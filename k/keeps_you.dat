Yet fear her, you who are Nature's darling: she may detain her treasure, but not keep it forever. Her last account, though delayed, must be paid and her discharge is to render you up.|$|E

500|$|Through {{the final}} storyline of the film, set in 2012, Kohli wanted to {{demonstrate}} a modern romance, which mostly happens through SMS, instant messaging apps, and Internet chat. Kohli described it by saying, [...] "Today people flirt, communicate and connect through smses and you get that feeling of being with somebody even when you are not with that person because that person is telling you everything that is happening in their life.

Then {{it goes back to}} 'Holiday' which is an old dance number. It <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> steppin'. Madonna sings everything live. She's been that way from the beginning of her career, even with all the athletic dancing. She's a hard worker and she expects everybody else to work as hard or harder. I respect that." ...|$|E

Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never get away with that, and nor would you want to." ...|$|E

[...] Alan Pergament, writing for The Buffalo News, included The Drew Carey Show in his Top 10 new shows, noting [...] "Carey is a lovable goof and his male buddy show has the chance of becoming the male version of Designing Women." [...] Pergament cited the lack of prominent female characters and [...] "a reliance on too many risque-language jokes" [...] as the weaknesses of the show. The Washington Post's Tom Shales found the episode funny, adding [...] "The Drew Carey Show bucks all the prevailing sitcom trends and does it endearingly." ...|$|E

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic gave it a very positive review, complimenting Shakira's versatility in her [...] "pan-global approach", and praising the album's simple and [...] "breezy" [...] nature, saying it [...] "never once sounds disparate or overworked -- it's sunny and easy, its natural buoyancy disguising Shakira's range and skill -- but listen closely and it becomes apparent that nobody makes better pop records in the new millennium than she does". The Billboard review of the album was also extremely positive, noting that its composition is [...] "infinitely more memorable and unique than the singer's baffling 2009 set, She Wolf", and that it [...] "manages to bridge the divide between the old and new Shakira with a spark that <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> listening to the very end".|$|E

[...] However Lambie noted [...] "when events push its premise from naff lads' drama into exotic thriller, Mad Dogs gets {{infinitely}} better, and if nothing else, it <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> guessing. As the series progressed, Lambie noted that Mad Dogs was [...] "developing into a nifty TV thriller with an engaging sense of the absurd. Writer, Cris Cole, enjoys picking holes in his characters' machismo as the tension mounts, and the strange billboard posters dotted all over the sun-scorched island, which say [...] "Yenda a ninguna parte," [...] ("Going nowhere") are perhaps a foreshadowing of their imminent fate." [...] Lambie was disappointed at the ending, calling it [...] "unexpectedly flat," [...] adding [...] "the major plot twist that the previous three-or-so hours appeared to allude to never arrives, [...] I couldn't help but feel that, as the closing credits rolled on the whole saga, the tension and intrigue that had gradually built up in previous weeks {{had been allowed to}} slip away.|$|E

500|$|Christman {{worked with}} the Office of Special Affairs (OSA) in her efforts to curtail or remove {{material}} critical of Scientology from the press, media, and the Internet. She spent a total of 20 years working for the OSA agency while {{a member of the}} Scientology organization. OSA agents serve as the [...] "internal security force and intelligence unit" [...] within Scientology. Christman assisted OSA agents in 1979, when a politician in Clearwater, Florida was attempting to hinder the Scientology organization's efforts to establish a presence in the city. She was ordered to participate in public meetings, and divert the focus of these events to questioning of the politician, Richard Tenning. He was defeated in a subsequent election, and the Scientology organization proceeded to increase its activities in Clearwater. In 1985, Christman helped OSA agents during a lawsuit from a former Scientology member. She attended the court proceedings and wrote reports about members of the jury, and assisted Scientology lawyers in compiling profiles of the jurors. At the time, Christman was an ardent believer in the Scientology organization and did not question the activities of the OSA agents. Reflecting back on her experiences assisting OSA agents, she commented, [...] "I was in a cult. Scientology promotes not watching the news. It <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> inside a Truman Show where you're totally unaware of things. It's like your own thinking gets shut down and you get used to not considering anything that might be critical of Scientology." ...|$|E

[...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called Veronica Mars an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness." [...] James South of Paste praised the [...] "crisp, clever writing", and noted the supporting characters were more than just plot devices. He commended Bell's portrayal of Veronica as [...] "simultaneously smart, vulnerable, tough and injured", and found the guest stars were well-utilized. South wrote the remaining cast was [...] "uniformly good", but gave Dohring a special mention for his acting. Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com praised the first-season finale for being [...] "just the sort of satisfying capper you look for in a series that, week after week, <b>keeps</b> <b>you</b> asking questions".|$|E
