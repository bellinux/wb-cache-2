5|$|The dusky woodswallow is {{medium-sized}} and swallow-like, with a {{dark brown}} hue, {{but there have been}} instances where the bird has appeared grey. The birds <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> patch in front of the eyes, and grey (sometimes also black) wings with white streaks on them. The dusky woodswallow has a black, white-tipped tail with a silver underwing. The birds have a blue-grey bill capped with black.|$|E
5|$|The grey hypocolius {{is a small}} Middle Eastern {{bird with}} the shape and soft plumage of a waxwing. They are mainly a uniform grey colour except the males <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{triangular}} mask around their eyes.|$|E
50|$|The sleepy orange <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> forewing cell {{spot on the}} upperside, the upperside of the hindwing <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> {{marginal}} border, and the hindwing is not pointed.|$|R

At the fifth tribal council, Jerry <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> vote that he could cast against the tribemate of his choice. At the twelfth tribal council, Caroline <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> vote that she could cast against the tribemate of her choice.

50|$|The {{southern}} muriqui, B. arachnoides, <b>has</b> <b>a</b> solid <b>black</b> face, distinguishing it {{from the}} northern species, B. hypoxanthus, which <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> face mottled with pink.|$|R
5|$|Dinoflagellates may use {{bioluminescence}} for defence against predators. They shine {{when they}} detect a predator, possibly making the predator itself more vulnerable by attracting {{the attention of}} predators from higher trophic levels. Grazing copepods release any phytoplankton cells that flash, unharmed; if they were eaten they would make the copepods glow, attracting predators, so the phytoplankton's bioluminescence is defensive. The problem of shining stomach contents is solved (and the explanation corroborated) in predatory deep-sea fishes: their stomachs <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> lining {{able to keep the}} light from any bioluminescent fish prey which they have swallowed from attracting larger predators.|$|E
5|$|Gestation is {{typically}} six months long, after which a single calf is born. Newborn are a light yellow; infant males may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> patch {{on the head}} and the neck. Young are precocial - they can stand on their own soon after birth. Females can mate again after a month of parturition. Juveniles remain active and playful throughout the day. Juvenile males turn black gradually, darkening notably after the third year. The lifespan {{is typically}} 10 to 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-winged fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism, males {{adopting}} a highly visible breeding plumage of brilliant iridescent blue and chestnut contrasting {{with black and}} grey-brown. The brightly coloured crown, ear tufts and upper back are prominently featured in breeding displays. The male in breeding plumage has a silvery blue crown, ear coverts and upper back, a black throat and nape, bright red-brown shoulders, a long grey-brown tail and wings, and greyish-white belly. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles are predominantly grey-brown in colour, though males may retain traces of blue and black plumage. All males <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> bill and lores (eye-ring and bare skin between eyes and bill), while females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> bill, rufous lores and pale grey eye-ring. Immature males will develop black lores by six weeks of age and generally moult into an incomplete breeding plumage the first breeding season after hatching. This has a patchy or spotty appearance, {{with a mixture of}} blue and grey feathers on the head, and black and grey on the breast; birds born early in the breeding season will gain more nuptial plumage initially than those born late. Most perfect their nuptial moult by their second spring, though some may need another year. Several males have been observed in breeding plumage in a single group at the same time, although it is unknown if or how this is related to dominance or breeding status.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of {{the family}} is {{generally}} very bright and in most species is mostly or at least partly green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are mostly rose-coloured. Most of the Merops bee-eaters <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge {{was given}} burgh status in 1885, and {{was granted a}} coat of arms by the Lord Lyon in 1892. The arms <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> field and on it a flaming tower to {{represent}} a blast furnace and Coatbridge's industrial tradition. The crest is a monk holding a stone in his left hand. The stone relates to the old parish of Monklands and {{the legend of the}} 'aul' Kirk stane'. The legend of the 'aul' Kirk stane' is that a pilgrim undertaking a penance from Glasgow carried a stone in the direction of Monklands. When he could carry the stone no further (or in another version of the legend, when an angel spoke to him) he laid the stone down. It was where the stone came to rest that he was to build a church. The church is the present day Old Monkland Kirk, at which the stone can still be seen.|$|E
25|$|In the {{majority}} of the population the ocular sinus is yellow, but some melanic males <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> area that reaches the lower margin of sinus. The queen has large black discal spots on terga 4 and 5, and smaller ones on terga 2 and 3.|$|E

500|$|The English-language {{place name}} [...] "Black Swan" [...] occurs as a {{descriptive}} toponym in four states, usually as a [...] "name cluster". Queensland <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Creek near Gladstone, together with nearby Black Swan Island and <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Rock further south near Shoalwater Bay; another Black Swan Creek near Maryborough; and <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Lagoon inland on the Darling Downs near Warwick. New South Wales <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Anabranch adjoining <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Lagoon {{on the north}} side of the Murray River in the Corowa Shire. In South Australia's arid north, there is <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Swamp just north of Roxby Downs and <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Waterhole further north of the old Overland Telegraph line. Tasmania <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Island near the wild South West Cape. Given the broad sweep of the black swan's natural habitat, the presence of only nine distinctive place names or name clusters within that range indicates the rarity of [...] "Black Swan" [...] as a toponym. New Zealand also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>Black</b> Swan Stream in the South Auckland district.|$|R

25|$|When {{wearing the}} full {{bottomed}} wig, Queen's Counsel <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> rosette {{hanging from the}} back of the neck, which was originally intended to catch oil and powder that might otherwise mark the silk gown. Modern wigs, however, are made of horsehair and so there is no longer any oil or powder.|$|E
25|$|Adults exhibit sexual dimorphism. Males are {{slightly}} larger than females and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> patch or spot of androconial scales on each hindwing (in some butterflies, these patches disperse pheromones, but are not known {{to do so in}} monarchs). The male's black wing veins are lighter and narrower than those of females.|$|E
25|$|Most coccinellids have {{round to}} elliptical, {{dome-shaped}} bodies with six short legs. Depending on the species, {{they can have}} spots, stripes, or no markings at all. Seven-spotted coccinellids are red or orange with three spots on each side {{and one in the}} middle; they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> head with white patches on each side.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a medium}} large grosbeak {{with a large}} bill. The male <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> head and bright yellow upper parts. The female is less brightly {{coloured}} and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> smaller <b>black</b> cap.|$|R
50|$|The Oxford bonnet <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> ribbon between {{crown and}} brim.|$|R
50|$|The male {{butterfly}} is {{pale blue}} to dark brown above, dark shining purple {{depending on the}} light. It <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> border with the upper forewing <b>having</b> <b>a</b> large <b>black</b> discal area of modified scales.|$|R
25|$|Characteristic {{of species}} that have a large range, the rufous fantail has many subspecies. However the taxonomic {{treatment}} of its subspecies and other relatives is still debated. The rufous fantail is easily distinguished by their orange-reddish-brown back, rump and base of tail. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> and white breast that grades into a white colour on the chin and throat.|$|E
25|$|The {{bees are}} {{medium-sized}} (with a head-to-body length of around 8‚Äì15mm) and slender. They <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> abdomen, with narrow white bands on each segment. Tawny hairs cover {{the top of}} the thorax, with somewhat paler hairs on the face. They are very similar to other species within the Colletes genus and, if more than one of these species shares the same habitat, microscopic examination can be necessary to distinguish between them. Females are slightly larger than the males, possessing slightly longer abdomens, which are also darker and glossier.|$|E
25|$|Of equids {{other than}} horses, all except the {{mountain}} zebra show a distinct dorsal stripe. Among domesticated donkeys, most <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> dorsal stripe, {{though it can}} be difficult to see on melanistic individuals. In the African wild ass, the dorsal stripe is thin but distinct and black. In Przewalski's horse, the dorsal stripe is usually dark brown, while it is black in the bred-back tarpan. In the plains zebra, the dorsal stripe is narrow and edged by white, while in Grevy's zebra, it is quite bold. The dorsal stripes of the onager and kiang are dark brown and especially vivid.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} pair of legs, the ground color is {{daffodil}} yellow. Femur <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> band distally, ending with a thin yellow band. Patella also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> thin <b>black</b> band distally. Tibia daffodil yellow.|$|R

25|$|Little {{variation}} occurs {{among individuals}} of P. dominula; the wing lengths of males range from 9.5 to 13.0mm, while those of females range from 8.5 to 12.0mm. Its body is colored entirely yellow and black, {{similar to that}} of Vespula germanica, {{one of the most common}} and aggressive wasps in its native range. The female mandible is black and sometimes has a yellow spot. Females <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> subantennal mark that rarely has a pair of small, yellow spots. The female vertex sometimes has a pair of small, yellow spots behind the hind ocelli. Females have yellow, comma-shaped scutal spots.|$|E
25|$|Due to Belyi's theorem, {{the action}} of Œì on dessins is {{faithful}} (that is, every two elements of Œì define different permutations {{on the set of}} dessins), so the study of dessins d'enfants can tell us much about Œì itself. In this light, it is of great interest to understand which dessins may be transformed into each other by {{the action of}} Œì and which may not. For instance, one may observe that the two trees shown have the same degree sequences for their black nodes and white nodes: both <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> node with degree three, two black nodes with degree two, two white nodes with degree two, and three white nodes with degree one. This equality is not a coincidence: whenever Œì transforms one dessin into another, both will have the same degree sequence. The degree sequence is one known invariant of the Galois action, but not the only invariant.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, {{the band}} {{received}} a substantial boost in funding, which allowed the band to supply more uniform parts {{free of charge}} that were previously purchased by band students. The band also purchased new cold weather overcoats that could be worn in the stands during a game. Previous cold weather coats included black wool, collared jackets from Holloway and Liz Claiborne. In 2013, the band has switched to double breasted wool overcoats which {{are similar to the}} U.S. Army's Class A overcoat. This coat features six Great Seal of Ohio buttons, and has large pockets to keep band members' hands warm while not playing their instrument. The band also changed the vinyl spats. Previously worn spats had white elastic straps, which were a custom ordered product. Due to shortages in marching band spats across the United States, the band opted to wear standard white vinyl spats which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>black</b> elastic strap.|$|E
