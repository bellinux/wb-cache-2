25|$|It is {{noteworthy}} that cooperative diversity can increase the <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> {{at the cost of}} losing the wireless resource such as frequency, time and power resources for the relaying phase. Wireless resources are wasted since the relay node uses wireless resources to relay the signal from the source to the destination node. Hence, it is important to remark that there is trade-off between the <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> and the waste of the spectrum resource in cooperative diversity.|$|E
25|$|Parallel relay {{transmission}} {{may be used}} where serial relay transmission {{suffers from}} multi-path fading. For outdoors and non-line-of-sight propagation, signal wavelength may be large and installation of multiple antennas are not possible. To increase the robustness against multi-path fading, parallel relay transmission can be used. In this topology, signals propagate through multiple relay paths in the same hop and the destination combines the signals received {{with the help of}} various combining schemes. It provides power gain and <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|In OFDM based {{wide area}} broadcasting, {{receivers}} {{can benefit from}} receiving signals from several spatially dispersed transmitters simultaneously, since transmitters will only destructively interfere with each other on {{a limited number of}} sub-carriers, whereas in general they will actually reinforce coverage over a wide area. This is very beneficial in many countries, as it permits the operation of national single-frequency networks (SFN), where many transmitters send the same signal simultaneously over the same channel frequency. SFNs utilise the available spectrum more effectively than conventional multi-frequency broadcast networks (MFN), where program content is replicated on different carrier frequencies. SFNs also result in a <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> in receivers situated midway between the transmitters. The coverage area is increased and the outage probability decreased in comparison to an MFN, due to increased received signal strength averaged over all sub-carriers.|$|E
30|$|In {{cooperative}} communications systems, idle nodes {{have the}} capability to relay information from other active nodes. Hence multiple copies of the same signal can reach a given destination through independent fading channels, which result in potential spatial <b>diversity</b> <b>gains.</b> However, <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> are usually achieved with some loss in system throughput[1, 2].|$|R

Doppler-RAKE receivers {{have been}} developed for collecting the resulting <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> only for spread-spectrum systems. Relying on a basis expansion model of time-selective channels, we find that the maximum achievable Doppler diversity is determined by the rank of the correlation matrix of the channel 's expansion coefficients. We also prove that RAKE reception can not collect maximum <b>diversity</b> <b>gains,</b> unless the transmission is appropriately designed.

25|$|The primary {{advantage}} of OFDM over single-carrier schemes {{is its ability}} to cope with severe channel conditions (for example, attenuation of high frequencies in a long copper wire, narrowband interference and frequency-selective fading due to multipath) without complex equalization filters. Channel equalization is simplified because OFDM may be viewed as using many slowly modulated narrowband signals rather than one rapidly modulated wideband signal. The low symbol rate makes the use of a guard interval between symbols affordable, making it possible to eliminate intersymbol interference (ISI) and utilize echoes and time-spreading (on analogue TV these are visible as ghosting and blurring, respectively) to achieve a <b>diversity</b> <b>gain,</b> i.e. a signal-to-noise ratio improvement. This mechanism also facilitates the design of single frequency networks (SFNs), where several adjacent transmitters send the same signal simultaneously at the same frequency, as the signals from multiple distant transmitters may be combined constructively, rather than interfering as would typically occur in a traditional single-carrier system.|$|E
50|$|The {{two main}} types of array gain when {{combining}} signals are average power of combined signals {{relative to the}} individual average power and the <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> related to the probability level of outage. The <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> is dependent on spatial correlation coefficients between antenna signals.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diversity</b> <b>gain</b> is the {{increase}} in signal-to-interference ratio due to some diversity scheme, or how much the transmission power can be reduced when a diversity scheme is introduced, without a performance loss. <b>Diversity</b> <b>gain</b> is usually expressed in decibels, and sometimes as a power ratio. An example is soft handoff gain. For selection combining N signals are received, and the strongest signal is selected. When the N signals are independent and Rayleigh distributed, the expected <b>diversity</b> <b>gain</b> {{has been shown to}} be , expressed as a power ratio.|$|E

30|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a multiple-input-multiple-output, {{orthogonal}} frequency division multiplexing, code-division multiple-access (MIMO OFDM-CDMA) scheme. The main {{objective is to}} provide extra flexibility in user multiplexing and data rate adaptation, that offer higher system throughput and better <b>diversity</b> <b>gains.</b> This is done by spreading on all the signal domains; i.e, space-time frequency spreading is employed to transmit users' signals. The flexibility to spread on all three domains allows us to independently spread users' data, to maintain increased system throughput and to have higher <b>diversity</b> <b>gains.</b> We derive new accurate approximations for the probability of symbol error and signal-to-interference noise ratio (SINR) for zero forcing (ZF) receiver. This study and simulation results show that MIMO OFDM-CDMA is capable of achieving <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> significantly larger {{than that of the}} conventional 2 -D CDMA OFDM and MIMO MC CDMA schemes.|$|R

40|$|Relying on space-time linearly precoded {{orthogonal}} frequency-division {{multiple access}} (OFDMA) and exploiting both transmit and receive antenna diversity, we design herein multirate transceivers that guarantee deterministic symbol recovery with <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> {{regardless of the}} (possibly unknown) frequency-selective finite impulse response (FIR) channels and multiuser interference. Our approach {{is based on a}} three-level design of user codes: the top level (based on OFDMA) handles multiuser interference, the middle level (based on space-time block coding) results in space-time <b>diversity</b> <b>gains,</b> and the lower level (based on linear precoding) mitigates intersymbol interference (ISI). In a multiuser/multirate setting, with two transmit and a single receive antenna, our designs achieve guaranteed <b>diversity</b> <b>gains,</b> whereas the use of two receive antennas could potentially double the capacity of the system (in terms of maximum number of users or achievable transmission rates) under favorable conditions (such as no frequency offset).

40|$|Abstract — Communication {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} {{as a fundamental}} bottleneck in sensor networks {{with large numbers of}} lowcost, low-power nodes. We consider cooperative transmission of a common message signal from a cluster of sensor nodes to a remote receiver, under realistic transmission models accounting for timing and frequency synchronization offsets across the nodes. The purpose is to obtain range extension by combining the powers of the nodes in a cluster, and to obtain robustness against channel impairments by exploiting the diversity naturally arising from the spatial distribution of the sensor nodes. For a simple scheme in which all nodes asynchronously transmit the same signal, we analyze the available <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> using an informationtheoretic analysis of outage capacity for wideband systems. We show that standard modulation formats can be adapted to realize <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> in the presence of synchronization errors. We propose simple receiver architectures that realize <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> and have desirable scaling properties as the number of sensors increases. I...|$|R

Through a judicious design of a novel backoff mechanism to utilize the channel information and reduce collisions, significant multiuser <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> are achieved. To a user, the higher the channel gain is, the smaller the backoff time-slot and, hence, the higher the access priority of that user is. In addition, for heterogeneous systems, our proposed scheme can realize multiuser <b>diversity</b> <b>gains</b> and achieve fairness among the users at the same time. Finally, we design two distributed opportunistic access schemes for OFDMA systems. Users contend on all sub-channels in the first scheme and only on several strongest sub-channels in the second scheme.
