5|$|The {{residents}} of Milwaukee Avenue {{and the surrounding}} Seward neighborhood formed the Seward West Project Area Committee (PAC) <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to save the Milwaukee Avenue homes. They argued that the houses had significant historic value {{and needed to be}} preserved. The City argued that the houses were legally nonconforming, and rehabilitating them would cost more than just building new houses.|$|E

5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to repair it, I observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E

5|$|The Portuguese general, {{convinced}} of the impossibility of taking Badajoz by assault, changed his strategy and began a circumvallation of the town, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to isolate it completely. The Spanish, meanwhile, were reinforcing their own defensive fortifications with extensive works, mainly ravelins built between the medieval towers. Various outlying forts were also strengthened {{with the aim of}} obstructing the Portuguese works and forcing them to build a larger circumvallation line. One of these forts was San Miguel, a star fort able to accommodate 600 infantry, built around a hermitage. It had five earthen bulwarks and an artillery-proof parapet.|$|E

In 1977, Panama and the United States signed the Torrijos-Carter Treaties giving Panama eventual control of the canal in December 1999. During the 1980s, foreign ministers of Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela created the Contadora Group <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> diplomatically <b>try</b> <b>to</b> resolve the crisis facing many Central American nations at the time.|$|R

5|$|With the Winter Olympics {{being held}} in Canada, the writers wanted an Olympic-themed episode that could air during the Games. The script was written by Rob LaZebnik, who {{considered}} having the plot revolve around Homer competing in four-man bobsled. However, he decided a curling episode would allow for the plot to revolve around Homer and Marge. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to make the depiction of curling in the episode accurate, the writers visited a curling club and tried the sport themselves. They also consulted {{with a number of}} curlers. The episode was directed by Chuck Sheetz, while sportscaster Bob Costas guest-starred in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Because vaquitas are {{indigenous}} to the Gulf of California, Mexico is leading conservation efforts {{with the creation}} of the International Committee for the Recovery of the Vaquita (CIRVA), which has tried to prevent the accidental deaths of vaquitas by outlawing the use of fishing nets within the vaquita's habitat. CIRVA has worked together with the CITES, the Endangered Species Act, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) to nurse the vaquita population back to a point at which they can sustain themselves. CIRVA concluded in 2000 that between 39 and 84 individuals are killed each year by such gillnets. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to prevent extinction, the Mexican government has created a nature reserve covering {{the upper part of the}} Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. They have also placed a temporary ban on fishing, with compensation to those affected, that may pose a threat to the vaquita.|$|E
5|$|The TNA Women's Knockout Championship was defended in a Three Way match by Awesome Kong against Gail Kim and ODB, {{also on the}} card.

Kim then fought Kong again at Final Resolution in a No Disqualification match, in which Kim retained the title. On the January 10, 2008, episode of Impact!, Kong defeated Kim to win the title in a match which gave Kim an injury in the storyline.

5|$|The club {{began their}} league {{campaign}} with two draws, but defeat by Cardiff City {{marked the beginning}} of a seven-game losing streak. Results improved in October and November before three more successive defeats saw Sturrock replaced by Mariner. Performances gradually improved and the club won both of their fixtures during the Christmas period, including a 4–1 win against Reading; their best of the season. The club signed Damien Johnson in the winter transfer window from Birmingham City and made a number of signings on loan, including Kenny Cooper and David Stockdale, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to improve their league position. A succession of draws and narrow defeats followed in February, which prompted Mariner to make more signings.|$|E
5|$|From 343 BC onwards, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> {{and disrupt}} the peace, Demosthenes and his {{followers}} used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace. Finally, in 341 BC, matters began {{to come to a}} head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of Diopeithes, who proceeded to ravage the territory of Cardia, an ally of Philip. Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech 'On the Chersonese', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, {{there was no need to}} do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace. Then, in the Third Philippic of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea. Finally, in the Fourth Philippic delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June, {{after an}} {{ineffective}} bombardment by a 6-gun battery {{put in place}} to try to breach the parapets, the Portuguese tercios and the cavalry, the latter covered by ranks of musketeers, were ordered to attack. The advance was made difficult by the presence of vineyard fences in the field. Moreover, 5 Portuguese battalions {{at the head of the}} attack were surprised by the Spanish cavalry of the Duke of Osuna and his general, don Juan de Pacheco, followed by the Duke of San German who, with various Spanish tercios, had sallied out of Badajoz <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to counter the Portuguese assault. Maestre de Campo of Tercio de la Armada, whose brother the Irish officer William Dongan was the commander of the Fort of San Miguel, managed to reach the fort. Albuquerque, meanwhile ordered dom Luiz de Menezes to reinforce his vanguard battalions. The Portuguese cavalry was also sent into action. Teniente General Diniz de Mello de Castro was wounded and captured, but a Spanish counter-attack was repelled and the Fort of San Miguel finally surrendered.|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} extrapolates {{the theory}} of self-organization in biological organisms to sociopolitical self-organization, in human social systems.

5|$|The Latvian {{government}} took {{a number of}} steps <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to bring the situation under control, and in 2006 {{not only were the}} events planned by right wing organizations not approved, but the monument was fenced off, according to an announcement by Riga city council, for restoration. The monument was indeed restored in 2006, but this statement was later questioned, as politicians named various other reasons for the change of date, the enclosed area was much larger than needed for restoration, and the weather appeared inappropriate for restoration work. Therefore, the government was criticized by the Latvian press for being unable to ensure public safety and freedom of speech. The unapproved events took place despite the ban. On November 23, 2006, the law requiring the approval of the authorities for public gatherings was ruled unconstitutional. In the future years the government mobilized the police force to guard the neighborhood of the monument and the events were relatively peaceful.|$|E

As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly.

Her love for sports was not confined to baseball though. Jackie also did well at basketball and speed skating, amongst other recreational activities.|$|R
2500|$|As an {{aircraft}} changes speed or altitude, {{the pressure of}} the air at the inlet to the compressor will vary. <b>In</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> [...] "tune" [...] the compressor for these changing conditions, designs starting in the 1950s would [...] "bleed" [...] air out of the middle of the compressor <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> compress too much air in the final stages. This was also used to help start the engine, allowing it to be spun up without compressing much air by bleeding off as much as possible.

5|$|The Odyssey was {{released}} by Magnavox in September 1972. After initially ordering a production run of 50,000 units, prior to release Magnavox increased its production capabilities and built up a large stock of the systems, as market testing had shown an enthusiastic response to the console. The Odyssey was sold only through Magnavox dealers and not through general retailers; Magnavox felt that as the first video game console it would draw consumers into its stores. The device retailed for US$99.99, or US$50 when purchased along with a Magnavox television. There are conflicting reports between Baer and Magnavox employees as to whether Magnavox produced 120,000 or 140,000 consoles in 1972; additionally, Odyssey product manager Bob Fritsche recalls selling 69,000 units that year, while Baer recalls sales being closer to 100,000. Baer has stated that he felt the low initial sales were due to the high price—US$100 being the equivalent of US$587 in 2017—and because of Magnavox restricting sales to their dealerships and implying that the device only worked with Magnavox televisions. Other sources have stated that dealership salespeople would try to mislead customers to that effect <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> to sell more television sets. Magnavox assistant product planner Don Emry has noted that the sales were {{in line with the}} original projections, if not with the production run.|$|E
