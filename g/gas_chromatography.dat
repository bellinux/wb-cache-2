40|$|International audienceThe present {{abstract}} {{deals with}} the comparison of two biomass-to-oil processes: fast pyrolysis and subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction. Using the same biomass (beech sawdust), fast pyrolysis was led thanks to the cyclone reactor (wall temperature between 870 and 1040 K) and subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction thanks to a 150 -ml-batch-reactor (temperature between 420 and 600 K). Mass balances and analysis (ultimate analysis, HHV, pH, Karl-Fischer, <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographies,</b> H 1 NMR) allow the comparison of both processes and the characterization of the main fractions of pyro-oils (heavy oils, light oils and aerosols) and liq-oils (heavy oils and water soluble organics) ...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Low {{molecular}} weight N-nitrosamines were detected by ultraviolet, infrared, nuclear magnetic resonance, mass spectral, thin-layer chromatographic and gas liquid chromatographic means. A method for {{the estimation of}} dimethylnitrosamine, diethylnitrosamine, ethal-n-propylnitrosamine and di-n-propylnitrosamine has been developed. The method involves {{the isolation of the}} nitrosamines in an aqueous distillate by freeze-drying. After extraction of the nitrosamines from the aqueous distillate by means of dichloromethane, their separation and quantitative estimation are achieved by <b>gas</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> of the extract. The procedure can be extended down to the ppb range. Dimethylnitrosamine was isolated from an extract of Solanum incanum and identified by <b>gas</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> on four different columns, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy...|$|R

Geburtstag gewidmet Summary: Urine samples (n = 300) were {{examined}} for drugs by thin-layer chromatography ("Drug Skreen", Brink-mann Corp.) {{and by the}} "Enzyme Multiplied Immunoassay Technique " ("Emit", Syva Corp.). The results of both methods were compared {{for the detection of}} opiates, barbiturates and amphetamines. In more than 90 % of the determinations identical results were obtained with both methods. About 10 % {{of the results of the}} Emit barbiturate assay differed from those of thin-layer chromatography and therefore had to be further investigated by <b>gas</b> liquid <b>chromatography.</b> It could be demonstrated that the barbiturate determination by the Emit system correlated better with the results of <b>gas</b> liquid <b>chromatography.</b> From the results of this study it is suggested that thin-layer chromato-graphy is used as a screening test, and to confirm positive results with other methods such as Emit. If the abuse of barbiturates or opiates is suspected the corresponding Emit test should also be performed, even in cases of a negative thin-layer Chromatograph*,-screening. Confirmation with a third method such as <b>gas</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> is necessary, if thin-layer chromatography and Emit lead to divergent results.

5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography</b> and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed by drug tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol may be {{quantified}} in blood, plasma, or urine as a diagnostic tool in clinical poisoning situations or {{to aid in}} the medicolegal investigation of suspicious deaths. The concentration in serum after a typical dose of paracetamol usually peaks below 30mg/l, which equals 200 µmol/L. Levels of 30–300mg/L (200–2000 µmol/L) are often observed in overdose patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 50–400mg/L in persons dying due to acute overdosage. Automated colorimetric techniques, <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography</b> and liquid chromatography are currently in use for the laboratory analysis of the drug in physiological specimens.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} simple chemical tests — commercially available as reagent testing kits — {{can be used}} to assess the presence of psilocybin in extracts prepared from mushrooms. The drug reacts in the Marquis test to produce a yellow color, and a green color in the Mandelin test. Neither of these tests, however, is specific for psilocybin; for example, the Marquis test will react with many classes of controlled drugs, such as those containing primary amino groups and unsubstituted benzene rings, including amphetamine and methamphetamine. Ehrlich's reagent and DMACA reagent are used as chemical sprays to detect the drug after thin layer chromatography. Many modern techniques of analytical chemistry have been used to quantify psilocybin levels in mushroom samples. Although the earliest methods commonly used <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography,</b> the high temperature required to vaporize the psilocybin sample prior to analysis causes it to spontaneously lose its phosphoryl group and become psilocin — making it difficult to chemically discriminate between the two drugs. In forensic toxicology, techniques involving <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography</b> coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS) are the most widely used due to their high sensitivity and ability to separate compounds in complex biological mixtures. These techniques include ion mobility spectrometry, capillary zone electrophoresis, ultraviolet spectroscopy, and infrared spectroscopy. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used with ultraviolet, fluorescence, electrochemical, and electrospray mass spectrometric detection methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of benzodiazepine overdose may be difficult, but is usually made {{based on the}} clinical presentation of the patient along {{with a history of}} overdose. Obtaining a laboratory test for benzodiazepine blood concentrations can be useful in patients presenting with CNS depression or coma of unknown origin. Techniques available to measure blood concentrations include thin layer <b>chromatography,</b> <b>gas</b> liquid <b>chromatography</b> with or without a mass spectrometer, and radioimmunoassay. Blood benzodiazepine concentrations, however, {{do not appear to be}} related to any toxicological effect or predictive of clinical outcome. Blood concentrations are, therefore, used mainly to confirm the diagnosis rather than being useful for the clinical management of the patient.|$|R
40|$|Essential oils {{have been}} {{extensively}} studied {{in recent years}} as a natural source of new antimicrobial agents. In this work, essential oils of leaf and branch from Drimys angustifolia growing in Southern Brazil were obtained by hydrodistillation and analyzed by <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographies</b> with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and with mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Drimenol and bicyclogermacrene were isolated by column chromatography from branch and leaf essential oils, respectively. Oils, isolated compounds and combinations of them were assayed against Gram-(+) and Gram-(-) bacteria. The oils showed to be more active against Bacillus cereus, with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) 125 and 250 µg mL- 1 for branch and leaf oils, respectively, strongly inhibiting bacterial growth. Bicyclogermacrene was more active then drimenol, providing a MIC value of 167 µg mL- 1 against B. cereus. Synergism was not observed in any of the combinations tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{fatty acid}} and {{positional}} specificities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (UI-SACCH) and Schizosaccharomyces octosporus (NRRL Y- 854) in the hydrolysis of lard were studied by using gas-liquid chromatography. Synthetic triglycerides {{were used to}} determine the positional specificities of the lipases of both organisms. Palmitic acid is specifically cleaved from all three triglyceride ester positions by S. cerevisiae, while S. octosporus was able to cleave stearic acid at either position 1 or position 3 of the glycerol moiety. Preparative scale fermentation with 200 g of lard per liter yielded 48. 4 g of palmitic acid per liter with S. cerevisiae and 42 g of stearic acid per liter with S. octosporus. The free fatty acids produced by microbial transformation of lard were characterized spectrally (1 H and C nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry) and chromatographically (thin-layer and <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographies)</b> ...|$|R
5|$|In many applications, {{the noble}} gases {{are used to}} provide an inert atmosphere. Argon {{is used in the}} {{synthesis}} of air-sensitive compounds that are sensitive to nitrogen. Solid argon is also used for the study of very unstable compounds, such as reactive intermediates, by trapping them in an inert matrix at very low temperatures. Helium is used as the carrier medium in <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography,</b> as a filler gas for thermometers, and in devices for measuring radiation, such as the Geiger counter and the bubble chamber. Helium and argon are both commonly used to shield welding arcs and the surrounding base metal from the atmosphere during welding and cutting, as well as in other metallurgical processes and in the production of silicon for the semiconductor industry.|$|E
5|$|The Bengal slow loris {{has a small}} {{swelling}} on the {{ventral side}} of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The oil has been analyzed using <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography</b> coupled to mass spectrometry, {{and it has been}} shown that almost half of the several dozen volatile or semi-volatile chemicals present do not occur in the closely related pygmy slow loris. The most predominant component was the phenolic compound m-cresol. The authors of the study suggest that the chemically complex oils may help the lorises communicate with each other, allowing them to transmit by scent information about sex, age, health and nutritional status, and dominance.|$|E
5|$|As {{many of the}} {{clinical}} {{signs and symptoms of}} ethylene glycol poisoning are nonspecific and occur in many poisonings the diagnosis is often difficult. It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by <b>gas</b> <b>chromatography.</b> Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by freezing point depression and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
