40|$|Faulty {{epigenetic}} reprogramming of somatic nuclei {{is likely}} to be a major cause of low success observed in all mammals produced through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). It has been demonstrated that the developmental competence of SCNT embryos in several species were significantly enhanced via treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) such as trichostatin A (TSA) to increase histone acetylation. Here we report that 50 [*]nM TSA for 10 [*]h after activation increased the developmental competence of porcine SCNT embryos constructed from Landrace fetal fibroblast cells (FFCs) in vitro and in vivo, but not at higher concentrations. Therefore, we optimized the application of another novel HDACi, Scriptaid, for development of porcine SCNT embryos. We found that treatment with 500 [*]nM Scriptaid significantly enhanced the development SCNT embryos to the blastocyst stage when outbred Landrace FFCs and ear fibroblast cells (<b>EFCs)</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> as donors compared to the untreated group. Scriptaid increased the overall cloning efficiency from 0. 4 % (untreated group) to 1. 6 % for Landrace FFCs and 0 to 3. 7 % for Landrace EFCs.

40|$|We {{fabricated}} {{an enzyme}} fuel cell (EFC) device based on glucose as fuel and glucose oxidase (GOx) as biocatalyst. As {{a strategy to}} improve GOx stability, preserving {{at the same time}} the enzyme catalytic activity, we propose an immobilization procedure to entrap GOx in a polymer matrix based on Nafion and multiwalled carbon nanotubes. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded to study changes in the 3 D structure of GOx that might be generated by the immobilization procedure. The comparison between the CD features of GOx immobilized and free in solution indicates that the shape of the spectra and position of peaks do not significantly change. The bioelectrocatalytic activity toward glucose oxidation of immobilized GOx was studied by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry experiments. Such electrochemical experiments allow monitoring the rate of GOx-catalyzed glucose oxidation and extrapolating GOx kinetic parameters. Results demonstrate that immobilized GOx has high catalytic efficiency, due the maintaining of regular and well-ordered structure of the immobilized enzyme, as indicated by spectroscopic findings. Once investigated the electrode structure–property relationship, an <b>EFC</b> device <b>was</b> assembled <b>using</b> the GOx-based bioanode, and sulfonated poly ether ether ketone as electrolyte membrane.

40|$|Self-powered {{wearable}} biodevices {{are highly}} attractive {{for a number}} of applications, including non-invasive detection of biomarkers and fitness monitoring. Enzymatic fuel cells (EFCs) hold great potential for the development of such devices. This particular type of fuel cells uses redox enzymes as catalysts to convert organic substrates, such as carbohydrates, into useful electricity at body temperature. In the past few years, electricity generation from human physiological fluids via <b>EFCs</b> has <b>been</b> reported, which proved the possibility to harvest energy from tears, serum and saliva. Through a careful choice of the enzymes used, EFCs can work as effective amperometric biosensors for target biomarkes. We have developed innovative miniature flow-through glucose/oxygen enzymatic fuel cells for continuous power generation. The EFCs use highly-porous gold (hPG) as electrodes. hPG is characterised by a very high specific surface area, with a pore size distribution ranging from the micro to the nano scale. This property, in combination with high conductivity and biocompatibility, makes hPG electrodes the ideal support for enzyme immobilisation and allows a very good electrical communication between the electrode and the enzyme, with no need for external electron mediators. To scale-up the power density, we developed a cascade of EFCs embedded in a compact and handy single channel device. To prove its use with a physiological fluid, the device was tested {{for the first time with}} transdermal extracts obtained by iontophoresis. The miniature EFCs generate power outputs in the orders of 1 - 5 μW cm- 2. Glucose detection in the sweat range (5. 6 and 2, 200 µM) was demonstrated, thus paving the way for self-powered painless glucose monitoring applications.

40|$|The {{arrival of}} sound signals in the {{auditory}} cortex (AC) triggers {{both local and}} inter-regional signal propagations over time up to hundreds of milliseconds and builds up both intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) and extrinsic functional connectivity (eFC) of the AC. However, interactions between iFC and <b>eFC</b> <b>are</b> largely unknown. <b>Using</b> intracranial stereo-electroencephalographic recordings in people with drug-refractory epilepsy, this study mainly investigated the temporal dynamic {{of the relationships between}} iFC and eFC of the AC. The results showed that a Gaussian wideband-noise burst markedly elicited potentials in both the AC and numerous higher-order cortical regions outside the AC (non-auditory cortices). Granger causality analyses revealed that in the earlier time window, iFC of the AC was positively correlated with both eFC from the AC to the inferior temporal gyrus and that to the inferior parietal lobule. While in later periods, the iFC of the AC was positively correlated with eFC from the precentral gyrus to the AC and that from the insula to the AC. In conclusion, dual-directional interactions occur between iFC and eFC of the AC at different time windows following the sound stimulation and may form the foundation underlying various central auditory processes, including auditory sensory memory, object formation, integrations between sensory, perceptional, attentional, motor, emotional, and executive processes...|$|R
