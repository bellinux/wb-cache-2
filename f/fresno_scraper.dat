25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1904, the family {{moved back to the}} United States, after William and Kate fell ill. The family spent the summer of that year in New Hampshire on a farm with Kate’s sister before they {{relocated}} to Des Moines, Iowa. In 1908, the family moved to Farson, Wyoming where they settled for the next five years, living in a small three-room house. During the five years in Farson, Rambo and the family planted crops and raised chickens for food, often struggling to produce enough for all members of the household. When Rambo was sixteen, he began working as a water boy to earn money for the family. He soon got a more permanent job driving a <b>Fresno</b> <b>scraper,</b> a metal basket that dumped dirt into an irrigation ditch, but was subsequently fired after he joined a group of workers protesting the wage. He then worked as an orderly in the local hospital and caught the attention of the resident doctor, who began to teach him common procedures such as catheterization. After the doctor left the hospital, Rambo performed many of the former doctor's duties, assisting in the operating room and helping out with emergencies at midnight. He learned to recognize and use different surgical knives and other tools and started handling the catheterization of paraplegics. He attended a nursing class and was two months short of graduating with a registered nurse's certificate when the family suddenly moved to Idaho after William was asked to preach in Emmett. In March 1914, the family moved again to Chehalis, Washington, where Rambo remained until September 1915, graduating from high school at the age of twenty-one.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper</b> is {{a machine}} pulled by horses used for {{constructing}} canals and ditches in sandy soil. The {{design of the}} <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper</b> forms the basis of most modern earthmoving scrapers, having the ability to scrape and move a quantity of soil, and also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Fresno</b> <b>scraper</b> {{was invented}} in 1883 by James Porteous. Working with farmers in Fresno, California, he had {{recognised}} the dependence of the Central San Joaquin Valley on irrigation, {{and the need for}} a more efficient means of constructing canals and ditches in the sandy soil. In perfecting the design of his machine, Porteous made several revisions on his own and also traded ideas with William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, who invented and held patents on similar scrapers. Porteous bought the patents held by Deidrick, Dusy, and McCall, gaining sole rights to the <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper.</b>|$|E

50|$|Roads were {{provided}} and maintained through a committee formed in 1907 by Local Improvement District 15.B.3 around Hanley. The early challenges were the hilly area and creek to the east. Early prairie roads were trails which became so rutted {{that they could}} barely be crossed over. To make roads out of these trails horse drawn blade graders were used to level out hummocks and fill badger holes. Horse drawn slush scrapers filled in sloughs. More advanced <b>fresno</b> <b>scrapers</b> replaced the slush scrapers as they could make longer and wider swaths across the sloughs. By ploughing the prairie soil at the road allowance, and then using road graders to pull in the dirt roads could be made wide enough for the first cars of the area. The rural municipality of Rosedale No. 283 was incorporated December 13, 1909.|$|R
5000|$|Forkner {{consulted}} {{with a number}} of California experts about the possibility of fig farming, including University of California, Berkeley, professor Edward J. Wickson and local fig grower Henry Markarian. He later hired another UC professor, Ira J. Condit, as project horticulturist. Forkner expanded his holdings to 12000 acre and began preparing the land for his [...] "Fig Gardens." [...] The ambitious scale of the project {{can be seen in the}} fact that the development encompassed a streetcar line, over 120 mi of streets, and an irrigation system with a 25 mi-long main canal and some 135 mi of side ditches. To move ahead rapidly, Forkner assembled a mix of horse-drawn [...] <b>Fresno</b> <b>scrapers</b> and over 100 Ford tractors, at one point owning more Ford tractors than anyone else in the world. Planting the figs required blasting holes with dynamite through a top layer of hardpan to reach the underlying soil. Forkner eventually planted some 600,000 fig trees, of which 9 in 10 were edible figs and the remainder ornamental figs. The figs came out of an adjacent nursery stocked in part with cuttings obtained from Markarian, and landowners were permitted to choose among different varieties. The majority of trees planted were Calimyrna figs, with significant acreage also devoted to Kadotas. By 1920, some 500 families were living in the development on individual fig farms averaging 16 acre apiece. Despite this early success, the Fig Gardens project collapsed when J.C. Forkner went bankrupt during the Great Depression.|$|R

50|$|Heavy {{construction}} equipment is usually used {{due to the}} amounts of material to be moved — up to millions of cubic metres. Earthwork construction was revolutionized {{by the development of}} the (<b>Fresno)</b> <b>scraper</b> and other earth-moving machines such as the loader, the dump truck, the grader, the bulldozer, the backhoe, and the dragline excavator.|$|E
50|$|Abijah McCall was a {{co-inventor}} of the <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper,</b> a horse-drawn (and later, tractor-drawn) earth-moving machine {{upon which}} modern road- and canal-building equipment is based. Along {{with his partner}} Frank Dusy, McCall devised an improvement on the Buck Scraper, invented by James Porteous. On June 15, 1885, McCall and Dusy received U.S. Patent 320,055 for their version of the scraper. Porteous purchased the patents held by Dusy and McCall and also a patent held by William Deidrick as he perfected the scraper, which Porteous also manufactured at his factory in Fresno, California. The scraper was widely used in the Western United States and also put into use by U.S. engineers building the Panama Canal. Deidrick, Dusy, and McCall were all early residents of Selma, California, where McCall Avenue is named for McCall. McCall reputedly used a <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper</b> in building the road which runs through Selma and north to Clovis, California.|$|E
50|$|MK's origins date to 1905, when Harry Morrison (1885 - 1971) met Morris Knudsen (1862 - 1943) {{while working}} on the {{construction}} of the New York Canal (Boise Project) in south-western Idaho. Morrison was a 20-year-old concrete superintendent for the Reclamation Service; Knudsen was a forty-something Nebraska farmer (and Danish immigrant) with a team of horses and a <b>fresno</b> <b>scraper.</b>|$|E
50|$|Prior {{scrapers}} {{pushed the}} soil ahead of them, while the <b>Fresno</b> <b>scraper</b> lifted {{it into a}} C-shaped bowl where it could be dragged along with much less friction. By lifting the handle, the operator could cause the scraper to bite deeper. Once soil was gathered, the handle could be lowered to raise the blade off the ground {{so it could be}} dragged to a low spot, and dumped by raising the handle very high.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes a {{bulldozer}} {{is used to}} push another piece of earth moving equipment known as a [...] "scraper". The towed <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper,</b> invented in 1883 by James Porteous, was the first design to enable this to be done economically, removing the soil from the cut and depositing it elsewhere on shallow ground (fill). Many dozer blades have a reinforced center section with this purpose in mind, and are called [...] "bull blades".|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, {{there were no}} bulldozers, earth moving equipment, etc. Work was done by hand using a star drill and a sledge hammer to pound holes into the very hard {{volcanic}} rock; dynamite was inserted into the holes, fuses lit, everyone ran for cover, and it blew. For construction, they used picks, shovels, crowbars, farm equipment, and $60 worth of dynamite given by the of Ventura County. The resulting rocks and debris were moved by hand and a horse-drawn <b>fresno</b> <b>scraper</b> to build the narrow, one-lane roadway.|$|E
5000|$|William Deidrick, of Selma, California was a {{co-inventor}} of the <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper,</b> {{the machine}} that became the basis of most modern earth-moving equipment. On April 17, 1883, Deidrick received U.S. Patent 275,893 for his horse-drawn scraper, which was {{a variation on the}} Buck Scraper, invented by James Porteous of Fresno, California. Porteous, originally a manufacturer of wagons, purchased Deidrick's patent, and also one held jointly by Frank Dusy and Abijah McCall as he perfected the machine, an important tool in the building of the Panama Canal, among many other uses.|$|E
50|$|Frank Dusy (December 17, 1837 - November 9, 1898) was {{an early}} {{business}} leader of Selma, California and a co-inventor of the <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper,</b> the basis of most modern earth-moving machinery. On June, 16, 1885, Dusy and his partner Abijah McCall were issued U.S. Patent 320,055, for their improvement on the Buck Scraper, invented by James Porteous of Fresno, California. Porteous, originally a wagon builder, purchased their patent and one held by William Deidrick as he perfected his machine. Dusy was also among the original investors in the Fresno Republican newspaper, which was eventually acquired by and combined with the Fresno Bee.|$|E
5000|$|Porteous invented an {{improvement}} on the simple buckboard, a horse-drawn earth scraper, and refined his Buck Scraper, as he first called it, through several design improvements. His ideas, combined {{with those of}} fellow-inventors William Deidrick, Frank Dusy, and Abijah McCall, all of Selma, California led to the <b>Fresno</b> <b>Scraper</b> (1883). Porteous purchased patents held by Deidrick and jointly by partners Dusy and McCall as he perfected his machine. The basic design forms the basis of most modern earth moving scrapers, having the ability to not only scrape and move a quantity of soil, but also to discharge it at a controlled depth, thus quadrupling the volume which could be handled manually.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909 {{he took an}} {{automobile}} correspondence course granting himself a [...] "Bachelor of Motorcycles" [...] as he learned about vehicle mechanics and graduated by taking apart and putting back together his newly acquired motorcycle in a day. After working on a project to build a bridge across the Stanislaus River, and seeing first hand the <b>Fresno</b> <b>scraper,</b> he was anxious to put to use his mechanical skills. In 1911, LeTourneau started the Superior Garage, in Stockton, as half-owner putting up $1,000 and building {{what may have been}} the first building designed exclusively for the sales and servicing of cars in that section of California. In 1917, he married Evelyn Peterson, the daughter of a draying company owner from Minnesota.|$|E
