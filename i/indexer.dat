25|$|Unlike Windows Desktop Search on Windows XP, the Windows Search <b>indexer</b> {{performs}} the I/O operations with low priority, the process also runs with low CPU priority. As a result, whenever other processes require the I/O bandwidth or processor time, it {{is able to}} pre-empt the <b>indexer,</b> thereby significantly reducing the performance hit associated with the <b>indexer</b> running in the background.|$|E
25|$|The Full Text Search {{engine is}} divided into two {{processes}}: the Filter Daemon process (msftefd.exe) and the Search process (msftesql.exe). These processes interact with the SQL Server. The Search process includes the <b>indexer</b> (that creates the full text indexes) and the full text query processor. The <b>indexer</b> scans through text columns in the database. It can also index through binary columns, and use iFilters to extract meaningful text from the binary blob (for example, when a Microsoft Word document is stored as an unstructured binary file in a database). The iFilters are hosted by the Filter Daemon process. Once the text is extracted, the Filter Daemon process breaks it up into a sequence of words and hands it over to the <b>indexer.</b> The <b>indexer</b> filters out noise words, i.e., words like A, And etc., which occur frequently and are not useful for search. With the remaining words, an inverted index is created, associating each word with the columns they were found in. SQL Server itself includes a Gatherer component that monitors changes to tables and invokes the <b>indexer</b> in case of updates.|$|E

40|$|Indexing is {{a crucial}} part of any {{information}} retrieval system. It is a challenging task requiring paying attention to many theoretical and practical issues. While the move towards digital information systems and automated indexing is thought to have reduced the need for <b>indexers</b> in some areas, professional <b>indexers</b> are still much needed {{and as a matter of}} fact electronic environment has posed new challenges for the <b>indexers.</b> The book ‘The Indexing Companion’ written by two professional <b>indexers</b> is an up-to-date resource for learning how to index. The book consists of eleven chapters. The first two chapters of the book present some information about the basics of indexing. Chapter one, The Indexing Work Environment, introduces the industry and the people who provide the context for the indexing process. The chapter gives a good overview of the people with whom <b>indexers</b> need to work and cooperate. It presents some general information about indexing and <b>indexers</b> such as what an index is and what <b>indexers</b> do as well as some information about different working environments. The second chapter is about standards and definitions related to indexing...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} from July 1 st to August 30 th 2007. The study included on‐line surveys as well as face to face interviews. All <b>indexers</b> (in house as well as contractors) were invited {{to take part in}} this study. 48 (37. 8 %) completed the on‐line survey out of the 127 <b>indexers</b> contacted via e‐mail. A total of 7 <b>indexers</b> participated in the individual interviews. Responders included <b>indexers</b> with different levels of experience (from novice to experts) and years of service (0 to more than 25 years). Half of the responders have been working as <b>indexers</b> for 8 years or less. The most frequently used tool from the “related ” tab are Neighbor and MTI which ranked the highest with 54 % of the responders reporting to use it in a daily basis. Several responders reported that they used both tools which is the reason why they both tools in a daily basis. In terms of perceived usefulness, Neighbor is perceived as very useful or above average by 58. 8 % of responders while MTI 45. 8 % consider it as very useful or above average.

In terms of satisfaction and perceived usefulness of the MTI recommendations the indexers’ opinion are split in three groups.

2500|$|The search service {{consists}} of several components, including the Gatherer, the Merger, the Backoff Controller, and the Query Processor, among others. The Gatherer retrieves {{the list of}} URIs {{that need to be}} crawled and invokes proper protocol handler to access the store that hosts the URI, and then the proper property-handler (to extract metadata) and IFilter to extract the document text. Different indices are created during different runs; it is the job of the Merger to periodically merge the indices. While indexing, the indices are generally maintained in-memory and then flushed to disk after a merge to reduce disk I/O. The metadata is stored in property store, which is a database maintained by the ESE database engine. The text is tokenized and the tokens are stored in a custom database built using Inverted Indices. Apart from the indices and property store, another persistent data structure is maintained: the Gather Queue. The Gather Queue maintains a prioritized queue of URIs that needs indexing.
