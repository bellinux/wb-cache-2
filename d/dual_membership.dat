25|$|In {{the period}} {{leading up to}} the Sarekat Islam's sixth {{congress}} in 1921, members became aware of Sneevliet's strategy and took moves to stop it. Agus Salim, the organization's secretary, introduced a motion banning SI members from holding <b>dual</b> <b>membership</b> of other parties. Despite opposition from Tan Malaka and Semaun, the motion passed, forcing the communists to change tactics. At the same time, the Dutch colonial authorities introduced more restrictions on political activity, and Sarekat Islam decided to focus more on religious matters, leaving the communists as the only active nationalist organization.|$|E

25|$|This {{system has}} not survived the {{introduction}} of regular fraternities and other changes. The senior class societies continue to prosper today {{without any of the}} lower class societies. A similar system was introduced at Wesleyan University in nearby Middletown, Connecticut, but with a pair of societies in each class year and <b>dual</b> <b>memberships</b> between class societies and college fraternities, so that most class society members were also fraternity members. The older societies survived because of their endowments, real estate, and the vigor of their respective alumni organizations and their charitable Trusts.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to its base membership, the ESC acts as an umbrella organization {{for a variety of}} smaller groups, including a revived NYCF, Sparta Metro Firm, MDS, Cobra Kai Metro Firm, La Banda Imperial, Hub City Hooligans, Metro Ultras.

500|$|When {{the prime}} minister, Stanley Baldwin, called a general {{election}} for December 1923, Wilkinson was adopted as Labour's parliamentary candidate for Ashton-under-Lyne. She {{made no secret of}} her Communist affiliations, stating that [...] "we shall have only one class in this country, the working class". In a three-way contest she came third, behind the Conservative and the Liberal candidate. The general election resulted in a hung parliament, and a minority Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald took office. During its short term in power, the Labour Party proscribed the Communist Party and outlawed <b>dual</b> <b>membership.</b> Faced with a choice, Wilkinson left the CPGB, citing the party's [...] "exclusive and dictatorial methods which make impossible the formation of a real left wing among the progressives of the Trade Unions and the Labour Party". After this, she was selected as Labour's candidate for the constituency of Middlesbrough East.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{regiment}} was formed the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) {{did not exist}} – arriving in September 1971. [...] <b>Dual</b> <b>membership</b> was initially acceptable to the military authorities as the UDA was not seen {{as a threat to}} the state. This changed when on 29 November 1972, the GOCNI, on instructions from Westminster, announced that <b>dual</b> <b>membership</b> of UDR and paramilitary organisations would not be tolerated and began a purge which saw 171 soldiers with links to the UDA discharged by the end of 1975.

50|$|New Haven Country Club dates {{its origins}} to {{downtown}} New Haven in the 1890s. Yale University professor Theodore S. Woolsey {{was instrumental in}} the development of the nine-hole New Haven Golf Club in 1895 at what is now Sacred Heart University. Woolsey and other NHGC members desired a new setting as the nine-hole course became overcrowded with Yale students who began to enjoy the newly imported sport. A major provision of the newly established NHCC was that it would allow guest play but not membership to Yale students. Notable Yale-associated members included U.S. President Howard Taft, who taught law at his Alma Mater, and Yale alumnus Walter Camp, the father of American football. Since the creation of Yale Golf Course the club does not have as strong of a Yale connection, but many members have <b>dual</b> <b>memberships</b> at both courses or work at Yale University.|$|R
2500|$|Flashpoint began life in 2005 {{as a part}} of a CTV {{project that}} {{encouraged}} actors to submit scripts to the network. The original Flashpoint script (known earlier as Sniper and Critical Incident) was for a two-hour TV movie. A pilot episode was produced for CTV in July 2007 under the Critical Incident title featuring most of the cast of what would become the series, but without the characters Jules Callaghan and Lewis Young; the characters in the pilot were Kate Travers and Robert [...] "Shakes" [...] Boneyman. [...] CTV's interest in the project led to Flashpoints being reworked as a regular CTV series, which was approved in mid-December 2007. The show was unaffected by the 2007–08 WGA strike because WGC rules allow any members of the WGC living in Canada, including writers with <b>dual</b> WGA/WGC <b>membership,</b> to write for Canadian productions. Writers living in the USA with <b>dual</b> WGA/WGC <b>membership</b> were required to get a waiver from the WGA to work on Canadian productions during the strike.|$|R
2500|$|Brigadier Michael Bray {{adopted a}} zero-tolerance policy for any {{activity}} related to loyalism {{from the beginning}} of his tenure as Commander UDR. He instituted a number of safeguards including monitoring of entire battalions and six-month security reviews of all UDR personnel. [...] An out of bounds list was compiled for included pubs and clubs known to be frequented by loyalist paramilitaries. Soldiers were cautioned as to whom they should socialise with. This was a concerted effort to remove anyone with <b>dual</b> <b>membership</b> from the regiment and to prevent peer pressure being applied.|$|E
2500|$|RSF sees {{itself as}} forming {{part of a}} wider Republican Movement {{with a number of}} organisations which share a similar or {{identical}} ideological and political perspective. These include (but are not limited to) the Continuity IRA, Cumann na mBan, Fianna Éireann, Cabhair and the National Commemoration Committee and the Republican Prisoners Action Group. Across these organisations there is believed to be some level of <b>dual</b> <b>membership</b> with RSF. RSF strenuously rejects the allegation that it is the [...] "political wing" [...] of the Continuity IRA, as it denies any assertion that the latter is its [...] "military wing".|$|E

50|$|Patricia de Lille (born 17 February 1951) is a South African {{politician}} and Mayor of Cape Town. She was {{the founder and}} the leader of the Independent Democrats, a South African political party which she formed in 2003 during a floor-crossing window. On 15 August 2010, the ID merged with the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's official opposition, and de Lille took on <b>dual</b> party <b>membership</b> until her party was fully dissolved in May 2014.|$|R
5000|$|The {{increase}} in members has led official propaganda, and leading {{members of the}} party and state, to say that the people and the party are inseparable. Michel Kilo, a Syrian dissident, said, [...] "The Ba'ath does not recognize society. It consider itself be society." [...] This idea led to Ba'athist slogans and tenets being included in the Syrian constitution. In 1979, the Ba'ath Party's position was further strengthened when <b>dual</b> party <b>membership</b> became a criminal offence.|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} session of the Congress, 24 deputy {{fractions}} were registered, numbering 50 to 355 deputies. <b>Dual</b> <b>membership</b> was allowed, so the fraction membership numbered 200% of the entire Congress. Two major blocs quickly formed in opposition to each other - the Communist Bloc, and the Democratic Russia Bloc. The “Democratic Russia” and its allies were initially in the majority, which allowed Yeltsin to be elected as the Chairman of the Presidium. During the fifth session, <b>dual</b> <b>membership</b> in fractions was outlawed, “one deputy - one fraction” law was passed. However, <b>dual</b> <b>membership</b> still remained an issue and in April 1992 there were 30 deputies with membership in several fractions.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with many}} others in the Labour movement, Wilkinson's attitudes were radicalised by the Russian Revolution of 1917. She saw {{communism}} as {{the shape of the}} future, and when the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) was formed in the summer of 1920, Wilkinson was {{one of a group of}} ILP members with Marxist leanings who became founder members. For the next few years the CPGB was the main focus of her political activity, although she kept her membership in the Labour Party, which at the time accepted <b>dual</b> CPGB/Labour <b>memberships.</b>|$|R
50|$|Marais was {{a senior}} member of the New National Party (NNP) and was {{appointed}} to the Western Cape cabinet by NNP Premier Gerald Morkel in the late 1990s. After the NNP's merger agreement with the Democratic Alliance (DA) in June 2000, Marais took up <b>dual</b> party <b>membership.</b> As the NNP was the stronger party in the province, he was the DA mayoral candidate for Cape Town, and became Mayor following the local government election in December 2000. He was forced from the position in 2001 by DA leader Tony Leon, who saw him as a political embarrassment. The move contributed to the NNP pulling out of the DA.|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the {{political}} scenario was changed, as five opposition parties united {{under the umbrella}} of the National Alliance for Democracy and Development. NADD thus represented virtually all political opposition forces in the country. Following the registration of NADD the High Court ruled that <b>dual</b> party <b>membership</b> was unconstitutional, and as NADD had been registered as a political party all four opposition MPs were dismissed from the National Assembly. By-elections were held on 29 September, in which NADD retained three of the four seats. On 15 November the same year, three high-ranking NADD leaders (including the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly, Halifa Sallah) were arrested on the grounds of subversion.|$|R
