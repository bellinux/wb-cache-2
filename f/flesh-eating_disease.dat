A 2015 systematic review of 56 studies that recorded immediate complications suggested {{that each of}} these occurred in more than one in ten girls and women undergoing any form of FGM, including symbolic nicking of the clitoris (Type IV), although the risks increased with Type III. The review also suggested that there was under-reporting. Other short-term complications include fatal bleeding, anaemia, urinary infection, septicaemia, tetanus, gangrene, necrotizing fasciitis (<b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease),</b> and endometritis. It is not known how many girls and women die {{as a result of the}} practice, because complications may not be recognized or reported.

40|$|AbstractNecrotizing fasciitis, {{commonly}} known as <b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease</b> or flesh-eating bacteria syndrome, is a rare infection that affects and easily spreads across the deep fascia of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Literature reviews have identified several related risk factors and these include malignancy, alcoholism, malnutrition, diabetes, male gender, and old age. There are few case reports in the literature describing this rare disease in association with colorectal malignancy. Perforated colorectal carcinoma often presents as an acute abdomen infection in most cases. Here we report {{a young man with}} a unique case of perforated rectal cancer that was disclosed by necrotizing fasciitis of the right lower limb without any sign or symptom of peritonitis. This case highlights the need for prompt diagnosis, urgent aggressive surgical debridement and consideration of a rare underlying cause when managing necrotizing fasciitis...|$|E
40|$|Editorial Since the mid- 1980 s, {{concern has}} grown that {{invasive}} group A Streptococci (GAS) {{has been increasing}} in incidence and severity. Invasive infections caused by group A Streptococcus or Streptococcus pyogenes include sepsis, arthritis, pneumonia, meningitis, necrotizing fasciitis (NF) and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). GAS also causes noninvasive suppurative disease as pharyngitis and otitis media, and nonsuppurative post streptococcal sequelae (acute rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis [1]. Necrotizing fasciitis (<b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease)</b> is a soft tissue infection involving the subcutaneous fat and fascia. It was first described in 1952 by Wilson [2]. Facial necrosis precedes muscle and skin involvement, hence its namesake. The overall mortality rate is 25 %- 30 % more than 70 % of cases are associated with toxic shock syndrome [3].

40|$|Antibiotic {{resistance}} {{is becoming more}} prevalent; thus, the need to find other inhibition pathways. A possibility is the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases which catalyze the attachment of the amino acid to its respective tRNA. These enzymes are an excellent target for drug development. Prevotella intermedia (Pi) is an orphan organism which causes Noma, an oral cavity <b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease.</b> We selected the Pi arginyl-tRNA synthetase (ArgRS) because of its unusual features and dissimilarity to human homologs. More so, we are characterizing the ArgRS’s ability to bind tRNA and arginine {{as a prelude to}} drug design. Gel shift assays and aminoacylation assays will be used to characterize the interaction of the enzyme with tRNA and arginine. Once the enzymatic characterization is complete, we will pursue potential drugs, which include modified arginines. This work will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the interaction of the tRNA and arginine with the synthetase and will help computational work to determine a suitable inhibitor. By designing drugs against the tRNA synthetases, we can expand a powerful new class of antibiotics...|$|E

40|$|Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus) causes severe {{invasive}} infections including scarlet fever, pharyngitis (streptococcal sore throat), skin infections, {{necrotizing fasciitis}} (<b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease),</b> septicemia, erysipelas, cellulitis, acute rheumatic fever, and toxic shock. The conversion from nonpathogenic to toxigenic strains of S. pyogenes is frequently mediated by bacteriophage infection. One {{of the key}} bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors is a putative "hyaluronidase," HylP 1, a phage tail-fiber protein responsible for the digestion of the S. pyogenes hyaluronan capsule during phage infection. Here we demonstrate that HylP 1 is a hyaluronate lyase. The 3 D structure, at 1. 8 -angstroms resolution, reveals an unusual triple-stranded beta-helical structure and provides insight into the structural basis for phage tail assembly {{and the role of}} phage tail proteins in virulence. Unlike the triple-stranded beta-helix assemblies of the bacteriophage T 4 injection machinery and the tailspike endosialidase of the Escherichia coli K 1 bacteriophage K 1 F, HylP 1 possesses three copies of the active center on the triple-helical fiber itself without the need for an accessory catalytic domain. The triple-stranded beta-helix is not simply a structural scaffold, as previously envisaged; it is harnessed to provide a 200 -angstroms-long substrate-binding groove for the optimal reduction in hyaluronan viscosity to aid phage penetration of the capsule...|$|E
40|$|Communicating {{information}} about possible life threatening concerns {{can be very}} delicately difficult, {{and if it is}} not done well, the communicator can put the affected public at greater risk by creating misunderstanding or possibly inciting unwarranted panic. On February 24, 2014, a late night news program reported that a “mysterious flesh-eating illness is slowly” spreading in Pangasinan, a province in the Philippines with a population of more than three million. The news report connected two case studies from the towns of Villasis and Santa Barbara, Pangasinan to a prophecy by a self-titled prophet who forewarns of a <b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease</b> in the said province. Just hours after the report came out that night, the hashtag #PrayForPangasinan trended on Twitter, and link of the video have been boundlessly shared on Facebook and other online social media. Anchored on the mental noise and risk perception theories, the study delves into the perceptions of risk of the affected public and determines the risk communication impacts and lessons of the Pangasinan Mysterious Disease. The findings of the study on the perceptions of risk by the affected public, the risk communication impacts and lessons on the news report is significant as the fundamental goal of risk communication is to provide meaningful, relevant and accurate information, in clear and understandable terms targeted to the concerned and affected publicand spur all concerned to a higher degree of consensus and support for a beneficial action. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The Mac/IdeS protein {{of group}} A Streptococcus (GAS) is a {{secreted}} cysteine protease with cleavage specificity for IgG and is highly {{expressed in the}} GAS serotype M 1 T 1 clone, which is the serotype most frequently isolated from patients with lifethreatening invasive infections. While studies of Mac/IdeS with recombinant protein {{have shown that the}} protein can potentially prevent opsonophagocytosis of GAS by neutrophils, the role of the protein in immune evasion as physiologically produced by the living organism has not been studied. Here we examined the contribution of Mac/IdeS to invasive GAS disease by generating a mutant lacking Mac/IdeS in the hyperinvasive M 1 T 1 background. While Mac/IdeS was highly expressed and proteolytically active in the hyperinvasive strain, elimination of the bacterial protease did not significantly influence GAS phagocytic uptake, oxidative-burst induction, cathelicidin sensitivity, resistance to neutrophil or macrophage killing, or pathogenicity in pre- or postimmune mouse infectious challenges. We conclude that in the highly virulent M 1 T 1 background, Mac/IdeS is not essential for either phagocyte resistance or virulence. Given the conservation of Mac/IdeS and homologues across GAS strains, it is possible that Mac/IdeS serves another important function in GAS ecology or contributes to virulence in other strain backgrounds. IMPORTANCE Group A Streptococcus (GAS) causes human infections ranging from strep throat to life-threatening conditions such as <b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease</b> and toxic shock syndrome. Common disease-associated clones of GAS can cause both mild and severe infections because of a characteristic mutation and subsequent change in the expression of several genes that develops unde...|$|E
40|$|The group A {{streptococcus}} (GAS), or Streptococcus pyogenes, is {{a strict}} human pathogen of medical significance, causing infections ranging from pharyngitis (strep throat) to necrotizing fasciitis (<b>flesh-eating</b> <b>disease).</b> Several virulence genes that encode factors important for colonization, internalization, and immune evasion {{are under the}} control of the multiple gene regulator of the GAS, or Mga. Mga functions as a DNA-binding protein that interacts with sites both proximal (Pemm and PscpA) and distal (PsclA) to the start of transcription for the genes that it regulates. The genes encoding serum opacity factor, sof, and a novel fibronectin-binding protein, sfbX, are cotranscribed and represent two uncharacterized Mga-regulated virulence genes in the GAS. Analysis of the promoter region of sof-sfbX identified a putative Mga-binding site 278 bp upstream of the regulated start of transcription as determined by primer extension. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that Mga is able to bind specifically to the single distal site in a fashion similar to the previously characterized PsclA. In order to better understand the events that take place at this and other Mga-regulated promoters, an in vitro transcription assay was established. Using this assay, we showed that Mga is sufficient to activate transcription in vitro for Mga-regulated promoters containing both proximal (Pemm) and distal (PsclA and Psof-sfbX) binding sites. These results indicate that additional factors are not required for Mga-specific activation at diverse promoters in vitro, although they do not rule out the potential influence of other components on the Mga virulence regulon in vivo...|$|E
