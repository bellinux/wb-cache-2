5|$|A crucial safety {{aspect of}} {{international}} airports is medical facilities and practices. In particular, controlling transmissible disease, such as SARS, is deemed important at international airports.

5|$|In the {{chromate}} conversion coating process, the strong oxidative properties of chromates are used to deposit a protective oxide layer on metals like aluminium, zinc and cadmium. This passivation and the self-healing properties by the chromate stored in the {{chromate conversion}} coating, which is able to migrate to local defects, are the benefits of this coating method. Because of environmental and <b>health</b> <b>regulations</b> on chromates, alternative coating methods are under development.|$|E
5|$|The {{stabilizing}} {{effect of}} cadmium chemicals like the carboxylates cadmium laurate and cadmium stearate on PVC {{led to an}} increased use of those compounds in the 1970s and 1980s.

5|$|The ship {{found so}} many bodies that the {{embalming}} supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. <b>Health</b> <b>regulations</b> permitted that only embalmed bodies could {{be returned to}} port. Captain Larnder of the Mackay-Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers {{because of the need}} to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, the majority of the burials at sea were third class passengers and crew. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would expect to be buried at sea. However complaints about the burials at sea were made by families and undertakers. Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies, requiring fewer embalming supplies, and were able to limit burials at sea to bodies which were too damaged to preserve.|$|E

In 2000, the Minister of Health signed an amended version of public <b>health</b> <b>regulations</b> which raise chemical standards for water quality to very stringent standards. Maximum levels for 38 new chemical substances—including pesticides, organic solvents and petroleum products—were set for the first time while existing standards for nitrates, lead, cadmium and zinc were tightened.|$|E

In 2007, there were an estimated 50,000 outlets for indoor tanning; it was a five-billion-dollar industry in the United States, and had spawned an auxiliary industry for indoor tanning lotions including bronzers, intensifiers, and accelerators. Since then, the indoor tanning industry has become more constrained by <b>health</b> <b>regulations.</b> In China, darker skin is still {{considered by many to}} be the mark of the lower classes.
