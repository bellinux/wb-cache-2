25|$|Cases {{like these}} have created some privacy {{implications}} {{as to whether}} or not companies should have the right to look at employees' social network profiles. In March 2012, Facebook decided they might take legal action against employers for gaining access to employee's profiles through their passwords. According to Facebook Chief Privacy Officer for policy, Erin Egan, the company has worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> its users the tools to control who sees their information. He also said users shouldn't be forced to share private information and communications just to get a job. According to the network's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, sharing or soliciting a password is a violation to Facebook. Employees may still give their password information out to get a job, but according to Erin Egan, Facebook will continue to do their part to protect the privacy and security of their users.|$|E

It appears to give freedom, but its true function is to enslave the wearer to the Fallen Angel. It corrodes the human will of the wearer, rendering him increasingly [...] "thin" [...] and unreal; indeed, its gift of invisibility symbolizes this ability to destroy all natural human relationships and identity. You could say the Ring is sin itself: tempting and seemingly harmless to begin with, increasingly <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up and corrupting in the long run".|$|E

500|$|Semi-desert cacti need careful watering. General {{advice is}} <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give,</b> since the {{frequency}} of watering required depends on where the cacti are being grown, {{the nature of the}} growing medium, and the original habitat of the cacti. Brown says that more cacti are lost through the [...] "untimely application of water than for any other reason" [...] and that even during the dormant winter season, cacti need some water. Other sources say that water can be withheld during winter (November to March in the Northern Hemisphere). Another issue is the hardness of the water; where it is necessary to use hard water, regular re-potting is recommended to avoid the build up of salts. The general advice given is that during the growing season, cacti should be allowed to dry out between thorough waterings. A water meter can help in determining when the soil is dry.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} well {{received}} by critics, although {{with the occasional}} caveat. Variety praised the performances of the entire main cast but felt that the [...] "sordid aspects" [...] of the story prevented the film from achieving the [...] "goal of being pure entertainment." [...] Variety also felt the film was far too long. Stanley Kauffmann, writing for The New Republic, concurred in part with this assessment. Kauffmann strongly praised the principal cast, calling Newman [...] "first-rate" [...] and writing that Scott's was [...] "his most credible performance to date." [...] Laurie, he writes, gives her part [...] "movingly anguished touches" [...] (although he also mildly criticizes her for over-reliance on Method acting). While {{he found that the}} script [...] "strains <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> an air of menace and criminality to the pool hall" [...] and also declares it [...] "full of pseudo-meaning", Kauffmann lauds Rossen's [...] "sure, economical" [...] direction, especially in regard to Gleason who, he says, does not so much act as [...] " [...] for a number of pictures which are well arranged by Rossen. It is the best use of a manikin by a director since Kazan photographed Burl Ives as Big Daddy." [...] The New York Times, despite finding that the film [...] "strays a bit" [...] and that the romance between Newman and Laurie's characters [...] "seems a mite far-fetched", nonetheless found that The Hustler [...] "speaks powerfully in a universal language that spellbinds and reveals bitter truths." ...|$|E
500|$|Kurtzman {{recruited}} his long-time collaborator Will Elder {{to work on}} the strip's illustrations. He {{suggested to}} Elder an [...] "outlineless", painted style, then thought the strip would be better suited by an India inked, outlined comic book style with flat color behind it. Hefner, whose opinion prevailed, preferred the more difficult, fully painted, outlineless look. Kurtzman's suggestions for the feature's name included The Perils of Zelda, The Perils of Irma, and Little Mary Mixup; he settled on Little Annie Fanny, its title and logo a parody of Harold Gray's Little Orphan Annie. The cartoonist began submitting story ideas for the multi-page comic strip to Hefner for approval. Over the twenty-six years he wrote the character, he was allowed (with Playboy substantial budget) to travel for research, photography, and sketching. He followed this with a preliminary script for Hefner, who revised it. Kurtzman then worked out the story's composition, pacing, and action in thumbnail drawings and pencil roughs of each page of the comic, followed by larger, more-detailed layouts on translucent vellum specifying lighting, color, and speech balloon placement. These also required Hefner's approval—a typical two- to seven-page episode would take as many as nine pages of layout. Kurtzman then discussed the layout with Elder, who drove from his home in New Jersey to Kurtzman's in New York. Kurtzman acted out every detail of the strip; according to Elder, [...] "He would change his voice and take on the characteristics of each role... We'd crack each other up and fall down laughing." [...] This gave Elder what he needed to create the penciling, including [...] "eye pops" [...] (background gags worked into blank areas of Kurtzman's layout; Hefner rejected many, so Elder created as many as possible) and the final rendering. Elder painted in oil, tempera, and watercolor, never using ink. Beginning with a white illustration board, Elder explained he would [...] "pile on" [...] his oil paint, light colors over dark, then apply tempera, then layer several watercolor washes to give Annie luminous tones. [...] "The colors were like gems to me," [...] he said. [...] "I worked very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them iridescence." [...] The work was labor-intensive and deadlines were often difficult to meet, so other artists, including Russ Heath, Arnold Roth, Jack Davis, Al Jaffee, Frank Frazetta, and Paul Coker, were occasionally enlisted to help finish the art. Jaffee, a childhood friend of Elder, said about the experience: [...] "Little Annie Fannie was the most unique, lavishly produced cartoon cum illustration feature ever. Each panel was a miniature masterpiece that Willie glazed and re-glazed in brilliant watercolor until he reached the level of 3-D-like translucence that he wanted. I know from first-hand experience what went into this project." [...] Letterers inked the dialog balloons before Kurtzman cleaned and submitted the finished work. Little Annie Fanny, [...] first comic strip, was the first multi-page comics feature in a major American magazine.|$|E
2500|$|When the British mission {{proposed}} two {{plans for}} transfer of power, {{there was considerable}} opposition within the Congress to both. The plan of 16May 1946 proposed a loose federation with extensive provincial autonomy, and the [...] "grouping" [...] of provinces based on religious-majority. The plan of 16June 1946 proposed the partition of India on religious lines, with over 565 princely states free to choose between independence or accession to either dominion. The League approved both plans while the Congress flatly rejected the proposal of 16June. Gandhi criticised the 16May proposal as being inherently divisive, but Patel, realising that rejecting the proposal would mean that only the League would be invited to form a government, lobbied the Congress Working Committee <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> its assent to the 16May proposal. Patel engaged the British envoys Sir Stafford Cripps and Lord Pethick-Lawrence and obtained an assurance that the [...] "grouping" [...] clause would not be given practical force, Patel converted Jawaharlal Nehru, Rajendra Prasad, and Rajagopalachari to accept the plan. When the League retracted its approval of the 16May plan, the viceroy Lord Wavell invited the Congress to form the government. Under Nehru, who was styled the [...] "Vice President of the Viceroy's Executive Council", Patel {{took charge of the}} departments of home affairs and information and broadcasting.

2500|$|Following the {{production}} overhaul and the studio's attempts for more cost-efficient animated features, Mark Dindal urged for [...] "a simpler approach that emphasized the characters rather than overwhelming special effects or cinematic techniques". Because {{of the subsequent}} departure of Deja, animator Dale Baer inherited the character of Yzma. Using Eartha Kitt's gestures during recording sessions, Baer commented that [...] "She has a natural voice for animation and really got into the role. She would gesture wildly and it was fun just to watch her. She would come into each session almost serious and very professional and suddenly she would go wild and break up laughing." [...] Ranieri was later asked {{to serve as the}} supervising animator of Kuzco (as a human and a llama), though he would admit being reluctant at first until he discovered that Kuzco [...] "had a side to him, {{there was a lot of}} comedy potential and as a character he went through an arc". Pudleiner was also reassigned to work as an animator of the human version of Kuzco. In addition to drawing inspiration from David Spade during recording sessions, the Kuzco animation team studied llamas at the zoo, visited a llama farm, watched nature documentaries, and even observed the animals up close when they came for a visit to the studio. For the rewritten version of Pacha, animator Bruce W. Smith observed that [...] "Pacha is probably the most human of all the characters," [...] and further added that he [...] "has more human mannerisms and realistic traits, which serve as a contrast to the cartoony llama he hangs out with. He is the earthy guy who brings everything back into focus. Being a big fellow about six-foot-five and weighing about 250 pounds we had to work <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him a sense of weight and believability in his movement." ...|$|E
