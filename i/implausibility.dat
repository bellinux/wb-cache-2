5|$|On 3 June, Spain was {{approached}} by the US ambassador with a request to use Spanish ports for evacuating the wounded, following landings in southern France. Originally the plan had been to request access {{for the purposes of}} staging the initial invasion. However, this was toned down in light of historical resistance to any foreign occupation of Spanish soil as well as the <b>implausibility</b> of invading France via the Pyrenees. On 5 June the British ambassador reinforced the request, and after some discussion the Spanish government agreed but only after an invasion had occurred, and {{under the supervision of the}} Red Cross. To emphasise the change in objective, the Allies followed this up with Operation Ferdinand which threatened an invasion in Italy.|$|E
5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't {{want to go out}} for dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew in the care of their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling <b>implausibility</b> too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
25|$|Holocaust {{historian}} Deborah Lipstadt {{had already}} denounced {{the story in}} her personal blog in December 2007. Other Holocaust survivors like Peter Kubicek also denounced the <b>implausibility</b> of the story. Jewish-American blogger Danny Bloom started emailing several historians for help, one of them being Holocaust historian Kenneth Waltzer.|$|E
5000|$|The Reality Trip and Other <b>Implausibilities</b> Ballantine (1972) ...|$|R
5000|$|It also {{contains}} some apparent self-criticism {{of its own}} <b>implausibilities,</b> e.g., [...] "a series of the most workmanlike miracles". These <b>implausibilities,</b> e.g., impostors as guests at a castle, mistaken identities which could be easily explained but are not, and unlikely encounters with old acquaintances, become common in Wodehouse's later works set in English castes, most notably Blandings Castle.|$|R

25|$|American {{journalist}} Arnaud de Borchgrave {{claimed that}} the Bulgarians chose Ağca to supply themselves with plausible deniability; choosing {{a member of the}} Grey Wolves that had allegedly been involved with the local KGB in drug smuggling routes through Bulgaria to Western Europe would distance themselves because of the <b>implausibility</b> of the link.|$|E
25|$|Criticism of {{cold fusion}} claims {{generally}} {{take one of}} two forms: either pointing out the theoretical <b>implausibility</b> that fusion reactions have occurred in electrolysis set-ups or criticizing the excess heat measurements as being spurious, erroneous, or due to poor methodology or controls. There {{are a couple of}} reasons why known fusion reactions are an unlikely explanation for the excess heat and associated cold fusion claims.|$|E
25|$|Keeping Miley's secret {{involves}} a two sided effort. As Hannah, she must keep her fans unaware {{that she is}} really a normal kid, and as Miley, she must keep her friends unaware that she is really Hannah Montana. In interviews, Miley Cyrus spoke of the <b>implausibility</b> {{of being able to}} keep a secret such as Miley and her family do in the show in a world of intense media scrutiny. The show however, remains workable primarily based on suspension of disbelief.|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{have noted}} many {{scientific}} <b>implausibilities</b> {{connected with the}} story of Helatrobus. Peter Forde's paper [...] "A Scientific Scrutiny of OT III" [...] (which also covers Scientologists' belief in the ancient galactic ruler Xenu) analyzes the matter in detail.|$|R
25|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} on March 20, 2009, in the United States. The DVD and Blu-ray media were released on July 7, 2009. Knowing met with mixed reviews, with praise for the acting performances, visual style and atmosphere, but criticism over some <b>implausibilities.</b>|$|R
50|$|In The Dancing Men, on {{the other}} hand, the plot is emphatically what counts. Most of the {{characterization}} {{is no more than}} adequate, and there are some hefty <b>implausibilities,</b> but Duncan Kyle keeps your curiosity simmering away too effectively for you to mind very much.|$|R
25|$|Arthur George, 3rd Earl of Onslow, {{who had a}} large Napoleonic collection, {{was visiting}} the Louvre with Paul Delaroche in 1848 and commented on the <b>implausibility</b> and theatricality of David's painting. He {{commissioned}} Delaroche to produce a more accurate version which featured Napoleon on a mule. While Delaroche's painting is more realistic than the symbolic heroic representation of David, it {{was not meant to}} be demeaning - Delaroche admired Bonaparte and thought that the achievement was not diminished by depicting it in a realistic fashion.|$|E
25|$|Partly in {{consideration}} of Le Sage's theory, Pierre-Simon Laplace undertook to determine the necessary speed of gravity {{in order to be}} consistent with astronomical observations. He calculated that the speed must be “at least a hundred millions of times greater than that of light”, in order to avoid unacceptably large inequalities due to aberration effects in the lunar motion. This was taken by most researchers, including Laplace, as support for the Newtonian concept of instantaneous action at a distance, and to indicate the <b>implausibility</b> of any model such as Le Sage's. Laplace also argued that to maintain mass-proportionality the upper limit for earth's molecular surface area is at the most the ten-millionth of earth surface. To Le Sage's disappointment, Laplace never directly mentioned Le Sage's theory in his works.|$|E
500|$|This {{objection}} {{is fundamentally}} an argument {{by lack of}} imagination, or argument from incredulity: a certain explanation is seen as being counterintuitive, and therefore an alternate, more intuitive explanation is appealed to instead. Supporters of evolution generally respond by arguing that evolution {{is not based on}} [...] "chance," [...] but on predictable chemical interactions: natural processes, rather than supernatural beings, are the [...] "designer." [...] Although the process involves some random elements, it is the non-random selection of survival-enhancing genes that drives evolution along an ordered trajectory. The fact that the results are ordered and seem [...] "designed" [...] is no more evidence for a supernatural intelligence than the appearance of complex natural phenomena (e.g. snowflakes). It is also argued that there is insufficient evidence to make statements about the plausibility or <b>implausibility</b> of abiogenesis, that certain structures demonstrate poor design, and that the <b>implausibility</b> of life evolving exactly as it did is no more evidence for an intelligence than the <b>implausibility</b> of a deck of cards being shuffled and dealt in a certain random order.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} censored and then rediscovered in 2008. A man called Giancarlo Mancini found a bad Italian copy {{interspersed}} with fragments from a French edition in Ripley's Home Video. It {{has been described}} as a mediocre melodrama with obvious <b>implausibilities</b> in the plot and unsuited to Neufeld.|$|R
5000|$|Rito P. Asilo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer wrote, [...] "The film is so adorable that it's easy to {{disregard}} its <b>implausibilities</b> ... Moreover, Island Dreams will win you over with its infectious optimism and charming whimsy, anchored on the vibrant chemistry of Delos Reyes and Petitprez. For hopeless romantics, {{this is the}} movie to see!".|$|R
25|$|Stories of Eurydice's plots {{against her}} husband and her sons are at odds with other {{historical}} evidence and may be fabricated. Recent scholars have noted the many <b>implausibilities</b> in Justin’s narrative and have acknowledged Eurydice’s near-contemporary evidences of Aeschines towards her. Aeschines described Eurydice I as the loyal defender of her sons, whereas a Plutarch’s passage describes Eurydice as a good model in the education of children.|$|R
500|$|Blair won the [...] "Most Popular New Female Talent" [...] Logie Award for her {{portrayal}} of Carmella, and was additionally nominated for several Golden Logies and Inside Soap Awards. Critics have deemed Carmella {{as one of}} the series' most popular characters. Blair's versatility has attracted praise, though several publications have highlighted the <b>implausibility</b> of many of Carmella's storylines.|$|E
500|$|She {{compared}} it to two previous episodes, [...] "The Impossible Planet" [...] and [...] "Midnight", both of which she enjoyed. She criticised three aspects of the episode: Lady Christina, who was the [...] "first [...] heroine who actually filled [...] with revulsion", leaving her hoping that the character would be killed off-screen, Malcolm's reluctance to close the wormhole and the <b>implausibility</b> of only three stingrays travelling through it. She thought that the episode was [...] "a pretty solid adventure with a cool set of monsters".|$|E
500|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{how much of}} the Brothers Poem is lost. [...] An overlap between P. Oxy. 2289 and P. Sapph. Obbink, the apparent alphabetic arrangement of the poems of Sappho in the Alexandrian edition of her works, and the <b>implausibility</b> of a poem beginning with the word αλλα (meaning [...] "but" [...] or [...] "and yet") all suggest that at least one stanza is missing {{from the beginning of the}} poem. [...] Bär has argued against this position, noting that the overlap between the Oxyrhynchus and Obbink papyri is sufficiently small (only six characters) as to not be conclusive; that there are other known exceptions to the alphabetical ordering of Sappho's poems in Book I of the Alexandrian edition, and thematic reasons why the Brothers Poem might have been placed out of order to follow closely after fragment 5; and that there are parallels elsewhere in Greek literature for an inceptive αλλα.|$|E
5000|$|Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times {{called the}} film [...] "egregiously dull" [...] and a {{contender}} {{for one of}} [...] "the dumbest action pictures of the year", citing its [...] "jarring shifts in tone, insurmountable plot <b>implausibilities,</b> rampant racial stereotyping, superfluous nudity and inhuman amounts of comically exaggerated violence". Willman also questioned {{the manner in which}} characters seem to recover from serious injuries and major trauma.|$|R

5000|$|Hippolyte Taine {{considered}} the psychological portraits of Stendhal's characters to be [...] "real, {{because they are}} complex, many-sided, particular and original, like living human beings." [...] Emile Zola concurred with Taine's assessment of Stendhal's skills as a [...] "psychologist", and although emphatic in his praise of Stendhal's psychological accuracy and rejection of convention, he deplored the various <b>implausibilities</b> of the novels and Stendhal's clear authorial intervention.|$|R
500|$|Former Scientologists {{and members}} of the anti-cult {{movement}} often discuss Scientology's space opera teachings. They generally take a rationalistic approach to the narratives and see them as absurd, or even as drug-fueled delusions, using them as a source of humor. The doctrines have been satirized in popular culture, most notably in the South Park episode [...] "Trapped in the Closet". The anti-Scientology website Operation Clambake prominently uses space opera doctrines in their criticisms of the church, casting the <b>implausibility</b> of the stories as a clear reason to reject the group. Anti-cult critics of Scientology argue that the content of these teachings demonstrates that Scientology misleads its followers; many aspects of the narratives, such as the age of the volcanoes that Xenu is said to have used, contradict scientific consensus. The space opera teachings are, in fact, incompatible with scientific consensus on the age of the universe: around 14 billion years. Rothstein notes that scholars of religion usually do not pursue this line of analysis because all myths contain unscientific content; he notes that cultural conditioning determines whether religious narratives appear reasonable.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt called Speed Racers {{visual effects}} [...] "stellar", but stated it [...] "proudly denies entry into its ultra-bright world {{to all but}} gamers, fanboys and anime enthusiasts". He criticized that story and {{character}} were [...] "tossed aside" [...] towards the [...] "wearying" [...] races. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted the target audience should be amused, but others might think the film [...] "a cinematic pile-up", citing its <b>implausibility</b> {{and the lack of}} identifiable peril in the driving sequences. While noted viewers interested in CGI would appreciate it, McCarthy said the frame sometimes resembled [...] "a kindergartner's art class collage". He had praise for the cinematography, the musical score, and the cast. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy also praised the cast, while saying the story is [...] "as anyone would expect", adding [...] "the characters are all cardboard archetypes with Saturday Morning dialogue." [...] Speed Racer [...] "sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self-conscious grandiosity", declared The New York Times A. O. Scott.|$|E
500|$|Roger Moore of The Seattle Times showed mixed {{feelings}} in his review: [...] "Rare is the thriller that goes as completely and utterly wrong as The Call does at almost precisely the one-hour mark. Which is a crying shame, because {{for an hour}} this is a riveting, by-the-book kidnapping." [...] Moore explained {{what he saw as}} the highs and lows: [...] "Brad Anderson turns this...serial-killer hunt...into a real edge-of-your-seat thriller. Given...a half-decent tale of horror, guilt, problem-solving and redemption, Anderson couldn't go far wrong," [...] but, Moore states, [...] "It's only when our Oscar-winning heroine puts down the phone and sets out to do some sleuthing of her own that The Call disconnects, turning into something far more generic and far less exciting." [...] The Los Angeles Times turned in a similar review: [...] "The semi-fresh thriller, set mainly in an emergency call center and on the freeways of Los Angeles, puts a tech slant on a damsel-in-distress setup. It buzzes along for a while, the promising plot innovations inviting suspension of disbelief, before by-the-numbers <b>implausibility,</b> over-the-top valor and unsavory contrivances take over and the line goes dead." ...|$|E
5000|$|Edward Guthmann of the San Francisco Chronicle said, [...] "As haunted-house thrillers go, Cold Creek Manor is more ludicrous {{than the}} average {{but at the same}} time more handsomely produced. Hokum with a big-budget gloss, it's a simple, formulaic nail-biter ... The script ... grafts from every {{possible}} thriller - most of which had pilfered their predecessors - and loads on <b>implausibilities</b> until we wonder why the actors play it seriously." ...|$|R
2500|$|This {{book would}} be Triplanetary, [...] "in which {{scientific}} detail {{would not be}} bothered about, and in which his imagination would run riot." [...] Indeed, characters within the story point out its psychological and scientific <b>implausibilities,</b> and sometimes even seem to suggest self-parody. At other times, they are conspicuously silent about obvious <b>implausibilities.</b> The January 1933 issue of Astounding announced that Triplanetary would appear in the March issue, and that issue's cover illustrated {{a scene from the}} story, but Astoundings financial difficulties prevented the story from appearing. Smith then submitted the manuscript to Wonder Stories, whose new editor, 17-year-old Charles D. Hornig, rejected it, later boasting about the rejection in a fanzine. He finally submitted it to Amazing, which published it beginning in January 1934, but for only half a cent a word. Shortly after it was accepted, F. Orlin Tremaine, the new editor of the revived Astounding, offered one cent a word for Triplanetary; when he learned that he was too late, he suggested a third Skylark novel instead.|$|R
5000|$|Daniel Pipes derided her view, {{saying that}} it was [...] "a tour de force, but it's a tour de force of alchemy. It has a {{fundamentally}} wrong premise." [...] According to Andrew C. McCarthy, who prosecuted Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman in 1995, [...] "Mylroie's theory was loopy... Leaving aside various other <b>implausibilities</b> in her surmise, the government had several sources who knew Basit as Basit {{both before and after the}} time he spent in Kuwait." ...|$|R
500|$|Brett Love of TV Squad {{posited that}} Gordon's {{return in the}} [...] "great" [...] episode was [...] "well worth the wait". He noted that the revelation that Lucy was just an {{innocent}} girl was a [...] "nice twist", and deemed it a [...] "great choice" [...] to have Gordon turned into a vampire. Love was sad to see Gordon depart from the series, finding the [...] "outstanding" [...] Brown to be [...] "so intense and committed" [...] to the role. However, he considered Bela's appearance to be unnecessary, and pointed out the <b>implausibility</b> of it being easier for Gordon to track down Bela {{than it would have}} been to just track down the Winchesters. Like Love, Julie Pyle of Airlock Alpha believed Bela's appearance [...] " [...] forced". She was saddened by the deaths of Gordon and Kubrick, and had hoped that their storylines would have been further explored. Pyle also criticized the episode's lighting, commenting, [...] "With the added gore this season, the show should seem darker. Instead, it's like Supernatural Lite." [...] While Maureen Ryan of Chicago Tribune found the concept of Gordon hunting down Sam to be [...] "inspired", she noted that [...] "'Fresh Blood' didn't do much for [...] ".|$|E
500|$|John's lack of {{religious}} conviction {{has been noted}} by contemporary chroniclers and later historians, with some suspecting that John was at best impious, or even atheistic, a very serious issue at the time. Contemporary chroniclers catalogued his various anti-religious habits at length, including his failure to take communion, his blasphemous remarks, and his witty but scandalous jokes about church doctrine, including jokes about the <b>implausibility</b> of the Resurrection. They commented on the paucity of John's charitable donations to the church. Historian Frank McLynn argues that John's early years at Fontevrault, combined with his relatively advanced education, may have turned him against the church. Other historians have been more cautious in interpreting this material, noting that chroniclers also reported John's personal interest {{in the life of}} St Wulfstan of Worcester and his friendships with several senior clerics, most especially with Hugh of Lincoln, who was later declared a saint. Financial records show a normal royal household engaged in the usual feasts and pious observances – albeit with many records showing John's offerings to the poor to atone for routinely breaking church rules and guidance. The historian Lewis Warren has argued that the chronicler accounts were subject to considerable bias and the King was [...] "at least conventionally devout," [...] citing his pilgrimages and interest in religious scripture and commentaries.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less positive. The Herald Suns head {{reviewer}} Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried {{to match the}} edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, [...] "way, way off the mark". He wrote, [...] "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', just wait until you get a load of this lame local production." [...] Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film {{was an example of}} [...] "just how bad local [...] films can get". In particular, he criticised the [...] "stiff" [...] performances, the [...] "woeful" [...] directing and the plot's <b>implausibility.</b> Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and lacked [...] "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and [...] "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that [...] "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that [...] "her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of [...] "an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away".|$|E
5000|$|Reviews for Pet {{have been}} mixed, with critics {{alternatively}} praising the subversive themes and strong leading performances, or lamenting the implausible twists. On Rotten Tomatoes {{the film has}} an approval rating of 50% based on 12 reviews. Reviews that have criticized the twists include Screen Anarchy, which wrote [...] "Without spoiling anything more, the twists push past the merely unlikely into a strange minefield of what in the world?", and RogerEbert.com, which noted [...] "The rank, idiotic <b>implausibilities</b> continue to mount..." ...|$|R
5000|$|O'Hehir {{stated that}} despite <b>implausibilities</b> in the film, its romance [...] "worked on me, {{or at least}} it made me wish that the world of Sam and Amira’s {{wonderful}} and unlikely love affair really existed. It’s a better world than ours." [...] O'Hehir added that even though the film had good intentions and any cultural mistakes [...] "are exceptionally mild", [...] "If enough people see this movie, it’s possible that Mullin will come under attack for eroticizing or exoticizing an Arab woman, and/or disrespecting Islam." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shrikant V Prabhu {{has written}} {{a review of the}} film on the Indian film website upperstall.com where he talks about the {{techniques}} used in the film. [...] "The camera easily lives and breathes in small spaces in the film. The wide angle lens creates a weird cocoon showing the two individuals hopelessly trapped. The jump cuts as a narrative device give you that interrupted feel and suggest the <b>implausibilities</b> in the narrative. The sound design has created a well-thought out fabric of a familiar world."(Source: Upperstall.com Site) ...|$|R
