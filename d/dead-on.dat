[...] She also praised Jim's prank on Pam, especially viewing Helms' performance [...] "amazingly funny as this oblivious blowhard." [...] Referring to [...] "Michael's earnest determination not to assume that Martin was the ex-con whom the Stamford office had hired," [...] West found the episode to be a satire of [...] "white liberal guilt". Reviewers were also positive towards the [...] "Prison Mike" [...] sequence, with West calling it [...] "a <b>dead-on</b> impersonation of a badass convict." [...] Television Without Pity gave the episode an [...] "A-".|$|E
500|$|The Deluxe Complete Edition soundtrack was {{released}} on December 18, 2007. Depp's singing was described by a New York Times reviewer as [...] "harsh and thin, but amazingly forceful". Another critic adds that, though Depp's voice [...] "does not have much heft or power", [...] "his ear is obviously excellent, because his pitch is <b>dead-on</b> accurate... Beyond his good pitch and phrasing, the expressive colorings of his singing are crucial to the portrayal. Beneath this Sweeney’s vacant, sullen exterior is a man consumed with a murderous rage that threatens to burst forth every time he slowly takes a breath and is poised to speak. Yet when he sings, his voice crackles and breaks with sadness." ...|$|E
500|$|MTV's Corey Moss {{compared}} Stefani's {{performance to}} Madonna {{with regard to}} [...] "the eight costume changes to the dancers to the theatrics to, hell, even the music itself" [...] and avouched that she sounded completely different from how she did with No Doubt. Moss asserted that the No Doubt lead vocalist was the [...] "most captivating thing onstage" [...] with her [...] "confident strut and <b>dead-on</b> vocals". Jon Pareles of The New York Times admired the [...] "glamour and groove" [...] antics of the show and how Stefani [...] "flaunt the perks of stardom". He praised her music, describing the album as [...] "a smart , with honed rhythm tracks that flit from funk to pop, electronics to rock", although calling most tracks [...] "superficial", being about [...] "style", [...] "success", [...] "shopping" [...] and [...] "sex".|$|E
500|$|... "It's the Grand Pumpkin, Milhouse" [...] was {{regarded}} by reviewers {{as the best}} segment in the episode. Canning wrote, [...] "this segment may not be all that gory, but it's funny and, quite honestly, it will just make you feel good", and Bentley described it as [...] "a <b>dead-on</b> comedy assault of the Charlie Brown animated Halloween special." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concurred, writing that it [...] "succeeds because it offers sly cultural commentary." [...] Show Patrol wrote [...] "The nostalgia factor makes “Grand Pumpkin” {{the best of these}} amusing bits for me, but they all lack that trademark “Simpsons” brand of satirical smartness." [...] Hal Boedecker of the Orlando Sentinel gave the episode a 4/5 and called the final segment a [...] "witty parody of Charlie Brown's Halloween classic. [...] The best gag, though, is a subtle one. Marge plays a trombone, a loving salute to the way the Peanuts specials portrayed adult voices." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{composed}} by Thomas Newman. He {{felt that it}} already elicited such strong emotions without music that he {{found it difficult to}} compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, [...] "Shawshank Redemption," [...] plays during Andy's escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a [...] "triumphal flourish" [...] and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. [...] "So Was Red," [...] played following Red's release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy's cache, became one of Newman's favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add [...] harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player Tommy Morgan [...] "casually delivered something <b>dead-on</b> perfect on the first take," [...] and this is heard in the finished film. Newman's score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Peter Smith of Computer Games Magazine {{found the}} game's {{swinging}} mechanics challenging, {{and noted that}} [...] "making a <b>dead-on</b> accurate shot {{much more difficult than}} in any of the other golf games out there." [...] He found the mechanics of the putting green to be badly designed, which he cited as [...] "an incredibly serious flaw that takes British Open Championship Golf out of contention for the gold cup." [...] Ultimately, he recommended Links LS and Jack Nicklaus 4 over the game, but suggested that future installments or patches might fix the issues. Computer Gaming Worlds Scott A. May wrote that [...] "the game is solid, but ... somewhat unspectacular" [...] compared to Jack Nicklaus 4 and Links LS. He stated that the links courses gave the game [...] "a somewhat desolate look and feel", and that, [...] "Historic or not, the scenery is downright dull". The reviewer considered Jim McKay's commentary and the simulated physics to be the game's high points, and he believed that, [...] "More so than any other golf sim, the reactive crowd and interactive caddie are ... totally integrated into play." [...] He summarized the game as [...] "a very good simulation" [...] that was somewhat deflated by its lack of multiplayer, course editing and match replays.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed critical reviews, with [...] "Tweenlight" [...] generally being {{regarded as}} the best segment. John Griffiths of Us Weekly gave the episode three stars, writing that [...] "the three oddball tales run from mildly amusing to flat-out inspired. In one goofy vignette, Homer and a bikini-wearing Marge pluck a scary mystery man from the sea. However, watching Lisa crush on a brooding vampire in a <b>dead-on</b> poke at Twilight is the hilarious treat here." [...] Fred Topel of Screen Junkies wrote, [...] "The best jokes in all the segments are actually not the spoofs. They’re the cartoon physical comedy, the references to mundane frustrations like having to be the thimble when playing Monopoly. It’s also super gory. [...] I think “The Simpsons” {{are still on the}} creative upswing since The Simpsons Movie and this “Treehouse of Horrors” would hold up with classics like [...] "The Shinning" [...] and [...] "The Homega Man." [...] Brad Trechak of TV Squad felt {{that it was one of}} the best Treehouse of Horrors in years. He wrote, [...] "Of the three vignettes, the first segment 'War and Pieces,' while not the best, was the most original despite being a variation of the plot of 'Jumanji.' Unlike that book/movie, instead of the game coming into the real world, the game brings other board games into the real world. The satire on this show remains sharp as none of the games had the same name as their real world counterparts to prevent toy company litigation against Fox. [...] The final segment 'Tweenlight'... was the best of the three. It felt a little less dated than the first two." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Saadiq, {{the opening}} track [...] "Thinking of You" [...] is [...] "a really soul, southern, funky song" [...] {{inspired}} by Al Green. It has light guitar strokes and is sung in a Southern twang by Saadiq, while [...] "Top Notch" [...] features jazz elements and the vocalist's playful {{promise of a}} trip to Denny's for [...] "the most expensive dinner we can find". On [...] "Still a Man", he sings {{from the perspective of}} a man who was left by his wife to raise their children alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative hook, [...] "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to hurt them so bad?" [...] On [...] "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. The song was described by Washington City Paper journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of the Stylistics' 1972 song [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow", featuring [...] "a <b>dead-on</b> impression of Russell Thompkins' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction". [...] "Annie May" [...] was written by Wiggins as a story about a [...] "good girl next door" [...] who becomes an exotic dancer, while [...] "Let Me Know" [...] is a love song with Wall of Sound elements. According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator, [...] "Wild Child" [...] is [...] "a ballad in the grand sense" [...] of the 1977 Earth, Wind & Fire song [...] "Be Ever Wonderful". [...] "Party Don't Cry" [...] is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song [...] "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a gospel-influenced instrumental and variation of [...] "Lovin' You" [...] composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is an universalist platitude.|$|E
