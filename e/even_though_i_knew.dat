25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E
500|$|Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a glowing review, calling it [...] "the best-yet episode of Veronica Mars". He {{elaborated}} by stating, This episode {{was just a}} total triumph for how it brought together SO MUCH from the past 22 episodes and beyond. I loved the Aaron Echolls assassination. I loved that last image of Duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some Australian beach. I especially loved the It's a Wonderful Life-esque dream sequence. This episode was so good that <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Beaver was the bad guy, I still came away shocked {{by many of the}} reveals. That's just good writing right there. Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, Flynt won a Supreme Court decision, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, {{after being}} sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1983, over an {{offensive}} ad parody in Hustler {{that suggested that}} Falwell's first sexual encounter was with his mother in an out-house. Falwell sued Flynt, citing emotional distress caused by the ad. The decision clarified that public figures cannot recover damages for [...] "intentional infliction of emotional distress" [...] based on parodies. After Falwell's death, Flynt said despite their differences, he and Falwell had become friends over the years, adding, [...] "I always appreciated his sincerity <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what he was selling and he knew what I was selling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knightley {{grew up in}} {{a modest}} {{household}} in Richmond, London, where she attended Stanley Junior School and Teddington School. At the age of six, she was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but {{by the time she was}} eleven, with her parents' support and much tuition, Knightley said: [...] "they deemed me to have got over dyslexia sufficiently". She is still a slow reader and cannot sight-read. Knightley has noted that she was [...] "single-minded about acting" [...] during her childhood. Speaking of her fascination with acting, she has said: [...] "There was never anything else, I wanted to be a part of my parents' world, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there are times when you're unemployed". Knightley performed in a number of local amateur productions, which included After Juliet, written by her mother, and United States, written by her drama teacher, Ian McShane. She focused on art, history, and English literature while studying at the Esher College, but left after a year to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E

He was so sad about all that with his younger girlfriend, and I swear nothing has ever been more heartfelt. I get teary just thinking about it. It's so positive and so negative. When it goes into [...] "I love you, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> too our love is taboo", it's like the saddest thing I've ever heard.

5000|$|LSE Director Howard Davies {{resigned}} on 3 March {{over the}} revelations. In a comment Davies {{said he had}} left the job because of [...] "two errors of judgment": 1) his advice that a donation from Gaddafi's foundation was acceptable, and 2) his decision to act as a financial adviser to the Libyan government. Davies acknowledged in his resignation letter that it would “be right for me to step down, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that this will cause difficulty for the institution I have come to love.” He added, “The short point is that I am responsible for the school’s reputation, and that has suffered.” ...|$|R
6000|$|I wandered {{backward}} and {{forward in the}} storm, drenched and cold, yet all unmindful of my state. I could have borne no roof over my head in those hours of my agony.

60|$|I {{staggered}} out-of-doors again, {{and fell}} into the car, whose ever-running machinery masked my yelps and hiccups. When I raised my forehead from the wheel, I saw that traffic through the village had been resumed, after, as my watch showed, one and one-half hour's suspension. There were two limousines, one landau, one doctor's car, three touring-cars, one patent steam-laundry van, three tricars, one traction-engine, some motor-cycles, one with a side-car, and one brewery lorry. It was the allegory of my own imperturbable country, delayed {{for a short time}} by unforeseen external events but now going about her business, and I blessed Her with tears in my eyes, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> She looked upon me as drunk and incapable.|$|E
6000|$|Back to the Homestead we drove--back to {{an empty}} shell. The place in which Isabel Garland's wish had been law {{for so many years}} was now desolate and drear, and return would have been {{impossible}} for me {{had it not been for}} the presence of my wife, whose serene soul was my comfort and my stay. [...] "You have done all that a son could do," [...] she insisted, and it was a comfort to have her say this <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that it was not true, her faith in me and her youth and beauty partly redeemed me from the awful emptiness of that home. Without her (and all that she represented) my father and I would have been victims of a black despair.|$|E
5000|$|... "When I {{was asked}} where I was from, I said I was from Cranston, Rhode Island," [...] Laffey recalls. [...] "Why did I say I was from Cranston? I'd been away for 20 years.

50|$|In {{sentence}} number 1, {{the doctor}} is a man, so the masculine pronoun is used. In sentence number 2, {{the doctor is}} a woman, so the noun is referred back with a feminine pronoun. But in sentence number 3, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> if the doctor is {{a man or a}} woman, it is perfectly possible to still dodge the definition by using the always available gender-neutral pronoun lu. Notice however that doktoro is never marked for gender in these sentences, since the doctor will be called in his/her professional capacity, and not for being a man or a woman. Actually, saying Me advokos mea doktorino (or mea doktorulo) implies I have a choice between a male and a female doctor, and I have decided on either of them.|$|R
6000|$|Now, too, I {{remembered how}} Barnabas {{had said the}} Augusta {{commanded}} that this Prince Magas and his daughter should come to the palace as her guests. Well, the place was vast, a town in itself, and likely enough I should not see them there. Yet I longed {{to see one of}} them as never I had longed for anything before. I was sure, also, that no fears could keep us apart, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the road before me to be full of dangers and of trials, knew that I went with my life in my hand, the life of which I had been quite careless, but that now had become so dear to me.

60|$|However, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{it was the}} parrot, {{and that}} indeed it could be nobody else, {{it was a good}} while before I could compose myself. First, I was amazed how the {{creature}} got thither, and then how he should just keep about the place, and no where else: but as I was well satisfied it could be nobody but honest Poll, I got it over; and holding out my Hand, and calling him by his Name Poll, the sociable Creature came to me, and sat upon my Thumb, as he used to do, and continued talking to me, Poor Robin Crusoe, and how did I come here? and where had I been? just {{as if he had been}} overjoyed to see me again; and so I carried him Home along with me.|$|E

But I'm only a poor {{minister}} and I {{have no right to}} ask her to share my life of hard work and self-denial. And even if I dared I know she wouldn't do it. She doesn't care anything for me except as a friend. I never meant to tell her I cared for her but I couldn't help going to Owlwood, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it was a weakness on my part. So now that I'm out of the habit of going I think it would be wisest to stay out. It hurts dreadfully, but it would hurt worse after a while. Don't you agree with me, Miss Elizabeth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{received}} your book[35] {{with the}} greatest pleasure, and heartily thank you for it. It is a volume of a highly prepossessing appearance, and a most friendly look.

5000|$|Anno {{was on the}} 1991 Tampa Bay Buccaneers squad {{the year}} that former Santa Monica High School Vikings quarterback Pat O'Hara (1984) was drafted by the Bucs (10, 260).

Whether or not I was his affair, I could try to make him mine--perhaps even persuade Fanny to love him.|$|R
