Patton was particularly upset when learning {{of the end of}} the war against Japan, writing in his diary, [...] "Yet another war <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end, and with it my usefulness to the world." [...] Unhappy with his position and depressed by his belief that he would never fight in another war, Patton's behavior and statements became increasingly erratic. Various explanations beyond his disappointments have been proposed for Patton's behavior at this point. Carlo D'Este wrote that [...] "it seems virtually inevitable... that Patton experienced some type of brain damage from too many head injuries" [...] from a lifetime of numerous auto- and horse-related accidents, especially one suffered while playing polo in 1936.|$|E

500|$|In a July 2011 {{interview}} with Forbes.com, Activision CEO Bobby Kotick {{stated that they}} were going to try to [...] "reinvent" [...] the series, but a former teammember of Vicarious Visions has stated that as of 2012, all development of Guitar Hero <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end within Activision. Another source close to Vicarious Visions had reported to Kotaku that while Guitar Hero 7 was in development under an Activision studio, the game was considered a [...] "disaster". The cancelled game omitted the additional instruments and used only a guitar peripheral, redesigning the unit to include a 6-button mechanism replacing the strum bar; the resulting unit was considered too expensive to manufacture and purchase. The developers had started from scratch to try to create new characters and venues that would be more reactive to the actual songs being played, to give the feel of a music video, but ultimately this proved too much of a challenge and had to be scrapped. Further, with a limited budget, the song selection was limited to [...] "low-budget" [...] hits of the 1990s, or at times reusing songs that had previously been included in Guitar Hero games. Though the team had a two-year development cycle, it was closed down after Activision president Eric Hirshberg had seen the current state of the project at the one-year point. Daniel Dilallo, a developer for Vicarious Visions at the time of cancellation, stated that he had come up with an idea of revitalizing the series using a first-person perspective approach, and had developed a prototype that he had called Guitar Hero Live at the time, though neither Activision nor FreeStyleGames have confirmed if this prototype was used as inspiration for the revived series.|$|E
