40|$|<b>Diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are highly}} {{reactive}} carbene precursors {{which can be}} used to generate molecular complexity rapidly. However, <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> are highly energetic and dangerous compounds and therefore, their use in large-scale applications remains rare. In this work, the use of continuous flow technology for the safe, efficient and scalable use of <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> is described. By using flow chemistry, <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> were safely generated within small diameter devices and directly used in subsequent reactions without a hazardous isolation of the diazo reagents. This thesis describes five new protocols for the use of <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds.</b> In the first project, ethyl diazoacetate (EDA) was generated safely in flow and used in subsequent aldol addition reactions to aldehydes with high yields (right). The preparation of the organometallic ethyl lithiodiazoacetate species in flow was achieved in the second project and used for the addition to ketones (left). Detailed kinetic and thermal studies on aryl diazoacetates were performed in the third project which yielded a new, multistep continuous flow protocol for the use of donor / acceptor carbenes. Rapid reaction optimisation was achieved using in-line infrared spectroscopy. Purification of the diazo species was performed in flow using in-line liquid / liquid extraction methodology. The fourth protocol entails the rapid assembly of complex lactone-cyclopropane structures of biological interest from <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> in a combination of flow and batch technologies (left).

40|$|<b>Diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> {{are useful}} {{synthetic}} intermediates in organic synthesis but, {{due to their}} toxicity and unpredictable explosive behaviour, their unique reactivity has not been fully exploited and their use on large scale has been avoided. We have developed a reliable method that generates <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> in situ. Our approach {{is based on the}} Bamford-Stevens reaction, which utilizes tosylhydrazone salts as diazo precursors. In the presence of phase-transfer-catalysts (PTC), we found that tosylhydrazone salts can be cleanly converted to <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> under mild reaction conditions and {{in a wide range of}} solvents. These <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> can then be induced to react directly with alkenes or alkynes to synthesize pyrazoles or with aldehydes to generate ketones. Alternatively, <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> can react with transition metals capable of carbene transfer reactions. We have shown the usefulness of this chemistry in a number of different transformations, such as Wittig olefination reactions and the sulfur ylide mediated epoxidation, as well as aziridination and cyclopropanation chemistry as applied toward the synthesis of more complicated molecules.

50|$|Diazo {{refers to}} a type of organic {{compound}} called <b>diazo</b> <b>compound</b> that has two linked nitrogen atoms (azo) as a terminal functional group. The general formula is R2C=N2. The simplest example of a <b>diazo</b> <b>compound</b> is diazomethane. The electronic structure of diazo compounds involves a positive charge on the central nitrogen and negative charge distributed between the terminal nitrogen and the carbon. Some of the most stable diazo compounds are α-diazo-ß-diketones and α-diazo-ß-diesters since the negative charge is delocalized into the carbonyls. In contrast, most alkyldiazo compounds are explosive. A commercially relevant <b>diazo</b> <b>compound</b> is ethyl diazoacetate (N2CHCOOEt). A group of isomeric compounds with only few similar properties are the diazirines, where the carbon and two nitrogens are linked as a ring.|$|E

The second chapter describes the coupling of flow-generated, semi-stabilised <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> with terminal alkynes for the synthesis of racemic di- and trisubstituted allenes, using copper(I) catalysis. The third chapter follows with an account of creating chiral disubstituted allenes by asymmetric coupling of flow-generated, semi-stabilised aryl aldehyde-derived <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> with terminal alkynes, using a copper(I) catalyst and a newly developed pyridine(bisimidazoline) ligand.

40|$|<b>Diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> {{have great}} {{synthetic}} potential as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. The formation of Rh(II) carbenoids from <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> allows the selective formation of C-C and C-heteroatom bonds {{and the introduction}} of functionality into organic molecules. The thermal stability of <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds,</b> however, varies and depends strongly on the substituents and <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> which are substituted by electron donating heteroatoms in α-position are known to decompose readily. They represent, however, a highly desirable class of <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> as to allow the introduction of additional functional groups into organic molecules for further transformations. The development of new methodology for the α-functionalization of <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> and introduction of new functionality into <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds</b> under mild conditions, that allows their application in catalytic carbenoid chemistry, is therefore highly desirable. In Chapter 2, {{the development of a new}} methodology for the one-pot in situ electrophilic halogenation of diazophosphonates will be presented. The halodiazophosphonates could for the first time be applied in catalytic cyclopropanations with olefins. The methodology avoids the handling of potentially toxic α-metalated diazophosphonates and adds as a new convenient protocol to the preparation of <b>diazo</b> <b>compounds.</b> Parts of this chapter are published in Paper I. A different and complementary approach to halodiazo compounds will be presented in Chapter 3. Based on α-aryliodonium diazo triflate salts, we developed three new alternative methods for the in situ nucleophilic halogenations of diazoesters, diazophosphonates and diazopiperidinylamides and the halodiazo compounds were successfully used in Rh(II) catalyzed cyclopropanations with styrene or thermal intramolecular C-H insertion. The work of this chapter is published in Paper II. Chapter 4 deals with computational calculations of the transition states for the nucleophilic substitutions of the α-aryliodonium diazoester triflate salt with bromide, dimethylsulfide and triethylamine and gives an insight into the mechanism for the nucleophilic substitution reactions. The calculations were performed by Martin Hennum. Parts of this work are published in Paper II.

Synthetic applications of the unexplored α-aryliodonium, α-dimethylsulfonium and α-triethylammonium diazo triflate salts will then be presented and discussed in Chapter 6 and a variety of interesting and unexpected reactivities of these compounds were discovered.
