5000|$|Routers forward {{traffic that}} enters on an <b>input</b> <b>interface</b> and leaves on an output interface, subject to {{filtering}} {{and other local}} rules. While routers usually forward from one physical (e.g., Ethernet, serial) to another physical interface, {{it is also possible}} to define multiple logical interfaces on a physical interface. A physical Ethernet interface, for example, can have logical interfaces in several virtual LANs defined by IEEE 802.1Q VLAN headers.|$|E
50|$|A {{forwarding}} information base (FIB), {{also known}} as a forwarding table or MAC table, is most commonly used in network bridging, routing, and similar functions to find the proper interface to which the <b>input</b> <b>interface</b> should forward a packet. It is a dynamic table that maps MAC addresses to ports. It is the essential mechanism that separates network switches from Ethernet hubs. Content-addressable memory (CAM) is typically used to efficiently implement the FIB, thus it is sometimes called a CAM table.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{the passage}} from the <b>input</b> <b>interface</b> {{directly}} to an output interface, through the fabric with minimum modification at the output interface, is called the fast path of the router. If the packet needs significant processing, such as segmentation or encryption, it may go onto a slower path, which is sometimes called the services plane of the router. Service planes can make forwarding or processing decisions based on higher-layer information, such as a Web URL contained in the packet payload.|$|E
50|$|Rayanchu and Barua provide another spin on this {{approach}} (called DERM). Their approach {{is similar in}} that they wish to use and encoded IP address of the <b>input</b> <b>interface</b> in the fragment id field of the packet. Where they differ from Belenky and Ansari is that they wish to encode the IP address as a 16-bit hash of that IP address. Initially they choose a known hashing function. They state {{that there would be}} some collisions if there were greater than 2^16 edge routers doing the marking.|$|E

50|$|Where {{commercial}} panels or controls do not exist, simulator builders {{will often}} {{create their own}} out of wood or similar easily worked materials. Another common route for sourcing the specific hardware needed in a simulator, and one used by the commercial sector as well, is to obtain a real component from a scrapyard and convert it for PC <b>input.</b> <b>Interface</b> hardware for these home-made controls is directly available from commercial suppliers, or {{can be obtained by}} dismantling cheap joysticks or similar components and rewiring them.
