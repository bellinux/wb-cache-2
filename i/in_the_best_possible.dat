The case was brought to court by the RSPCA and the two men were found guilty. The court's sentence was 200 hours community service. Later the same year another investigation by Hillside, at Cherrydene Farm in Bergh Apton, Norfolk (which produces for MFD Foods Ltd.) uncovered animal cruelty. The farm was a member of the animal welfare charity RSPCA-owned 'Freedom Food label'.

On West's direction and cinematographer Shelly Johnson, he said [...] "the action choreography never disappoints".
