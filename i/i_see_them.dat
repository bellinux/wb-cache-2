Adams remarked that she thoroughly enjoyed her work on the show. In an interview with Advocate.com, she said that The Office [...] "was the best work experience.

500|$|Dark Horse Comics {{approached}} {{creative director}} Neil Druckmann, {{who was working}} on The Last of Us, to produce a tie-in comic book series for the game. Druckmann was initially wary of the idea, but eventually agreed when he realized Dark Horse [...] "didn't {{want to do something}} tangential" [...] with the opportunity of expanding their characters and universe beyond the game. Work on the comic began during the game's development, which allowed the stories of the two projects to integrate, and influence each other. Druckmann requested webcomic artist Faith Erin Hicks as a collaborator on the project, after reading her comic Friends with Boys (2012) and appreciating [...] "how personal it felt". He also felt that Hicks could capture the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the game. Hicks then sent some concept art to Dark Horse as a pitch for the job; they accepted, and she became officially involved with the project. Hicks was drawn to the project after reading about the character of Ellie in the game's script; she considered Ellie an unusual character to include in a survival horror game, calling her a [...] "tough teenage girl who wasn't sexualized, and who seemed very much the equal of her male counterpart". Hicks was given access to various gameplay sequences and the game's script during development, to allow her to better understand the story. She was also given videos of the actors performing on set, which was helpful when illustrating the characters. [...] "I get a look at these characters and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> interacting as human beings, not just as concept art," [...] said Hicks.|$|E

[...] "It is kind of ironic {{that we are all}} still around," [...] Myers says. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> I speak and they speak. I think there is a level of mutual respect." [...] Connick, too, who served as district attorney until 2003, also was surprised it reached the nation's highest court. [...] "All of this free-speech foolishness was nonsense ... An employer should be able to fire an employee who fails to follow orders, plain and simple." ...|$|E

2500|$|The show's other {{prominent}} pairing, Nathan and Haley, {{emerged as a}} supercouple. James Lafferty, Nathan's portrayer, said, [...] "I think Nathan and Haley... Well Schwahn always says that he had that sort of as an 'ace in the hole' the entire time. As he was writing the pilot script, he was planning on doing that, he really didn't know how it would pan out or what would happen. But, the fans have responded so passionately towards it, and I'm not really sure why." [...] However, Lafferty has said {{that there is a}} genuine relationship between Nathan and Haley: [...] "It started as something sort of based on betrayal and deceit. It then kind of transgressed over into something based on actual true love. So, I think that it's a transition that the fans really bought into, and I think that people really enjoy to watch." [...] Schwahn called the couple [...] "gold" [...] and said, [...] "I love Nathan and Haley, and most of our audience does as well." [...] He explained that Nathan and Haley's fan base is strong because they have always been the most stable couple on the show, admitting that it confuses him when people ask when he is going to let them be happy. [...] "They have a lot of obstacles come their way," [...] said Schwahn, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> growing– especially with the jump [...] ahead and aging them a little bit– <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> growing into some really great places, not only as individuals, but as a family." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album brought {{widespread}} commercial success, selling 350,000 {{copies in}} the United States. It took the fifteenth {{place on the}} Billboard 200 Charts almost immediately.

Amy Doyle, then-MTV vice president, remarked that [...] "I see screaming girls in their future. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> having to wear disguises". Many stores stocked various Click Five-based items such as lunchboxes, backpacks, trading cards, and hair gel lines. The band spent late 2005 and early 2006 as the opening act for Ashlee Simpson, Alanis Morissette, the Backstreet Boys, and Jesse McCartney as well as touring both by itself and in collaboration with Big City Rock. They also performed at Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in November 2005, singing [...] "Catch Your Wave".|$|E
2500|$|Glover and Stanning {{retained}} their World {{title at}} the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Lac d'Aiguebelette, France, on 5 September. They won their heat in 7:04 minutes and qualified directly for the semi-final which they won in 07:06 minutes. They lead the final {{from the start}} and finished in 6:52.99, 2 seconds outside their own world record, defeating the New Zealand silver medalists, Grace Prendergast and Kerri Gowler, by 3.8 seconds. Multiple Olympic gold medalist Sir Steve Redgrave said [...] "Glover and Stanning dominate any combination that is put up against them.", whilst their coach Robin Williams said “The coach shouldn’t be that impressed I suppose, since <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> every day, but I’m just lost for words, quite stunning.”. Sir David Tanner, Britain’s rowing chief, declared it “one of the best GB performances of all-time … utterly exceptional,”.|$|E

2500|$|Van Gogh was {{extremely}} {{mindful of the}} impact of 19th-century industrialization on the changing landscape and what that meant to people's lives. [...] Van Gogh {{wrote in a letter to}} Anthon van Rappard: [...] "I remember as a boy seeing that heath and the little farms, the looms and the spinning wheels in exactly the same way as <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> now in Anton Mauve’s and Adam Frans van der Meulen’s drawings… But since then that part of Brabant with which I was acquainted has changed enormously in consequence of agricultural developments and the establishment of industries. [...] Speaking for myself, in certain spots I do not look without a little sadness on a new red-tiled tavern, remembering a loam cottage with a moss-covered thatched roof that used to be there. [...] Since then there have come beet-sugar factories, railways, agricultural developments of the heath, etc., which is infinitely less picturesque." ...|$|E
2500|$|Simple-minded, curious, mindlessly {{happy and}} perpetually innocent, the strip's title {{character}} drifts through life in Coconino County without a care. Krazy's dialogue {{is a highly}} stylized argot ("A fowl konspirissy – is it pussible?") phonetically evoking a mixture of English, French, Spanish, Yiddish and other dialects, often identified as George Herriman's own native New Orleans dialect, Yat. Often singing and dancing to express the Kat's eternal joy, Krazy is hopelessly in love with Ignatz and thinks that the mouse's brick-tossing is his way of returning that love. Krazy is also completely unaware of the bitter rivalry between Ignatz and [...] "Offissa" [...] Pupp and mistakes the dog's frequent imprisonment of the mouse for an innocent game of tag ("Ever times <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> two playing games togedda, Ignatz seems to be It"). On those occasions when Ignatz is caught before he can launch his brick, Krazy is left pining for the [...] "l'il ainjil" [...] and wonders where the beloved mouse has gone.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Anne Allman {{spoke about}} the shock of {{learning}} that her character Terry Marek was Rosie Larsen's killer: [...] "Veena Sud had called me a couple hours before I was going in to read for the table read for episode 13, the last episode, that I was the killer. When {{she gave me the}} news, I was upset, I started crying. I actually thought that while I was contemplating, 'What if I'm the killer?,' that I'd be excited but I started crying and started feeling bad for Terry. 'Oh man, this is a really tragic situation.'" [...] Allman also {{spoke about the}} point in the season when she began to wonder if Terry was the killer: [...] "I'm sure everybody on the cast was wondering if they were the killer or not at some point. But there was a scene that I alluded to some things that I had questioned whether or not I was the killer. It was the scene where [...] were playing with the trunk. I come down from the apartment and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in the garage locked in the trunk and I got really upset at Tommy. I remember [...] really wanting me to really shake Tommy and be very upset about this. I thought, why would I be that mad at him? It could've been, this is Terry not wanting the boys to mess around because it was how Rosie died or this is a flashback for her because she was involved." [...] This scene was in the Ogi Jun episode.|$|E

2500|$|Fang Xuanling {{had served}} Your Imperial Majesty {{for a long}} time. [...] He is careful, {{and all of his}} {{wonderful}} strategies and secret plans were not revealed to anyone. [...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope that you will not abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account of our marriage, not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope that you will not put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month. [...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm them in my death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting.

[...] It is not necessary to summon the sons and daughters back here; if <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> mourn and cry, I will only be saddened.|$|E
2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could go to him and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
