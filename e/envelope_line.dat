40|$|In fiber gas sensor systems, {{in order}} to improve the {{detection}} sensitivity, it is vitally necessary to make intensive efforts to restrain various noises of the system. Designing low-noise preamplifier and light driving circuit can effectively reduce the system noise, but cannot reduce the noise caused by the changes of optical path. This kind of noise is called background noise, which influences the measuring sensitivity of fiber gas sensor system. Therefore, how to filter the background noise affects the improvement of measurement accuracy. This paper puts forward a method based on least logarithm square method which can easily reduce the background noise of optical gas sensor system. By using reference grating and Fabry-Perot etalon, it can reconstruct the output spectra. A modified least square method is used to fit the envelope of gas absorption lines by using the data of absorption peaks on both sides. Dividing the gas absorption lines by the <b>envelope</b> <b>line</b> of absorption lines, the normalization of output is realized and thus the drift of the background noise curve due to the change of experimental environment can be reduced. This method can avoid data collection again when the background noise is drifting, and brings convenience to measurement...|$|E

40|$|The Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) {{has been}} used to propose a new method for {{filtering}} time series originating from nonlinear systems. The filtering method is based on fuzzy entropy and a new waveform. A new waveform is defined wherein Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) —which are obtained by CEEMDAN algorithm—are firstly sorted in ascending order (the sorted IMFs is symmetric about center point, because at any point, the mean value of the <b>envelope</b> <b>line</b> defined by the local maxima and the local minima is zero), and the energy of the sorted IMFs are calculated, respectively. Finally, the new waveform with axial symmetry can be obtained. The complexity of the new waveform can be quantified by fuzzy entropy. The relevant modes (noisy signal modes and useful signal modes) can be identified by the difference between the fuzzy entropy of the new waveform and the next adjacent new waveform. To evaluate the filter performance, CEEMDAN and sample entropy, Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) and fuzzy entropy, and EEMD and sample entropy were used to filter the synthesizing signals with various levels of input signal-to-noise ratio (SNRin). In particular, this approach is successful in filtering impact signal. The results of the filtering are evaluated by a de-trended fluctuation analysis (DFA) algorithm, revised mean square error (RMSE), and revised signal-to-noise ratio (RSNR), respectively. The filtering results of simulated and impact signal show that the filtering method based on CEEMDAN and fuzzy entropy outperforms other signal filtering methods...|$|E

Hexamers have been studied in planar and tubular arrays but the predicted pentamers have not been observed. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic analyses of two in vitro-assembled capsids of Rous sarcoma virus.

Fitting of atomic models of the two CA domains into the reconstructions shows three distinct inter-subunit interactions.

In the real projective plane, a point conic has the property that every line meets it in two points (which may coincide, or may be complex) and any set of points with this property is a point conic.
