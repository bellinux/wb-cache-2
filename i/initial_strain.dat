INTRODUCnON IT IS well-known that an inelastic stress problem can be approximately solved as a sequence of linear elastic problems. This method is based on Theorem I given in thl! Appendix. This theor�m allows to convert the elasticity problem with <b>initial</b> <b>strains</b> to an elasticity problem without <b>initial</b> <b>strains.</b> For volumetric strains this theorem was presented in 1838 by Duhamel, for deviatoric strains and isotropic material it wn. derived in 1 <) 3 ! by Reissner (see [1]). By different approaches it was later independently obtained by Eschelby (cf. [1]) and (for a generally anisotropic material) by Bldant [2 - 4]. First application of this theorem to creep (of the rate type) of plates is due to Lin [5, I] and Batant [3, 4]. In thes...|$|R

The lognormal distribution function is {{shown to be a}} good descriptor of the populations for 5 - 90 % of their range. Statistical models are presented for the lognormal behaviour of the crack-length distribution and for the strain dependence of the crack density. The models assume that a change {{in the value of the}} random variable of the respective population depends on the population value of the variable at the time of the change. It is shown that the model for the strain dependence of the crack density is suitable for the strain dependence of the acoustic emission, measured in both columnar-grain and granular ice subject to constant compressive loads. Evidence is also presented for a lognormal dependence of the dislocation density on strain. The analysis demonstrates that the cracks that form during the <b>initial</b> <b>straining</b> of polycrystalline ice are independent, random events and that the resulting crack populations are precursors to failure by fracture.
