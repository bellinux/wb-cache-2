40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction <b>of</b> <b>included</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> ERSM <b>threaded</b> parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact <b>of</b> the conjugated <b>thread</b> turns and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change <b>of</b> <b>included</b> <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>threaded</b> parts <b>of</b> the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which roller thread profile has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack <b>of</b> sharp <b>thread</b> turns on the screw, rollers and nut; <b>thread</b> turn <b>of</b> roller with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; <b>thread</b> turn <b>of</b> roller with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features. Concurrently, possible wear out <b>of</b> <b>threaded</b> surfaces <b>of</b> ERSM parts is taken into account. </p...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a <b>thread</b> turn section <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threaded</b> ORD components and change of the radius <b>of</b> roller <b>thread</b> turn section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the roller and screw threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the <b>thread</b> turn section <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> the <b>threaded</b> components was <b>of</b> 90 °, and the roller thread turn section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>threaded</b> ORD components and radius <b>of</b> roller <b>thread</b> turn section outline. </p...|$|R
