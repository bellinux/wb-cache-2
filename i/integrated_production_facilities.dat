Despite the position of the export oriented apparel industry which has become one of (he highest export earning sources to the country, the textile weaving industry passes a dire stage.

Although there is demand from export oriented garment manufacturers {{as well as from the}} domestic market, demand uncertainty hinders growth and new investments in the industry. Information collected from several small and medium scald manufacturers reveals failure to meet the product quality requirements, specifications and prices due to use of old and obsolete machinery which leads to low productivity, excessive waste generation in manufacturing and high cost of production, inconsistent tariff policies, untrained work force and financial constraints faced by the firms arc the major causes for the; evading situation.

Destroyed in 1999, the BZ Fill Facility filled munitions with the agent BZ, a hallucinogen. In 2003, NSCMP began demolition of the former Pine Bluff <b>Integrated</b> Binary <b>Production</b> <b>Facilities</b> (PB IBPF), designed to produce binary chemicals and fill binary chemical weapons. These weapons were designed to mix two non-lethal chemicals to form a chemical agent in flight to a target. The DF Production/M20 Canister Fill and Close Facility was the only facility operated. From 1988 to 1990 it produced the binary precursor methylphosphonic difluoride (DF), inserting the chemical into coffee can-sized M20 canisters for use in the M687 155 mm Binary Artillery Projectile. The BLU-80/B Bigeye Bomb Fill <b>Facility,</b> QL <b>Production</b> <b>Facility</b> and DC <b>Production</b> <b>Facility</b> never operated, and all were demolished. The final remaining PB IBPF building, intended to fill binary munitions for the Multiple Launch Rocket System, but never used for that purpose, was reutilized as the Pine Bluff Binary Destruction Facility (PB BDF), to neutralize the binary precursor chemicals DF and QL. After neutralization was completed in October 2006, demolition of the building commenced. Completed on Dec. 28, 2006, it marked the end of the PB IBPF demolition and the last former {{chemical warfare}} <b>production</b> <b>facility</b> destroyed in the United States. This accomplishment was significant since it enabled NSCMP to surpass the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) treaty milestone of demolition of all the nation’s former <b>production</b> <b>facilities</b> four months ahead of schedule.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{trend in}} subsea {{petroleum}} production systems in offshore field developments points towards <b>integrated</b> <b>production</b> and processing <b>facilities</b> at the seabed {{along with more}} extensive use of multiphase transportation technology. The SOFA (Subsea On-line multiphase Fluid sampling and Analysis) system designed by Christian Michelsen Research {{in cooperation with the}} University of Bergen is an autonomous metering station for permanent installation subsea. The SOFA carries out fluid analysis subsea, and the current method of transfer of fluid samples to surface by a remote operated vehicle is avoided. A laboratory prototype for capturing multiphase fluid samples in a dedicated measurement chamber/sample container has been built and tested. This is equipped with ultrasound sensors, a dual modality densitometer (DMD) gamma-ray system, pressure and temperature sensors, which together with conductivity, permittivity or similar measurements will be used as a multi-modality system for fluid characterisation. This paper presents experimental results for fluid sampling and characterisation based on multimodality. The focus is on detection and monitoring of water salinity, water density and oil density. In addition, perspectives for operational use are discussed. 1...|$|R
40|$|Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) was devised as a {{flexible}} forming {{process in the}} 1990 s. The basic principle of ISF is that a generic forming tool moves along a tool path and progressively forms a metal sheet into the desired shape. The tool is either moved using CNC machines or industrial robots. Applying CNC technology or robots to sheet metal forming allows for replacing expensive dedicated tooling and for a fast transfer from the CAD model to the formed part. Since its first applications in the 1990 s ISF has undergone tremendous developments. Various process variants such as double-sided ISF and hybrid process combinations such as heat-assisted ISF as well as stretch-forming and ISF have been put forward. The present contribution gives an overview of these developments with a special focus {{on the outcome of}} the research accomplished within the cluster of excellence “Integrative Production Technology for High Wage Countries”, where the development of fully <b>integrated</b> sheet metal <b>production</b> <b>facilities</b> is envisioned as the next evolution step of ISF.

40|$|Clostridium difficile and Clostridium {{perfringens}} {{are among}} the most commonagents of enteric disease in both humans and domestic animals. The former continues to increase in prevalence and diseases caused by the latter persist. Infection with a recently emergedhypervirulent strain (NAP 1 / 027 /III) of C. difficile is increasingly common andserious sequelae and fatalities are much more common in these patients. In neonatalpiglets, C. difficile infection (CDI) has become a common occurrence. Historically,isolation of C. perfringens type A from patients with enteric disease has been consideredinconsequential due to its presence in the normal intestine and to the mild nature ofdisease syndromes such as porcine enteritis. However, both CDI and type A diseasecause losses to the swine industry and pigs have been implicated as a possible source ofC. difficile for infection in humans. We investigated the epidemiology and pathogenesisof porcine CDI, and immunity against porcine CDI and type A enteritis. The occurrenceof CDI in <b>integrated</b> swine <b>production</b> <b>facilities</b> was most common in neonatal pigs. Infection in sows was rare, and finisher pigs were culture negative. All C. difficile strainswere ribotype 078.

Inoculation of anti-microbial-treatedadolescent pigs with NAP 1 / 027 /III did not cause disease. Ingra-gastric inoculation ofpigs with purified TcdA resulted in severe small intestine damage which isuncharacteristic of natural disease; effects of TcdB were minimal.
