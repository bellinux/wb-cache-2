40|$|In this article, the {{quantitative}} genetic aspects of <b>imprinted</b> genes and statistical properties of methods to detect <b>imprinted</b> QTL are studied. Different models to detect <b>imprinted</b> QTL and {{to distinguish between}} <b>imprinted</b> and Mendelian QTL were compared in a simulation study.

It was shown that <b>imprinted</b> QTL might remain undetected when analyzing the genome with Mendelian models only. Compared to testing against a Mendelian QTL, using the H 0 of an <b>imprinted</b> QTL gave a higher proportion of correctly identified <b>imprinted</b> QTL, but also gave a higher proportion of false inference of <b>imprinting</b> for Mendelian QTL.

40|$|<b>Imprinted</b> noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) are {{expressed}} mono-allelically in a parent-of-origin-dependent manner, which is mainly evident in mammals. Lying at a crossroad between <b>imprinted</b> genes and ncRNAs, <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs show distinct features. They {{are likely to}} function in nontraditional ways compared to non-imprinted ncRNAs, and are much more responsible for the mechanism of genomic <b>imprinting</b> compared to <b>imprinted</b> protein-coding genes. An increasing number of human diseases {{have been shown to}} be related to abnormalities in <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs. Due to their functional importance, many studies focusing on <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs have been published in recent years; however, there is no systematic collection or description of <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs and the rapidly growing knowledge is scattered in various places. Here, we describe a new database, ncRNAimprint, which serves as a comprehensive resource center for mammalian <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs. A catalog of <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs, including snoRNAs, microRNAs, piRNAs, siRNAs, antisense ncRNAs, and mRNA-like ncRNAs, was annotated in detail using information extracted from relevant literature and databases. Comprehensive collections of <b>imprinted</b> ncRNA-related diseases, <b>imprinting</b> control regions (ICRs), and <b>imprinted</b> regions were manually compiled to provide resources for current research focusing on <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs. Small RNA deep sequencing reads that fully matched within <b>imprinted</b> regions were also included to offer useful evidence in detecting novel <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs and to aid in analyzing expression patterns of known <b>imprinted</b> ncRNAs.

40|$|Parent-of-origin {{dependent}} {{gene expression}} associated with genomic <b>imprinting</b> {{is expected to}} result in the phenotypic signature of {{a difference between the}} average phenotypes of the reciprocal heterozygotes. Quantitative genetic mapping approaches have exploited this phenotypic manifestation to identify putatively <b>imprinted</b> loci affecting the expression of 'complex' traits. By focusing on the phenotypic consequences of <b>imprinting,</b> quantitative mapping techniques enable us to rapidly scan the genome for <b>imprinted</b> loci. Such genome-wide scans can be used to identify the array of pleiotropic effects of <b>imprinted</b> loci and to establish associated <b>imprinting</b> patterns including partial <b>imprinting</b> and more complex <b>imprinting</b> patterns, such as polar overdominance. Moreover, quantitative mapping makes no assumptions about underlying mechanisms of parent-of-origin-dependent effects and can thus help identifying alternative mechanisms causing <b>imprinted</b> expression. Thus, we suggest that phenotype-based mapping approaches can significantly advance our understanding of various aspects of genomic <b>imprinting,</b> especially when integrated with other molecular or bioinformatic approaches...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{completed}} genomic sequences of mouse and human {{we performed a}} comparative analyses of <b>imprinted</b> genes and gene clusters. For many <b>imprinted</b> genes we could detect <b>imprinted</b> as well as non-imprinted paralogues. The inter- and intrachromosomal similarities between paralogues and their linkage to <b>imprinting</b> clusters suggests that <b>imprinted</b> genes were dispersed throughout the genome by gene duplications as well as translocation and transposition events. Our findings indicate that <b>imprinting</b> clusters may have been linked together on one (or a few) ancestral pre-imprinted chromosome(s), arguing for a common mechanistic origin of <b>imprinting</b> control. <b>Imprinting</b> may originally have evolved on a simple basis of dosage compensation required for some duplicated genes (chromosomes) followed by selection of sex-biased expression control...|$|R

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} mechanism {{resulting in}} parental allele-specific gene expression. Defects in normal <b>imprinting</b> {{are found in}} cancer, assisted reproductive technologies, and several human syndromes. In mouse models, germline-derived DNA methylation is shown to regulate <b>imprinting.</b> Though <b>imprinting</b> is largely conserved between mammals, species- and tissue-specific domains of <b>imprinted</b> expression exist. Using the cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis) to assess primate-specific <b>imprinting,</b> we present a comprehensive view of tissue-specific <b>imprinted</b> expression and DNA methylation at established <b>imprinted</b> gene clusters. For example, like mouse and unlike human, macaque IGF 2 R is consistently <b>imprinted,</b> and the PLAGL 1, INPP 5 F transcript variant 2, and PEG 3 <b>imprinting</b> control regions are not methylated in the macaque germline but acquire this post-fertilization. Methylome data from human early embryos appear to support this finding. These suggest fundamental differences in <b>imprinting</b> control mechanisms between primate species and rodents at some <b>imprinted</b> domains, with implications for {{our understanding of the}} epigenetic programming process in humans and its influence on disease.

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} gene-marking {{process which}} allows {{a subset of}} mammalian genes to be monoallelically expressed in a parent-of-origin specific manner. The regulation of this <b>imprinted</b> gene expression involves DNA methylation and chromatin modifications, marking parental alleles differentially. <b>Imprints</b> are established in accordance to {{the sex of the}} parent in the germline, and are subsequently maintained throughout development and adult life, and are erased prior to establishment during germ cell development.

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} {{phenomenon that}} causes a differential expression of paternally and maternally inherited alleles of {{a subset of}} genes (the so-called <b>imprinted</b> genes). <b>Imprinted</b> genes are distributed throughout the genome and it is predicted that about 1 % of the human genes may be <b>imprinted.</b> It is recognized that the allelic expression of <b>imprinted</b> genes varies between tissues and developmental stages. The current study represents the first attempt to estimate a prevalence of <b>imprinted</b> genes within the total human transcriptome. In silico analysis of the normalized expression profiles of a comprehensive panel of 173 established and candidate human <b>imprinted</b> genes was performed, in 492 publicly available SAGE libraries.

40|$|In plants, {{a subset}} of genes exhibit <b>imprinting</b> in {{endosperm}} tissue such that expression is primarily from the maternal or paternal allele. <b>Imprinting</b> may arise {{as a consequence of}} mechanisms for silencing of transposons during reproduction, and in some cases <b>imprinted</b> expression of particular genes may provide a selective advantage such that it is conserved across species. Separate mechanisms for the origin of <b>imprinted</b> expression patterns and maintenance of these patterns may result in substantial variation in the targets of <b>imprinting</b> in different species. Here we present deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from reciprocal crosses of four diverse maize genotypes, providing a comprehensive analysis of <b>imprinting</b> in maize that allows evaluation of <b>imprinting</b> at more than 95 % of endosperm-expressed genes. We find that over 500 genes exhibit statistically significant parent-of-origin effects in maize endosperm tissue, but focused our analyses on {{a subset of}} these genes that had > 90 % expression from the maternal allele (69 genes) or from the paternal allele (108 genes) in at least one reciprocal cross. Over 10 % of <b>imprinted</b> genes show evidence of allelic variation for <b>imprinting.</b> A comparison of <b>imprinting</b> in maize and rice reveals that only 13 % of genes with syntenic orthologs in both species exhibit conserved <b>imprinting.</b> Genes that exhibit conserved <b>imprinting</b> in maize relative to rice have elevated dN/dS ratios compared to other <b>imprinted</b> genes, suggesting a history of more rapid evolution.

40|$|Genomic <b>imprinting</b> is an {{epigenetic}} {{mechanism that}} results in monoallelic expression of genes depending on parent-of-origin of the allele. Although the conservation of genomic <b>imprinting</b> among mammalian species has been widely reported for many genes, there is accumulating evidence that some genes escape this conservation. Most known <b>imprinted</b> genes {{have been identified in}} the mouse and human, with few <b>imprinted</b> genes reported in cattle. Comparative analysis of genomic <b>imprinting</b> across mammalian species would provide a powerful tool for elucidating the mechanisms regulating the unique expression of <b>imprinted</b> genes. In this study we analyzed the <b>imprinting</b> of 22 genes in human, mouse, and cattle and found that in only 11 was <b>imprinting</b> conserved across the three species. In addition, we analyzed the occurrence of the sequence elements CpG islands, C + G content, tandem repeats, and retrotransposable elements in <b>imprinted</b> and in nonimprinted (control) cattle genes. We found that <b>imprinted</b> genes have a higher G + C content and more CpG islands and tandem repeats. Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) were notably fewer in number in <b>imprinted</b> cattle genes compared to control genes, which is in agreement with previous reports for human and mouse <b>imprinted</b> regions. Long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) and long terminal repeats (LTRs) were found to be significantly underrepresented in <b>imprinted</b> genes compared to control genes, contrary to reports on human and mouse. Of considerable significance was the finding of highly conserved tandem repeats in nine of the genes <b>imprinted</b> in all three species...|$|R
40|$|Previous studies {{revealed}} that Igf 2 and Mpr/Igf 2 r are <b>imprinted</b> in eutherian mammals and marsupials {{but not in}} monotremes or birds. Igf 2 lies in a large <b>imprinted</b> cluster in eutherians, and its <b>imprinting</b> is regulated by long-range mechanisms. As a step {{to understand how the}} <b>imprinted</b> cluster evolved, we have determined a 490 -kb chicken sequence containing the orthologs of mammalian Ascl 2 /Mash 2, Ins 2 and Igf 2. We found that most of the genes in this region are conserved between chickens and mammals, maintaining the same transcriptional polarities and exon–intron structures. However, H 19, an <b>imprinted</b> noncoding transcript, was absent from the chicken sequence. Chicken ASCL 2 /CASH 4 and INS, the orthologs of the <b>imprinted</b> mammalian genes, showed biallelic expression, further supporting the notion that <b>imprinting</b> evolved after the divergence of mammals and birds. The H 19 <b>imprinting</b> center and many of the local regulatory elements identified in mammals were not found in chickens. Also, a large segment of tandem repeats and retroelements identified between the two <b>imprinted</b> subdomains in mice was not found in chickens. Our findings show that the <b>imprinted</b> genes were clustered before the emergence of <b>imprinting</b> and that the elements associated with <b>imprinting</b> probably evolved after the divergence of mammals and birds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: As a {{field of}} study, genomic <b>imprinting</b> has grown rapidly in the last 20 years, with a growing figure of around 100 <b>imprinted</b> genes known in the mouse and {{approximately}} 50 in the human. The <b>imprinted</b> expression of genes may be transient and highly tissue-specific, and there are potentially hundreds of other, as yet undiscovered, <b>imprinted</b> transcripts. The placenta is notable amongst mammalian organs for its high and prolific expression of <b>imprinted</b> genes. This review discusses {{the development of the}} human placenta and focuses on the function of <b>imprinting</b> in this organ. <b>Imprinting</b> is potentially a mechanism to balance parental resource allocation and it {{plays an important role in}} growth. The placenta, as the interface between mother and fetus, is central to prenatal growth control. The expression of genes subject to parental allelic expression bias has, over the years, been shown to be essential for the normal development and physiology of the placenta. In this review we also discuss the significance of genes that lack conservation of <b>imprinting</b> between mice and humans, genes whose <b>imprinted</b> expression is often placentalspecific. Finally, we illustrate the importance of <b>imprinting</b> in the postnatal human in terms of several human <b>imprinting</b> disorders, with consideration of the brain as a key organ for <b>imprinted</b> gene expression after birth...|$|R

40|$|SummaryThe {{mechanisms}} {{responsible for}} maintaining genomic methylation <b>imprints</b> in mouse embryos are not understood. We generated a knockout mouse in the Zfp 57 locus encoding a KRAB zinc finger protein. Loss {{of just the}} zygotic function of Zfp 57 causes partial neonatal lethality, whereas eliminating both the maternal and zygotic functions of Zfp 57 results in a highly penetrant embryonic lethality. In oocytes, absence of Zfp 57 results in failure to establish maternal methylation <b>imprints</b> at the Snrpn <b>imprinted</b> region. Intriguingly, methylation <b>imprints</b> are reacquired specifically at the maternally derived Snrpn <b>imprinted</b> region when the zygotic Zfp 57 is present in embryos. This suggests {{that there may be}} DNA methylation-independent memory for genomic <b>imprints.</b> Zfp 57 is also required for the postfertilization maintenance of maternal and paternal methylation <b>imprints</b> at multiple <b>imprinted</b> domains. The effects on genomic <b>imprinting</b> are consistent with the maternal-zygotic lethality of Zfp 57 mutants...|$|R
40|$|Normal plant {{development}} requires epigenetic {{regulation to}} enforce changes in developmental fate. Genomic <b>imprinting</b> {{is a type}} of epigenetic regulation in which identical alleles of genes are expressed in a parent-of-origin dependent manner. Deep sequencing of transcriptomes has identified hundreds of <b>imprinted</b> genes with scarce evidence for the developmental importance of individual <b>imprinted</b> loci. <b>Imprinting</b> is regulated through global DNA demethylation in the central cell prior to fertilization and directed repression of individual loci with the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC 2). There is significant evidence for transposable elements and repeat sequences near genes acting as cis-elements to determine <b>imprinting</b> status of a gene, implying that <b>imprinted</b> gene expression patterns may evolve randomly and at high frequency. Detailed genetic analysis of a few <b>imprinted</b> loci suggests an <b>imprinted</b> pattern of gene expression is often dispensable for seed development. Few genes show conserved <b>imprinted</b> expression within or between plant species. These data are not fully explained by current models for the evolution of <b>imprinting</b> in plant seeds. We suggest that <b>imprinting</b> may have evolved to provide a mechanism for rapid neofunctionalization of genes during seed development to increase phenotypic diversity of seeds...|$|R
40|$|Sexual <b>imprinting</b> is a {{specific}} form of learning, which was originally defined as {{the development of a}} cognitive model of sexual partner based on parental characteristics.
