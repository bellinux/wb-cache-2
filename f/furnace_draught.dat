60|$|To begin, then, with heavenly fire or sunshine. If God's gift {{of vital}} air is {{neglected}} and undervalued, His gift of sunshine {{appears to be}} hated. There are many houses where not a cent has been expended on ventilation, but where hundreds of dollars have been freely lavished {{to keep out the}} sunshine. The chamber, truly, is tight as a box; it has no fireplace, not even a ventilator opening into the stove-flue; but, oh, joy and gladness! it has outside blinds and inside folding-shutters, so that in the brightest of days we may create there a darkness that may be felt. To observe the generality of New England houses, a spectator might imagine they were planned for the torrid zone, where the great object is to keep out a <b>furnace</b> <b>draught</b> of burning air.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical {{forced draught}} is {{provided}} {{by means of a}} fan forcing air into the combustion chamber. Air is often passed through an air heater; which, as the name suggests, heats the air going into the furnace in order to increase the overall efficiency of the boiler. Dampers are used to control the quantity of air admitted to the <b>furnace.</b> Forced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> usually have a positive pressure.|$|R
50|$|Laborde built a {{complete}} industrial complex. Within 6 years, he had blast <b>furnaces</b> with waterwheel-powered <b>draught</b> producing cast iron, puddling mills producing wrought iron, a steeling plant producing spring steel, a glassworks, brickworks and cement-plant, a heavy foundry {{capable of producing}} 24-pound cannons, a musket factory, a gunpowder mill, a tower to make lead shot, and textile mills.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{mechanical}} induced draught. The first is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet oriented in the direction of flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall <b>draught</b> in the <b>furnace.</b> This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The second method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which removes flue gases from the furnace and forces the exhaust gas up the stack. Almost all induced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> operate with a slightly negative pressure.|$|R
5000|$|Induced draught: This is {{obtained}} {{one of three}} ways, the first being the [...] "stack effect" [...] of a heated chimney, in which the flue gas is less dense than the ambient air surrounding the boiler. The denser column of ambient air forces combustion air into and through the boiler. The second method is through use of a steam jet. The steam jet or ejector oriented {{in the direction of}} flue gas flow induces flue gases into the stack and allows for a greater flue gas velocity increasing the overall <b>draught</b> in the <b>furnace.</b> This method was common on steam driven locomotives which could not have tall chimneys. The third method is by simply using an induced draught fan (ID fan) which sucks flue gases out of the furnace and up the stack. Almost all induced <b>draught</b> <b>furnaces</b> have a negative pressure.|$|R
50|$|And from March 2008 {{the firing}} of her boiler became more {{environmentally}} friendly. From her launch in 1859 she had been coal fired, but she now uses Blazer Logs, commercially produced blocks made from compressed sawdust. These burn more efficiently, giving off little smoke with negligible sulphur content and are carbon neutral. The cylinders exhaust to atmosphere after first passing through a silencer. The draught induced by the steam is used to draw the heat and waste products of combustion through the boiler and up the funnel, and so draw more air into the <b>furnace,</b> a force <b>draught</b> system. Now that the ship is using a different fuel to fire the boiler, however, a flue damper has also been fitted to produce a finer tolerance of control in the firebox. This uses less fuel to produce more steam, and hence delivers much greater economy.|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} elucidated the {{following}} relations at steady state from the experiments, in which fuei oil contained in cruicible {{was put into}} a constant temperature <b>furnace</b> of natural <b>draught.</b> 　(1) The evaporation velocity v of water is constant. 　(2) v of motor gasoline is constant at the initial term, since becomes small gradually　(3) As v of light diesel oil is not constant from the start, the author derived the rate of linear evaporation y =kt and obtained the empirical equation of k at the initial term. Where t {{is a time of}} evaporation, k is a evaporation velocity coefficient. 　(4) Derived that the relationship of rate of evaporation q = k 2 ̆ 7 log t consisted after the initial term of stationary evaporation except the pure liquid k 2 ̆ 7 is constant with the same furnace temperature without regard to the initiai weights of oil k 2 ̆ 7 is a evaporation velocity coefficient...|$|R
5000|$|In 1854 Howden {{launched}} {{himself as}} a consultant engineer and designer, his first major invention being a rivet-making machine. The selling of the patent rights to a company in Birmingham for this secured him financially and James Howden & Co. was established as a manufacturer of marine equipment. In 1857 Howden began work on the design and supply of boilers and steam engines for the marine industry; his first contract was with Hendersons to supply the Anchor Liner Ailsa Craig with a compound steam engine and water boilers, using steam at 100 lb pressure. That same year, together with Alexander Morton of Glasgow, he was awarded a patent for the [...] "invention of improvements in obtaining motive power." [...] On 28 February 1859 he applied for a patent for the [...] "improvements in machinery, or apparatus for cutting, shaping, punching, and compressing metals." [...] In 1860 he patented a method of preheating combustion air; his patent was granted for the invention of [...] "improvements in steam engines and boilers, and in the apparatus connected therewith". In 1862 he decided to construct main boilers and engines to his own design and started manufacturing in his first factory on Scotland Street in Glasgow's Tradeston district. A breakthrough came in 1863 when he introduced a <b>furnace</b> mechanical <b>draught</b> system which used a steam turbine driven axial flow fan.Howden is chiefly remembered as {{the inventor of the}} Howden forced draught system, which forced heated waste gases into the combustion chamber by means of a fan and ductwork and which appeared in the 1880s. This system dramatically reduced the amount of coal used in ships' boilers. Howden patented this device in 1882 as the 'Howden System of Forced Draught' and during the 1880s more than 1000 boilers were converted to this specification or constructed to Howden's patent. The first vessel to use the system was the New York City, built in 1885. Amongst the liners to use the Howden system in their boilers were the Lusitania and Mauretania, the fastest liners in the world when they were built.|$|R
