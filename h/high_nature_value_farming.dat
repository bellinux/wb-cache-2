40|$|The rural {{development}} policy community is calling for new transdisciplinary approaches to convey meaningful measures (e. g. indicator sets, indices) for assessing <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> <b>farming</b> systems at different spatial scales (IEEP, 2009). At broader spatial scales there has been huge efforts for example by IRENA (Indicator Reporting on the Integration of Environmental Concerns into Agriculture Policy) in developing a set of agri-environmental indicators at the European scale (Paracchini et al., 2010). Another European scale initiative was the <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> <b>farming</b> project which worked on developing <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Farming</b> area indicators. In parallel, there is a rich literature reporting local case study data on <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> <b>farming</b> systems throughout Europe. Nevertheless, transforming the local case study data on a local level indicator set is yet far from being accomplished. Furthermore, is still missing cross scale work on integrating European and local scale <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> <b>farming</b> indicators. Land cover patterns, being dynamic landscape components, are essential features in High nature value systems. Thus, one promising avenue for devising indicators that bridge the agri-environmental and social spheres at different scales of analysis is that of land cover (vegetation structures such as grass, glades and forests) (Wiggering et al., 2006). However, landscape structure and composition will alter with changes in scale, and also across regions throughout Europe, and land cover patterns will also shift accordingly. Therefore, {{it is likely that}} the metrics/indexes framed at the European scale will not be transferable across scales in a straightforward way. There is thus the need to explore what are the set of indicators(including but not exclusively land cover) that can be framed in a comprehensive methodological approach for upscaling and downscaling HNV farming indicators (EEA, 2010). This paper particularly focuses on methodological issues in the light of the state of the art methodological approaches. It finishes by pointing out the challenges ahead for progressing on the development of multi scale indicators for gauging High Nature farming systems in Europ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstract The term <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> (HNV) <b>farming,</b> {{acknowledges}} that the conservation of {{a large proportion of}} European biodiversity and important semi-natural habitats are dependent on low-input, mainly extensive farming practices. HNV has become a focus for nature conservation and countryside management in Europe. This paper critically analyses the drivers of change and the challenges facing two European HNV upland pastoralist systems, one in the French Atlantic Pyrenees and the other in the Irish uplands. The detailed case studies highlight the traditional linkages between the landscape, grazing management, locally adapted animal breeds and social capital, all of which are currently under threat from globalised markets and policy orientation. The research findings indicate that the European multifunctional model of agriculture and its support for farm diversification including the provision of environmental goods and services has not been successful in targeting and rewarding HNV systems. In the search for economic viability (and social acceptance) many are left with the stark choice of intensification or abandonment; ultimately meeting neither market demands nor ecosystem services. We conclude with a recommendation for more targeted, evidence based support for HNV farmland, along with better integration in the wider rural economy, if these farming practices are to survive into the future and if the EU is to meet its 2020 biodiversity targets...|$|R

This condition, extended to other policies in the areas of natural interest,risks to question the innovative model of preservation of the biodiversity puts forward in the disciplinary sphere of the Landscape Ecology with the ecological networks, promoting the traditional “insular” model of preservationof the protected areas (parks and reserves) which in time has shown tobe inadequate to grant very good levels of preservation of the biodiversity.

40|$|PresentationThe Iberian working oak {{woodlands}} (dehesas and montados) are outstanding <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> (HNV) <b>farming</b> {{systems in}} a European context. However, management practices applied {{are not always}} appropriate to maintain their sustainability. Ensuring tree regeneration, soil protection, and landscape mosaics are essential for their long-term conservation. Policy measures should bear this in mind and consider these priorities in an integrated way. The main decisions are now made at national level, in the Portuguese case, and at the regional level, in the Spanish. There should therefore be room for specific schemes considering the specific land use systems in each country/region. Rural Development Program gives priority to the HNV farming systems, especially within the so-called agri-environmental measures, but these measures will only work if supported by pro-active and expert advisory systems. Current efforts to address these needs in a transnational network through co-operation projects between both countries are presented and discussed. The recent elaboration of the Green Book on Dehesas and Montados (a concise report supported by most associations of land-managers and producers) {{is an opportunity for}} those who have knowledge on the functioning of this system to work together, to gather existing expertise, to assess opportunities and to propose actions that can be implemented through policies.

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> (HNV) <b>farming</b> {{systems are}} {{inherently}} valuable for biodiversity. They use semi-natural pastures, meadows and orchards, {{as well as}} species-rich arable land, and often retain a wealth of landscape features. HNV farming is present in all European countries, with a diversity of types and extent. Apart from being the cornerstone of European farmland biodiversity, these types of farming provide a multitude of other services for society, including sustainable rural economies, and the rich social fabric and character of Europe’s landscapes. The environmental, socio-cultural and territorial significance of HNV farming is increasingly recognised, but greater awareness is needed amongst policy makers and the wider public. This chapter on Portugal {{is part of a}} book presenting an overview of HNV farming across 35 European countries, describing the main characteristics and presenting examples of farming systems, farms and farmers. Beside the country chapters there are thematic chapters looking at a range of issues of farming, nature, economy and policy. In Portugal exists an immensely rich heritage of traditional farming systems, almost all of which are still of <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value.</b> Some of these use large-scale semi-natural areas – the baldios and lameiros of the north and the montado in the south. Others are characterised by low-intensity mosaics – small-scale permanent cropping farms in the south and especially the typical smallholdings of the northern uplands. Both the area of farmland and the number of farmers have declined steeply over recent years; all HNV farmland associated with small farms are in practice severely threatened. On the southern latifundia, the picture is more complex – cork prices maintain a relatively good income, but the quality of management of many montados is in decline, with both localised intensification and abandonment. New intensive systems are being put in place, included irrigated low <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> olive monocultures. A territorial vision for Portugal’s agricultural landscapes is only in its infancy; this is a severe impediment to the development of holistic and targeted support for HNV farming systems. Economic marginalisation has allowed the survival of Portuguese HNV farming systems into the early 21 st century; a socio-economically and ecologically sustainable future for those systems or their modern successors requires an end to their political marginalisation...|$|R
40|$|The {{support scheme}} for farming in less-favoured areas, {{established}} by the European Union in 1975, marked {{a major change in}} the nature of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) by introducing for the first time regional categories. It also represented the initiation of direct annual payments to farmers, an approach which was to expand greatly in the 1990 s and thereafter. Over a long period it had remained the only significant structural measure of agricultural policy with a territorial dimension. Only recent policy reforms changed this situation: commodity market support was gradually decreased and, on the other hand, the environmental implications of policy measures were increasingly emphasised. Discussions on the interrelations of the Less-Favoured Areas (LFA) scheme with Agri-Environmental Measures (AEM) and other elements of the Rural Development Programmes (RDP) have been intensified as the political and financial weight of the programmes gained in importance. This paper focuses on the objectives and relevance of the LFA support scheme, its application in the EU and the main elements of the debate for the redefinition of LFA support. From the very beginning, LFA policy was conceived as a structural policy aimed at the prevention of land abandonment, to preserve the farming population in these areas and maintain cultural landscapes. In this regard, the instrument was one of the first measures to address environmentally beneficial farming systems, and thus reveals high coincidence with <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> (HNV) <b>farming</b> systems. The three types of LFA, mountain areas, other LFAs and areas affected by specific handicaps take account of the range of geographical differences in the production difficulties of EU agriculture. The increased focus on environmental aims resulted in a discussion of the ‘intermediate’ areas, the category of other LFAs. It has been proposed that the socio-economic criterion in determining these areas should be dropped, but the aim to maintain land management in marginal areas would be kept. Meanwhile, the decision on the redefinition of the LFAs has been postponed (to 2010). Nevertheless the issue will keep a central role in policy discussions of the future Rural Development Programmes. ...|$|R

40|$|The Portuguese montado, an agro-silvo {{pastoral}} system {{derived from}} the Mediterranean forest ecosystems, is broadly considered a <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Farming</b> System (HNV). These semi-natural systems significantly depend on the agricultural management. Consequently, its natural value and environmental qualities {{are closely related to}} the different farming practices adopted by land managers. Within these, grazing has a particular relevance since extensive livestock production is currently {{one of the most important}} economic activities associated with these systems, presenting a pronounced variability, both in terms of intensity and variety of animal species and breeds. In the region of Alentejo, Southern Portugal, there are several types of montado in different natural conditions (soils, climate, and topography) and managed, currently and over time, in very distinct ways. The high variability underlying these systems, both in biophysical and management contexts, can result in an impact of completely different levels on the sustainability of the system and consequently, on its natural values. Using birds as models for assessing the levels of biodiversity and starting from the research question: How to differentiate between a montado with and without HNV? In this paper we intend to present an innovative interdisciplinary methodology built up to assess the relationship between grazing management and biodiversity values, in a case study - a specific type of montado. Considering the complexity and fuzziness of these Mediterranean systems, defining a grazing management compatible with the existence of a high biodiversity value, poses a great challenge which requires the integration of different scientific perspectives and cross disciplines. However, the greatest difficulty in implementing this new approach probably lies in adopting the methodologies arising from these distinct fields of knowledge in a coherent manner...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{analyzes}} {{the sustainability of}} beef cattle systems of the Spanish Rangelands known as “Dehesas”. These are traditional systems of the Iberian Peninsula where native herbaceous vegetation and evergreen species of Quercus {{provide the basis for}} extensive livestock farms. These systems are considered as outstanding <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> (HNV) <b>farming</b> systems and the most extensive agroforestry systems in Europe according to CORINE Land Cover. Beef farms in this area show low stocking rates and a small dependence on foodstuff purchases. However, certain changes have occurred in the last decadesdue to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). On the one hand, some farms have become more intensified, as a way to maximize the revenues from the CAP subsidies. On the other hand, many farms have turned to organic production, trying to take advantage both of new subsidies and of new market trends. In this regard, the organic livestock farming model is gaining weight as an option for sustainable production since, according to various authors, these systems have advantages over conventional and intensive systems. In fact, organic production in the area has increased substantially in recent years due to several factors, such as the growing interest of the EU towards preserving sensitive ecosystems, the potential role of organic production in the development of rural areas and the growing consumers’ demand for safer and higher quality foods produced under ethical and environmental standards. In this study, we carried out a comparative assessment of the sustainability of different conventional and organic beef production systems located in dehesa rangelands. The systems analyzed were classified as follows. (i) non-organic farms (Conventional); (ii) organic farms that sold calves at weaning age as conventional ones (Organic 1); (iii) organic farms that fattened and sold their calves as organic (Organic 2).

Tourism has {{emerged as one of the}} main drivers of change and contributors for a sustainable exploitation of local resources. Rural tourism (RT) can foster the enhancement of the territorial capital (TC), the preservation of public goods (PGs) and the promotion of a more environmental oriented livelihood. The research focuses on a case study area, two valleys from Maramureş, where environmental approaches as diversification strategies are partially explored. The work investigates the role of tourism initiatives for the promotion of green oriented practices. The first part of the work is based on a literature review and interdisciplinary analysis of secondary data to identify the key issues: from rural development policy, to the concept of TC, of PGs and RT. The Romanian development programmes and related strategies are investigated; afterwards the characteristics of the County and the role of RT as diversification and valorisation policies is considered. The second part is based on the collection of primary data through interviews to different local stakeholders (farmers owners of rural guesthouses, local administrators, networks and artisans). The main frequencies are analyzed, a cluster analysis is computed to evaluate the similarities within the most representative groups and a comparative analysis is carried out between the two Valleys. The frame of the analysis is based on a set of indicators following the dimensions of the TC, to assess the characteristics of the local stakeholders and to outline the perception about the local PGs and on the adopted strategies to manage the territory. Final considerations are elaborated and few scenarios are outlined, giving relevance to the importance of improving awareness and creating embeddedness among public-private local stakeholders and resources as a tool for a socio-economic and environmental development of the area. ...|$|E

Although the main aim {{of the project was}} to build the capacity of civil society organizations in the Republic of Macedonia on the importance of HNV farming, it also has involved carrying out case studies on the occurrence of and issues facing HNV farming systems in three different regions in the country - Lacavica, Mariovo and Rekanski. The main findings of the case studies have been presented to the farmers and responsible institutions and are also presented in this handbook. The publication is intended to serve different stakeholders in the agricultural and rural development sector including policy and decision makers, regional authorities and services, non-governmental and scientific organizations addressing social, environmental and agricultural issues and the inter-linkages between them. The book is therefore produced in both the Macedonian and English language and {{can be used as a}} reference for future programming in the rural development sector in the country. Chapter 1 of the publication examines the impact of current agricultural practices on the environment in the country. Chapter 2 then outlines the concept of HNV farming in the EU and its development over the time. A first attempt to develop a typology of HNV farming systems in the Republic of Macedonia and the case study areas, along with indicative maps of their distribution are found in Chapter 3. The needs of the HNV farmers and the main problems they face, as identified through the workshops, discussions and face to face meetings with them are presented in Chapter 4 and the link between HNV farming and social capital is further elaborated in Chapter 5. The hidden values of HNV farming systems are also presented in Chapter 6. In order make the project results as useful as possible, proposals for agri-environmental type measures that could support HNV farming in the Republic of Macedonia were developed. The measures proposed are intended to complement the existing proposal for the NAEP of the Republic of Macedonia and to respond to the needs of the farmers in rural areas as a whole, and the case studies areas in particular. These proposals are presented in Chapter 5. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{processes}} of change in European rural landscapes. Landscapes have evolved over millennia {{as a result of}} human influence on the physical environment. Europe has a wide variety of landscapes that can alter within a relatively short distance, and which often form part of the national cultural identity of a European country. Central to this thesis, however, are insights into {{the processes of}} landscape change. In this context, the overall objective of this thesis is: To assess the dynamics of landscape change and increase the scientific understanding of the underlying processes and policies that have shaped the rural landscapes of Europe after establishment of the EU. The focus is on the period following the establishment of the European Economic Community  in 1965, which is hypothesised as the main driver of landscape change. European policies have an important direct impact on national and regional policies. The way that European policy transposition took place,  existing governance structures and policy cultures also defined  how ‘European policy’ influenced countries and regions. The object of this study is in particular the changing rural landscape, including the role of European agricultural policies, such as the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and conservation policies (for example Natura 2000) in these changes. The thesis uses an integrated approach to assess the various processes of landscape change: land use transitions, urbanisation of the countryside, land use intensification, extensification or abandonment. These processes are linked to drivers of landscape changes, the role of policies, and how these affect the landscape processes. Research questions The research objective requires unravelling the correlations between land-related policies and landscape change in the EU, the drivers of landscape change and in particular how policies affect the European landscape. To operationalise this objective, the following research questions are addressed: What are the major landscape change processes occurring in different regions of Europe? What are the drivers of landscape change in different regions of Europe, and {{what is the role of}} EU-policies in particular? How do landscape changes affect the provision of landscape services? How does the implementation of conservation policies affect processes of landscape change? Which effective strategies and future pathways can be followed to conserve valuable cultural landscapes? The thesis consists of an introductory chapter, five chapters each addressing one of the research questions, and a concluding synthesis: putting the findings together and indicating their potential significance for research and policy. The first chapter introduces the theoretical framework, which focusses on the benefits (goods and services) that landscapes provide, satisfying human demands directly or indirectly. The framework recognises the institutions, the policies (indirect drivers), as well as natural and anthropogenic drivers of landscape change. The five central chapters have each been submitted to international peer reviewed scientific journals, three of which have been accepted, and one has been revised and resubmitted. Research question Q 1, ‘What are major landscape changes occurring in different regions of Europe?’ is addressed by interviewing 437 farmers in six selected study areas in Denmark, the Netherlands, Austria, Greece and Romania (Chapter 2). The aim of this survey was to acquire a better understanding of farmer’s decision making, the environmental conditions and the landscape change processes taking place. The focus is on intensification and extensification processes in the case-study areas and regional similarities and differences. A statistical analysis of land use intensity was carried out on the basis of the interviews. Research question Q 2, ‘What are the drivers of landscape change in different regions of Europe, and what particularly are the role of EU-policies?’, discusses the factors and drivers of change in a meta-study of six countries (Chapter 3). This study is based on stakeholder’s interpretations of change processes, using Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping. Groups of landscape experts participated in five workshops to jointly construct a cognitive map of landscape change processes over the past 25 years. The study examines in particular the storylines of the processes of landscape change. Two cases of Mediterranean and Boreal landscapes, are detailed. Question Q 3, ‘How do landscape changes affect the provision of landscape services?’ is addressed in Chapter 4, and discusses five European case studies with regard to changes in landscape services. The analysis is based on observed landscape changes by comparing maps for periods of up to 25 years. The changes were interpreted in terms of the consequences for landscape services, and related to European policies of landscape change. Question Q 4 : ‘How does the implementation of conservation policies affect processes of landscape change?’ is discussed in Chapter 5 through focus on landscape governance. The transposition of European policy is assessed using the case of the Habitats Directive in four countries: Denmark, Greece, The Netherlands and Romania. It is assessed how legislation is locally translated and how this ‘fits’ the national governance system. The last Question, Q 5 : ‘Which effective strategies and future pathways can be followed to conserve valuable cultural landscapes?’ is addressed in Chapter 6 on Mediterranean landscape change. Two ‘iconic’ Greek and Italian cultural olive yard landscapes were compared. Both landscapes have a centuries-old farming system. Long-term data sets on landscape change (exceeding 100 years) were combined with map data, interviews and literature, to discuss the characteristics of cultural landscape management, opportunities and potential risks for the future of these cultural landscapes. The final chapter, Chapter 7, reflects on the results and presents the conclusions of the previous chapters, and on the scientific and societal significance of the thesis as a whole.  It is concluded that the landscape in Europe is permanently changing as a result of complex interacting drivers. Policy has been one of the important drivers, but the landscape changes that have taken place are the outcome of various economic drivers and policies. The paradox is that the intentions of different European and regional spatial policies have been ambitious with regard to rural development, environmental quality, conservation of natural habitats and cultural heritage. In the end however, the complex interactions among direct and indirect drivers led to unintentional changes negatively affecting landscape value, resulting in land degradation, loss of cultural values and biodiversity. In other words, dominant drivers of landscape change (global economy, European policies) resulted in an outcome of landscapes that are preferred by the majority of the agricultural and forest sector, but otherwise no specific stakeholders were targeted, an outcome which was not envisaged by the policies. Without efficient allocation of land resources and failing to regulate sustainable use, the landscape services are declining One approach to meet the diverse demands for landscape services is to focus on the provision of multiple benefits, using a multifunctional land use approach. The assumption thereby is that a multifunctional landscape has all aspects of a sustainable, liveable and biodiverse landscape. The case studies landscapes in this thesis are characterised by different approaches that differ in multifunctionality: the marginal areas in southern Europe are less embedded in the global economy, and demonstrate high multifunctionality. Denmark and The Netherlands show typical ‘lowland agriculture’, that are weakly multifunctional. The Eastern European landscape cases in Romania and Estonia have higher multifunctionality, but the opportunities for change towards multifunctionality are less than in Western Europe. The opportunities are mostly dictated by environmental conditions, in particular the marginality of land, and the economy. Farming in these regions may have been profitable in the past, but abandonment is looming if no measures are taken to counteract economic driving forces. The cultural landscapes such as in Lesvos and Portofino are particularly highly multifunctional. These old social systems are in decline: landscapes have deteriorated and changed since they have not been well maintained. The discontinuance of traditional management has occurred due to ageing populations, a lack of labour, skills and high costs.  If iconic cultural landscapes are to be preserved for the future, deterioration must be halted. Traditional knowledge, skills and techniques are key for maintaining valuable cultural landscapes, such as in Italy and Greece, but also cultural landscapes in Western Europe like England or France, or traditional landscapes in Hungary or Poland.  Solutions must be found to preserve the knowledge and traditions of landscape management, but also funds and labour are required to maintain these landscapes. European landscapes have been permanently changing as a result of complex interacting drivers. Policy is one of the important drivers, but the landscape changes that take place are not the outcome of ‘a’ policy which steers the landscape development, but as the outcome of globalisation, economic drivers and policies; mostly the CAP, Rural Development Plan (RDP) and national forest policies which affect to a large measure the landscapes. There is no European policy for landscapes: landscape is not a prerogative of the EU. Therefore, a tailor-made approach is essential for European policies implemented in each member state, taking into account the structure and functioning of existing national institutions, without losing sight of the overall aims of  the policy. This requires input from the recipient countries in designing regulations, adapting them to existent institutions and modifying historical and current practices. Holmes’ framework for changing modes of occupancy (use of rural space) has been used, whereby landscape transitions are considered the result of a changing balance between societal consumption, conservation and production. Landscapes where (agricultural or forestry) production is less dominant, may allow for more multifunctional policies that counterbalance the dominant position of production. Most countries do not have policies that fill the ‘gap’ of multifunctional landscape management. Gaps exist for  landscapes not subject to Natura 2000, <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> <b>farming</b> areas, outside urban zones, locations not affected by the Water Framework Directive or national forest policies, or those insufficiently covered at present by effective planning for multifunctional land use. Existing (sectoral) schemes need to be re-examined with respect to multifunctionality. Potential multifunctional impacts should be considered in policymaking,  e. g. payment schemes in the CAP or in Natura 2000, and about appropriate target areas for measures. Making more funds from CAP and RDP available for multifunctional land use could lead to more land sharing. Landscapes, particularly iconic cultural landscapes, can benefit from mechanisms that allow the costs incurred by lower agricultural production to be covered. Payments for regulating and cultural services could be integrated in funding programs, e. g. through better targeting of Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) at smaller farmers in these valuable landscapes. Funding schemes should ensure that small, multifunctional farmers particularly in need support benefit. Better use must also be made of the added value potential of multifunctional effects. Increased multifunctionality would benefit the attractiveness of the countryside for residence, recreation and tourism. Countries implement policies differently, but key success factors for multifunctional landscapes are the existence of locally- appropriate institutions that implement multifunctional policies. Building of new institutions can be time consuming and requires staff development. Policy instruments on their own may be insufficient to harmonise the different aims of multifunctionality. Despite the AES, biodiversity and landscape quality is declining. The domination of some functions requires interventions and choices about trade-offs to be made (Arts et al. 2017). Given the dominant power of globalisation and European markets, payment for landscape services alone is ineffective, requiring additional incentives for the valorisation of these services, and to stimulate multifunctionality. Regional integrative approaches could be supported, with positive examples provided in the cases of  alternative funding schemes, and how obstructions for such experiments can be tackled. Finally, stakeholder involvement in landscape governance appears promising as a way to better meet the socio-ecological context  within a landscape, provided that stakeholders address different scale levels. This requires a dynamic process to mobilise stakeholders, and flexibility of the government towards negotiations and conflict management at the landscape level. In particular, these last issues can be decisive for successful landscape governance. Different landscape governance arrangements are currently being tested in Europe which demonstrate new avenues. Notwithstanding some successful stakeholder involvement in landscape management, there are also challenges: in all such processes, there is a risk that collaboration results in power inequalities that affect the outcome, or may give certain groups more benefits than others, which may make the process unsustainable. It remains, therefore, important that the concept of multifunctional landscapes is integrated in existing legislation and regulations, and further integrated into land-related policies...|$|E

40|$|Europe's {{agricultural}} landscapes provide highly varied {{living conditions}} for many plants and animals. Baldock et al. (1993) and Beaufoy et al. (1994) described the general characteristics of low-input farming systems {{in terms of}} biodiversity and management practices and introduced the term <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland. Typical <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland areas are the extensively grazed uplands in the UK, alpine meadows and pasture, steppic areas in eastern and southern Europe and dehesas and montados in Spain and Portugal. The more intensively farmed areas in lowland western Europe can also host concentrations of species of particular conservation interest, such as migratory waterfowl. The need for measures to prevent the loss of <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland is widely acknowledged. Conservation of biodiversity on agricultural land is an explicit objective of the pan-European Biodiversity and Landscape Strategy, the Bern Convention, the European Landscape Convention, and, at EU level, the Habitats and Birds Directives and the Rural Development Policy (Community Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development Programming Period 2007 - 2013). In their 6 th Environment Action Programme, the EU committed itself to halting biodiversity decline by 2010. Conserving <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland is key to achieving this 2010 biodiversity target. Pan-European data on distribution and conservation status of HNV farmland, however, were largely lacking. In their 2003 "Kyiv" declaration, the European Environment Ministers have therefore set the goal to fill this data gap and take adequate conservation measures. In support of this policy process, EEA and UNEP published a Joint Message (EEA 2004), presenting a preliminary map of HNV farmland and analysing the targeting of agricultural policy instruments. The Joint Message used the concept as developed by Andersen et al. (2003) that describes HNV farmland as: "Those areas in Europe where agriculture is a major (usually the dominant) land use and where that agriculture supports, or is associated with, either a high species and habitat diversity or the presence of species of European conservation concern, or both". The aim of estimating HNV farmland distribution at European level according to a standardised method is primarily to gain insight in the current status, as well as enabling analysis of European trends and targeting of relevant policy instruments, such as Less Favoured Area (LFA) support. In order to increase accuracy, JRC and the EEA have been preparing the first EU 27 map of <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland, {{on the basis of}} new land cover data, refined and regionally differentiated selection criteria, and additional biodiversity datasets.

40|$|Agriculture {{is shaping}} {{most of the}} European landscapes. Its {{activities}} started about 8, 000 years ago and spread until it reached its maximum extension and covered half of the European territory. This long history of agricultural land management has {{lead to the development}} of specific agro-ecosystems and associated biodiversity that can only be maintained under specific agricultural practices. The effects of such agricultural management cover a range of impacts. On the one hand land allocation, pesticides and fertilisers can deeply reshape the land and the distribution of flora and fauna, reducing species richness and abundance. On the other hand, the areas where traditional agriculture is persisting and the human impacts are less pronounced, are among those where the highest natural value is preserved. A consequence of the intensification trends that have characterised the development of agricultural practices during the 20 th century and the evolution of many European landscapes is the shift of the main character of agricultural lands towards intensive farming, with a consequent reduction of the area hosting a high rate of biodiversity. The awareness of the decline of world (and particularly European) biodiversity has lead to policy actions at different levels aimed at preserving farming areas characterised by <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value.</b> The process started in the early 1990 s and has lead firstly to the identification of the concept of <b>High</b> <b>Nature</b> <b>Value</b> farmland, and then to focused policy targets aimed at halting biodiversity loss in general and of endangered agro-ecosystems in particular. There is an implicit link between areas of high natural value and traditional agricultural landscapes, though the two concepts are not fully overlapping.

40|$|Loss of {{biodiversity}} related with diminishing traditional land use practice has raised global concern. Since, traditional land use practices is socio-economically unviable, many incentive based conservation approaches {{have emerged in}} order to encourage practitioners to continue with their practices. <b>High</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> farmland is one of the newly emerged conservation approaches which aim at identifying causalities between farming type and biodiversity, and for providing support to the farming types which contribute to maintenance {{of biodiversity}}. Determination of the basis for the support is the major challenge, specifically the indicators used and the spatial extents taken into consideration. In this study I have explored the possibility of using semi-natural grassland biotope as a potential indicator for assessing the <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> of transhumance summer grazing practices in Sweden. Participatory Geographic Information System, questionnaire survey and key informant interviews were carried out to explore the existing management practices of Swedish transhumance summer grazing practices. Potential <b>high</b> <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> indicators included TUVA identified grassland and in addition seven others areas of conservation importance were analyzed for their proportional presence inside the summer grazed land. The results showed that transhumance summer grazing practices of Sweden is complex in terms of land coverage types and associated biological and cultural values. The area covered in TUVA identified semi-natural meadows and pastures are not sufficient to estimate the overall <b>nature</b> <b>value</b> of summer grazing landscape. Existing transhumance summer grazing practices are not limited to TUVA identified grassland biotopes and the importance of other associated landscape elements under the same grazing regime should not be underestimated. Each land coverage type has its own importance and cannot be separated from the overall value of the different land coverage types. Subsequently I argue that environmental incentives framed under the HNV concept should be able to address the complexity of rural land use dynamics instead of focussing on a limited type of land use practice...|$|R
