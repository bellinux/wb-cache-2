50|$|In the United States the Carboniferous {{is usually}} broken into Mississippian (earlier) and Pennsylvanian (later) subperiods. The Mississippian is {{about twice as}} long as the Pennsylvanian, but due to the large {{thickness}} of coal-bearing deposits with Pennsylvanian ages in Europe and North America, the two subperiods were long thought to have been more or less equal in duration. In Europe the Lower Carboniferous sub-system is known as the <b>Dinantian,</b> comprising the Tournaisian and Visean Series, dated at 362.5-332.9 Ma, and the Upper Carboniferous sub-system is known as the Silesian, comprising the Namurian, Westphalian, and Stephanian Series, dated at 332.9-298.9 Ma. The Silesian is roughly contemporaneous with the late Mississippian Serpukhovian plus the Pennsylvanian.

40|$|SUMMARY: Little {{is known}} of the {{southern}} continuation of the Lower Carboniferous (<b>Dinantian)</b> rocks of the Derbyshire Dome where they lie concealed beneath Triassic rocks at {{the margin of the}} Needwood Basin. Evidence from regional Bouguer gravity anomaly surveys pointed to the existence of a ridge of shallow <b>Dinantian</b> rocks, here called the Snelston Ridge, largely concealed by Triassic strata apart from two small inliers. The NNW-SSE trending ridge was proved by a borehole which inter-sected (<b>Dinantian)</b> Widmerpool Formation rocks at a depth of 61 m. Evidence from a seismic reflection profile indicates that the ridge, at least at Birchwoodpark (Snelston), is probably an asymmetrical, fault-controlled anticline. There is, however, no evidence for any significant changes in the thickness of <b>Dinantian</b> rocks hereabouts. The base metal potential of the Snelston Ridge was investigated using detailed geophysical and geochemical surveys and drilling. A borehole {{on the top of the}} mineralized mudmound that forms the Limestone Hill Inlier proved minor replacement galena-sphalerite-baryte mineralization with up to 10 % Pb over an intersection of about 11 m. Two boreholes on the flanks of the feature revealed little sign of mineralization, indicating that it is restricted to the exposed dolomitized summit of the mudmound. The Derbyshire Dome is a structural high with a core of Lower Carboniferous (<b>Dinantian)</b> rocks, predominantly limestones, covering an area of c. 500 km 2 and surrounded by Namurian and younger rocks (Edwards & Trotter 1954) (Fig. 1).

40|$|Results of {{integrated}} seismic mapping, within the Firth of Forth in the offshore Midland Valley of Scotland, are presented and illustrate {{aspects of the}} subsurface structure and tectonic evolution of the Upper Devonian to Carboniferous succession. Evidence for three main phases of tectonic activity has been recognized: (1) Late Devonian to <b>Dinantian</b> fault-controlled subsidence; (2) basin-wide Silesian subsidence, localized inversion and growth folding; (3) Late Silesian dextral transtensional and transpressional strike-slip faulting. During {{the first phase of}} tectonic activity, the NNE-trending Mid Forth Fault is interpreted to represent a Late Devonian to <b>Dinantian</b> extensional fault, with a small, mainly <b>Dinantian</b> depocentre developed in the hangingwall block that has subsequently been inverted during Silesian times. A major Late Devonian to <b>Dinantian</b> depocentre also occurs in the hangingwall block of the NE-trending offshore continuation of the Crossgatehall Fault, although it remains unclear whether this mainly <b>Dinantian</b> depocentre was developed during pull-apart as a result of extension or transtensional strike-slip fault movement. The NNE-trending Leven Syncline and Mid Forth Anticline within the hangingwall block of the Mid Forth Fault are interpreted as Silesian synsedimentary growth folds that formed during the second phase of tectonic activity. The peak of this activity occurred during intra-Westphalian B to Westphalian C times. In the third phase, the ENE-trending Inchkeith Fault Zone is interpreted as a Late Silesian transtensional–transpressional strike-slip fault that dextrally offsets the axial trace of the Leven Syncline. Evidence from the Firth of Forth could provide support for regional tectonic models involving mainly dextral strike-slip fault activity during Devonian–Carboniferous times, or mainly sinistral strike-slip during Devonian to Early Carboniferous followed by dextral strike-slip during Late Carboniferous times, {{for the development of the}} Upper Devonian and Carboniferous succession. However, the latter model is preferred as it provides the more convincing explanation for our interpretation that the NNE-trending Mid Forth Fault represents a Late Devonian to <b>Dinantian</b> extensional or transtensional fault that was inverted during Silesian times. This inversion may therefore reflect a major change in the regional stress field. ...|$|E
40|$|Scottish <b>Dinantian</b> {{transitional}} to mildly alkaline volcanism {{is represented}} by abundant outcrops in the Midland Valley, Southern Uplands and Highlands provinces. <b>Dinantian</b> volcanic rocks from Kintyre in the Scottish Highlands range in composition from basalt through basaltic hawaiite, hawaiite, mugearite and benmoreite to trachyte, the compositions of the evolved types being largely due to differentiation from the basaltic parents. Recent geochemical investigations of Scottish Caledonian granitoids, Siluro-Devonian Old Red Sandstone (ORS) lavas and xenolith suites from numerous vents and dykes of Permo-Carboniferous to Tertiary age have revealed that the Scottish crust and upper mantle both increase in age and are increasingly enriched in incompatible elements towards the north and northwest. The upper mantle and lower crust below the Highlands province are therefore largely considered to be more enriched and in parts older than those below the Midland Valley and Southern Uplands. <b>Dinantian</b> alkali basalts from these latter two provinces have ɛNd values predominantly in the range + 3 to + 6, initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values of 0. 7029 – 0. 7041 and 207 Pb/ 204 Pb values of 15. 48 – 15. 60. However, similar basalts from Kintyre and Arran in the Highlands have lower εNd (+ 0. 1 to + 3. 4) and 207 Pb/ 204 Pb (for given 206 Pb/ 204 Pb ratios; 15. 49 – 15. 51) and slightly higher 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (0. 7033 – 0. 7046). This regional variation correlates well with the differences seen between Midland Valley and Highland magmas in the ORS calc-alkaline suite (Thirlwall 1986) and {{it is suggested that}} both the ORS and <b>Dinantian</b> basic rocks are derived from similar types of mantle, although no lithospheric slab component is present in the later <b>Dinantian</b> suites. Isotopically-distinct portions of mantle therefore appear to have been present below the Highland and Midland Valley-Southern Upland provinces from at least Caledonian to Carboniferous times. The combined incompatible element and Sr-Nd-Pd isotopic evidence from Kintyre and Arran basaltic rocks does not allow unequivocal distinction between a lithospheric mantle and a sublithospheric mantle source. The observed correlation between isotopic composition of <b>Dinantian</b> basalts and the chemical composition of the lithosphere, together with the apparent involvement of long-term separated source reservoirs suggests that Kintyre and Arran lavas were derived largely from a lithospheric mantle source. On the other hand, the isotopic enrichment of Kintyre basaltic rocks is not extreme; trace element and isotopic compositions are still comparable to modem OIB. Sublithospheric mantle could therefore also be a viable source for Kintyre and Arran <b>Dinantian</b> volcanism. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the Dublin Basin a Courceyan ramp {{phase of}} {{sedimentation}} was {{followed in the}} Chadian by tectonic break-up of the basin into distinct shallow-water platforms, on which production of carbonate sediments continued in considerable volume, and 'deep' basinal areas in which it ceased. Progradation of the platforms across these basinal areas was limited, and mainly confined to the dip-slope of hanging wall blocks; progradation across fault scarps was rare. In the Shannon Trough basement-fault control {{was evident in the}} distribution and migration patterns of volcanic centres in the Chadian to Arundian, but despite this, ramp sedimentation ccurred throughout the <b>Dinantian,</b> evolving into a purely constructional l rge platform by late <b>Dinantian</b> time. There was no break-up of the basin {{as in the case of}} the Dublin Basin. The reason for the contrasting behaviour of the two basins is related to the rate of upwards movement of extensional faults relative to sedimentation rates. In the Dublin Basin these faults penetrated to the palaeosurface to form scarps by the late Chadian, and this topography survived into the Brigantian. In the Shannon Trough these faults failed to surface, but deep basement structures controlled the distribution of <b>Dinantian</b> volcani...|$|E
40|$|The Northwest European Carboniferous Basin is {{characterized}} by a series of carbonate platforms and intervening shale-dominated troughs during the <b>Dinantian</b> Sub-period. These structures have been mainly found along the margins of the basin. Here we present the results of an investigation of high-quality 3 D seismic surveys, which has allowed the construction of a palaeogeographical and structural framework of the <b>Dinantian</b> Sub-period in the centre of the Northwest European Carboniferous Basin. Analysis of these data has revealed a series of structures characterized by flat tops, well-developed slopes and onlap by overlying strata. These geometrical features suggest that the structures represent <b>Dinantian</b> carbonate platforms, an interpretation that is supported by recently published well data. These findings suggest the following sequential depositional and structural model for the area: (1) during the Tournaisian Stage, carbonate sedimentation took place in basinal areas; (2) continued subsidence, probably induced by rifting, resulted in the gradual onlap of carbonate deposition onto topographically higher areas; (3) during the Late Viséan Stage, rimmed shelf deposition took place, by analogy with observations from the UK and Belgium. The seismically mapped structures represent these rimmed-shelf carbonate platforms. © 2010 Geological Society of London...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Dinantian</b> {{volcanic}} {{province of}} southern Scotland, northern England {{and parts of}} Ireland is represented by a large volume of transitional to mildly alkaline rocks. Many (although not all) of its basic members display inter-regional variations in incompatible element concentrations, particularly LREE, Zr, Nb, K, and Ba. Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic data also show some minor inter-regional variations, although {{they are not as}} well-defined as those observed in the trace elements. Indeed, much of the variation is intra-regional. Modelling of the basic rocks (^ 4 % MgO) using Ce/Y and Zr/Nb ratios reveals that fractional crystallization and varying degrees of partial melting alone cannot explain the compositional diversity. Models involving variable-depth melting in the stability fields of both garnet and spinel, and garnet exhaustion through progressive melting are equally untenable. The best model to fit the ratios is one involving variable-degree melting superimposed on slight source region heterogeneity. Investigations of potential magma sources suggest that this heterogeneity is not related to crustal contamination or to incorporation of relict slab material derived from a pre-existing subduction zone (c. 50 Ma earlier) in the same region. Instead, the observed trace element and isotopic characteristics show marked similarities to many modern ocean island basalts (OIB) : a feature which suggests that the mantle source region was sub-lithospheric. It is suggested that the variations observed in basic <b>Dinantian</b> volcanic rocks merely mirror on a local scale the variations observed in OIB globally, and that no other source is necessary to explain the chemical diversity of <b>Dinantian</b> magmas. If the speed of northward motion (15 ° of latitude between the Lower Carboniferous and Lower Permian) and the longevity of <b>Dinantian</b> volcanism (c. 40 Ma) are taken into account, {{it is hardly surprising that}} such distinct chemical variations are observed: the magmas may well have sampled an enormous volume of convecting sublithospheric mantle...|$|E
