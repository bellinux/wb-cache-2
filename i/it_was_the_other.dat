25|$|Argentina {{collected}} {{a maximum of}} six points from their opening two games after beating Greece 4–0 in Foxboro before coming from behind to overcome the feisty Nigerians 2–1 on the same field four days later, yet still only finished third. The game against Greece had been won in style thanks mainly to a hat-trick from Gabriel Batistuta, yet <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> goal in the game – from Diego Maradona – that hit the headlines. Nigeria had been very impressive on their World Cup debut, and despite the narrow loss to Argentina, had emerged as group winners following victories against Bulgaria and Greece, the latter in which Nigeria doubled its lead late on a goal from Daniel Amokachi – a goal that would allow Nigeria to top its group. Maradona only played with Argentina during their first two games, both in Foxborough (playing Greece and Nigeria); he {{was thrown out of}} the tournament after testing positive for ephedrine.|$|E
25|$|The Midwest Region {{featured}} upsets {{knocking off}} the fourth through seventh seeds. Among these {{was the first}} upset of the tournament with 11th seed Kansas State's win over the sixth seeded Southern California Trojans 80-67 in Omaha, Nebraska. The media had focused {{a lot of attention}} on the freshman stars of both teams, the Wildcats' Michael Beasley and the Trojans' O. J. Mayo. In reality, while Beasley and Mayo did well, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> K-State players who made the difference, applying a strong defense to the Men of Troy's attack and coming up with the school's first tournament win since 1988. Also in the Midwest Region, #10 seed Davidson defeated seventh seeded Gonzaga 82-76 in Raleigh, North Carolina. Stephen Curry led the Wildcats with 40 points, 30 of them in the second half. His 40 points are the fifth most in NCAA tournament history, and gave Davidson their first tournament win since 1969. In the same region, 13th seed Siena upset fourth seed Vanderbilt 83-62 in Tampa, Florida. Future Harlem Globetrotter Tay Fisher made all six of his 3-point attempts, the Saints never trailed and became the first MAAC team to advance since 2004. The Midwest's first-round play ended with 12th seed Villanova's upset of fifth seed Clemson, 75-69, also in Tampa. Behind by eighteen late in the first half, the Wildcats came back, taking the lead at about the twelve-minute mark and holding it for the win. The Wildcats have won more games as an underdog in the tournament since seedings began in 1979 than any other team. With Villanova's win, the Forum saw a tournament record four upsets in one day. Earlier in the day, WKU, San Diego, and Siena defeated Drake, UConn, and Vanderbilt, to set the record.|$|E

500|$|September saw Arsenal win all {{of their}} league matches. At home to Aston Villa, Šuker scored his first goals for the club and earnt the praise of his manager Wenger: [...] "He is just obsessed by goals. You feel when he is inside the box he hits the target." [...] Away to Southampton, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> signing Henry who scored his first goal for Arsenal. The player, on as a substitute, {{received}} the ball from Tony Adams and {{with his back to}} goal [...] "some 20 yards out", turned and curled it past goalkeeper Paul Jones. Henry later admitted his failure to score for Arsenal before then was getting him down: [...] "My goal today was very important for me. I have missed at least 14 or 15 chances for Arsenal and my confidence was low." [...] Kanu scored the only goal of the match against Watford, which moved Arsenal in third position, two points behind leaders Manchester United.|$|E
500|$|Benfica's first {{match in}} September {{was on the}} 14th against Belenenses. Despite leading the game with 90 minutes played, Benfica allowed the {{visitors}} to score two goals in extra time to draw the match 3–3. Camacho took responsibility for the goals in extra-time, admitting the team needed to be smarter and waste time. The next match was the Clássico away on the 21st; Porto had a five-point lead in the league table, although Benfica had played one less game. Porto won 2–0. Camacho complained of bad luck: [...] "What happened was that one team entered the game to dominate, achieved some control, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> team who scored. What matters in football is goals, and Porto scored, while we did not." [...] Three days later, Benfica started their UEFA Cup campaign against La Louvière, a Belgian team that António Simões described as [...] "easy". The game ended in a 1–1 draw, with Camacho dismissing {{the idea that it}} was a bad result, saying that an away draw in a European competition was still a satisfying outcome. On the 28th, Benfica closed the month with a home win against Nacional, with Tiago scoring the only goal. Despite the fans whistling the team, Camacho was pleased with the performance, noting the opportunities the team had to double the lead.|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have fun with it, but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E
2500|$|Laviolette {{was given}} free rein by the NHA owners to sign all francophone players. The others would not sign any until the Canadien team was set. His first signing was {{his old friend}} Didier [...] "Cannonball" [...] Pitre. Pitre was working in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, when he {{received}} a telegram from Laviolette outlining the team and to come to Montreal. At the train in North Bay, Ontario Pitre was met by {{an official of the}} CHA's Montreal Le National, who signed him on the spot for $1100, however Pitre had thought he was signing a contract with Laviolette. When Pitre arrived in Ottawa, Laviolette was there to meet him. Laviolette explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> French-Canadien team that Laviolette was managing. Pitre signed with Laviolette for a guaranteed $1700. Before the first game, legal action was initiated by the Nationals and an injunction was only lifted {{on the day of the}} first Canadien game. Laviolette's other signings went much easier. Newsy Lalonde signed on December 14 and he reported the next day to complete the roster.|$|E
2500|$|A replicant is {{a fictional}} {{bioengineered}} or biorobotic android in the Blade Runner franchise. Virtually identical to adult humans, replicants typically have superior strength, agility, and variable intelligence {{depending on the}} model. Because of their similarity to humans, a replicant can only be detected {{by means of the}} fictional Voight-Kampff test in which emotional responses are provoked; replicants' responses differ from humans' responses. Nexus 6 replicants also have a safety mechanism, namely a four-year lifespan, to prevent them from developing empathic cognition and therefore immunity to a Voight-Kampff machine. Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the inspiration for Blade Runner, used the term android (or [...] "andy") rather than [...] "replicant"; Blade Runner director Ridley Scott requested a new, separate term that did not have preconceptions from David Peoples. As Peoples was rewriting the film's screenplay he consulted his daughter, who was then involved in biochemistry and microbiology, who suggested the term [...] "replicating", the biological process of a cell making a copy of itself. From that, either Peoples or his daughter (each would recall later <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>other)</b> coined the term replicant, which was inserted into Hampton Fancher's screenplay.|$|E

He remarked that it and [...] "A Tale of Two Springfields" [...] (which premiered the same night in Australia) were [...] "so surreal they would have Salvador Dalí scratching his head". However, he identified John Updike's guest appearance {{as an example of}} [...] "sophisticated comedy". The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "The episode gets lost in a quagmire of guest stars.
