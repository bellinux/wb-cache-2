5|$|Banksia aquilonia adapts {{readily to}} {{cultivation}} in humid or temperate climates, but is rarely cultivated. A fast-growing plant, it can grow in acidic soils from pH 3.5 to 6.5. Propagation is generally by seed, and plants flower at {{four to six}} years of age. Vegetative propagation is possible from semi-hardened cuttings of pencil thickness. The flower spikes attract birds to the garden. It can also be grown <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot,</b> with its branches heavily pruned to keep foliage dense.|$|E
5|$|Deep frying (also {{referred}} to as deep fat frying) is a cooking method in which food is submerged in hot fat, most commonly oil, rather than the shallow oil used in conventional frying, done in a frying pan. Normally, a deep fryer or chip pan is used for this; industrially, a pressure fryer or vacuum fryer may be used. Deep frying may also be performed using oil that is heated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot.</b> Deep frying is classified as hot-fat cooking method. Typically, deep frying foods cook quickly: all sides of a food are cooked simultaneously as oil has {{a high rate of}} heat conduction.|$|E

5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and flavoured with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E
5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used {{to store}} the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by drinking {{the contents of the}} blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due to the power of Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E

25|$|Coffee may be brewed {{by several}} methods. It may be boiled, steeped, or pressurized. Brewing coffee by boiling was the {{earliest}} method, and Turkish coffee {{is an example}} of this method. It is prepared by grinding or pounding the seeds to a fine powder, then adding it to water and bringing it to the boil for no more than an instant <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> called a cezve or, in Greek, a bríki. This produces a strong coffee with a layer of foam on the surface and sediment (which is not meant for drinking) settling {{at the bottom of the}} cup.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} recipes for cholent. Ingredients vary {{according}} to the geographic areas of Europe where the Jews lived and especially the personal preferences of the cook.

The meat is placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> with peeled potatoes, any type or size of beans, and grains (barley, hulled wheat, rice). The mixture is lightly seasoned, mainly salt and pepper, and water is added to the pot to create a stew-like consistency during slow cooking.|$|E

25|$|In Boccaccio's Decameron a memorably morbid tale (novella V) {{tells of}} Lisabetta, whose {{brothers}} slay her lover. He appears {{to her in}} a dream and shows her where he is buried. She secretly disinters the head, and sets it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> of basil, which she waters with her daily tears. Shortly after the pot is taken from her by her brothers, she dies of grief. Boccaccio's tale is the source of John Keats' poem Isabella or The Pot of Basil – which in turn inspired the paintings Isabella (Millais painting) and Isabella and the Pot of Basil. A similar story is told of the Longobard queen, Rosalind.|$|E
25|$|Indoors, an avocado tree {{is usually}} grown from {{the pit of}} an avocado fruit. This is often done by {{removing}} the pit from a ripe, unrefrigerated avocado fruit. The pit is then stabbed {{with three or four}} toothpicks, about one-third of the way up from the flat end. The pit is placed in a jar or vase containing tepid water. It should split in four to six weeks and yield roots and a sprout. If there is no change by this time, the avocado pit is discarded. Once the stem has grown a few inches, it is placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> with soil. It should be watered every few days. Avocados have been known to grow large, so owners must be ready to re-pot the plant several times.|$|E
25|$|Sir Francis Bacon {{published}} one of {{the first}} plant physiology experiments in 1627 in the book, Sylva Sylvarum. Bacon grew several terrestrial plants, including a rose, in water and concluded that soil was only needed to keep the plant upright. Jan Baptist van Helmont published what is considered the first quantitative experiment in plant physiology in 1648. He grew a willow tree for five years <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pot</b> containing 200 pounds of oven-dry soil. The soil lost just two ounces of dry weight and van Helmont concluded that plants get all their weight from water, not soil. In 1699, John Woodward published experiments on growth of spearmint in different sources of water. He found that plants grew much better in water with soil added than in distilled water.|$|E
