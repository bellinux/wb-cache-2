Much of the adult plumage is white, with black flight feathers and a forked blacked tail. This forked tail is shorter than the stiff white undertail coverts, so that these protrude from underneath the tail and may function aerodynamically in flight.

It flaps its wings at a rate of 181 beats per minute and the wingspan measures 150–180cm. This stork needs to give three long jumps before it can take off from the ground.|$|E

6000|$|It took me {{just about}} that time to {{convince}} him that I had never dreamed of marrying Hermann's niece. Could any necessity have been more extravagant? And the difficulty was the greater because he was so hard hit that he couldn't imagine anybody being able to remain in a state of indifference. Any man with eyes in his head, he seemed to think, could not help coveting so much bodily magnificence. This profound belief was conveyed by the manner he listened sitting sideways to the table and playing absently with a few cards I had dealt to him at random. And the more I saw into him the more I saw of him. The wind swayed the lights so that his sunburnt face, whiskered to the eyes, seemed to successively flicker crimson at me and to go out. I saw the extraordinary breadth of the high cheek-bones, the perpendicular style of the features, the massive forehead, steep like a cliff, denuded at the top, largely uncovered at the temples. The fact is I had never before seen him without his hat; but now, as if my fervour had made him hot, he had taken it off and laid it gently on the floor. Something peculiar in the shape and setting of his yellow eyes gave them the provoking silent intensity which characterised his glance. But the face was thin, furrowed, worn; I discovered that through the bush of his hair, as you may detect the gnarled shape of a tree trunk lost in a dense undergrowth. These overgrown cheeks were sunken. It was an anchorite's bony head fitted with a Capuchin's beard and adjusted to a herculean body. I don't mean athletic. Hercules, I take it, was not an athlete. He was a strong man, susceptible to female charms, and not afraid of dirt. And thus with Falk, who was a strong man. He was extremely strong, just as the girl (since I must think of them together) was magnificently attractive by the masterful power of flesh and blood, expressed in shape, in size, in attitude--that is by a straight appeal to the senses. His mind meantime, preoccupied with respectability, quailed before Schomberg's tongue and seemed absolutely impervious to my protestations; and I {{went so far as to}} protest that I would just as soon think of marrying my mother's (dear old lady!) faithful female cook as Hermann's niece. Sooner, I protested, in my desperation, much sooner; but it did not appear that he saw anything outrageous in the proposition, and in his sceptical immobility he seemed to nurse the argument that at all events the cook was very, very far away. It must be said that, just before, I had gone wrong by appealing to the evidence of my manner whenever I called on board the Diana. I had never attempted to approach the girl, or to speak to her, or even to look at her in any marked way. Nothing could be clearer. But, as his own idea of--let us say--courting, seemed to consist precisely in sitting silently for hours in the vicinity of the beloved object, that line of argument inspired him with distrust. Staring down his <b>extended</b> <b>legs</b> he let out a grunt--as much as to say, [...] "That's all very fine, but you can't throw dust in my eyes." ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{work was}} done in {{conjunction}} with the VINNOVA-funded research and development project LIGHTSTRUCT. It was performed in the department of lightweight structures at KTH. The thesis investigated two potential weld improvement techniques called toe weaving and <b>extended</b> <b>leg.</b> These methods use double pass welding in order to create favorable weld geometries in order to improve the fatigue life. The toe weaving technique produces a wavy weld toe line that should induce a specific crack growth behavior, while the <b>extended</b> <b>leg</b> technique has a straight toe line and will provide a smoother transition between weld and baseplate. The investigation was done by performing 3 D fracture analyses of the weld geometries as well as fatigue tests on manually welded cruciform joints. Both simulations and fatigue tests showed a slight fatigue life improvement for both techniques. A high variation in fatigue lives was observed in testing, mostly due to the prevalence of undercut defects. The specific crack growth for the toe weaved specimens could not be observed as in previous studies. The fatigue life enhancement was therefore most likely due to a smoother weld transition between weld and baseplate, reducing the stress concentration factor at the weld toe. The weaving technique is not suitable for welded joints loaded in the longitudinal direction, making its use more limited compared to the <b>extended</b> <b>leg</b> technique. From a production point of view, the toe weaving technique is more time and knowledge demanding than the <b>extended</b> <b>leg</b> technique. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the <b>extended</b> <b>leg</b> technique...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} {{the design and}} electromagnetic simulation of antenna-coupled bolometer that works in THz band. Starting with infrared microbolometer technology, spiral antenna-coupled microbridge structures were developed in this paper. Novel spiral antenna with <b>extended</b> <b>legs</b> was first designed based on the structure characteristics of microbolometer. Results of the structure design and electromagnetic simulation were presented, concentrating on the spectral absorption. The influences of different structure parameters of the spiral antenna on THz wave absorption were discussed. The <b>extended</b> <b>legs</b> of spiral antenna, which contributed to the increase of THz wave absorption rate and the decrease of absorption frequency, {{made it possible to}} use the spiral antenna as electrode lead simultaneously for process simplification. A spiral antenna-coupled microbridge structure with optimized absorption at 2.52  THz was obtained, aiming at applications in detection and imaging. This research was only the first step in demonstrating the feasibility of antenna-coupled THz bolometer detectors by proposing novel spiral antenna-coupled microbridge structures and demonstrating its improvements on THz absorption and manufacturing process. However, it established a foundation for fabrication of THz microbolometer and its applications in sensing and imaging which will be done in further work.|$|E
30|$|Bolometer sensor {{is a good}} {{candidate}} for THz imaging due to its compact system, low cost, and wideband operation. Based on infrared microbolometer structures, two kinds of antenna-coupled microbridge structures are proposed with different spiral antennas: spiral antenna on support layer and spiral antenna with <b>extended</b> <b>legs.</b> Aiming at applications in detection and imaging, simulations are carried out mainly for optimized absorption at 2.52  THz, which is the radiation frequency of far-infrared CO 2 lasers. The effects of rotation angle, line width, and spacing of the spiral antenna on THz wave absorption of microbridge structures are discussed. Spiral antenna, with <b>extended</b> <b>legs,</b> is a good solution for high absorption rate at low absorption frequency and can be used as electrode lead simultaneously for simplified manufacturing process. A spiral antenna-coupled microbridge structure with an absorption rate of more than 75 % at 2.52  THz is achieved by optimizing the structure parameters. This research demonstrates the use of different spiral antennas for enhanced and tunable THz absorption of microbridge structures and provides an effective way to fabricate THz microbolometer detectors with great potential in the application of real-time THz imaging.|$|E
