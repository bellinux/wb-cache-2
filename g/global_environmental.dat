5|$|In {{reviewing}} {{the sweep of}} botanical history it is evident that, {{through the power of}} the scientific method, most of the basic questions concerning the structure and function of plants have, in principle, been resolved. Now the distinction between pure and applied botany becomes blurred as our historically accumulated botanical wisdom at all levels of plant organisation is needed (but especially at the molecular and global levels) to improve human custodianship of planet earth. The most urgent unanswered botanical questions now relate to the role of plants as primary producers in the global cycling of life's basic ingredients: energy, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, and ways that our plant stewardship can help address the <b>global</b> <b>environmental</b> issues of resource management, conservation, human food security, biologically invasive organisms, carbon sequestration, climate change, and sustainability.|$|E
