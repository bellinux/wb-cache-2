Actinic is also used to describe medical conditions that are triggered by exposure to light, especially UV light (see actinic keratosis).|$|R
40|$|Summary Cervical {{cancer is}} an {{important}} public health problem. Pap smear is the leading strategy of screening programs for cervical cancer worldwide. However, delayed diagnosis leads to more aggressive and less effective treatments. Patients with uterine cervix malignancies who are referred for radiotherapy have advanced-stage disease, which results in high rates of locoregional recurrence. The use of radiotherapy {{as a treatment for}} cervical cancer causes morphological changes in neoplastic and non-neoplastic epithelial cells, as well as in stromal cells, which make it difficult to diagnose the residual lesion, resulting in a dilemma in cytopathological routine. Based on the difficulties of cytopathologic evaluation for the follow-up of patients treated with radiotherapy for cervical cancer, our objective was to describe the <b>actinic</b> cytopathic <b>effects.</b> Our paper was based on a structured review including the period from June 2015 to April 2016, aiming at an exploratory-descriptive study. Bibliographic investigations were carried out through selection and analysis of articles, list of authors and keywords, selection of new articles focused on the analysis of bibliographic references to previously selected documents, as well as textbooks of recognized merit. The most incident actinic cytopathological alterations as described in the literature are: cellular gigantism, nuclear and cytoplasmic vacuolization, dyskeratosis, bi- and multinucleated (B/M) cells, macro and multiple nucleoli, anisokaryosis, anisonucleolosis and nuclear pyknosis. To date, a protocol has not been established that can precisely differentiate the morphological characteristics between benign cells with <b>actinic</b> <b>effects</b> from recurrent malignant cells on post-radiotherapy smears...|$|R
40|$|Flash {{spectroscopy}} {{data were}} obtained for purple membrane fragments at pH 5, 7, and 9 for seven temperatures from 5 degrees to 35 degrees C, at the magic angle for actinic versus measuring beam polarizations, at fifteen wavelengths from 380 to 700 nm, and for about five decades of time from 1 microsecond to completion of the photocycle. Signal-to-noise ratios are as high as 500. Systematic errors involving beam geometries, light scattering, absorption flattening, photoselection, temperature fluctuations, partial dark adaptation of the sample, unwanted <b>actinic</b> <b>effects,</b> and cooperativity were eliminated, compensated for, or are shown to be irrelevant for the conclusions. Using nonlinear least squares techniques, all data at one temperature and one pH were fitted to sums of exponential decays, which is the form required if the system obeys conventional first-order kinetics. The rate constants obtained have well behaved Arrhenius plots. Analysis of the residual errors of the fitting shows that seven exponentials are required to fit the data {{to the accuracy of}} the noise level...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of dual-channel PAM {{chlorophyll}} fluorometer has been developed, which is specialised in the detection of extremely small differences in photosynthetic activity in algae or thylakoids suspensions. In conjunction with standardised algae cultures or isolated thylakoids, the new device provides an ultrasensitive biotest system for detection of toxic substances in water samples. In this report, major features of the new device are outlined and examples of its performance are presented using suspensions of Phaeodactylum tricornutum (diatoms) and of freeze-dried thylakoids of Lactuca sativa (salad). Investigated and reference samples {{are exposed to the}} same actinic intensity of pulse-modulated measuring light. The quantum yields are assessed by the saturation pulse method. Clock-triggered repetitive measurements of quantum yield typically display a standard deviation of 0. 1 %, corresponding to the inhibition induced by 0. 02 mug diuron l(- 1). Hence, for diuron or compounds with similar toxicity, the detection limit is well below the 0. 1 mug l(- 1) defined as the limit for the presence of a single toxic substance in water by the European Commission drinking water regulation. The amounts of water and biotest material required for analysis are very small, as a single assay involves two 1 ml samples, each containing ca. 0. 5 mug chlorophyll. Both with Phaeodactylum and thylakoids the relationship between inhibition and diuron concentration is strictly linear up to 10 % inhibition, with very similar slopes. Apparent inhibition depends on the <b>actinic</b> <b>effect</b> of the measuring light, showing optima at 6 and 4 mumol quanta m(- 2) s(- 1) with Phaeodactylum and thylakoids, respectively...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{fatty acids}} are {{believed}} to be photochemically inert in the actinic region, complex volatile organic compounds are produced during illumination of an air-water interface coated solely with a monolayer of carboxylic acid. When aqueous solutions containing nonanoic acid (NA) at bulk concentrations that give rise to just over a monolayer of NA coverage are illuminated with actinic radiation, saturated and unsaturated aldehydes are seen in the gas phase, and more highly oxygenated products appear in the aqueous phase. This chemistry is probably initiated by triplet-state NA molecules excited by <b>direct</b> absorption of <b>actinic</b> light at the water surface. Because fatty acidsâ€“covered interfaces are ubiquitous in the environment, such photochemical processing will have a substantial impact on local ozone and particle formation...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{high resolution}} extreme ultraviolet (EUV) coherent diffractive imaging {{in the most}} general reflection geometry by combining ptychography with tilted plane correction. This method {{makes it possible to}} image extended surfaces at any angle of incidence. Refocused light from a tabletop coherent high harmonic light source at 29 nm illuminates a nanopatterned surface at 45 degree angle of incidence. The reconstructed image contains quantitative amplitude and phase (in this case pattern height) information, comparing favorably with both scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscopy images. In the future, this approach will enable imaging of complex surfaces and nanostructures with sub- 10 nm-spatial resolution and fs-temporal resolution, which will impact a broad range of nanoscience and nanotechnology including for <b>direct</b> application in <b>actinic</b> inspection in support of EUV lithography...|$|R
40|$|Coupling {{of optical}} data-processing devices with microelectronics, telecocommunication and sensory functions, {{is among the}} biggest {{challenges}} in molecular electronics. Intensive research is going on to find suitable nonlinear optical materials that could meet the demanding requirements of optoelectronic applications, especially regarding high sensitivity and stability. In addition to inorganic and organic crystals, biological molecules have also been considered for use in integrated optics, among which the bacterial chromoprotein, bacteriorhodopsin (bR) generated the most interest. bR undergoes enormous absorption and concomitant refractive index changes upon initiation of a cyclic series of photoreactions by a burst of <b>actinic</b> light. This <b>effect</b> can be exploited to create highly versatile all-optical logical elements. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by investigating the static and dynamic response of several basic elements of integrated optical devices. Our results show that, due to its relatively high refractive index changes, bR {{can be used as}} an active nonlinear optical material to produce a variety of integrated optical switching and modulation effects...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSolar {{irradiance}} spectral {{measurements were}} performed during a total solar eclipse. The spectral {{effect of the}} limb darkening to the global, <b>direct</b> irradiance and <b>actinic</b> flux measurements was investigated. This effect leads to wavelength dependent changes in the measured solar spectra showing a much more pronounced decrease in the radiation at the lower wavelengths. Radiative transfer model results {{were used for the}} computation of a correction for the total ozone measurements due to the limb darkening. This correction was found too small to explain the large decrease in total ozone column derived from the standard Brewer measurements, which is an artifact in the measured irradiance due to the increasing contribution of diffuse radiation against the decreasing direct irradiance caused by the eclipse. Calculations of the Extraterrestrial spectrum and the effective sun's temperatures, as measured from ground based direct irradiance measurements, showed an artificial change in the calculations of both quantities {{due to the fact that}} radiation coming from the visible part of the sun during the eclipse phases differs from the back body radiation described by the Planck's law...|$|R
40|$|Actinic keratosis {{is among}} the most {{commonly}} treated skin conditions in the outpatient setting. Its prevalence spans the globe, with greater distribution in fair skinned individuals and the immunocompromised. With high prevalence, increasing incidence and the risk of transformation to a cancerous lesion, prevention and timely treatment present opportunities to rein in costs. The {{purpose of this article is}} to review published economic studies relating to the treatment of actinic keratosis, to summarize results discussing the cost drivers of current treatment modalities and to identify parameters most likely to influence the cost effectiveness of treatment. We systematically conducted a published literature search for pharmacoeconomic research of actinic keratosis using title, abstract or full-text searches with the following search terms ([actinic OR solar] AND [keratosis OR keratoses]) AND (economic OR cost OR pharmacoeconomics OR decision). We included published articles referencing actinic keratosis in a standalone study or in a broader study referencing non-melanoma skin cancer and articles evaluating cost-of-illness, cost-of-treatment, cost minimization, cost effectiveness, cost utility, cost-benefit analysis and cost consequence. Our review of the literature found nine studies devoted to pharmacoeconomic considerations of actinic keratosis treatments, with one article investigating both cost-of-illness and cost-of-treatment, two measuring cost-of-illness, two evaluating cost-of-treatment, one focusing on cost minimization, and three focusing on cost effectiveness. The literature compared a broad range of actinic keratosis treatments including topical medications, cryotherapy, photodynamic therapy, excision and a combination of treatment modalities. The <b>direct</b> cost of <b>actinic</b> keratosis management in the US was estimated at $US 1. 2 [*]billion per year, with indirect costs totalling $US 295 [*]million (year 2004 values). The primary drivers of cost were physician office visits and associated procedures. Pharmacoeconomic research defining standards, outcomes and areas of efficiencies in the treatment of actinic keratosis is in its infancy. To move towards more comprehensive analysis, research needs to focus on updating epidemiological data, evolving evidence-based standards, delineating cost drivers in immunocompetent and immunocompromised populations, and on health outcomes. ...|$|R
