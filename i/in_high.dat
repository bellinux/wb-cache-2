40|$|Service-learning {{is gaining}} high {{popularity}} {{all over the}} world. It is believed to effectively promote students' learning and development. This paper examines how service-learning links service experience to students' learning by applying Astin's theory of involvement <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> education. Much research exists on theory of involvement in other fields. However, little research has highlighted the multidimensional applications of this theory in service-learning field especially <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> education. This paper reviews Astin's theory of involvement that how it applies to students' learning and development <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> education. Theoretically, the paper contributes to service-learning literature in two ways: first it highlights the role of service-learning for students' active learning <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> education and second, it explains Astin's theory of involvement {{as a model of}} service-learning <b>in</b> <b>higher</b> education.
