40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the origins and}} development of the European Community Educational Indicators Project that began in 1992. It reviews past literature relating to the various definitions of an indicator that have been used and the conceptual models that have been adopted. A description of the objectives of the project is followed by an analysis of the information requirements of the European Commission in the areas of education and training. The relationship between the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Indicators of Education Systems (<b>INES)</b> <b>Project</b> and the Community Educational Indicators Project is examined, with reference to work in the field of educational indicators in selected member states of the European Union (EU). The paper also identifies the categories that provide the overarching framework for the proposed EU indicators. The appendix contains the proposed ne...|$|E
40|$|There is no {{shortage}} of data and results that demonstrate that open source software, when adopted with appropriate best practices, can significantly lower costs and provide quality IT (information technology) solutions, especially for small and medium enterprises. For example, the Consortium for Open Source Software in Public Administration project demonstrated that by using best practices for OSS procurement, not only was software acquisition cheaper, but the evaluation of tangible and intangible costs over 5 years demonstrated a cost reduction ranging from 20 % to 60 %. The EU study on the impact of OSS indicates that OSS can reduce software research and development costs by 36 %, while the <b>INES</b> <b>project</b> found that companies adopting OSS increased profits and reduced time to market and development costs in 80 % of the trials. If OSS is so advantageous, why is so little use of it perceived in the marketplace, especially among SMEs? We present the preliminary results of an European project called OpenTTT to improve the adoption rate and study the effectiveness of best practices in OSS adoption within small and medium enterprises...|$|E
50|$|According to the 2002 census by the National Statistics Institute (INE), Temuco had a {{communal}} population of 245,347 (117,071 men and 128,276 women). Of these, 232,528 (94.8%) lived {{in urban areas}} and 12,819 (5.2%) in rural areas. The population grew by 24.4% (48,111 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. The <b>INE</b> <b>projected</b> the 2010 population to be 377,495, which makes it the second largest city south of Santiago (behind Concepción), and the fourth largest in the country. One of the distinctive features of Temuco is the strong presence of the Mapuche culture, who make up 23.05% {{of the population in}} the Temuco commune, and numerous German immigrant colonies (9.82%). Temuco proper has a population of 227,086.|$|R
40|$|In {{the project}} ''Corrosion Evaluation of Metallic Materials for Long-Lived HLW/Spent Fuel Disposal Containers,'' (November 2000 to October 2003) {{in-depth}} corrosion studies are performed on preselected container materials in rock salt, granite and clay environments. The materials investigated are carbon steel, stainless steels, Ni-base alloys (Hastelloy C- 4 and Hastelloy C- 22), the alloy Ti 99. 8 -Pd and Cu-base materials. The {{objectives of the}} studies are: to {{determine the influence of}} essential parameters (e. g., composition of the medium, temperature etc.) on corrosion, {{to gain a better understanding}} of corrosion mechanisms, and to provide more accurate data for modeling the corrosion of the containers over hundred of years. To achieve the objectives of the project, a combination of chemical experiments (long-term immersion tests), electrochemical studies, and stress corrosion cracking studies are performed. The project is a joint undertaken of FZK. <b>INE</b> (<b>project</b> co-ordinator; investigations in rock salt and granite), GNF. IUT (investigations in rock salt), ENRESA/INASMET (studies in granite), and SCK. CEN (studies in clay). In the present paper the results obtained in the second year of the project (November 2001 -October 2002) are presented. (orig.)

40|$|This paper identi…es a {{limit to}} {{arbitrage}} that arises because …rm value is endogenous to the exploitation of arbitrage. Trading on private information reveals this information to managers and improves their real decisions, enhancing fundamental value. While this feedback e¤ect increases the pro…tability of a long position, it reduces the pro…tability of a short position. Thus, investors may refrain from trading on negative information, and so bad news is incorporated more slowly into prices than good news. This has potentially important real consequences – if negative information is not incorporated into prices, <b>ine</b> ¢ cient <b>projects</b> are not canceled, leading to overinvestment...|$|R
40|$|Here is my Master of Science thesis, finally. It took {{seven years}} {{to get to this}} point, so this should better be good. This {{document}} is the result of nine months work. It started when I hit on the idea of formulating my assignment myself. It was inspired by <b>Ines,</b> an active <b>project</b> at TKI. I immediately had to restrict the assignment, because of time limits. The aspect of my project I liked a lot, is that it was a very many-sided project; I have studied some psychology, studied some didactics, created a dialog system with computer science, and I have done a user inquiry with thirty persons. In this period, where I had to deal with serious sickness of my family and a friend, I loved being working usefully although I had some troubles giving up the freedom of the student life. I also got a bit disappointed in the progress of my program; I expected to create much more, but as the expert Rieks said {{it takes a lot of}} time to create an extensive dialog system. I always had the sneaky suspicion that words of thank to supervisors were a veiled attempt to get a higher mark by using flattery. But now in my own project I have experienced that my supervisors really were a great support. Their enthusiasm kept m...|$|R
