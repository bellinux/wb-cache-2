The structural coloration on meat cuts appears {{only after the}} ordered pattern of muscle fibrils is exposed and light <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> by the proteins in the fibrils. The coloration or wavelength of the diffracted light depends on the angle of observation and can be enhanced by covering the meat with translucent foils. Roughening the surface or removing water content by drying causes the structure to collapse, thus, the structural coloration to disappear.|$|E
25|$|The Dazzler is a {{commercial}} pulse shaper in which light <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> from an acoustic wave. By tuning the timing, frequency, and amplitude of the acoustic wave, {{it is possible}} to introduce arbitrary dispersion functions with a maximum delay of a few picoseconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{dimensions}} of the components may be dictated by the distance from transmitter to receiver, the wavelength and the Rayleigh criterion or diffraction limit, used in standard radio frequency antenna design, which also applies to lasers. Airy's diffraction limit is also frequently used to determine an approximate spot size at an arbitrary distance from the aperture. Electromagnetic radiation experiences less diffraction at shorter wavelengths (higher frequencies); so, for example, a blue laser <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> less than a red one.|$|E

50|$|Although generalizable, {{the limit}} {{is defined in}} the context of biomolecular X-ray crystallography, where a typical {{experiment}} consists of exposing a single frozen crystal of a macromolecule (generally protein, DNA or RNA) to an intense X-ray beam.

25|$|Bragg is {{most famous}} for his law on the {{diffraction}} of X-rays by crystals. Bragg's law {{makes it possible to}} calculate the positions of the atoms within a crystal from the way in which an X-ray beam <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> by the crystal lattice. He made this discovery in 1912, during his first year as a research student in Cambridge. He discussed his ideas with his father, who developed the X-ray spectrometer in Leeds. This tool allowed many different types of crystals to be analysed.|$|E
25|$|In the {{two-point}} linear implosion, {{the nuclear}} fuel is cast into a solid shape and placed within {{the center of}} a cylinder of high explosive. Detonators are placed {{at either end of the}} explosive cylinder, and a plate-like insert, or shaper, is placed in the explosive just inside the detonators. When the detonators are fired, the initial detonation is trapped between the shaper and the end of the cylinder, causing it to travel out to the edges of the shaper where it <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> around the edges into the main mass of explosive. This causes the detonation to form into a ring that proceeds inwards from the shaper.|$|E
25|$|The {{incoming}} beam {{is shaped}} by slits of a few tens of micrometers such that the transverse coherence length {{is greater than the}} grating period. The interferometer consists of three parallel and equally spaced phase gratings, and an x-ray camera. The incident beam <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> by a first grating of period 2P into two beams. These are further diffracted by a second grating of period P into four beams. Two of the four merge at a third grating of period 2P. Each is further diffracted by the third grating. The multiple diffracted beams are allowed to propagate for sufficient distance such that the different diffraction orders are separated at the camera. There exists a pair of diffracted beams that co-propagate from the third grating to the camera. They interfere with each other to produce intensity fringes if the gratings are slightly misaligned with each other. The central pair of diffraction paths are always equal in length regardless of the x-ray energy or the angle of the incident beam. The interference patterns from different photon energes and incident angles are locked in phase.|$|E

2500|$|When light {{travels through}} thin clouds {{made up of}} nearly uniform sized water or aerosol {{droplets}} or ice crystals, diffraction or bending of light occurs as the light <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> by {{the edges of the}} particles. [...] This degree of bending of light depends on the frequency (color) of light {{and the size of the}} particles. [...] The result is a pattern of rings, which seem to emanate from the Sun, the Moon, a planet, or another astronomical object. The most distinct part of this pattern is a central, nearly white disk. This resembles an atmospheric Airy disc but is not actually an Airy disk. It is distinct from rainbows and halos, which are mainly caused by refraction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract We have {{investigated}} the role of wave-front cur-vature on propagation by following the wave front that <b>was</b> <b>diffracted</b> through a narrow isthmus created in a two-dimen-sional ionic model (Luo-Rudy) of ventricular muscle and in a thin (0. 5 -mm) sheet of sheep ventricular epicardial muscle. The electrical activity in the experimental preparations was imaged by using a high-resolution video camera that moni-tored the changes in fluorescence of the potentiometric dye di- 4 -ANEPPS {{on the surface of}} the tissue. Isthmuses were created both parallel and perpendicular to the fiber orienta-tion. In both numerical and biological experiments, when a planar wave front reached the isthmus, it <b>was</b> <b>diffracted</b> to an elliptical wave front whose pronounced curvature was very similar to that of a wave front initiated by point stimulation. In addition, the velocity of propagation was reduced in relation t...|$|R
50|$|When {{a crystal}} is {{composed}} of crystallites with varying lattice orientation, topographic contrast arises: In plane-wave topography, only selected crystallites will <b>be</b> in <b>diffracting</b> position, thus yielding diffracted intensity only {{in some parts of}} the image. Upon sample rotation, these will disappear, and other crystallites will appear in the new topograph as strongly diffracting. In white-beam topography, all misoriented crystallites will <b>be</b> <b>diffracting</b> simultaneously (each at a different wavelength). However, the exit angles of the respective diffracted beams will differ, leading to overlapping regions of enhanced intensity as well as to shadows in the image, thus again giving rise to contrast.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ensemble}} approach differs {{significantly from}} the Copenhagen approach in its view of diffraction. The Copenhagen interpretation of diffraction, especially {{in the viewpoint of}} Niels Bohr, puts weight on the doctrine of wave-particle duality. In this view, a particle that <b>is</b> <b>diffracted</b> by a diffractive object, such as for example a crystal, is regarded as really and physically behaving like a wave, split into components, more or less corresponding to the peaks of intensity in the diffraction pattern. Though Dirac does not speak of wave-particle duality, he does speak of [...] "conflict" [...] between wave and particle conceptions. He indeed does describe a particle, before it is detected, as being somehow simultaneously and jointly or partly present in the several beams into which the original beam <b>is</b> <b>diffracted.</b> So does Feynman, who speaks of this as [...] "mysterious".|$|E

5000|$|The debate {{involving}} how cuspate forelands form is ongoing. [...] However, {{the most}} widely accepted process of formation involves long shore drift.
