40|$|As VAT {{becomes an}} {{increasingly}} important source of tax revenue world-wide, tax policy makers should be well aware of its strengths and weaknesses. In academia, there is strong consensus that tax exemptions rank among the most problematic features of VAT. The very concept of exemption is already a misrepresentation, because it normally entails the loss of entitlement to an input VAT credit; exempt supplies are therefore actually “input-taxed”. It is generally accepted that this particular form of occult taxation detrimentally affects economic efficiency and increases administrative complexity. Moreover, VAT as an indirect and <b>impersonal</b> <b>tax</b> on consumption {{is intended to be}} borne by final consumers but it is imposed on business. It will therefore often be questionable who really benefits from the intended relief, and whether there are superior alternatives to VAT exemptions to attain their underlying policy objectives. Even where they can be defended, exemptions are often implemented in an inconsistent fashion. All of these aspects are particularly troublesome in the EU VAT system that suffers from legislative eurosclerosis. The present paper discusses these topics with special emphasis on the EU constitutional and institutional framework. It offers an overview of the current array of exemptions and lays out the relevant economic and legal benchmark for their critical assessment. The paper identifies eight main rationales for tax exemptions and analyzes their merits in the light of those benchmarks. Particular attention is given to considerations of tax equity and social policy, and to exemptions of so-called “hard to tax”-supplies. In a separate section, the paper discusses the detrimental effects of the corresponding denial of input VAT deduction and its eventual justifications. Policy makers are thus provided with clear legal guidance as to which exemptions are required, which are tolerable, and which should be abolished within the framework of EU VAT, and how the defendable ones should be amended. ...|$|E
40|$|Considering {{the extent}} to which {{progress}} is being made with the integration of the European Capital Market, harmonisation of the taxation of income is becoming increasingly important. Efficient allocation of capital must not be hindered by inter-governmental tax differentials. Following more than forty years of discussion, the approach that is now beginning to emerge is one by which the principle of country of residence is translated into reality via a system of information exchange and tax collected at source. The information model should guarantee that interest income earned abroad is declared in the taxpayer's country of residence. EU states that place great value on banking secrecy should be able to charge tax collected at source for interest income earned there during a transition phase ending in 2002. Their tax rates must be raised from 15 % to 35 % during this period in order to stimulate the transition to information exchange in these countries as well. In this context, Switzerland and other third countries, which are supposed to give up their status as tax havens and adopt this approach, represent a particular problem relating to tax policy. The model chosen for the EU is a pragmatic concession in so far as its intervention in national tax law is relatively limited. With its interest income tax rate of 25 %, which is to apply to interest income earned by resident taxpayers from 2004 onwards, German tax legislation has opted for an approach that would be compatible with the European solution if, while implementing the European approach, information about interest income earned in Germany by non-resident individuals could also be passed on. Both the standards negotiated for a European guideline on the taxation of interest income and the German approach are incomplete in as far as there remain considerable gaps in the recording of <b>impersonal</b> and personal <b>tax</b> liability. Further efforts need to be made as regards tax policy in order to eliminate the remaining deficiencies in the taxation of interest income and bring about coordination between the burden of interest income and the likewise necessary harmonisation of corporate management {{in a way that makes}} sense economically.
