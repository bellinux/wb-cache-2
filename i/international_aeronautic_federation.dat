40|$|<b>International</b> audienceIn <b>aeronautic</b> sector, the reattachement of separeted {{air flows}} close to {{aircraft}} wings can be actively controlled by blowing air jets in the boundary layer, through submillimetric holes situated on airplane wings near the seperation edges. Performance improvement of next generation planes (lift enhancement, drag reduction) pushes plane designers to investigate MEMS solutions {{in order to}} provide active air flow control. This paper presents realization of silicon cantilever beams by Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) in order to reach high aspect ratio. These cantilever beams take place in the design and realization of a micro-valve which will provide high speed pulsated air jets for boundary layer control...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>aeronautic</b> {{industry}} is a fragile and highly competitive sector in which {{the relationships between the}} different partners are supported by numerous IT applications which must be interoperable in a flexible manner and at low cost. This is particularly true for the sub-contractors of rank 2 and following which are small enterprises (round 50 employees). This paper presents the ISTA 3 methodology based on MDI and SOA principles using a progressive approach in order to define technical services based on business models at the highest level. After the presentation of SOA and MDI principles, the method is presented and illustrated by a case study of ISTA 3 Project presenting the models used to characterize interoperability nodes.

For each functional requirement, the conditions are expressed as sets of linear relations on production deviations, from blank parts to finished part. These relations allow specification of blank parts, machining phases and braze welding phases. The method is applied on a part from Snecma...|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>aeronautic</b> and {{automotive}} {{industries have}} shown {{a renewed interest in}} TiAl based alloys. The main reasons for such an interest are their low density (~ 3, 8 g/cm 3), a good stiffness and a high strength for temperatures up to 750 °C. However, these alloys exhibit, in their polycrystalline form, a poor ductility at room temperature with widely scattered values. The aim of this study is therefore to characterise their mechanical behaviour with a multiscale methodology, coupling microstructure analysis and strain field measurements. This methodology employs orientation imaging microscopy as well as digital imaging correlation techniques with an intragranular step size of a few micrometers. Two chemical compositions (47 at. % Al and 48 at. % Al) and two processing routes (casting and powder metallurgy) are studied. Thus, four different types of final microstructures are considered, from fully lamellar Ti 3 Al (a 2) + TiAl (g) microstructure to bimodal ones composed of two-phase (a 2 +g) lamellar grains and monolithic g grains. Firstly, the microstructure is characterised crystallographically and morphologically. This allows the identification of a representative volume element (RVE) inside the analysed volume. Then, uniaxial mechanical tests are performed for each microstructure, and the strain fields are analysed with a multiscale approach, which determines the spatial distribution of the strain field heterogeneity with respect to the different microstructures...|$|R
50|$|Gallaudet {{was born}} in Washington, DC to Edward Miner Gallaudet, the son of Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, founder of Gallaudet University. Both his father and {{grandfather}} were famous educators in the field of deaf education. He received his B.A. from Yale University in 1893, and his Ph.D in Electrical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1896. He worked at Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from 1896 to 1897, then became an instructor of physics at Yale, where he taught from 1897 to 1900. From 1900 to 1903 he worked at William Cramp & Sons' Ship and Engine Building Company in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and then, in 1903, worked at the National Cash Register Company in Dayton, Ohio. He married Marion Cockrell on February 14, 1903. From 1903 to 1908 he worked as an assistant to the President and General Superintendent of the Stillwell Bierce & Smith Vaile Company in Dayton (which later became the Platt Iron Works Company). In 1908 he worked for the New England Refrigerator Company in Norwich, Connecticut. In 1908 he founded the Gallaudet Engineering Company in Norwich, where, as President, he did work as a mechanical and consulting engineer and, in 1909, built his first airplane. Gallaudet Engineering Company was incorporated as the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation in 1917. As a student at Yale in the Class of 1893 {{he was a member of}} Psi Upsilon and Skull and Bones. He was an Associate Fellow with the Institute of the Aeronatical Sciences, Inc., a member of the American Society of <b>Aeronautic</b> Engineers, <b>Fédération</b> Aéronautique Internationale, and a member of the Aero Club of America, Sigma X1, Engineers' Club (New York). He was a member of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences.|$|R
40|$|<b>International</b> audienceThe <b>aeronautic</b> {{industry}} requires {{high speed}} and high power spindles to obtain high material removal rates during long rough milling operations. The weakness of HSM spindle is the bearings, although high precision hybrid ball bearings {{have been developed}} to achieve this critical application. Inadequate use of spindles inevitably leads to shortened lifetimes. Choosing the operating conditions is a required step before machining applications. It can be achieved through either experimental tests or numerical modeling that leads to stability lobe diagrams. Stability of cuts relies on the dynamic behavior of the spindle, which is particularly due to the eigenfrequencies of the tool-shaft assembly. The frequencies depend on bearing stiffness that can change under operating conditions. That is why the impact of cutting conditions and bearing parameters on its stiffness are studied in the paper. A five degrees of freedom model of angular ball bearing is briefly presented. A complete bearing model is introduced. The originality of the approach is the complete technological modeling, notably of the radial expansions of inner and outer rings of bearing. A non-linear expression is established from continuum mechanics model. The influence of geometry of bearing, operating conditions and design parameters of spindle on the bearing stiffness are established and analysed. Then, modal analyses of the tool-spindle assembly are carried out in relation to the varying bearing stiffness. Finally, significance of the approach is demonstrated through the analyses of Frequency Response Function...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{the results of the study}} conducted by the authors at the request of the EADS Group and a discussion about the European Culture concept and organizational identity. It is based upon 313 questionnaires administered via the company Intranet to the group's key managers and directors. It highlights a number of specific cultural and managerial trends within the group and examines their relationship to the company's economic performance. Our analysis shows that EADS is characterised chiefly by a European ideology. However, in many instances, the actual company values are very close to the Anglo-Saxon cultural model Throughout the period 2000 - 2004, the EADS Group displayed remarkable economic performance characterised by a significant increase in sales, improved market share, with a leading <b>international</b> position in <b>aeronautic</b> industry for 2004, and ambitious industrial projects notably with the A 380. In the same period, the Top Management tried to create an “ad hoc” identity around the EADS Organization, in complement of the already existing identities of the subsidiaries. Within this context, the directors of the EADS Group decided to carry out an analysis of their company's cultural characteristics in order to better understand the management style at play and the perceived values of the company's key directors and managers...|$|R
