2500|$|The {{standard}} dimensions for a box stall (called a [...] "box" [...] in the UK, and a [...] "stall" [...] in the USA) {{vary from}} 10' by 12' to 14' by 14', depending on local cultural traditions, the breed of horse, gender, and any special needs. Mares with foals often {{are kept in}} <b>double</b> <b>stalls.</b> Stallions, kept alone with less access to turnout, are also often given larger quarters. [...] Ponies sometimes are kept in smaller box stalls, and warmbloods or draft horses may need larger ones. [...] Horses kept in stables need daily exercise and may develop stable vices {{if they are not}} given work or turnout. [...] Box stalls usually contain a layer of absorbent bedding such as straw or wood shavings and need to be cleaned daily; a horse generates approximately [...] of manure and several gallons of urine each day.

There are health risks to the horse if forced to stand all day in its own waste.However, stables are built as much for the convenience of humans as horses; most healthy horses are equally, if not more, comfortable in a field or paddock with a simple three-sided shed that protects them from the elements.|$|E

40|$|This report {{concerns}} {{development and}} validation of a 2 d testing facility for airfoil pressure measurements. The VELUX open jet wind tunnel was {{used with a}} test stand inserted. Reynolds Numbers until 1. 3 million were achieved with an airfoil chord of 0. 45 m. The aerodynamic load coefficients were found from pressure distribution measurements and the total drag coefficient was calculated from wake rake measurements. Stationary inflow as well as dynamic inflow through pitching motion was possible. Wind tunnel corrections were applied for streamline curvature and down-wash. Even though the wind tunnel is not ideal for 2 d testing, {{the overall quality of}} the flow was acceptable with a uniform flow field at the test stand position and a turbulence intensity of 1 % at the inlet of the test section. Reference values for free stream static and total pressure were found upstream of the test stand. The NACA 63 - 215 airfoil was tested and the results were compared with measurements from FFA and NACA. The measurements agreed well except for lift coefficient values at high angles of attack and the drag coefficient values at low angles of attack, that were slightly high. Comparisons of the measured results with numerical predictions from the XFOIL code and the EllipSys 2 D code showed good agreement. Measurements with the airfoil in pitching motion were carried out to study the dynamic aerodynamic coefficients. Steady inflow measurements at high angles of attack were used to investigate the <b>double</b> <b>stall</b> phenomenon...|$|R
6000|$|The police {{reported}} officially {{that three}} thousand people {{were turned away}} from the hall last night. I doubt if they were so numerous as that, but they carried in the outer doors and pitched into Dolby with great vigour. I need not add that every corner of the place was crammed. They were a very fine audience, and took enthusiastically every point in [...] "Copperfield" [...] and the [...] "Trial." [...] They made the reading {{a quarter of an hour}} longer than usual. One man advertised in the morning paper that he would give thirty shillings (<b>double)</b> for three <b>stalls,</b> but nobody would sell, and he didn't get in.|$|R
50|$|Batak Toba culture centres on Lake Toba and {{the sacred}} island of Samosir that lies within it. Jabu is the Toba {{language}} word for rumah adat. The houses {{are made up}} of three sections. A substructure of large wooden pillars resting on flat stones (or concrete nowadays) protects the structure from rising damp. Some of these pillars support longitudinal beams known as labe-labe, which run the length of the house at head height to carry the massive roof. Other pillars carry two large beams with carved singa heads which, with two lateral beams mortised into them, form a great ring beam bearing the small living area. The substructure is strengthened by beams mortised into the piles which <b>double</b> as night <b>stalls</b> for cattle. Walls are lightweight and lean outwards and provide additional stability to the structure. The wall and the wall plate supporting the rafters hang from the labe-labe with rattan cord, while the base of the wall sits on the ring beam. The rafters spring from the wall plate and are angled outwards producing the roof curve. In lieu of horizontal bracing battens, diagonal ties - running {{from the middle of the}} labe-labe to the gable ends - provide reinforcement.|$|R
50|$|The chapel {{contains}} a <b>double</b> row of <b>stalls</b> {{facing each other}} in collegiate fashion. The west door {{is surrounded by a}} doorcase consisting of carved Corinthian pilasters and an entablature. The reredos contains two twisted Solomonic columns framing panels containing the Ten Commandments, and outside them are panels with the Lord's Prayer and the Creed. At the top of the reredos is an open pediment enclosing a flaming urn. Above the central panels is a cartouche, and over the side panels are smaller closed pediments. The sanctuary is paved with black and white marble. The roof is in five bays. The wooden font dates from the 17th century. It has an octagonal base, a richly carved circular bowl, and a dome-shaped cover. From the roof hangs an eight-branch candelabrum. In the chapel is a wall tomb to Sir James Altham, who died in 1616, and his last wife Helen, who died in 1638. It consists of two praying figures facing each other in an alabaster and marble frame, consisting of Corinthian columns and an open segmental pediment containing a cartouche flanked by obelisks. At the west end is a marble memorial tablet to John Askill Bucknall dated 1797 by C. Regnant.|$|R
40|$|Since 1980, {{the number}} of undernourished people in eastern and {{southern}} Africa has more than <b>doubled.</b> Rural development <b>stalled</b> and rural poverty expanded during the 1990 s. Population growth remains very high and declining per capita agricultural capacity retards progress towards Millennium Development goals. Analyses of in situ station data and satellite observations of precipitation identify another problematic trend. Main growing season rainfall receipts have diminished by approximately 15 % in food insecure countries clustered along the western rim of the Indian Ocean. Occurring during the main growing seasons in poor countries dependent on rain fed agriculture, these declines are societally dangerous. Will they persist or intensify? Tracing moisture deficits upstream to an anthropogenically warming Indian Ocean leads us to conclude that further rainfall declines are likely. We present analyses suggesting that warming in the central Indian Ocean disrupts onshore moisture transports, reducing continental rainfall. Thus late 20 th century anthropogenic Indian Ocean warming has probably already produced societally dangerous climate change by creating drought and social disruption {{in some of the}} world's most fragile food economies. We quantify the potential impacts of the observed precipitation and agricultural capacity trends by modeling millions of undernourished people as a function of rainfall, population, cultivated area, seed and fertilizer use. Persistence of current tendencies may result in a 50 % increase in undernourished people. On the other hand, modest increases in per capita agricultural productivity could more than offset the observed precipitation declines. Investing in agricultural development can help mitigate climate change while decreasing rural poverty and vulnerability...|$|R
