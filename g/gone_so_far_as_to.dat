5|$|Former President of the United States Barack Obama {{has said}} that The Wire is his {{favorite}} television series. The 2010 Nobel Prize in Literature Laureate, Mario Vargas Llosa, wrote a very positive critical review of the series in the Spanish journal El País. The comedian turned mayor of Reykjavík, Iceland, Jón Gnarr, has <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> say {{that he would not}} enter a coalition government with anyone who has not watched the series.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the plot of Cars bears a {{striking}} resemblance to that of Doc Hollywood, the 1991 romantic comedy which stars Michael J. Fox as a hotshot young doctor, who, after causing a traffic accident in a small town, is sentenced to work at the town hospital, {{falls in love with a}} local law student and eventually acquires an appreciation for small town values. Some have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> say that the makers of Cars plagiarized the script of Doc Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 {{during an}} {{interview}} with Eddie Trunk, King declared that, while Hanneman still had not {{been involved with the}} album, the band was waiting for label issues to be resolved before recording. King stated that he and Lombardo had eight songs that they were working on, as well. When asked about whether or not Exodus guitarist Gary Holt, who had been filling in for Hanneman during live shows, would play on the record, King denied it, saying that he would handle all guitars except for Hanneman's lead parts. King also said that Hanneman had yet to offer up any material for the album. Araya later contradicted King's statement about Hanneman and stated that Hanneman had been working on material for the album. Shortly after Hanneman's death, Araya revealed that Hanneman had <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> send Araya music that he had been working on, and Araya later said that some of this material—including an outtake from World Painted Blood—may make it onto the album.|$|E

5|$|The clade Oviraptorosauria is {{generally}} regarded {{as a group of}} non-avian (or non-bird) theropod dinosaurs, and their similarity to birds (Aves) has often been noted. Fossils of oviraptorosaurs in the family Caenagnathidae have historically been confused with those of birds, and some researchers have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> consider oviraptorosaurs as a whole more closely related to birds than to other non-avian dinosaurs. In 2002 Lü and colleagues used the then unnamed Nemegtomaia to show similarities between birds and oviraptorosaurs, and found the latter group to be closer to birds than to bird-like dinosaurs such as dromaeosaurs. They therefore concluded that oviraptorosaurs were flightless birds rather than non-avian dinosaurs, and noted that the boundary between birds and dinosaurs was becoming more and more difficult to delineate. Other researchers have instead found dromaeosaurs and troodontids to be most closely related to birds, together forming the group Paraves; oviraptorosaurs, therizinosaurs, and alvarezsaurs are just outside this group. The wider group that includes oviraptorosaurs and Paraves is called Pennaraptora, and this group is defined by the presence of pennaceous feathers (feathers with a stalk).|$|E
25|$|For {{some social}} {{constructionism}} {{has been described}} as a source of the postmodern movement, and has been influential in the field of cultural studies. Some have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> attribute the rise of cultural studies (the cultural turn) to social constructionism.|$|E
25|$|Commentators such as Leo Strauss have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> name Machiavelli as the {{deliberate}} originator of modernity itself. Others {{have argued that}} Machiavelli is only a particularly interesting example of trends which were happening around him. In any case Machiavelli presented himself at various times as someone reminding Italians of the old virtues of the Romans and Greeks, and other times as someone promoting a completely new approach to politics.|$|E

25|$|There are six extant {{subspecies}} {{of golden}} eagle that differ slightly {{in size and}} plumage. Individuals of any race are somewhat variable and the differences between subspecies are clinal, {{especially in terms of}} body size. Other than these characteristics, there is little variation across the range of the species. Some recent studies have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> propose that only two subspecies be recognized based on genetic markers: Aquila chrysaetos chrysaetos (including A. c. homeyeri) and A. c. canadensis (including the races A. c. japonica, A. c. daphanea and A. c. kamtschatica).|$|E
25|$|However, not all law {{enforcement}} agencies have been as critical; many CSIs have responded positively to the show's influence and enjoy their new reputation. In the UK, scenes of crime officers now commonly refer to themselves as CSIs. Some constabularies, such as Norfolk, have even <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> {{change the name of}} the unit to Crime Scene Investigation. Also, recruitment and training programs have seen a massive increase in applicants, with a far wider range of people now interested in something previously regarded as a scientific backwater.|$|E

25|$|The Blytt-Sernander {{classification}} {{has been}} used as a temporal framework for the archaeological cultures of Europe and America. Some have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> identify stages of technology in north Europe with specific periods; however, this approach is an oversimplification not generally accepted. There is no reason, for example, why the north Europeans should stop using bronze and start using iron abruptly at the lower boundary of the Subatlantic at 600 BC. In the warm Atlantic period, Denmark was occupied by Mesolithic cultures, rather than Neolithic, notwithstanding the climatic evidence. Moreover, the technology stages vary widely globally.|$|E
25|$|Other theorems have a known {{proof that}} cannot easily be written down. The most {{prominent}} examples are the four color theorem and the Kepler conjecture. Both of these theorems are only {{known to be}} true by reducing them to a computational search that is then verified by a computer program. Initially, many mathematicians did not accept this form of proof, but {{it has become more}} widely accepted. The mathematician Doron Zeilberger has even <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> claim that these are possibly the only nontrivial results that mathematicians have ever proved. Many mathematical theorems can be reduced to more straightforward computation, including polynomial identities, trigonometric identities and hypergeometric identities.|$|E
25|$|In April 1967 MACSOG {{was ordered}} to {{commence}} Operation DANIEL BOONE, a cross-border recon effort in Cambodia. Both SOG and the 5th Special Forces Group had been preparing for just such an eventuality. The 5th had <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> create Projects B-56 Sigma and B-50 Omega, units based on SOG's SHINING BRASS organization, which had been conducting in-country recon {{efforts on behalf of}} the Field Forces, awaiting authorization to begin the Cambodian operations. A turf war now raged between the 5th and SOG over missions and manpower. The Joint Chiefs decided in favor of MACSOG, since it already successfully conducted covert cross-border operations. Operational control of Sigma and Omega was eventually handed over to SOG.|$|E

25|$|The {{popularity}} of Conway's Game of Life was helped by its coming into being {{just in time}} {{for a new generation of}} inexpensive computer access which were being released into the market. The game could be run for hours on these machines, which would otherwise have remained unused at night. In this respect, it foreshadowed the later {{popularity of}} computer-generated fractals. For many, Life was simply a programming challenge: a fun way to use otherwise wasted CPU cycles. For some, however, Life had more philosophical connotations. It developed a cult following through the 1970s and beyond; current developments have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> create theoretic emulations of computer systems within the confines of a Life board.|$|E
25|$|With her {{accession}} to power, Messalina enters history {{with a reputation}} as ruthless, predatory and sexually insatiable. Her husband is represented as easily led by her and unconscious of her many adulteries. In 48 AD, he went away on a trip and was informed when he returned that Messalina had <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> marry her latest lover, Senator Gaius Silius. While many would have ordered her death, the Emperor offered her another chance. Seeing that as weakness, one of his head officers went behind the Emperor's back and ordered Messalina's death. Upon hearing the news, the Emperor did not react and simply asked for another chalice of wine. The Roman Senate then ordered a damnatio memoriae so that Messalina's name would be removed from all public and private places and all statues of her would be taken down.|$|E
25|$|While staff {{accommodation}} {{continues to be}} built for hotels and similar buildings, in domestic use it has declined along with the numbers of staff kept. This major decline began in Europe following World War I. In Europe many owners of large mansions have <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> demolish whole service wings. Queen Elizabeth II made this decision at Sandringham House in the 1980s, while at West Wycombe Park the roofless former service wing now contains a garden. In many other houses {{open to the public}} the former servants' domains are now restaurants, shops and offices, while the bedrooms are let to holiday makers and tourists. Where staff are retained in private houses, {{they are more likely to}} live in purpose-built apartments created from the former servants' quarters, or as at Woburn Abbey converted from former stables; at Woburn the servants' attic bedrooms have now been altered to provide more spacious bedrooms for the use of the owners, thus providing a retreat and privacy from the paying public viewing the rooms below.|$|E

25|$|Currently the Fiero has a cult {{following}} {{of owners}} and customizers. While all Fiero models {{are considered to}} be collectible, the 1988 model year is particularly sought after by collectors due to its limited production numbers and vastly improved underpinnings. Because of an abundance of replacement parts available from other General Motors vehicles, there are many upgrades {{that can be done to}} improve performance and reliability of the cars. Additionally, a multitude of different General Motors engines have been installed by enthusiasts, from the Quad-4 engine to the Chevrolet small-block V8 to the Cadillac 4.9L and Northstar V8s. The GM 3800 Supercharged is also a very popular choice, as well as the 3.4L found in the 1993, 1994, or 1995 Camaro/Firebird. One shop in particular that pioneered and now specializes in V8 installations has even <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> install the famed Z06 Corvette powerplant, the 505horsepower LS7, into a Fiero. Installation of the 4.9L V8 or smaller engines is possible with few modifications to the car itself, because Fiero prototypes were tested with a similar small aluminum V8 prior to production. As a result, the engine bay is large enough to accommodate engines of that size.|$|E
500|$|On release, certain Riesling wines {{reveal a}} {{striking}} petrol note (goût de pétrole in French) which is sometimes described with associations to kerosene, lubricant or rubber. While {{an integral part}} of the aroma profile of mature Riesling and sought after by many experienced drinkers, it may be off-putting to those unaccustomed to it, and those who primarily seek young and fruity aromas in their wine. The negative attitude to petrol aromas in young Riesling, and the preference for fruitier young wines of this variety, seem more common in Germany than in Alsace or on the export market, and some German producers, especially the volume-oriented ones, have even <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> consider the petrol notes a defect which they try to avoid, even at the cost of producing wines that are less suited to extended cellar aging. In that vein, the German Wine Institute has <b>gone</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> omit the mentioning of [...] "petrol" [...] as a possible aroma on their German-language Wine Aroma Wheel, which is supposed to be specially adapted to German wines, and despite the fact that professor Ann C. Noble had included petrol in her original version of the wheel.|$|E
