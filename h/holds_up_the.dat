5|$|Trees {{have their}} roots {{in the ground and}} their trunk and {{branches}} extended towards the sky. This concept is found in many of the world's religions as a tree which links the underworld and the earth and <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> heavens. In Norse mythology, Yggdrasil is a central cosmic tree whose roots and branches extend to various worlds. Various creatures live on it. In India, Kalpavriksha is a wish-fulfilling tree, one of the nine jewels that emerged from the primitive ocean. Icons are placed beneath it to be worshipped, tree nymphs inhabit the branches and it grants favours to the devout who tie threads round the trunk. Democracy started in North America when the Great Peacemaker formed the Iroquois Confederacy, inspiring the warriors of the original five American nations to bury their weapons under the Tree of Peace, an eastern white pine (Pinus strobus). In the creation story in the Bible, the tree of life and the knowledge of good and evil was planted by God in the Garden of Eden.|$|E
5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square bishop, to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:At first sight the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic significance. It <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E
25|$|Giants also {{abound in}} Greek mythology and in medieval Scandinavian myth and saga. The Icelandic outlaw Grettir {{encounters}} a giant behind a waterfall in a 13th-century Icelandic tale. Odysseus encounters many giants, {{before returning to}} his home of Ithaca in the mysterious boat of King Alcinous. Hercules visits the Garden of the Hesperides in the far west of the world, near to where the giant Atlas <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sky.|$|E

25|$|The triumphal arches were {{crafted by}} Rock of Ages Corporation. Sculptor Raymond Kaskey created the bronze eagles and wreaths that were {{installed}} under the arches, {{as well as}} 24 bronze bas-relief panels that depict wartime scenes of combat and the home front. The bronzes were cast {{over the course of}} {{two and a half years}} at Laran Bronze in Chester, Pennsylvania. The stainless-steel armature that <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> eagles and wreaths was designed at Laran, in part by sculptor James Peniston, and fabricated by Apex Piping of Newport, Delaware.|$|E
25|$|Mmuo {{is a broad}} {{class of}} minor spirits or divinities manifesting in natural {{elements}} under the class of elder divinities with major cults. Feminine mmuo inhabit earth and water and masculine mmuo inhabit fire and air. This class {{can be broken down}} by the alusi, serviceable mmuo, agwu are related to unusual and deranged human behaviours, these spirits interact with human in a capricious nature that often makes them dangerous. Other cult deities exist around Igboland such as Njoku Ji, yam and fire deity overseeing agriculture, Idemili, 'the pillar of water', the female alusi based in Idemili North and South who <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> waters, and Mkpataku the 'bringer of wealth' or 'coming in of wealth'. In addition to minor spirits there are evil wondering spirits of wrong doers called ogbonuke.|$|E

500|$|... "Survivor Man" [...] {{received}} a 4.9/7 in the Nielsen ratings, meaning that 4.9 {{percent of households}} were tuned in {{at any given moment}} and seven percent of all televisions in use were tuned in to the program. The episode was watched by 8.29 million viewers and achieved a 4.3/10 in the ages 18–49 demographic. Travis Fickett of IGN stated that [...] "Overall, this isn't a terrific episode, but <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> show's usual standard. Steve Carell is hilarious as usual. Watching him attempt to make shelter and clothing out of his suit over the span of only a few hours is great fun." [...] Fickett also stated that {{a good portion of the}} humor in the episode came from in-jokes that required previous knowledge of the series, specifically pointing out the parallel comparison between Michael and Jim's lives. [...] Like Fickett, Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode's comparison between Michael and Jim. [...] Fenno also went on to praise other points of the episode, stating she also enjoyed the overall episode for its [...] "just outdoorsiness with Michael and Dwight, and infighting among the rest of the staff." [...] Oscar Dahl, a Senior Writer for BuddyTV, stated that [...] "What seems like a one and done episode without much character work at first turns into much more by the end." [...] Dahl went on to praise the episode, stating that it was [...] "lighter" [...] in comparison to Carell's previous episode [...] "Casino Night".|$|E
500|$|The Doctor {{picks up}} Clara and takes {{her back to}} Latimer's mansion, placing her under medical care of Strax. He {{collects}} the ice fragments from the governess and places them in a souvenir London Underground biscuit tin. He and Vastra travel to Simeon's lab, where the Doctor notes the Intelligence's plan to replace humanity with ice creatures and <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tin with the necessary DNA. Dr Simeon grabs the tin and opens it {{only to find the}} memory worm, which latches on to him. The Doctor states that the Great Intelligence, which has been existing as a mirror of Dr Simeon's thoughts, will vanish with the erasure of Simeon's memories. Instead, the Intelligence reveals that it existed long enough that it can now control Simeon's body, which it uses to attack Vastra and the Doctor. The influence of the Great Intelligence quickly wanes, and Simeon falls dead. Outside, a salt-water rain has started, and the Doctor sees that another psychic ability has taken control of the snow from the Great Intelligence: the Latimer family, crying for Clara. Strax informs the Doctor upon his return to the Latimer mansion that Clara only has moments left, and she passes away as the Doctor returns the TARDIS key to her. At her funeral, the Doctor reads Clara's full name on her tombstone and realises she is the woman he met in [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] who became a Dalek, whom he refers to as [...] "Soufflé Girl". He gleefully announces that a person dying twice is an impossibility and, bidding farewell to his allies for now, the Doctor departs in the TARDIS to investigate and find Clara. The episode concludes in contemporary times, where a young woman resembling Clara walks through the same graveyard, pausing by Clara's tombstone.|$|E

[...] The lantern is a bit less than seven meters tall and, “…is equal to the height of the dome it surmounts,”. The lantern metaphorically expresses the themes of death and resurrection. The lantern is where the soul could escape and go from “…death to the afterlife.”.|$|E

The arch also represents the once divided nation coming together, inspired by the South African Flag. The arch consists of a 5×5m steel hollow box and weighs 2,600 tonnes. A funicular carries visitors from {{the north side of the}} stadium to a viewing platform at the top of the arch, offering a view over city and ocean. The south side features a 550-step adventure walk.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his book}} titled Technoliberalism, Adam Fish {{describes}} technoliberalism as {{a belief that}} networked technologies ameliorate the contradictions of a society that cherishes both the free market of economic liberalism and the social welfare of social liberalism. In this manner, technoliberalism has some links to neo-liberalism, yet with some core differences; [...] "While Adam Smith conceived of a market that was in a way a natural and ineradicable {{part of the landscape}} (based on the human propensity 'to truck, barter and exchange'), and neoliberal thought continues to see the market in this way, technoliberalism <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> idea that such complex systems can be contrived in their entirety" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{main part}} of the Cathedral's first floor is the Commons Room, called one of the [...] "great {{architectural}} fantasies of the twentieth century", is a fifteenth-century English perpendicular Gothic-style hall that covers half an acre (2,000m2) and extends upwards four stories, reaching [...] tall. The room was a gift of Andrew Mellon. It is a piece of true Gothic architecture; no steel supports were used in the construction of its arches. Each arch is a true arch, and they support their own weight. Each base for the arches weighs five tons, and it is said that they are so firmly placed that each could hold a large truck. The large central piers act only as screens for the structural steel that <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> upper floors of the building.|$|E
2500|$|Kovel {{believes}} that examples like the Christian Bruderhof Communities (despite elements of patriarchy that he attacks) show that [...] "communistic" [...] organizations can [...] "survive rather {{well in a}} heavily industrialized market" [...] if they are [...] "protected" [...] from the dependence on the market by [...] "anti-capitalist intentionality". He further posits that class struggle is [...] "internationalized {{in the face of}} globalization", as evidenced by a wave of strikes across the Global South {{in the first half of}} the year 2000; indeed, he says that [...] "labor's most cherished values are already immanently ecocentric". Kovel therefore thinks that these universalizing tendencies must lead to the formation of [...] "a consciously 'Ecosocialist Party'" [...] that is neither like a parliamentary or vanguardist party. Instead, Kovel advocates a form of political party [...] "grounded in communities of resistance", where delegates from these communities form the core of the party's activists, and these delegates and the [...] "open and transparent" [...] assembly they form are subject to recall and regular rotation of members. He <b>holds</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) and the Gaviotas movement as examples of such communities, which [...] "are produced outside capitalist circuits" [...] and show that [...] "there can be no single way valid for all peoples". Nonetheless, he also firmly believes in connecting these movements, stating that [...] "ecosocialism will be international or it will be nothing" [...] and hoping that the Ecosocialist Party can retain the autonomy of local communities while supporting them materially. With an ever-expanding party, Kovel hopes that [...] "defections" [...] by capitalists will occur, leading eventually to the armed forces and police who, in joining the revolution, will signify that [...] "the turning point is reached".|$|E
