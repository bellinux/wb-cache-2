5|$|Meanwhile, Tom (Aziz Ansari) asks Andy (Chris Pratt), April (Aubrey Plaza), Jerry (Jim O'Heir) and Donna (Retta) to {{participate}} in a new game show called Know Ya Boo, that he is hoping to pitch to networks; he admits that it is a rip-off of The Newlywed Game. It quickly becomes clear that Jerry and Donna <b>know</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> about each other than the recently married Andy and April. When April reveals her favorite band is Neutral Milk Hotel and not Andy's band Mouse Rat, Andy angrily leaves the game and they later have a big fight which causes him to quit his music. April seeks advice from Ann because, although she dislikes her, Ann previously dated Andy for several years. Ann tells April she has to be supportive of Andy no matter how she feels. The next day, April brings the other members of Mouse Rat to city hall and surprises Andy by singing one of his songs. A thrilled Andy reconciles with April.|$|E

2500|$|Far from [...] "disregarding {{principles}} {{of due process}} and the jury trial right," [...] O'Connor argued, the guidelines system honored them. Under the former sentencing scheme, a defendant like Blakely could have received anything from probation to 10 years in prison. Under the guidelines, he knows what range of sentence he might receive based on the conduct in which he engaged. [...] "Criminal defendants still face the same statutory maximum sentences, but they now at least <b>know,</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than before, the real consequences of their actions." [...] The guidelines also reduce disparities, particularly those based on race, which was a concern of some critics of the pre-guidelines system.|$|E

'Well, I don't know,' {{said his}} wife, 'our clerk is tremendously learned, and <b>knows</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> than his Paternoster, and I could almost {{believe that he}} might be able to teach Peter to talk, for Peter has a wonderfully good head too.

60|$|If I succeed, {{one point}} {{will be made}} probable.
