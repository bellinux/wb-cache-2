5|$|A view {{of part of}} Albany, New York, {{as it was in}} 1814 shows {{a mixture}} of Dutch, English and Federal styles, {{although}} Dutch brick was reportedly used for one of the English-style houses. One house in the Dutch style was said to date from the American Revolution. If so, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last genuine Dutch-style houses to be built in the United States, reflecting the conservative Dutch culture of Albany at that time.|$|E
5|$|At 04:40, HMAS Canberra {{recorded}} {{that the}} Japanese may have fired torpedoes at her. This may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> many false alarms throughout the night. However, M-21 {{had attempted to}} fire its two torpedoes, but failed because of damage to the bow either from HMAS Yandras ramming or depth charges, or a possible collision with USS Chicago, making it possible that M-21 attempted to attack the cruiser. The observer aboard Canberra may have seen bubbles from the compressed air released to fire the torpedoes.|$|E

5|$|Gedi's {{location}} {{along the}} coast and association with similar sites along the Swahili Coast made it an important trade center. Although there are few historical documents specifically associating Gedi with Indian Ocean trade, the site is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important sites {{along the coast}}. Gedi's architecture and an abundance of imported material culture including pottery, beads, and coins provide evidence of the city's rising prosperity {{over the course of}} its occupation from as early as the eleventh century to its abandonment in the early seventeenth century.|$|E
5|$|Krugers is {{recorded}} {{as having been}} active in film in the mid-1920s, leading the laboratory at N.V. Java Film. He may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> its founders, together with the Dutchman L.Heuveldorp. The company exclusively produced documentaries until 1926, when Heuveldorp directed the colony's first feature film, Loetoeng Kasaroeng. Krugers served as a cameraman for the film, {{which was based on}} a Sundanese folktale, also processing the film in his laboratory in Bandung.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, occasionally, the narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which is known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E

5|$|Operationally, the National Hurricane Center {{determined}} if the non-tropical {{low that}} absorbed Nicholas {{developed into a}} tropical or subtropical storm, it would be named Odette. In post-season analysis, the center considered classifying the system as an unnumbered tropical depression, though lack of sufficient characteristics of a tropical depression prevented the classification. If Nicholas had attained hurricane status, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> eight tropical cyclones to reach hurricane status in October in the deep tropical Atlantic since 1900.|$|E
5|$|She {{inherited}} {{her beauty}} and singing voice from her mother, a former operatic contralto and successful women's clothier who in her younger years was widely considered to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Ireland's most beautiful women. O'Hara noted that whenever her mother left the house, men would leave their houses {{just so they}} could {{catch a glimpse of}} her in the street. O'Hara's siblings were Peggy, the oldest, and younger Charles, Florrie, Margot, and Jimmy. Peggy dedicated her life to a religious order, becoming a Sister of Charity.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of Reuleaux polygons shows that diameter measurements alone cannot verify that an object has a circular cross-section. Overlooking this fact {{may have played}} a role in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, as the roundness of sections of the rocket in that launch was tested only by measuring different diameters, and off-round shapes may cause unusually high stresses that could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the factors causing the disaster.|$|E

5|$|The kulintang gong {{itself is}} {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those foreign musical elements incorporated into kulintang music, derived from the Sundanese kolenang due to its striking similarities.

Even the word kulintang {{is believed to}} be just an altered form of the Sundanese word kolenang.|$|E
5|$|The plot {{key to the}} {{eventual}} rescue plan undertaken is that a lone JPL astrodynamicist suddenly comes up with an out-of-nowhere idea about using gravity assist to get astronauts back to Mars faster and then has to convince layers of NASA management that this could work. In reality, gravity assist is a well-known practice {{that has been used}} on a number of unmanned planetary exploration missions and served as a backup strategy on manned Apollo missions.

5|$|The {{suicide of}} Nero on 9 June 68 brought the Julio-Claudian dynasty to an end, {{leading to the}} chaotic Year of the Four Emperors, which saw the {{successive}} {{rise and fall of}} the emperors Galba, Otho and Vitellius, until the accession of Vespasian on 21 December 69. Virtually nothing is known of Nerva's whereabouts during 69, but despite the fact that Otho was his brother-in-law, he appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the earliest and strongest supporters of the Flavians.|$|E
5|$|Thomas is also speculated to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the driving}} forces behind the Battle of the Neva, a disputed Swedish-Novgorodian {{conflict}} {{that took place}} in 1240. The speculation is based on the 14th-century Russian Primary Chronicle mention of Finns and Tavastians fighting on the Swedish side, which according to some historians would have been organized by the bishop. However, as the Chronicle also lists the very unlikely Norwegians as allies, the information is often regarded as mid-14th century propaganda, depicting Sweden as being in control of Norway, Finland and Tavastia.|$|E
