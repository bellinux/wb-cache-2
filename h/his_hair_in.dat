5|$|Promotional {{activities}} halted after G-Dragon {{tested positive}} for marijuana. Though a urine test back in August came back negative, a weak positive for marijuana was detected from testing the content of <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> October. Since {{it was his first}} recorded offence with a minuscule amount of the drug, it resulted in an indictment and he was not charged. He later claimed to have accepted an offered cigarette from a fan in Japan during a party back in May, but after realizing it was not a normal cigarette, threw it away. Because he was not charged, he did not lose any endorsers and made his first public appearance after the scandal at the 2011 MTV EMAs with his group.|$|E

Observing his newfound popularity, two marketing executives try to persuade Krusty to endorse a new sport utility vehicle called the Canyonero.

Despite Psicosis announcing before the event that he would be betting <b>his</b> <b>hair</b> <b>in</b> case of a loss in the Parejas Suicidas match, it was announced that the match would be for Líder's hair and Psicosis' mask. However, before the match began, Líder attacked Psicosis and ripped his mask off, revealing his burned face and forcing the match to be changed to a Hair vs. Hair match. Towards the end of the hardcore brawl, Líder threw a garbage can into Psisocis' face as he was climbing to the top rope. However, when Líder went to suplex his opponent back down to the ring, Psicosis countered the move and dropped him with a flip piledriver through a table and a ladder, both propped up against the corner, and then pinned him to win the match. Afterwards, Psicosis continued the assault on his rival, dropping him onto a pile of thumbtacks, before having him shaved bald. After getting backstage, Líder and Psicosis continued brawling in the locker room, before being broken up by security.|$|E
