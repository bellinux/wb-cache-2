It was later seen by Campbell in 1931 in a long-tailed macaque imported from Singapore to the Calcutta School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in India. Campbell was interested in kala azar and was working under Napier. Napier inoculated the strain into three monkeys, {{one of which was}} a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta), which developed a <b>fulminating</b> <b>infection.</b> Knowing that the Protozoological Department were looking for a monkey malaria strain, they handed the original infected monkey to Biraj Mohan Das Gupta, who was the assistant of Robert Knowles. Dr Das Gupta maintained the species by serial passage in monkeys until Dr Knowles returned from leave. In 1932, Knowles and Das Gupta described the species in detail {{for the first time and}} showed that it could be transmitted to man by blood passage, but failed to name it. It was named by Sinton and Mulligan in 1932 after Dr Knowles. From early in the 1930s to 1955, P. knowlesi was used as a pyretic agent for the treatment of patients with neurosyphillis.|$|E

Little is known about their basic biological functions, including life cycle, since no species can be cultured continuously outside the mammalian lung. To better understand the pathological process, about 4500 ESTS derived from sequencing of the poly(A) tail ends of P. carinii mRNAs during <b>fulminate</b> <b>infection</b> were annotated and functionally characterized as unassembled reads, and then clustered and reduced to a unigene set with 1042 members. Because of the presence of sequences from other microbial genomes and the rat host, the analysis and compression to a unigene set was necessarily an iterative process. BLASTx analysis of the unassembled reads (UR) vs. the Uni-Prot and TREMBL databases revealed 56 % had similarities to existing polypeptides at E values of# 10 26, with the remainder lacking any significant homology. The most abundant transcripts in the UR were associated with stress responses, energy production, transcription and translation. Most (70 %) of the UR had similarities to proteins from filamentous fungi (e. g., Aspergillus, Neurospora) and existing P. carinii gene products.

40|$|Abstract. Variant- and strain-specific {{immunity}} to malaria in Saimiri monkeys infected with homologous O and R variants of the Palo Alto strain (FUPSP) of Plasmodium falciparum or by various heterologous divergent strains were studied. Following homologous reinfections, the {{primary immune response}} in monkeys was effective only against the same variant type but not against the other variant, which differed only by antigens exposed at {{the surface of the}} infected red blood cell. In contrast, after two successive inoculations with a single variant type, a variant transcending immunity developed to both O and R parasite populations. The immunity against FUPSP in monkeys repeatedly infected with various combinations of heterologous strains, including Sal I, Tanzania, Camp, FUPCP, FCH 4, FVO, and FUPCDC parasites was less effective, resulting at best in protecting the monkey against <b>fulminating</b> <b>infection.</b> However, in several cases, previous or concomitant heterologous infections modified the course of virulent infection by FUPSP parasites, indicating a significant degree of cross-protection between the strains. Therefore, in this model, while variant- and strain-specific antigens are important components of acquired {{immunity to}} malaria, the monkey immune response to infection transcends phenotypic antigenic variation and strain diversity. Immunity to malaria in humans is poorly protective and only acquired slowly after several years of exposure to in-tense transmission. It is a nonsterile immunity and require...|$|E
40|$|Background: Polymethyl {{methacrylate}} (PMMA) antibiotic beads though {{have proved}} their utility {{as a local}} antibiotic delivery system, however, there are limitations. Decalcified bone matrix (DBM) as a vehicle of antibiotics can serve the purpose, provided a minimum inhibitory concentration is sustained. Healing of the defect and avoiding the second surgery is another advantage. We studied the DBM as the delivery vehicle for vancomycin in controlling the methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis as well as healing of the cavity simultaneously in an experimental study. Materials and Methods: An in vitro {{study was conducted to}} optimize vancomycin impregnation in the DBM. For the in vivo study, a unicortical defect was created in the metaphysis of the distal femur in 18 rabbits. After contaminating the defect with MRSA, rabbits were divided into three groups. Group I (eight limbs) received no graft. Defects in group II (11 limbs) were filled with plain DBM chips and in group III (14 limbs), cavities were implanted with vancomycin-impregnated decal bone chips. Rabbits were assessed by clinical, radiological, histological, gross examination and bacterial load assay. High Performance Liquid Chromatography HPLC analysis of vancomycin in group III was done to assess the concentration in DBM chips. Results: In group I, the infection persisted throughout the period of the study. Group II showed the <b>fulminated</b> <b>infection</b> at the grafted site with DBM chips sequestrating out. Vancomycin-impregnated decal chips in group III did not show any sign of infection and eventually incorporated. The bacterial load study showed a progressive load change and HPLC revealed an effective antibiotic concentration up to 3 weeks in both in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Decal bone chips were effective as the local antibiotic delivery vehicle in preventing the MRSA osteomyelitis model. It eluted vancomycin significantly and the graft uptake was also excellent. Allogeneic decal grafts eliminated the need for second surgery and acted as an excellent delivery vehicle for antibiotics...|$|R

There {{are only a}} few reports concerning their treatment. We performed splenectomy in two patients with severe autoimmune cytopenias after allogeneic SCT resistant to immunosuppressive treatment. Patients, methods and results. First patient had unrelated alloSCT at Royal Free Hospital London for chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL) in July 2000. Post-transplant period was complicated with cytomegalovirus reactivation and septicemia. Seven months later RBC and platelet counts went down. Direct Coomb’s test was intermittently positive. She was resistant to steroids and high dose immunoglobulin. Splenectomy was performed in February 2001. After splenectomy hemoglobin concentration and platelet count improved. Her blood counts remained stable with hemoglobin about 110 g/L and platelets over 100 x 109 /L. She continued therapy with Itraconazol, Valacyclovir and Penicillin. Three months later she was readmitted for E. Coli <b>fulminated</b> septic <b>infection</b> with fatal outcome. Second patient had related alloSCT at University Medical Centre Ljubljana for CGL in January 2003. Post-transplant course was uneventful.

40|$|Master of Dental SurgeryHistory has {{recorded}} the antiquity of serious infections {{in the region}} of the head and neck. Today, our community still experiences major life-threatening infections in these anatomical locations, which pose significant management difficulties to the oral and maxillofacial surgeon. The aim of this thesis is to review the aetiology, diagnosis and treatment of some bacterial infections involving structures of the head and neck. Such infections may spread, causing serious complications with severe morbidity and occasionally death. This theses deals only with infections of bacterial origin and does not attempt to cover viral, or fungal agents or the chronic specific diseases of tuberculosis and syphilis, and makes no attempt to address the old question of focal infection. The literature review relates especially to Ludwig’s Angina which was first described so dramatically in 1836. To this day it remains as a clinically potentially lethal disease despite the progress of modern medicine. Numerous descriptions in the literature warn of the rapid appearance of symptoms and the danger of respiratory obstruction when management of the airway is not satisfactorily undertaken. Both odontogenic and non-odontogenic causes of orofacial and neck infections are reviewed. Odontogenic problems are given special emphasis as they are now of major concern. The significance of the potential fascial spaces in the face and neck which allow the spread of dental infections is also highlighter. A thorough knowledge of these anatomical relationships is still of the utmost importance to the surgeon if he is to be successful in treatment. The principle of surgical drainage of pus is as important in 1990 as it was 150 years ago. The biological basis for the onset and progress of such <b>fulminating</b> <b>infections</b> {{in the head and neck}} region is still poorly understood. One constant need is that the bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, be correctly identified. Microbiological techniques are constantly improving and provide an important adjuvant investigation, which then allows the surgeon to provide the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Principal to the many aspects of treatment is the ability to maintain the airway of the patient and to provide the depth of anaesthesia necessary to undertake the required surgery. Major bacterial orofacial infections may have severe local and far-reaching systemic effects. Such complications are discussed in all their ramifications. It should be realised that the presentation of these patients at a late stage, when complications have already supervened, may make diagnosis difficult. There is always a necessity to ensure that the underlying cause of the disease is accurately defined and that complication are not allowed to progress further. Finally, a retrospective study of the management of 90 patients with major bacterial orofacial infections who have been treated at Westmead Hospital is presented. The outcome of this study of some major bacterial orofacial infections of the head and neck is the need to stress the importance of urgent surgical management and maintenance of the airway, together with the microbiological determination of the causative organisms and their sensitivities, so that other than empirical antibiotics can be instituted early. This must be combined with an upgrading of the patients’ medical and dental status. It was demonstrated that, in the majority of these patients, ignorance and fear combined with a lack of routine dental care resulted in major infections arising from relatively simple odontogenic causes such as dental caries, periodontal disease and pericoronal infection related to impacted teeth. Without doubt, the immediate care of these patients demanded intensive management. However, it is important to recognise that dental education forms an integral part not only of the recovery programme for the afflicted patient, but also as a community health preventive measure of profound significance...|$|R

It was concluded that this was not due to impaired macrophage function but was caused by the inability of antibody production to cope with the massive parasitaemias produced by rapidly-replicating infections so that effective opsonization of the parasites did not occur. In contrast, a train of trypanosome which causes a more chronic infection, although initially having a similar replication, although initially having a similar replication rate, subsequently switched t a slower one and thereby allowed antibody to reach levels which permitted effective opsonization. There was no evidence that the parasite caused any significant suppression of antibody responses in these acute infections since inoculation with trypanosomes of one stock {{at the same time as}} vaccination with irradiated organisms of a second stock did not prevent the development of antibody to the latter, as measured by the hepatic uptake of radiolabelled parasites...|$|R

The correlation with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection with mucosa associated lymphoepithelial tumor (MALT) is now well documented {{and some of the}} low grade MALT can be cured sorely by triple agent eradication therapy. The most common type of PGL is diffuse large B cell lymphoma which now can be successfully treated with chemotherapy alone. There is still no consensus on the optimal treatment for PGL. In the recent 10 years chemotherapy combined with anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody such as rituximab, achieved higher complete response rate and more than 80 % are long-term survival. The so-called R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristin, prednisolone) now become the new gold standard therapy. The role of surgical resection prior to chemotherapy is controversial and not commonly applied in recent publications. Yet some cases of suboptimal response to R-CHOP or patient is too fragile to tolerate the immuno-chemotherapy will be feasible to surgical resection as a salvage or alternative therapy.

Swelling was also observed in the hind paws of hamsters infused with only Mphi-FBb or only enriched populations of either immune or naive T lymphocytes after infection with B. burgdorferi. However, the swelling detected in these hamsters was less severe and of shorter duration. In addition, hamsters receiving both macrophages not exposed to Formalin-inactivated B. burgdorferi (Mphi-NFBb) and enriched populations of either immune or naive T lymphocytes failed to develop severe swelling after infection with B. burgdorferi.
