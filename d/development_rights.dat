5|$|In 1988, Chicago Mayor Harold Washington {{approved}} a $24million subsidy to FJV Venture to develop Block 37. There were {{a series of}} subsequent alternate redevelopment plans. Among the prior redevelopment plans for the block were the original Block 37 Towers, for which the original block was demolished and which included a 47-story tower designed by Murphy/Jahn, Inc. Another failed plan was a Solomon Cordwell Buenz plan including a 711-foot 66-story residential tower and a 12-story Marriott Hotel towering over a 4-story retail base. This had followed the 39-story Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates design scheduled for 2004 completion. The developments fell through, which put the property back into the city's possession. In 2002, the city initiated a competition for the <b>development</b> <b>rights</b> to the property. In 2004, the city sold the property to Mills Corp. at a $20million loss. Mills sold the <b>development</b> <b>rights</b> to Joseph Freed and Associates in 2005, when the city committed $42million in tax-increment funding. In 2007, the city learned the development was $150million over budget. The complex was originally being developed by commercial real estate developer Mills Corporation, {{best known for its}} ownership of numerous super-regional shopping malls. However, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC has inherited the <b>development</b> <b>rights.</b>|$|E

5|$|Lenders, {{including}} Bank of America, {{moved to}} foreclose on the retail and transit {{portion of the}} mixed-use development on October 19, 2009, because the developer, Joseph Freed and Associates LLC, ran out of money. Freed technically defaulted in March. With cost overruns exceeding $34million as of August 25, Freed owes $128.5million on a $205million construction loan, according to a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court. On November 3, the developer announced it had landed 13 new tenants to open within the succeeding few months. On November 20, a circuit court judge stripped Freed of the <b>development</b> <b>rights</b> and turn the responsibility over to CB Richard Ellis. On the same day a partial occupancy permit for the underground pedway connecting the red line and the blue line {{as well as the}} first floor retail space was granted. Freed claimed that the loan payments were current and that the default was based on a technicality. As receiver, CB Richard Ellis was scheduled to file a status report with the court December 8 and a full report, including financials, on January 15, 2010. In March 2011, Bank of America acquired the $206 million property with a credit bid of $100 million at a sheriff's foreclosure sale. Then in February 2012, CIM Group was expected to close on a negotiated purchase of the entire 305,000-square-foot shopping center from Bank of America Corp.|$|E
5|$|Like most stadiums {{demolished}} {{during this}} time whose replacements were located nearby (including the Civic Arena over a decade later), the site of Three Rivers Stadium mostly became a parking lot.
