25|$|After the {{introduction}} of iOS 7 in June 2013, Apple began using an extra-thin weight of <b>Helvetica</b> Neue for the user interface of iOS 7, arousing numerous complaints about the less legible typography. For the final release of the operating system, Apple changed the system's font to a slightly thicker weight of <b>Helvetica</b> Neue, although some have complained that readability is still compromised compared to the font weight used in former versions of iOS. Older iOS devices continue to use <b>Helvetica</b> or <b>Helvetica</b> Neue in regular font weights that display with higher contrast on low-resolution displays.|$|E

25|$|Akzidenz-Grotesk is {{sometimes}} {{at first glance}} mistaken for the <b>Helvetica</b> or Univers typefaces. The similarities of <b>Helvetica</b> and Akzidenz-Grotesk are apparent, but the subtle differences include the uppercase and lowercase C and the uppercase G, J, R and Q. Aside from the subtle differences in these individual letters, Miedinger's primary change to Akzidenz-Grotesk is Helvetica's higher x-height, {{the distance from the}} baseline to the height of the lowercase letter x, and the consistently horizontal terminals. The general effect is that <b>Helvetica</b> appears more oblong while Akzidenz-Grotesk maintains circular counters and bowls. Both <b>Helvetica</b> and Univers are more regular and have a greater consistency of stroke weight and details, for instance unifying all or most strokes to terminate on horizontals or verticals.|$|E
25|$|Around 2012, Apple {{started using}} <b>Helvetica</b> in macOS (then named OS X) {{application}} software. iTunes, iMovie, iPhoto, GarageBand, and Apple's professional applications started to feature heavy use of <b>Helvetica,</b> {{while the majority}} of the OS X (now named macOS) environment retained the comparatively more legible Lucida Grande typeface, which was designed specifically for on-screen use.|$|E

His most important publication, from 1868, is Enumeratio plantarum phanerogamicarum districtus quondam Naszondensis; as was customary at the time, it is written in Latin. A Romanian variant appeared in 1881 as Diagnozele plantelor fanerogame și cryptogame vasculare, care provin spontaneu din Transilvania. This was followed in 1893 by Diagnoza plantelor fanerogame și cryptogame vasculare care cresc spontaneu în Transilvania și nu sunt descrise în opul lui Koch: Synopsis Florae Germanicae et <b>Helveticae.</b> He was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy in 1882; this was due to his scientific merits as well as his status as the most important Romanian botanist in Transylvania during the Austro-Hungarian period.
