Comparison with the results of earlier tests on wooden cupboards for solvents indicates that the steel cupboard tested afforded much less protection from fire to its contents. It must be expected that any simple steel cupboard even if it were of acceptable integrity would, when exposed to a similar fire, permit its contents to be heated sufficiently for <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> in bottles to escape and ignite.

40|$|Fires {{caused by}} {{accidental}} spillage of <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids</b> {{have been a}} major safety concern in industries and urban areas. There has been a recent surge of interest in the research concerning the combustion and flame spread over an inert porous media soaked with <b>flammable</b> <b>liquid.</b> This interest has been driven by the need to better understand fire and its behaviour under these conditions and improve the relevant fire safety and prevention technologies. A review of key studies in this subject area has been conducted and summarised, focussing mainly on the theory plus a notable experimental findings about combustion and the flame spread phenomena of fuel-soaked porous media. The review covers topics such as flame spread behaviour, physical flame propagation aspects, heat transfer, temperature distribution; and fuel consumption over inert porous media. The review concludes with some practical safety and environmental considerations for decontamination of land soaked with <b>flammable</b> <b>liquid...</b>|$|R

Consequently, Edlich initiated a nationwide educational program that has dramatically reduced the frequency of burn injuries stemming from <b>flammable</b> <b>liquids.</b>|$|R
