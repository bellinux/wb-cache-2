40|$|This paper {{reported}} a preliminary research with an objective {{to find out}} wastewater quality of fish processing industries and surface waters where the wastewater was <b>disharged</b> in. Methods consisted of clustering industrial area, sampling points and weekly observation, covering dry and rainy seasons (June – October 2011). Results presented maximum wastewater flowrate and quality as well as rivers and sea waters. Based on the maximum loading, the next works proposed on-site, collection and off-site treatment strategies. In depth research works will be particularly focused on the off-site detoxification system for fish processing industries. International researchers are welcome to join the next research works. Key words: Fish wastewater quality, surface waters, maximum loading, on-site anaerobic treatment, offsite detoxification system...|$|R
40|$|The 9 -ince and 18 -inch Parshall flumes {{with the}} throat section {{installed}} {{level with the}} bottom of an incoming pipe were tested. The measured discharges for given flow depths (free flow) or differences in flow depths (submerged flow) were found to deviate quite significantly fromt he computed standard Parshall flume <b>disharges</b> at both low and high flow rates. New empirical formulats have been developed to take such deviations into account. It is noted that values of the coefficients and exponents contained in the new formulas depend on the throat size of the flume and the slope of the incoming pipe. Calibration curves and tables were prepared for convenient applications of the new formulas...|$|R
40|$|The {{mathematical}} river {{models have}} been known describing the systems of river by the shortest way. The mathematical model wed in this study had unique diamension. It was able to simulate the parameters of river and <b>disharge</b> depending on {{the distance between the}} segments and also to show the relation between the concentration and the distance. The mathematical model was construded as considering the topographical sturucture, the <b>disharge</b> charectiristics and the places of endüstrial plants and small companies, various points of dranage and leakage and the various streams discharged to river. The computer programme used in the modelling was constructed to solve the differantial equations. The related parameters were calculated by using the computer programme after applying the hydrolic works and kinetic constants to the equations. The constructed mathematical model was calibrated by using of the chemical results of the samples taken from the various points at different places, then the relation of between the analyzing end oretical results was controlled. These results showed that the constructed mathmatical model was fitting well. The variations of DO, COD, ORG-N, ORG-P have been estimated along the Karasu river in Erzurum with this mode...|$|E
40|$|The benthic foraminiferal assemblages of the Gulf of Policastro {{have been}} studied and {{particular}} {{attention has been paid}} to continental shelf sediments sampled by a Shipek grab-sampler in the vicinity of major river outfalls and two stations that were not subjected to fresh-water discarge. The samples were preserved in 4 % formol and Rose Bengal in order to compare the biocoenoses and thanatocoenoses. The assemblages showed areal and bathymetric differences that may be determined by different environmental factors such as grain size, fresh-water discharge and the presence of algal populations. By taking into considerations the previous parameteres, we have been able to define dominant assemblages for different habitats. Moreover, it was possible to determine that the influence that fresh-water <b>disharge</b> had on species assemblages was confined to the circalittoral area...|$|E
40|$|Epilepsy is an {{occasional}} and excessive and disorderly discharge of the neuons. Epileptic attack is {{the manifestation of}} a paroxymal <b>disharge</b> of abnormal electrical rythms in {{some part of the}} brain. If one adds that such discharges are likely to be repetitive, one has defined the cardial features of epilepsy. Sometimes psychiatric dilliculties such as deficits in attention, memory, motor speed and aberrant personality changes, amciety, depression, psychosis may be seen {{during the course of the}} illness. Antiepileptic drugs themselves which ceases neurobehavioral disorders could lead to cognitive dysfunctions. Neuropyschiatric symptoms may occur at the preictal, postictal and interictal periods of epileptic seizure and also sometimes one psychiatric symptom may be the only sign of the seizure. Because of this, epilepsy is important for both neurology and psychiatry. In this review, we aimed to investigate the common psychiatric dilliculties that can be seen during the course of epilepsy...|$|E

A new antenna type has been installed to allow wave excitation with higher RF currents and lower dynamic polarization of the antenna straps than for the one previously used. In spite of edge plasma heating, which causes influx of impurities, we have obtained a clear confirmation of wave deposition inside the plasma from a localized increase of the electron temperature measured with the ECE radiometer. Detailed profiles of the plasma density and Ha emission were obtained in runaway <b>disharges</b> with currents around 100 kA. These profiles confirm our model of a low-temperature plasma maintained in equilibrium by the relativistic electron beam. Analysis of the Ha and density spikes indicate that recombination plays a substantial role in the particle and energy balance...|$|R
40|$|AIM: Acute limb {{ischemia}} (ALI) is not infrequently {{associated with}} limb loss (10 - 30 %) or {{death of the}} affected patient (15 - 30 %). These results can be even worse in elderly population. The {{aim of this study}} is to quantify safety and efficacy of early revascularization in over 90 years old patients with acute limb ischemia. METHODS: This is a prospective registry lasting from January 2012 to January 2013. We include all consecutive over 90 years patients treated for ALI (N. = 15). A careful preoperative Duplex scan (DS) were performed in each patient. All patients underwent surgery by Fogarty's embolectomy, and endovascular completion procedure if needed (N. = 3). RESULTS: We performed 18 revascularizations (15 lower limbs, 3 upper limbs) in 15 patients (2 staged bilateral femoral, 1 simultaneous bilateral femoral). The mean follow-up was 124 days (4 - 365). Technical success was obtained in 16 cases (88. 9 %). At <b>disharge</b> mortality was 5. 9 % (1 case), and amputation rate was 6. 2 % (1 pt). The Kaplan-Meier curves at 1 year revealed an estimated freedom from death, amputation and re-occlusion of 76. 5 %, 88. 2 %, and 71. 3 %, respectively. CONCLUSION: The over 90 years old patient represent a challenging case for vascular surgeon. Vascular procedures involve high mortality rate but emergent revascularization by Fogarty Embolectomy in ALI is safe and effective even in older patient...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Postoperative atrial {{fibrillation}} {{is the most}} common arrhythmia following bypasssurgery with significant morbidity, mortality and increased healthcare costs. The aim of this studyis to determine the incidence and timing of {{atrial fibrillation}}, identify the risk factors coveringpreoperative and intraoperative periods, evaluate rate of return to sinus rhythm by <b>disharge,</b> andexplore the impact on postoperative outcomes in a large group of patients operated in a singlecenter by a single surgeon. Patients and Methods: Between January 2011 and January 2012, 418 patients on preoperativesinus rhythm were operated for ischemic heart disease and associated complications (left ventricleaneurysm repair and ischemic mitral insufficiency) in a single center, by a single surgeon. The preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative variables were studied. Results: The mean age of the patients were 61. 92 ± 10. 05, and 77. 5 % were male. Atrial fibrillationdeveloped in 68 (16. 3 %) patients. The incidence peaked at second day. Patients with atrialfibrillation were older (p< 0. 001). Gender, preoperative comorbidities, ejection fraction, left atrialdiameter, preoperative beta-blocker use, leukocyte count, type of operation and intraoperativevariables did not affect its occurence. Intensive care unit and hospital length of stay were longer(p< 0. 05). 95. 5 % (n= 65) of patients were in normal sinus rhythm at discharge. Conclusion: Postoperative atrial fibrillation is a popular subject with unknowns and controversialresults which may lead to wrong interpretations. We believe that every center has its own risk factors related with the population of that region. Discussion will last, but simple precautions and close monitoring will help to minimizeadverse outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Stage-discharge {{equations}} for lakes without <b>disharge</b> measurements Simon Andersson In 2015 all lakes, rivers, {{coastal water}} and groundwater {{should be of}} good ecological statusaccording to the water framework directive from the European Union. In the process ofimproving the quality of Swedish water bodies, knowledge of where problems occur isneeded in order to utilize the resources optimally. The ability of lakes to store water is animportant factor since it controls {{the flow of water}} through the country. A stage-dischargeequation is a mathematical relation between discharge from a lake and its water level. Bybetter understanding of stage-discharge equations for lakes, their storage capacity can bedescribed better in hydrological models. This master thesis aims to evaluate methods for determining stage-discharge equations forlakes where a variable amount of field measurements is available. The methods developed inthe project were evaluated by comparison with measured stage-discharge equations made bySMHI (Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute). First, relations between lakeproperties and stage-discharge equations were evaluated. In {{the second part of the}} project,tests were made to observe if a stage-discharge equation could be developed from data ofwater levels in a lake and modeled inflow to the lake. Finally, possibilities of estimatingstage-discharge equation through Sjölyftet were evaluated. Sjölyftet is a project financed bythe Swedish Public Employment Service in which unemployed people in Sweden makesimple hydrological measurements for SMHI. The results showed that the use of the same constant standard parameters for all lakes in thestage-discharge equation gives large errors. The use of catchment areas, lake areas and outletwidths gave better results than applying constant standard parameters in stage-dischargeequations. The best method for estimating stage-discharge equations was obtained whenmeasurements of water level for lakes where used. The measurements from Sjölyftet couldnot be evaluated properly because validation data were missing. Although, the data collectedfrom Sjölyftet might be useful in the future...|$|E
40|$|Pilonidal sinus {{disease is}} a complex {{condition}} that causes both discomfort and embarassment to suffers. Direct cost through absence from work is high. Controversy still exists regarding the best surgical technique for its treatment in terms of minimizing disease recurrence and patient discomfort. Thus, we conducted this study to evaluate the results of rhomboid excision and Limberg flap reconstruction in the surgical treatment of pilonidal sinus disease. This prospective study included 81 patients who had pilonidal sinus and were treated by the rhomboid excision and Limberg flap. The mean follow-up was 18 months and all patients {{were satisfied with the}} procedure. There were lower complication rates, minimal discomfort, patients <b>disharged</b> in 2 - 3 days and only two recurrences. The Authors recommend the Limberg flap procedure for pilonidal sinus disease. It is effective, with short hospitalization, low recurrence rate and shorter time off work...|$|R
40|$|Perineal hernia is the {{protrusion}} of an intra-abdominal structure {{into the}} perineal area, {{that could be}} primitive or secondary to trauma or abdominoperineal resection. mail treatmnent could be transabdominal, transperineal or combined. Here is a rare case of anterior perineal hernia in a young saxophone male patient, treated with a mininvasive perineal approach. A 25 -year-old Caucasian male patient referred 1 -year history of perineal pain. <the pain was more severe when he played his saxophone. Local exam was negative but a dynamic perineal ultrasonography revealed a small anterior perineal hernia. The defect was repaired with a polypropylene plug and the patient was <b>disharged</b> the day after. At one year, no signs of remission have been signalled. Perineal mesh hernioplasty of primary perineal hernia is technically feasible, is associated with rapid recovery and minimal complications, and has a good long-term outcome. The use of ultrasonography to detect the hernia {{could be considered the}} best choice whenever it is o small size. Ultrasonography allow to identify weakness areas, reducing diagnostic time and avoiding further costs...|$|R
