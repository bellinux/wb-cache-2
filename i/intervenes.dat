40|$|Although {{teachers}} {{may be in}} a position to address enactments of sexual and gender stigma among their students, little is known about their motivations to <b>intervene</b> in such situations.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine the {{short-term}} and long-term effects of a curriculum-based anti-bullying intervention program on students' attitudes towards bullying, intentions to <b>intervene</b> in bully-victim problems, perceived efficacy of <b>intervening</b> and actual <b>intervening</b> behavior. The intervention program was applied in primary schools and was implemented by trained teachers within the classroom context. The sample consisted of 454 pupils drawn from fourth to sixth grade classrooms of 10 primary schools in central Greece. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design was used. The findings indicate positive short-term program outcomes concerning students' attitudes towards bullies and victims, perceived efficacy of <b>intervening</b> in bully-victim incidents and actual rates of <b>intervening</b> behavior. However, the magnitude of the program effects was quite small, since the positive short-term outcomes were not sustained in the long-term (post-test two measures). The results of the study also indicated clear time effects for attitudes towards bullies and victims, self-efficacy of <b>intervening</b> and intention, as well as actual <b>intervening</b> behavior. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for anti-bullying interventions...|$|R
50|$|An <b>intervening</b> {{cause is}} an event that occurs after a tortfeasor's initial act of {{negligence}} and causes injury/harm to a victim. An <b>intervening</b> cause will generally absolve the tortfeasor of liability for the victim's injury only if the event is deemed a superseding cause. A superseding cause is an unforeseeable <b>intervening</b> cause. By contrast, a foreseeable <b>intervening</b> cause typically does not break the chain of causality, meaning that the tortfeasor is still responsible for the victim's injury—unless the event leads to an unforeseeable result.|$|R
40|$|Cyber {{harassment}} {{can have}} harmful effects {{on social media}} users, such as emotional distress and, consequently, withdrawal from social network sites or even life itself. At the same time, users are often upset when network providers <b>intervene</b> and deem such an intrusion an unjust occurrence. This article analyzes how decisions to <b>intervene</b> can be communicated {{in such a way}} that users consider them adequate and acceptable. A first experiment shows that informational justice perceptions of social network users depend on the format in which network providers present the decision to <b>intervene.</b> More specifically, if a decision to <b>intervene</b> is presented in the form of a story, as opposed to an analytical rendering of facts and arguments, decisions to <b>intervene</b> prompt more positive informational justice perceptions. A second experiment reveals that when users relate the experience to themselves, narrative transportation increases, which positively affects perceptions of the justice of decisions to <b>intervene...</b>|$|R
5|$|The Narrator – as {{in other}} works of metafiction, the narrator's voice {{frequently}} <b>intervenes</b> in the story with a personality of its own. Though the voice appears {{to be that of}} Fowles, Magali Cornier Michael notes that chapter 13, which discusses the role of author and narrator within fiction, distinguishes between the author's role in the text and the narrator's. Alice Ferrebe describes the narrator as both a lens for critiquing traditional gender roles and a perpetuation of the perspectives on gendered identity perpetuated by the male gaze.|$|E

5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates).

A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by the Senate. Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in the Senate (there may be exceptions if an election <b>intervenes</b> during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of the Senate.|$|E
40|$|Typically adolescents' {{friends are}} {{considered}} {{a risk factor for}} adolescent engagement in risk-taking. This study took a more novel approach, by examining adolescent friendship as a protective factor. In particular it investigated friends' potential to <b>intervene</b> to reduce risk-taking. 540 adolescents (mean age 13. 47 years) were asked about their intention to <b>intervene</b> to reduce friends' alcohol, drug and alcohol-related harms and about psychosocial factors potentially associated with <b>intervening.</b> More than half indicated that they would <b>intervene</b> in friends' alcohol, drug use, alcohol-related harms and interpersonal violence. <b>Intervening</b> was associated with being female, having friends engage in overall less risk-taking and having greater school connectedness. The findings provide an important understanding of increasing adolescent protective behavior as a potential strategy to reduce alcohol and drug related harms...|$|R

40|$|The 2013 {{debate over}} whether the United States should <b>intervene</b> in the Syrian {{conflict}} raised important questions regarding the benefits countries receive when they <b>intervene</b> in civil wars, and how those benefits are distributed {{to the citizens of}} the <b>intervening</b> country. To address these lingering questions, Civil War Interventions and Their Benefits: Unequal Return offers readers a comprehensive examination of the intervention process, examining the decision to <b>intervene,</b> what motivates states, and how their intervention shapes the conflict process. Most importantly, this book examines how states benefit from their interventions and the distribution of intervenor benefits. Specifically, two questions are addressed: What are the benefits of intervention for <b>intervening</b> countries? And how are benefits distributed within the intervenor 2 ̆ 7 s society? Using evidence compiled from three case studies (El Salvador, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka), this book examines what motivated states to <b>intervene,</b> how they <b>intervened,</b> what they got from their intervention, and how the benefits of the intervention were distributed among the public. Arguing that foreign policy and security decision making is isolated from the general public, this book demonstrates that citizens gain little from indirect interventions into civil wars.
