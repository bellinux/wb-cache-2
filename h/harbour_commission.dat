5|$|The port {{expanded}} {{greatly in}} the 19th century, with {{the purchase of}} a steam tug in 1819, and the rebuilding of the breakwater in 1822. By this point, three ship building yards had also been established. The construction of the Blyth and Tyne Railway from 1849 allowed coal shipments to quickly expand, reaching 200,000 tons per annum. The Blyth Harbour and Dock Company was created in 1854, but with need for further expansion, it was replaced by a bill of parliament given Royal Assent on 19 June 1882, which constituted the current Blyth <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission.</b> This allowed additional financing to be raised, for construction of the South Harbour.|$|E
25|$|The Harbour Commission's {{plans to}} expand the usage of the airport ran into {{opposition}} at Toronto City Council, which reversed its support of the expansion and withheld a building permit for the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> to build the new terminal. Council started a court case to stop the expansion, {{on the grounds that}} the expansion had not had an environmental assessment and violated the 1983 agreement. The <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> rented trailers to use as temporary passenger facilities. The Federal Court rejected an injunction request from the City on March 30, 1990, clearing the way for new airlines to use the airport.|$|E
25|$|Airport {{passenger}} traffic {{declined in the}} 1990s. Although a new airline entered the island marketplace, City Express folded. The early 1990s saw a further decline due to an economic downturn. Additionally, the airport lost its subsidies from the Province of Ontario and Government of Canada. The ending of subsidies of the airport, the Toronto <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> became dependent on subsidies from the City of Toronto. During the 1990s, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> transferred much of its harbour lands to the City of Toronto for economic development and waterfront revitalization in exchange for future subsidies. The land transfers deal would later be challenged by the Toronto Port Authority.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, the {{operations}} of the airport was re-organized. The airport was leased to the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> for 21 years, and THC assumed financial responsibility for the airport. THC now operated the airport as principals, not as agents for the City of Toronto.|$|E
25|$|The annual {{operating}} deficit {{of running the}} airport had reached $300,000 per year, $130,000 of it in operating the Maple City ferry. The City of Toronto decided to ask the Government of Ontario and the Government of Canada to cover the deficit. Despite the deficit, {{and in the absence}} of a subsidy, the joint committee studying the airport recommended to the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> to keep it open. The report outlined three options: keep it open as is, closing it and use the land for other uses (which would mean finding a location for the 140,000 takeoffs and landings elsewhere), or use it for a STOL airport. The Government of Canada agreed to grant an annual subsidy to the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> to operate the airport, while the Government of Ontario agreed to pay for the costs of the airport ferry. The Government of Canada put a condition on the subsidy, that intergovernmental agreement needed to be reached on the future of the airport.|$|E

25|$|In 1972, the Harbor City project {{died when}} {{the governments of}} Canada and Ontario {{proposed}} {{to build a new}} major airport in Pickering, Ontario. At the same time, the Government of Canada initiated a feasibility study of converting the island airport to a major airport for Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) planes. Later that year, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> announced plans for an aquatic park on the Outer Harbour headland, the location in the 1968 plan for the relocated island airport.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Government of Canada told the Harbor Commission {{that it was}} cutting its subsidy of the airport. In {{response}} to the subsidy cut {{and a decline in}} annual traffic, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> board faced with what it saw as only two options: expand or close the airport, chose to expand the airport. In November 1989, the Harbor Commission voted to build a temporary passenger terminal and allow access to four more airlines at the airport: Air Ontario, Simo Air, Intair and Canadian Partner. The Commission planned to increase flights by 120 per day and increase the number of passengers by 500,000. It would also impose a $1.50 per user fee on the carriers to fund the improvements and cover the operating deficit. Toronto City Council voted to approve the expansion, but wanted a 90-flight per day limit. Air Ontario's president William Deluce announced it would start 14 flights a day between the island, Montreal and Ottawa. While the expansion had the approval of the <b>harbour</b> <b>commission</b> and city council, it awoke opposition to the airport from the Toronto Island Residents Association, who felt that there would be too many flights, leading to noise and air pollution and it would contravene the 1983 operating agreement.|$|E
25|$|Conceived in the 1930s as {{the main}} airport for Toronto, the {{construction}} of the airport was completed in 1939 by the Toronto <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> (THC). At the same time, the THC built Malton Airport as an alternate, but nearby Malton (today Toronto Pearson International Airport) became Toronto's main passenger airline hub instead, leaving the island airport for general aviation and military purposes. During the 1940s and 1950s, several political leaders proposed an expansion of the island airport to enable scheduled passenger airlines and reduce the annual operating costs. Malton was sold in 1962 to the Government of Canada in exchange for an expansion and improvements to the island airport. After the expansion, civil flights increased to a peak of over 200,000 annual flights in the 1960s. Although regional airlines were introduced in the 1970s, the annual number of flights went into decline and closure was discussed. In 1983, a 50-year tripartite agreement between the governments of Canada, City of Toronto and the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission,</b> which limited noise and banned jet use for scheduled airlines, allowed airport operations to continue. In the 1990s, in an era of government cost-cutting, questions about the airport's future were raised again due to its annual deficit. At the same time, redevelopment was taking over north of the airport and several studies suggested that the airport was incompatible with development.|$|E

25|$|In 1937, the Government of Canada {{agreed to}} support the {{building}} of two airports for Toronto, Ontario. One site was downtown, today's Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport. The other was to be outside the city, intended as a backup for the downtown airport. A site on a ghost-town called Elmbank {{near the town of}} Malton, northwest of Toronto, was chosen and the Toronto <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> purchased and acquired several farms to provide the land for the airfield. The first scheduled passenger flight for the new Malton Airport was a Trans-Canada Air Lines DC-3 that landed on August 29, 1939.|$|E
25|$|In parallel, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> built Malton Airport airfield, {{and opened}} it in 1939. Before its completion, Toronto City Council made {{arrangements}} for the Government of Canada {{to take over the}} field, which was christened Bishop Field (to honour the same flying ace for which the island airport was later renamed after) in 1939. The Malton field was intended to be used for training, as the centre for the trans-Canada air system, and used when visibility was poor at the island. Trans-Canada Airlines inaugurated passenger service at Malton and ultimately rejected the island airport due to its short runways. Malton ultimately became Toronto's main airport instead of the island airport.|$|E
25|$|During {{this same}} period, the Government of Canada was {{developing}} its Port Authority legislation. Transport Minister Collenette {{announced that a}} new agency would take over {{the responsibilities of the}} <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission,</b> but without as many politician members on its board. The new agency would operate the airport, contrary to the wishes of Toronto City Council, which wished to keep the airport under city control. City Council voted to appeal to the Senate of the Parliament of Canada to try to block the legislation creating the new Toronto Port Authority. According to Councillor Olivia Chow, the new agency would get the Harbour Commission's $20 million in reserves, operate independently, while the City of Toronto would have to subsidize any losses.|$|E
50|$|The Canada Ports Corporation (also {{known as}} Ports Canada) was a port {{corporation}} which operated across Canada. An Act of Parliament, {{which had been}} promoted by Jean-Luc Pépin, founded it on 24 February 1983, and it was marked as a responsibility of the Minister of Transport. Additionally, Pépin enunciated the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commissions</b> Act, under which a new National Ports Policy was launched. The Canada Ports Corporation was phased out in 1998 {{with the creation of}} the Canada Marine Act (CMA), an act ostensibly to modernize Canada's ports and harbors; prior to the implementation of the CMA, a National Marine Policy had been written in 1995 under the Ministry of Doug Young.|$|R
50|$|In the 1990s, {{the agency}} was {{requiring}} annual subsidies to manage the Island airport and the port lands. There {{were a number of}} <b>harbour</b> <b>commissions</b> in Canada and the federal government replaced the law under which harbours were managed, with the Canada Marine Act. Most ports were put under the authority of local governments and several were put under the authority of new 'Port Authority' agencies which would manage their affairs on a break-even basis. Toronto's was added to the Port Authority program, largely at the insistence of local Liberal MP Dennis Mills. In 2001, the new Toronto Port Authority was formed to manage the Port of Toronto, including the Island airport.|$|R
50|$|Gonzalo Piña Ludueña {{was born}} in Gibraltar in 1545 which was then part of Spain. He moved to the New World and settled down in Mérida, {{currently}} Western Venezuela, {{becoming one of the}} first Spanish inhabitants of the town. He was since then responsible for establishing several new towns and hamlets in the area, such as Nuestra Señora de Pedraza (founded in 1591 and known now as Pedraza, state of Barinas), or San Antonio de Gibraltar (currently known as Gibraltar, located in the state of Zulia). San Antonio de Gibraltar was named after Gonzalo Piña Ludueña's hometown as authorised by the city council of Mérida, which, in need of a new <b>harbour,</b> <b>commissioned</b> its construction on the shore of Lake Maracaibo in 1592.|$|R
25|$|The Toronto Port Authority (TPA) {{came into}} being on June 8, 1999 and the THC was dissolved. Unlike the {{previous}} <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission,</b> the Port Authority used a different management structure and a different management focus. Its new board of directors contained only one City of Toronto-appointed member. The Authority was also expected to manage the port more like a business. The new authority entered into negotiations with the City of Toronto. It wanted $20 million from the City, the return of lands transferred to the City in 1994, and to be exempt from municipal property taxes, while the City wanted out from its $2.8 million annual subsidy. This would {{be the start of}} a protracted dispute that would last several years.|$|E
25|$|After {{five years}} in the {{temporary}} terminal, Air Ontario spent $200,000 to build a new terminal in 1994, renovating an existing building and moving out of trailers. In August 1994, Toronto City Council, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> and the Government of Canada approved the airport's renaming to Toronto City Centre Airport. Later that year, the Government of Canada announced it would start to phase out its subsidy of the airport in 1995 and would end its subsidy of the fire station at the airport starting in April 1995. Classic Airlines, a new charter airline, started operating at the airport, using an old 28-seater DC-3 for short and medium range flights, but it would shut down early in 1995, when its insurance premiums increased from $33,000 annually to over $100,000.|$|E
25|$|Instead of the tunnel, ferry {{service was}} inaugurated across the narrow Western Gap channel {{in the spring}} of 1939. The first ferry service was a cable ferry, which was rated to carry 48 persons. The cable ferry was {{constructed}} by the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> at its yard at the Keating Channel. It was attached by two cables, one to either dock. One cable was reeled in, while the other was let out. The cable was dropped to the bottom to let shipping pass. When high waves occurred from storms or wind, the ferry went out of service. Attached by a rope, the ferry was allowed to drift out into the channel to avoid battering itself against the dock. The boat was 'marooned' for two days when the Hurricane Hazel storm arrived in 1954.|$|E

25|$|The inland route, {{while not}} opposed in the Sunnyside and Jameson areas, faced {{opposition}} in its proposed route in the CNE to downtown segment. Alternative route proposals emerged in 1954 from the Toronto <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission,</b> which wanted the route moved further north, and planner Edwin Kay, who proposed a tunnel through downtown. The decision was then made {{to proceed with}} the non-contentious parts of the original Margison plan, to build a new Humber bridge to connect with the QEW, the Queen Street extension, and the Humber River to Dowling section, demolishing Sunnyside Park and South Parkdale. Metro also approved the eastern section of the expressway from Sherbourne Street to the east, but the central, elevated section was left for further deliberation. Metro approved $33million for the eastern and western sections in its 1955 budget, but omitted the Humber River bridge.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> {{proposed}} {{a plan to}} modify the Toronto Islands, including a new tunnel under the Western Gap. A new highway would connect to the tunnel and run {{the length of the}} island, and bridge the Eastern Gap channel. The highway would remove the need for the ferry service and bus service on the island, which was costing the City $100,000 per year. Under the plan, the airport's runways would be extended, a new regatta course would be built, amusements would be moved from the Sunnyside Amusement Park to the island and apartment buildings would be built. The plan would mean the filling of various channels and expanding the land mass of the islands. The project came with no price tag and was sent back to the THC for further study. The city hoped to persuade the Government of Canada to pay for the tunnel.|$|E
25|$|In January 1964, {{the cable}} ferry was retired, {{replaced}} by the <b>Harbour</b> <b>Commission</b> tugboat Thomas Langton That year, interest by municipal government officials was renewed in a new link to the airport. Takeoffs and landings had declined from the 1961 peak to 189,000 in 1962 and 187,000 in 1963, despite the addition of night-time capability. The decline was attributed to two factors: the limited access and poor service the ferry provided {{and the opening of}} the Buttonville Municipal Airport north of Toronto in 1962. The City of Toronto, spurred by Lamport, wanted the Government of Canada to provide a better ferry, or a lift bridge. The Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) planning department studied a proposal to build a bridge, although full automobile access was opposed by the Metro Commissioner of Parks, Tommy Thompson, whose department was converting the islands to parkland. The Maple City, capable of carrying vehicles and passengers, took over the ferry service in March 1965.|$|E
