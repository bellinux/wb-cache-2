500|$|Newspapers and {{journals}} {{around the world}} speculated that Brazil was acting {{as a proxy for}} a naval power which would take possession of the two dreadnoughts soon after completion, as they did not believe that a previously insignificant geopolitical power would contract for such powerful armament. The evidence for a sale seemed strong, as Brazilian attempts to float a multi-million-dollar loan against the value of their coffee crop in 1908 were unsuccessful. With three dreadnoughts planned (including the upcoming [...] ), a Spanish naval journal stated [...] "it was only natural that rumors [...] to circulate supporting the argument that Brazil acted as an intermediary for some great power which would acquire them before they terminate their construction."

40|$|Concentration of {{zooplankton}} in {{a holding}} zone near the shore during onshore winds may be explained hypothetically by the built-in behaviourial responses of planktonic organ-isms (particularly crustacean larvae) to landwash vibrations. These responses initiate verti-cal or other migrations which take advantage of compensatory outward currents and keep the plankton from drifting ashore. Lagoon or estuary entrances change the “noise ” pattern and the plankton (especially penaeid shrimp or crab larvae) enter the estuary at the deep-est part of such channels with inward tidal flows. Key words: Currents, winds, zooplankton. that those without such defences against drifting ashore did not survive.

40|$|I was {{managing}} the construction project, and I thought my biggest challenge was simply finishing {{the work in}} time for start of the holiday shopping season. The store opened three weeks before Thanksgiving. Everything looked great. Business picked up steadily as the serious spending season approached. Then, two days before Thanksgiving, disaster struck. The fire protection system was designed to prevent smoke and fire from reaching the merchandise. If a fire alarm went off anywhere in the building, the system went into a massive pressurization mode. Dampers would open and the system would pump in hundreds of cubic feet of air from outside into the store, pressurizing every square foot, preventing fire or smoke from spreading into the store. That night an unknown event tripped the alarm-and it sounded for six hours. The air conditioning system was still operational as the outside air temperatures had been warm all month. That night, however, temperatures plummeted to 20 degrees. With an alarm sounding in a building complex that covers many millions of square feet, no one {{paid attention to the}} cold air flowing into the space. Pipes froze and burst. Hundreds of gallons of water came down through the drywall, soaking merchandise, the carpet and the hardwood racks. This state of the art system, which had been designed to protect, was now responsible for unthinkable damage. You could be the among greatest project managers in world, but if you have an attitude and you give the client heartburn, unnecessary heartburn, you're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do more work with him. If you have a disaster like this one, and you manage to make everybody feel good and believe that you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> care of <b>them,</b> then everybody looks back on it and says, "You know what, this is a good project team; we work well together, so let's do another one. ...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a legend}} about a {{church on the}} island of Orust in the small village of Tegneby. The legend tells a story about a hidden church bell in the mysterious hole in the creek. “During a war long time ago, people were afraid that the King Gustav Vasa would take their church bell to use as {{material}} for cannons. So the people in Tegneby hid their beloved church bell in a hole in the creek below the church and there it remained for seven years”  (main legend) The aim of this paper was to find out if this legend still is alive in the area of Tegneby. Another aim was to understand what had caused the folk legend to appear and also if there were other places in the south west of Sweden that had corresponding legends.   There was a big difference in the knowledge of the legend between the informants that I intervjued according to age. The older informants knew about the story and also had heard more versions of the legend. The younger informants were not as enlightened about the legend of the sunken/hidden church bell. Were there similar legends in the south west of Sweden? Yes, there was as many as 397 of them, they were very much alike the main legend about Tegnebys sunken church bell. What could have caused this legend? The answer is this that there is no perfect right answer. What probably caused the legend to appear was confiscation of church bells that took place during the 15 - 1600 hundreds in Sweden and in Denmark. People got afraid that their church bell was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> from <b>them...</b>|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the things}} that you must know in bird control are your state and local regulations. The state law may read that a license is {{required}} for bird control. A state law may read that the techniques and manners of your control must conform with their law. A state law may require registration of the poison you 2 ̆ 7 re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> use. State law may also prohibit placement of baits at a certain time during the day or year. And most important, a state law may prohibit control of specific types of birds. In Nebraska and most of the other states, the English Sparrow, the Pigeon, and the Starling are our # 1 birds on the most-wanted list. The Rid-A-Bird perch that I 2 ̆ 7 m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak about today has been registered by EPA for the control of those types of birds. Assuming that we get a call at Presto-X in Omaha from a potential customer to look at a bird problem, the first thing I 2 ̆ 7 d do is a survey. The survey is so important that it just cannot be overlooked. You just can 2 ̆ 7 t pick up the phone, have the guy tell you the problem and say, 2 ̆ 2 Oh yeah, we can do that for 100. We 2 ̆ 7 ll be out tomorrow and <b>take</b> care of <b>them.</b> 2 ̆ 2 You just can 2 ̆ 7 t do that in bird control. In my survey, I look to see what pest species is the target and if non-target types are around. In other words, if we 2 ̆ 7 re dealing with sparrows, are there any Cardinals or any other types of birds in the same area. This determines the amount of money that we 2 ̆ 7 re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> spend for the bait and the pre-baiting and how long it 2 ̆ 7 s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>to</b> get <b>them</b> under control. I want to know the food sources and the type of food that they 2 ̆ 7 re eating and where the birds are feeding. It is very important to know the exact area where the birds are feeding. I want to know the water sources if possible, and I want to know the roosting, nesting, dusting, and molting sites. And most important are the travel patterns of the birds that are entering or leaving the area. Where are these birds actually staying? Are they loafing or nesting here? What are the birds doing? Why are they in this particular area...|$|R
