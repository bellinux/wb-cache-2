25|$|Anonymous delegates are {{functions}} pointers {{that hold}} anonymous methods. The purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> simpler to use delegates by simplifying {{the process of}} assigning the function. Instead of declaring a separate method in code the programmer can use the syntax to write the code inline and the compiler will then generate an anonymous function for it.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{effective}} ways to prevent electromagnetic attacks <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> difficult for an attacker to collect an electromagnetic signal at the physical level. Broadly, the hardware designer could design the encryption hardware to reduce signal strength or to protect the chip. Circuit and wire shielding, such as a Faraday cage, are effective in reducing the signal, as well as filtering the signal or introducing extraneous noise to mask the signal. Additionally, most electromagnetic attacks require attacking equipment to be very close to the target, so distance is an effective countermeasure. Circuit designers can also use certain glues or design components {{in order to make it}} difficult or impossible to depackage the chip without destroying it.|$|E

500|$|As of 2009, {{the mall}} is {{anchored}} by Sears (223,000 sq ft), Kohl's (73,799 sq ft), Younkers (165,000 sq ft), and Target (126,483 sq ft), with approximately 95 inline tenants, {{as well as}} a food court and a single-screen movie theater with the largest movie screen in Des Moines. It is managed by Abbell Credit Corporation, the same company that has held a majority ownership interest in the mall since 1959. It has undergone several renovations over time to remain a viable shopping center. According to Elizabeth Holland, the CEO of Abbell Credit Corporation, the Des Moines area is large enough to support only two shopping malls, and the goal of the Merle Hay Mall redevelopment <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> [...] "become one of the two surviving shopping malls." ...|$|E

Savan Kotecha, Yacoub, and Falk, who composed One Direction's hits, [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing", spent six months in Stockholm, Sweden, developing songs for the album, {{and were able to}} shape melodies around their tones. Kotecha reflected: [...] "We’ll spend days, sometimes weeks, challenging the melody. The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> sound like anyone can do this, but it's actually very difficult".

Heads-up {{for those of you}} who missed the other warning threads and need a place to completely lose your mind." [...] Having learned from the controversy caused by the 2007 redesign, Curtis introduced the new site as a preview one week (two weeks for TotalFark users) prior to June 1, to allow users to comment on the changes and provide feedback on where things were broken. The primary reason for the redesigned site <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> easier to use and more intuitive. The site's tagline was changed from [...] "It's not news, it's FARK" [...] to [...] "We don't make news. We mock it." [...] The music tab was also dropped, due to low usage – content was rolled into the Showbiz or Video tab, where most of the content was already cross-posted anyway. An overhaul to the Fark Mobile Web site was not done at this time, but Curtis did say that small changes would be implemented over time to make the mobile site more consistent with the overall design of the new site.|$|E

500|$|Though the United States $1 Coin Act of 1997 {{required}} {{a change in}} composition and edge, it did not dictate what was {{to appear on the}} coin. To determine this, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin appointed a nine-member Dollar Coin Design Advisory Committee. Rubin, who had the authority to select the coin's design as Secretary of the Treasury, specified that the coin should depict a representation of one or more women and could not depict a living person. The committee was chaired by Philip N. Diehl, a role that did not include a vote on the designs. They met in Philadelphia in June 1998, listening to seventeen concepts submitted by members of the public, and reviewing many more suggestions received by telephone, mail and email. On June 9, 1998, the committee recommended Sacagawea, the Shoshone guide of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, for the design of the new coin. Despite the committee's choice of Sacagawea, Castle advocated that the Statue of Liberty be depicted, as per his earlier legislation. In a letter to the House of Representatives, Castle explained his objection, stating that the [...] "goal in creating a new dollar coin <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more distinctive with a popular design that would encourage its wider use by the public." [...] Between November 18 and 22, 1998, the General Accounting Office conducted a poll on behalf of Castle. The object of the poll was to determine which design the public would find more desirable. In total, 65 percent preferred the Statue of Liberty, 27 percent preferred Sacagawea, two percent believed that either was acceptable, three percent said neither was acceptable, and an additional three percent had no opinion. Despite Castle's objection, Sacagawea was ultimately chosen as the subject of the coin.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States and Canada, {{firewood}} {{is usually}} {{sold by the}} cord, 128ft³ (3.62 m³), corresponding to a woodpile 8ft wide × 4ft high of 4ft-long logs. The cord is legally defined by statute in most U.S. states. [...] A [...] "thrown cord" [...] is firewood {{that has not been}} stacked and is defined as 4ft wide x 4ft tall x 10ft long. [...] The additional volume <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> equivalent to a standard stacked cord, where there is less void space. [...] It is also common to see wood sold by the [...] "face cord", which is usually not legally defined, and varies from one area to another. For example, in one state a pile of wood 8 feet wide × 4 feet high of 16"-long logs will often be sold as a [...] "face cord", though its volume is only one-third of a cord. [...] In another state, or even another area of the same state, the volume of a face cord may be considerably different. [...] Hence, it is risky to buy wood sold in this manner, as the transaction is not based on a legally enforceable unit of measure.|$|E
2500|$|There {{seems to}} be a couple {{different}} types of irony in the sonnets in general that which is [...] "openly voiced by the speaker and authorial irony suggested {{at the expense of the}} (deceived) speaker." [...] There seems to a sense of irony when the speaker tells the beloved to forget him. Schoenfeldt reasons that [...] "we cannot quite take these lines literally" [...] because [...] "to tell someone to forget something <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> harder for them to forget." [...] This demonstrates a certain [...] "reverse-psychology appeal" [...] as a sense of irony. Furthermore [...] "the shift from the 'vile world' (line 4) to the 'wise world' (line 13) is the final evidence of Shakespeare's irony" [...] in this particular sonnet. Krieger goes on to explain: [...] "For this world is wise—that is, shrewd, prudential—only as it is vile, only as it exercises those characteristics which ape the destructive perfection, the absolute cooperation with time, of the 'vilest worms.'" [...] He questions, [...] "How single-mindedly, then, is his friend to take this selfless, seemingly anti-sentimental injunction to obey to obey the dictates of the world's cold wisdom lest he be mocked by it?" ...|$|E
