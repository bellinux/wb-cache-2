40|$|In {{the context}} of the promotional program "Pilot {{projects}} achieving Efficiency House Plus Standard" established by the Federal German Ministry of Transport, Building and Urban Development (BMVBS), six German manufacturers of prefabricated buildings have developed surplus energy houses as a showcase in the exhibition area prefab world Cologne. In the annual balance, a so-called 'Efficiency House Plus' generates more energy than it needs for its own use. It either feeds surplus energy back into the public grid or uses it for electro-mobility. Most buildings have a compact design and the energy performance of the building constructions is optimized. As a rule, the heating demand of most of the pilot houses is slightly above the energy requirement of passive houses. The optimization of both building construction and technical equipment led to the best possible economic concept. To cover the required heat demand, heat pumps are used in most houses. All buildings are equipped with a mechanical ventilation system using heat recovery. Energy profits are gained by photovoltaic modules installed as roof-top or roof- or facade-integrated solutions. To increase the degree of self-use, surplus energy is stored in a battery in some of the houses. For the monitoring program, the energy flows of the buildings are measured, recorded and analysed by Fraunhofer IBP. The measuring configuration intends to determine both the monthly energy balances of the building and the performance of the installed technology. <b>Further</b> <b>parameters</b> <b>measured</b> in selected rooms include air temperature, relative air humidity and CO 2 concentration levels. The contribution by the photovoltaic plant (which is used on-site or fed into the public grid) and the overall consumption of all electrical appliances of the houses are recorded continuously. After completion of the houses in spring 2012 the 2 -year monitoring period started. Meanwhile, first measurements are available for the period from March 2012 through February 2013...|$|E
40|$|The superconducting RF photoinjector SRF gun {{operating}} with a 31 2 cell niobium cavity and Cs 2 Te photocathodes is {{installed at the}} ELBE radiation center. The gun provides beams for ELBE {{as well as in}} a separate diagnostics beam line for beam parameter measurements. Since 2012 a new UV driver laser system developed by MBI has been installed for the SRF gun. It delivers CW or bust mode pulses with 13 MHz repetition rate or with reduced rates of 500, 200, and 100 kHz at an average UV power of about 1 W. The new laser allows the gun to serve as the driver for the infrared FELs at ELBE. In the first successful experiment a 250 amp; 956;A beam with 3. 3 MeV from SRF gun was injected into ELBE, further accelerated in the ELBE superconducting linac modules and then guided to the U 100 undulator. First lasing was achieved at the wavelength of 41 amp; 956;m. The spectrum, detuning curve and <b>further</b> <b>parameters</b> were <b>measure...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{sector of}} private {{educational}} institutions in Austria is very young but crowing. Despite the urgent necessity of customized and directly applicable control mechanisms {{there are still}} little knowledge and experience due to the recentness of the sector. Controlling in educational institutions has rarely been explored to this day. Up until now only the sub-areas of controlling of educational processes have been researched. Institutions which are dealing with working students have to offer special service in terms of opening hours, service quality, lectures etc. which causes higher costs and requests a high budget liability. In order to develop a customized controlling instrument for educational institutions in higher education {{an examination of the}} crucial influencing factors of private educational institutions is necessary. In <b>further</b> consequence, <b>parameters,</b> <b>measuring</b> criteria and key figures can be developed on this basis to create customized controlling. Aim of the following part is an intensive examination of the processes of private educational institutions. This will be used as a basis for a further evaluation of processes {{in order to determine the}} influence of particular processes in educational institutions. To reach this aim the necessary and trendsetting processes will be defined with regard to the exemplary institutions Ingenium Education and Studienzentrum Weiz...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} a wide range of engine performance parameters, including: indicated torque (IT), indicated power (IP), indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) and indicated specific fuel consumption (ISFC). <b>Further,</b> the combustion <b>parameters</b> <b>measured</b> include: start of injection timing, in-cylinder peak pressure, boost pressure and rate of maximum pressure rise. Resultant emission parameters investigated include: exhaust blow by, unburned hydrocarbon (UBHC), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), particulate matter (PM), particle number (PN) and particle size distribution (PSD). Normal butanol (n -butanol) was chosen to blend with a reference diesel fuel. The experiment was conducted using a 6 -cylinder, turbocharged common rail diesel engine in accordance with the 13 -Mode European Stationary Cycle (ESC). Considering limits of solubility of n -butanol in reference diesel, a maximum of 30 % n -butanol was blended with 70 % reference diesel. Three different butanol blends having 10 % butanol with 90 % reference diesel, 20 % butanol with 80 % reference diesel and 30 % butanol with 70 % reference diesel (the blending percentages were on a volume basis) were prepared. The engine experimental results show that without considerably deteriorating engine performance, most of the emissions were significantly reduced with the butanol blends compared to those of the reference diesel...|$|R

Various <b>parameters</b> were <b>measured</b> and were found to increase at 55 °C, these changes could be related to gelatinisation of the starch remaining in the products. In natural mashed potato, texture profile analysis (TPA) and firmness parameters were lower in the processed than in the fresh samples, indicating a weakening of the structure; this was confirmed by photomicrographs. In commercial mashed potato, TPA <b>parameters</b> <b>measured</b> at 55 and 65 °C and firmness <b>parameters</b> <b>measured</b> at 25 °C were higher in the processed samples, indicating enhanced structural strength; this was confirmed by photomicrographs.
