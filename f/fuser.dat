40|$|Abstract – In this paper, {{we first}} present a general data model for discretized {{asynchronous}} multisensor systems {{and show that}} errors in the data model are correlated across sensors and with the state. This coupling renders most existing “optimal ” linear fusion rules suboptimal. While our fusion rules of Part I are valid and optimal for this general model, we propose a general, exact technique to decouple {{the two types of}} correlation of the errors so that other existing rules can be applied after decoupling. Then, we discuss several theoretically important issues unique to fusion for dynamic systems. The first is the role of prior information in the static case versus that of prediction in the dynamic case. We present two general, best linear unbi-ased estimation <b>fusers</b> with and without prior information respectively. Other issues discussed include optimality of existing linear fusion rules as well as two commonly used fusion schemes, and the effect of feedback...|$|R
40|$|Here we {{demonstrate}} that the incorporation of boron (B) atoms between double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) during thermal annealing (1400 - 1600 degrees C) results in covalent nanotube "Y" junctions, DWNT coalescence, {{and the formation of}} flattened multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). These processes occur via the merging of adjacent tubes, which is triggered by B interstitial atoms. We observe that B atom interstitials between DWNTs are responsible for the rapid establishment of covalent connections between neighboring tubes (polymerization), thereby resulting in the fast annealing of the carbon cylinders with B atoms embedded in the newly created carbon nanotube network. Once B is in the lattice, tube faceting (polygonization) starts to occur, and the electronic properties are expected to change dramatically. Therefore, B atoms indeed act as atomic nanotube <b>fusers</b> (or welders), and this process could now be used in assembling novel electronic nanotube devices, nanotube networks, carbon nanofoams and heterojunctions exhibiting p-type electronic properties...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} approach {{that consists of}} sensor-based filtering algorithms, local processors, and a global processor is employed to describe the distributed fusion problem when several sensors execute surveillance over a certain area. For the sensor tracking systems, each filtering algorithm utilized in the ref-erence Cartesian coordinate system is presented for target tracking, with the radar measuring range, bearing, and elevation angle in the spherical coordinate system (SCS). For the local processors, each track-to-track fusion algorithm is used to merge two tracks representing the same target. The number of 2 -combinations of a set with N distinct sensors is considered for central track fusion. For the global processor, the data fusion algorithms, simplified max-imum likelihood (SML) estimator and covariance matching method (CMM), based on linear minimum variance (LMV) estimation fusion theory, are de-veloped {{for use in a}} centralized track-to-track fusion situation. The resulting global <b>fusers</b> can be implemented in a parallel structure to facilitate estimation fusion calculation. Simulation results show that the proposed SML estimator has a more robust capability of improving tracking accuracy than the CMM and the LMV estimators.

40|$|Objectives:The use of {{synthetic}} cannabimimetics (SC; “spice” drugs) is increasing, especially among teenagers and young adults. In parallel with this, {{the number of}} studies describing intoxication episodes associated with psychotic symptoms in SC users is growing. We present both a systematic review of the related literature and a case report, which seems to highlight {{the existence of a}} possible association between SC use and psychosis. Methods: Some 223 relevant studies were here identified and reviewed. Out of these, 120 full text articles were assessed for eligibility, and 41 were finally included in the systematic review. Results: According to the available data from the studies here identified, SC’s average age <b>fusers</b> was 22. 97 years, and the male/femaleratio was 3. 16 : 1. SC compounds most often reported in studies using biological specimen analysis were JWH- 018, JWH- 073, JWH- 122, CP- 47, 497, and JWH- 250. Mounting evidence seemed to suggest that psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions may occurin acute/chronic SC users. Conclusions: Although a clear causal link may not be here identified, the available evidence suggests that SC can trigger the onset of acute psychosis in vulnerable individuals and/or the exacerbation of psychotic episodes in those with a previous psychiatric history...|$|R
40|$|Summary Using a dataset of karyotypic changes {{reported}} for bovids {{and the house}} mouse (Mus musculus domesticus) together with information from the cattle (Bos taurus) and mouse genomes, we examined two principal variables that have been proposed to predict chromosomal positioning in the nucleus, chromosome size and GC content. These were expected to influence the distribution of Robertsonian (Rb) fusions, the predominant mode of chromosomal change in both taxa. We found the largest chromosomes to be most frequently involved in fusions in bovids, and confirm earlier reports that chromosomes of intermediate size were the most frequent <b>fusers</b> in mice. We then tested whether chromosomal positioning can explain Rb fusion frequencies. We classified chromosomes into groups by size and considered the frequency of interactions between specific groups. Among the interactions, mouse chromosomes showed a slight tendency to fuse with neighbouring chromosomes, in line with expectations of chromosomal positioning, but also resembling predictions from meiotic spindle-induced bias. Bovids, on the other hand, showed no trend in interactions, with small chromosomes being the least frequent partner for all size classes. We discuss the results in terms of nuclear organization at various cell cycle stages and the proposed mechanisms of Rb fusion formation, and note that the difference {{can be explained by}} (i) considering bovid species generally to be characterized by a greater intermingling of chromosomal size classes than the house mouse, or (ii) by the vastly different timescales underpinning their evolutionary histories. © Cambridge University Press 2012...|$|R
40|$|Distribution {{protection}} and system reliability have become equally important concepts since {{the inception of}} power systems. With more and more sensitive equipment coming in to industries, the requirement of {{protection and}} higher reliability of power system is been highlighted. Problems with system reliability result in costly loss of production to critical processes create a dilemma for both the serving utility & the consumer. The protective devices and switches {{play an important role in}} the reliability of electrical distribution systems by minimizing the impact of interruption. In this project, a method for identifying the type and location for protection devices and switches on the distribution system using cost-based optimization is proposed. Data has been obtained from the data loggers in the re-closers, DDLO <b>fusers</b> and transformers which are connected to the Labugama feeder of the Ranala gantry energized by the Kosgama grid substation. The proposed method is based on the existing reliability analysis and reliability analysis, after introducing various components, e. g., Sectionalizes, Auto-recloses and switching gantry. The detailed design of the protection devices and the switches are determined by minimizing the total cost of reliability that comprises apparatus investment, maintenance, and interruption cost. Chapters 03 to 05 concentrate mainly on the selection of technologies and sample feeder which represents the total system. Chapters 06 will discuss the way of data collection and analysis. Suggestions on possible improvements to reduce number of customer interruptions and customer interruptions duration while maintaining same degree of protection will discuss under the chapter 07...|$|R

50|$|Edgar Tolliver was Cadet Corporal of Seafort's barracks {{during his}} time at the Naval Academy, and was {{extremely}} unpopular with the young cadet, who felt that Tolliver hazed him to an unnecessary degree. Tolliver {{on the other hand}} merely thought of the hazing as 'part of the drill'. He was later promoted to Lieutenant and assigned to Portia at some point after Seafort left the ship, until he was reassigned to replace Alexi Tamarov as Seafort's aide. While serving in that capacity the heli the two were travelling in was fire on by a surface-to-air missile, and Tolliver threw Seafort aside to seize the controls and take evasive action. Rather than court-martial and execute Tolliver for touching him, as the strict naval regulations would have demanded, Seafort instead opted to give him administrative punishment, and demoted the Lieutenant to Midshipman. Tolliver remained as Seafort's aide throughout the battle of Hope Nation that followed, and eventually an understanding grew between the two. Seafort would retain Tolliver as his aide, saving his career that had been ruined by his demotion, and Tolliver would have 'special dispensation' to criticise and talk back to Seafort at will, in private. Tolliver served in this capacity throughout Seafort's time as academy commandant, and following the battle of Home System persuaded Seafort to keep the details of how the academy's cadets had been duped into sailing to their deaths in the <b>Fusers</b> secret. Tolliver remained in the Navy, eventually rising to Captain, and during the transpop rebellion attempted to contact Seafort to dissuade him from his course into Earthport's laser batteries. His call was ignored by Philip Seafort. During the naval rebellion Tolliver answered his friend's call to arms, and lead academy cadets in their assault on Lunapolis' laser cannon, although he was unable to seize them in time to prevent their firing on Galactic. When Seafort accepted command of Olympiad, Tolliver turned up on the bridge, unannounced, to offer his services as first lieutenant, an officer Seafort grudgingly accepted. During the second Fish crisis at Hope Nation, Tolliver took command of Olympiad after Seafort was seriously injured by Randy Carr, and again when the Captain was captured by religious extremists. He was relieved of duty and confined to quarters when Lieutenant Sarah Frand seized the ship, and only reluctantly agreed to desist from acting against her on the voyage back to Earth.|$|R
40|$|Re-creating and {{understanding}} {{the origin of life}} represents one of the major challenges facing the scientific community. We will never know exactly how life started on planet Earth, however, we can reconstruct the most likely chemical pathways that could have contributed to the formation of the first living systems. Traditionally, prebiotic chemistry has investigated the formation of modern life’s precursors and their self-organisation under very specific conditions thought to be ‘plausible’. So far, this approach has failed to produce a living system from the bottom-up. In the work presented herein, two different approaches are employed to explore the transition from inanimate to living matter. The development of microfluidic technology during the last decades has changed the way traditional chemical and biological experiments are performed. Microfluidics allows the handling of low volumes of reagents with very precise control. The use of micro-droplets generated within microfluidic devices is of particular interest to the field of Origins of Life and Artificial Life. Whilst many efforts have been made aiming to construct cell-like compartments from modern biological constituents, these are usually very difficult to handle. However, microdroplets can be easily generated and manipulated at kHz rates, making it suitable for high-throughput experimentation and analysis of compartmentalised chemical reactions. Therefore, we decided to develop a microfluidic device capable of manipulating microdroplets {{in such a way that}} they could be efficiently mixed, split and sorted within iterative cycles. Since no microfluidic technology had been developed before in the Cronin Group, the first chapter of this thesis describes the soft lithographic methods and techniques developed to fabricate microfluidic devices. Also, special attention is placed on the generation of water-in-oil microdroplets, and the subsequent modules required for the manipulation of the droplets such as: droplet <b>fusers,</b> splitters, sorters and single/multi-layer micromechanical valves. Whilst the first part of this thesis describes the development of a microfluidic platform to assist chemical evolution, finding a compatible set of chemical building blocks capable of reacting to form complex molecules with endowed replicating or catalytic activity was challenging. Abstract 10 Hence, the second part of this thesis focuses on potential chemistry that will ultimately possess the properties mentioned above. A special focus is placed on the formation of peptide bonds from unactivated amino acids, despite being one of the greatest challenges in prebiotic chemistry. As opposed to classic prebiotic experiments, in which a specific set of conditions is studied to fit a particular hypothesis, we took a different approach: we explored the effects of several parameters at once on a model polymerisation reaction, without constraints on hypotheses on the nature of optimum conditions or plausibility. This was facilitated by development of a new high-throughput automated platform, allowing the exploration of a much larger number of parameters. This led us to discover that peptide bond formation is less challenging than previously imagined. Having established the right set of conditions under which peptide bond formation was enhanced, we then explored the co-oligomerisation between different amino acids, aiming for the formation of heteropeptides with different structure or function. Finally, we studied the effect of various environmental conditions (rate of evaporation, presence of salts or minerals) in the final product distribution of our oligomeric products...|$|R
