40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} if {{the use of a}} transpalatal (TPA) or Nance palatal arch with varying degrees of molar rotations significantly affects resistance to sliding during sliding mechanics. Also, to establish if there is reduced resistance to sliding using the extraoral tube (EOT) on molar bands opposed to the straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> when using a TPA or Nance- palatal arch with rotated molars Materials and method: A custom made experimental apparatus approximating the transpalatal arch, allowing for 1 -degree incremental changes to molar rotation was designed. A 0. 019 x 0. 025 ” stainless steel archwire was displaced through the molar tubes to determine the effect of molar rotation on resistance to sliding, determined as work. Unilateral and bilateral palatal rotations were evaluated as well as comparison of the extraoral and straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube.</b> Results: The work required to achieve a constant archwire displacement was significantly increased for bilaterally, palatally rotated molars compared with a unilateral rotation (p< 0. 05 for displacement of both 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm). Pearson correlation analysis identified a significant association between extent of molar rotation and difference in work between unilateral and bilateral rotated molars (p-value 0. 002 and 0. 01 for displacement of 0. 5 and 0. 1 mm respectively). Placement of the archwire in the extraoral tube significantly reduced the work required for a fixed displacement compared with the straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube.</b> The magnitude of the effect was greatest for bilateral palatal rotated molars and was highly significant (p < 0. 001 for 0. 5 mm). Conclusion: The relationship between work and molar rotation was found to be non-linear, with an exponential increase in work with increasing palatal rotations. Bilaterally, palatally rotated molars resulted in a significantly increased amount of work for all amounts of displacement of the archwire compared with a unilateral rotation. Use of the EOT significantly reduced the work required to displace the archwire compared with the straight <b>wire</b> <b>tube...</b>|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of turbulators (coiled <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> insert) as a passive method for heat {{transfer}} enhancement on heater performance of Mokhtar city gate station of Yasuj city has been evaluated. To analyze the performance and {{the effect of}} geometrical parameters of turbulators and physical parameters of the flow, steady state and incompressible flow were simulated through ANSYS CFX 14. 5. Shear stress transport (SST) turbulence model for modeling turbulated flow regime besides the wall has been used. Using simulation results, important performance parameters such as friction factor, Nusselt number, and thermal performance factor were calculated and deeply studied. In this study the effect of coiled <b>wire</b> <b>tube</b> insert as a turbulator on the performance of heater in two states of circular and elliptical tubes with similar cross sections has been surveyed.

The effects of inserting coiled <b>wires</b> in <b>tubes</b> on different parameters such as heat transfer coefficient, pressure drop, temperature distribution, velocity distribution and secondary flows are presented and discussed. The results show that using coiled <b>wire</b> in <b>tubes</b> leading to increase in  about 13. 44 % but increase the Δp about 14. 66 % with respect to the flow without nanofluid and coiled wire. Similarly, using nanofluid leading to increase in  about 5. 52 % but increase the  Δp about 8. 92 %.

Optimization was conducted with the Hooke-Jeeves method, which aims to optimize the geometry of the heat exchanger, especially on the diameter (dw) and the distance between wires (pw). The model developed to present heat transfer correlations on single staggered <b>wire</b> and <b>tube</b> heat exchanger was valid. The maximum optimization factor obtained when the diameter wire was 0. 9  mm and the distance between wires (pw) was 11  mm with the fref value = 1. 5837.
