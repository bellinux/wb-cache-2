As of 2009, Romania cultivated around 12900 ha of rice fields ranking third in the European Union in terms of rice area. The most important growing areas are located along the Danube River in Ialomiţa, Brăila, Olt and <b>Dolj</b> <b>counties.</b> In 2009 rice production reached 72,500 metric tons with an yield of 5.62 tons/hectare.

Assisting fellow deputy Gheorghe Manu, he tried to solve the Strousberg Affair by {{reselling}} railway stock to the Romanian state. Against other colleagues, he did not favor selling more stock to the Englishman George Crawley, noting that the latter lacked credentials. In May 1874, he was a rapporteur on the negotiations with Austria-Hungary, which dealt specifically with opening the Romanian railway grid to the Austrian StEG, through connections in Bolvașnița and Predeal.

Political scientist Vladimir Tismăneanu describes him as part of a group of [...] "deeply subservient" [...] and [...] "utterly incompetent" [...] figures with whom Ceauşescu surrounded himself in the 1980s. Starting in 1982, as part of her personal court of hagiographers, he was the undisputed second-in-command of Elena Ceauşescu; described by Tismăneanu as [...] "her most obedient servant", they were together responsible for all personnel appointments. In their study of the regime's last years, Roger Kirk, United States Ambassador to Romania from 1985 to 1989, and Romanian diplomat Mircea Răceanu assert that Bobu was [...] "arguably the most powerful Romanian after the two Ceauşescus", although his status within the party structure slipped following the thirteenth congress in November 1984.|$|R

In 1923, he obtained a university degree at Bucharest, became director of Gazeta Copiilor and was officially named Gusti's teaching assistant. In 1924, he founded a university organization {{in support of}} the League of Nations, serving as president until 1928. The same year, he became a frequent contributor to Societatea de mâine. In 1925, the Institute held a series of public speeches at the Carol I University Foundation; these were covered by Vlădescu-Răcoasa in Adevărul, where he was editor, and he would later write about similar events in Dimineața. That spring, Gusti initiated the first of his monographic research campaigns, in <b>Dolj</b> <b>County's</b> Goicea village; Vlădescu-Răcoasa was among the participants. The following year, he joined the team studying Rușețu, Brăila County. In 1926, he published Institutul Social Român. 1919-1926. From 1926 to 1928, he undertook studies at the University of Geneva and the Graduate Institute of International Studies, obtaining a doctorate in social sciences.|$|R
50|$|The most {{important}} investor in rice production in Romania is Riso Scotti Danubio, {{owned by the}} Italian company Riso Scotti the largest rice producer in Europe. In 2003 the company started to buy suitable lands for cultivation in Ialomiţa, Brăila, Olt and <b>Dolj</b> <b>counties</b> owning a total of 10000 ha. In 2009 Riso Scotti cultivated around 6000 ha with rice, {{the rest of the}} land currently being prepared for use. In the same year production amounted to 30,000 metric tons. Around 60% of the production is intended for internal use and 40% is exported to Slovakia, Czech Republic, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Hungary, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Armenia and Moldova. Another important company is Padova Agricultura owned by the Italian company Gruppo Roncato which ownes 4200 ha cultivated with rice in Brăila County. In 2009 the company produced 36,000 metric tons of rice which was mainly exported to Italy and Turkey but also delivered to Riso Scotti.

40|$|The {{radical changes}} that have {{occurred}} in the Romanian economy during the last decade have created new pressures on the country’s rural areas. Increasing industrial unemployment generated an urban-rural migratory flow of the population. The collapse of the agri-industrial processing and industrial sector increased rural unemployment. Since 1991, land reform has also generated new relationships in rural areas, and a massive redistribution of land. However, agriculture continues to function inefficiently, and is unable to provide a decent and sustainable standard of living for most rural inhabitants. Therefore, many donors and multilateral agencies are focusing on the potential of the rural non-farm economy (RNFE) and more specifically, Non-Farm Diversification (henceforth NFD) to reduce rural underemployment. NFD through the development of the RNFE may also provide means of increasing rural incomes, assist the improved utilisation of locally available resources and promote a better standard of living for rural population through enhanced non-farm employment opportunities and growth. There are several reasons underlying the rural poor’ decision to diversify: low on-farm incomes or returns on labour, the existence of a surplus of resources (land, capital, labour or knowledge), as a strategy to spread risk, or to smooth the impact of the fluctuations in a unique source of income (e. g. agriculture). The present paper relies on community-level data from a survey conducted in two Romanian <b>Counties,</b> <b>Dolj</b> and Brasov, to analyse the main determinants of NFD in rural areas. The main findings are placed in a national context and policy proposals are advanced. rural non-farm diversification and employment, transition economies, livelihood diversification...|$|R
40|$|Vlad III The Impaler, {{also known}} as Dracula, descended from the dynasty of Basarab, the first rulers of {{independent}} Wallachia, in present Romania. Whether this dynasty is of Cuman (an admixed Turkic people that reached Wallachia from the East in the 11 (th) century) or of local Romanian (Vlach) origin is debated among historians. Earlier studies have demonstrated the value of investigating the Y chromosome of men bearing a historical name, {{in order to identify}} their genetic origin. We sampled 29 Romanian men carrying the surname Basarab, in addition to four Romanian populations (from <b>counties</b> <b>Dolj,</b> N = 38; Mehedinti, N = 11; Cluj, N = 50; and Brasov, N = 50), and compared the data with the surrounding populations. We typed 131 SNPs and 19 STRs in the non-recombinant part of the Y-chromosome in all the individuals. We computed a PCA to situate the Basarab individuals in the context of Romania and its neighboring populations. Different Y-chromosome haplogroups were found within the individuals bearing the Basarab name. All haplogroups are common in Romania and other Central and Eastern European populations. In a PCA, the Basarab group clusters within other Romanian populations. We found several clusters of Basarab individuals having a common ancestor within the period of the last 600 years. The diversity of haplogroups found shows that not all individuals carrying the surname Basarab can be direct biological descendants of the Basarab dynasty. The absence of Eastern Asian lineages in the Basarab men can be interpreted as a lack of evidence for a Cuman origin of the Basarab dynasty, although it cannot be positively ruled out. It can be therefore concluded that the Basarab dynasty was successful in spreading its name beyond the spread of its genes...|$|R
