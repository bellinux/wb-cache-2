40|$|Nephrogenic {{systemic}} fibrosis (NSF) is a fibrotic disease generating {{intense interest}} {{due to its}} recent discovery, and unknown cause. It appears confined to patients with renal disease and presents as grossly thickened, indurated, tight skin that is woody to palpation. Histologically, the dermis contains thickened collagen bundles, numerous plump fibroblast-like cells, and elevated hyaluronan expression. Recent data suggest {{a link between the}} use of gadolinium chelate as an MRI contrast agent and the onset of the disease. Fibroblasts from the lesions of six NSF patients, all of whom were exposed to <b>gadodiamide,</b> were compared with control fibroblasts for hyaluronan and collagen synthesis. Serum from NSF patients was assessed for fibroblast hyaluronan-stimulating activity, collagen synthesis, and <b>gadodiamide</b> for its effect on fibroblast proliferation and matrix synthesis. NSF fibroblasts synthesized excess levels of hyaluronan and collagen compared with control fibroblasts, with up to 2. 8 -fold and 3. 3 -fold increases, respectively. NSF patient serum stimulated control fibroblast hyaluronan synthesis by up to 7 -fold, and collagen synthesis by up to 2. 4 -fold. 1 mM <b>gadodiamide</b> added to culture medium stimulated fibroblast growth in a dose-dependent manner, decreasing their doubling time from 28 h to 22 h, and increasing the maximum cell density. Even a short exposure to <b>gadodiamide</b> stimulated cell growth, suggesting that the cells were activated by the <b>gadodiamide.</b> The growth of fibroblasts within contracted collagen lattices was also significantly stimulated by <b>gadodiamide,</b> while fibroblasts exposed to <b>gadodiamide</b> synthesized increased levels of hyaluronan.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study {{was approved by}} all institutional review boards; {{informed consent was obtained}} from each subject before procedures. Two hundred forty-seven subjects were included; 240 received either contrast agent and were available for safety analysis; 222 were available for accuracy analysis. Enhanced 3 D MR angiography and DSA were performed; image data were evaluated in a double-blinded randomized study. Stenoses were classified as not relevant (or = 50 %). For detection of main stenosis, accuracy with enhanced 3 D MR angiography compared with that with DSA was determined. RESULTS: The difference in accuracy for imaging with <b>gadodiamide</b> and gadopentetate was 3. 6 %. Noninferiority was inferred because the lower bound of the exact two-sided 95 % confidence interval was - 10. 1 and was above the noninferiority margin (- 15 %). Accuracy for detection of the main stenosis was low, 56. 4 % for <b>gadodiamide</b> and 52. 8 % for gadopentetate group. Subgroup analysis with exclusion of inferior mesenteric artery and internal iliac arteries and the most false-positive stenosis classifications yielded better results: 76. 6 % and 71. 6 %, respectively. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative and positive predictive values did not differ substantially between study groups.

40|$|RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The authors {{assessed}} {{whether the}} small-molecular-weight magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrast agents dysprosium diethylenetriamepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (sprodiamide injection), which enhances T 2 *, and gadolinium diethylenetriamepentaacetic acid bismethylamide (<b>gadodiamide</b> injection), which enhances T 1, could improve {{the detection of}} reperfused ischemia of the rat intestine. METHODS: Eighteen rats were subjected to vascular occlusion of the distal ileum for 30 minutes, followed by reperfusion. Ten minutes after reperfusion, T 1 - and T 2 -weighted spin-echo (SE) images were obtained before and after administration of sprodiamide, <b>gadodiamide,</b> or both. The same imaging protocol was applied in another group of 18 rats subjected to 10 minutes of occlusion and reperfusion. Histologic examination of the intestine was performed after MR imaging. RESULTS: Villous injury (ie, denudation) was observed in most cases after 30 minutes of occlusion, but not after 10 minutes of occlusion. After 30 minutes of occlusion, the superficial part of the ischemic intestine was hyperintense to the normal intestine on unenhanced T 2 -weighted images. Administration of sprodiamide improved {{the contrast between the}} normal and ischemic intestine on T 2 -weighted images, and administration of both <b>gadodiamide</b> and sprodiamide improved the contrast on T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images.

40|$|Background. Nephrogenic {{systemic}} fibrosis may {{be caused}} by gadolinium (Gd) -containing magnetic reso-nance imaging contrast agents. Most reported cases were associated with one particular agent, gadodia-mide. Yet, unidentified cofactors might explain why only a minority of renal failure patients exposed to <b>gadodiamide</b> develop nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Methods. We conducted a case-control study of 19 histologically verified cases and 19 sex- and age-matched controls. All subjects had chronic renal failure when exposed to <b>gadodiamide.</b> Clinical, biochemical and pharmacological data were retrieved from medical records. Results. Cases had been exposed to a mean gadodi-amide dose of 0. 29 mmol/kg (range 0. 18 – 0. 50) shortly before first signs of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. Controls had been exposed to 0. 28 mmol/kg (0. 13 – 0. 49). Cumulative <b>gadodiamide</b> exposure while in chronic kidney disease stage 5 was significantly higher among cases compared with controls (0. 41 vs 0. 31 mmol/kg, P 0. 05) and among severe cases (n 9) compared with non-severe cases (0. 49 vs 0. 33 mmol/kg, P 0. 02). Severe cases developed primarily among patients in regular haemodialysis therapy at exposure. Cases had higher serum concentrations of ionized calcium and phosphate than controls and tended to receive higher doses of epoietin-b than controls at time of exposure. Severe cases were treated with higher doses of epoietin-b than non-severe cases at exposure (10. 8 vs 4. 4 103 IU/week, P 0. 02). Conclusions. Increasing cumulative <b>gadodiamide</b> exposure, high-dose epoietin-b treatment, and higher serum concentrations of ionized calcium and phosphate increase the risk of gadodiamide-related nephrogenic systemic fibrosis in renal failure patients. Severe cases seem to develop primarily among patients in regular haemodialysis therapy at exposure...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} imaging findings and staging of rectal carcinoma by using conventional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR imaging with an enema of superparamagnetic ferristene-based contrast material, and MR imaging with an enema of ferristene solution plus intravenous injection of <b>gadodiamide.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine patients (17 women, 12 men; age range, 39 - 91 years) referred with a diagnosis of rectal carcinoma were examined. Analysis of the rectal wall and staging of the tumor were performed. In all patients, the MR imaging findings were correlated with the histopathologic findings. RESULTS: The contrast material enema caused distention of the rectum and an intraluminal signal void, whereas the <b>gadodiamide</b> injection caused enhancement of the mucosa on T 1 -weighted images. This enhancement enabled evaluation of the normal rectal wall and differentiation of the mucosa, tunica muscularis, and perirectal space, which was not possible on the nonenhanced images. Double-contrast (ferristene solution plus <b>gadodiamide)</b> MR imaging was superior to imaging with only ferristene-based contrast material and had a sensitivity of 100 %, specificity of 70 %, and accuracy of 90 % in distinguishing tumor stages worse than Dukes A.

40|$|Identification {{of serious}} adverse drug {{reactions}} (sADRS) associated with commonly used drugs can elude detection for years. Reye’s syndrome (RS), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) among {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) patients were recognized in 1951, 2000, and 1998, respectively. Reports associating these syndromes with aspirin, <b>gadodiamide,</b> and epoetin, were published 29, 6, and 4 years later, respectively. We obtained primary information from clinicians who identified causes of these sADRs and reviewed factors contributing to delayed identification of these toxicities. Overall, 3, 500 aspirin-associated RS cases in the United States, 1, 605 gadolinium-associated NSF cases, and 181 epoetin-associated PRCA cases were reported. Delays in FDA regulation of over-the- counter medications and administration of aspirin to children contributed to development of RS. For NSF, in 1996, the Danish Medicine Agency approved high-dose <b>gadodiamide</b> administration to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing MR scans. Overall, 88 % of Danish NSF cases were from two hospitals and 97 % of United States’ NSF cases were from 60 hospitals. These hospitals frequently administered high-doses of <b>gadodiamide</b> to CKD patients. Another factor was the decision to administer linear chelated contrast agents versus lower risk macrocyclic chelated agents. For PRCA, increased use of subcutaneous epoetin formulations to CKD patients, {{in part due to}} convenience and cost-savings considerations, and a European regulatory requirement requiring removal of albumin as a stabilizer, led to toxicity. Overall, 81, 13, and 17 years elapsed between drug introduction into practice and identification of a causal relationship for aspirin, erythropoietin, and <b>gadodiamide,</b> respectively. A substantial decline in new cases of these sADRs occurred within two years of identification of the offending drug.

40|$|Purpose: To prospectively compare {{nephrotoxicity}} and radiodensity of plasma hyperosmotic gadolinium chelates (attenuation-osmotic {{ratio of}} 1 : 1) {{with those of}} plasma iso-osmotic iodine-based contrast media (attenuation-osmotic ratio of 3 : 1 or 6 : 1) after renal arteriography in ischemic porcine kidneys. Materials and Methods: The local animal care committee approved this study. The following contrast media were used: (a) iodixanol (150 mg of iodine per milliliter and 320 mg I/mL, 0. 29 osm/kg H 2 O), (b) iopromide (150 mg I/mL, 0. 34 osm/kg), (c) 0. 5 mol/L <b>gadodiamide</b> (0. 78 osm/kg), and (d) 1. 0 mol/L gadobutrol (1. 6 osm/kg). After left-sided nephrectomy, contrast media (3 mL per kilogram of body weight) were injected (20 mL/min) in a noncrossover design into the right renal artery of pigs during a 10 -minute ischemic period. There were eight pigs in each group and one group for each contrast medium. We compared histomorphology, radiographic contrast medium excretion, subjective radiodensity of nephrograms (70 kVp) {{at the end of}} injection, and contrast medium plasma half-life elimination times 1 - 3 hours after injection. Longer elimination times resulted in lower glomerular filtration rates. Results: Gadobutrol caused extensive tubular necrosis and moderate glomerular necrosis; <b>gadodiamide</b> and iopromide, minimal to mild tubular necrosis; and iodixanol, no necrosis. Gadobutrol was the only contrast medium to show no sign of excretion, and its plasma half-life elimination time (median, 1103 minutes; P =. 001) was significantly longer than that of other contrast agents. <b>Gadodiamide</b> had a significantly longer plasma half-life elimination time (median, 209 minutes; P =. 01) than did iodine-based contrast media (median, 136 - 142 minutes). The 320 mg I/mL dose of iodixanol had the highest radiodensity, whereas <b>gadodiamide</b> had the lowest radiodensity. The radiodensity of the 320 mg I/mL dose of iodixanol was greater than that of the 150 mg I/mL dose of iodixanol, which was equal to the radiodensities of the 150 mg I/mL dose of iopromide and 1. 0 mol/L gadobutrol, which in turn were greater than that of 0. 5 mol/L <b>gadodiamide.</b> Conclusion: Plasma iso-osmotic iodine-based contrast media used at commercially available concentrations have superior attenuation and nephrotoxic profiles compared with equal volumes of hyperosmotic nonionic 0. 5 - 1. 0 mol/L gadolinium-based contrast media when performing renal arteriographic procedures.

40|$|Aims of {{the study}} The aims of this study using <b>Gadodiamide</b> {{injection}} were to investigate: · Whether <b>Gadodiamide</b> injection was comparable to Gd-DTPA for the enhancement of CNS lesions. · The contrast effect at different field strengths. · The effective time-window for the enhancement of blood-brain barrier damage. · The relations between the concentration of contrast agent and enhancement in phantoms, and to correlate the results to doses given to patients. · The use of a higher dose in two important clinical problems; the detection of metastases in the brain, and the evaluation of patients with failed back surgery syndrome (patients with recurrent pain after surgery for lumbar disc herniation). Results and conclusions · <b>Gadodiamide</b> injection was comparable to Gd-DTPA with regard to both safety and diagnostic efficacy in the CNS. · The contrast effect of Gadolinium contrast agents is higher at 1. 5 T than at 0. 3 T both in phantoms and patients with a maximum ratio (signal lesion / signal grey matter) more than 50 % higher at 1. 5 T. · To achieve high contrast effect, heavily T 1 -weighted images are also important at both field strengths, as prolonging the repetition time from 400 ms to 600 ms reduced the ratio by 15 - 45 % depending on concentration. · The effective time-window for imaging of blood-brain barrier damage is between 2 - 5 and 25 - 30 minutes after injection and several scans can be performed without loss of enhancement. · To provide maximum detectability of blood-brain-barrier-damage in patients with brain lesions, higher doses of Gd contrast media should be useful, as the doses used clinically today do not utilize the maximum contrast effect, either at high or low field strength. However, higher doses are more important at low field strengths because the contrast effect is lower than at high field strengths. · High-dose (0. 3 mmol/kg b. w.) contrast-enhanced T 1 -weighted spin-echo MRI with <b>Gadodiamide</b> injection allowed detection of significantly (p<< 0. 01) more and smaller metastases than standard-dose (0. 1 mmol/kg b. w.)

Later dilution of these new structures, called bicosomes, demonstrated that lipid vesicles were able to isolate and protect bicelles entrapped inside them from the medium. Characterization of systems before and after dilution by dynamic light-scattering spectroscopy and cryo-transmission electron microscopy showed that free bicelles changed in size and morphology, whereas encapsulated bicelles remained unaltered by the effect of dilution. Free and entrapped bicelles (containing the paramagnetic contrast agent <b>gadodiamide)</b> were injected into rat brain lateral ventricles. Coronal and sagittal visualization was performed by magnetic resonance imaging. Whereas rats injected with free bicelles did not survive the surgery, those injected with bicosomes did, and a hyperintensity effect due to <b>gadodiamide</b> was observed in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results indicate that bicosomes are a good means of preserving the morphology of bicelles under dilution conditions...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Reconstruction of first-pass bolus {{information}} to derive regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) maps is commonly performed in many centers; how-ever, various protocols with different doses of paramagnetic contrast injections have been re-ported. We evaluated the dose dependency of rCBV maps in {{a brain tumor}} population by using three different doses of <b>gadodiamide</b> injection to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy in blinded reader sessions. METHODS: Eighty-three patients with intraaxial brain tumors (72 gliomas) were studied at three centers and randomized to receive a bolus injection of 0. 1, 0. 2, or 0. 3 mmol/kg per body weight of <b>gadodiamide.</b> rCBV maps were generated from T 2 *-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar sequences at 1. 5 T. Data processing was performed according to the indicator dilution theory. RESULTS: The mean contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) was significantly different between ga-dodiamide doses of 0. 1 and 0. 2 mmol/kg (CNR 5 8. 7 and 15. 7) and between 0. 1 and 0. 3 mmol/kg (CNR 5 17. 7). No {{significant difference was found}} between doses of 0. 2 and 0. 3 mmol/kg. Sensitivity for the differentiation of benign and malignant brain tumors was 80 %, 95 %, an...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The higher relaxivity of gadobenate dimeglumine {{compared}} with ga-dodiamide is potentially advantageous for contrast-enhanced brain MR imaging. This study intraindi-vidually compared 0. 1 -mmol/kg doses of these agents for {{qualitative and quantitative}} lesion enhancement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adult patients with suggested or known brain lesions underwent 2 identical MR imaging examinations at 1. 5 T, one with gadobenate dimeglumine {{and the other with}} <b>gadodiamide.</b> The agents were administered in randomized order separated by 3 – 14 days. Imaging sequences and postinjection acquisition timing were identical for the 2 examinations. Three blinded readers evaluated images qualitatively for diagnostic information (lesion extent, delineation, morphol-ogy, enhancement, and global preference) and quantitatively for contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). RESULTS: One hundred thirteen of 138 enrolled patients successfully underwent both examinations. Final diagnoses were intra-axial tumor, metastasis, extra-axial tumor, or other (47, 27, 18, and 21 subjects, respectively). Readers 1, 2, and 3 demonstrated global preference for gadobenate dimeglu-mine in 63 (55. 8 %), 77 (68. 1 %), and 73 (64. 6 %) patients, respectively, {{compared with}} 3, 2, and 3 patients for <b>gadodiamide</b> (P. 0001, all readers).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{contrast}} effects of <b>gadodiamide</b> injection at 0. 3 and at 1. 5 T, at different concentrations in phantoms, and to correlate {{the results to}} clinical doses used for examining brain lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Gel phantoms with T 1 and T 2 corresponding to brain gray matter were doped with different concentrations of <b>gadodiamide</b> injection and examined with T 1 -weighted sequences. Two different sets of phantoms were used, one for 0. 3 T and one for 1. 5 T. To express contrast, a quotient (RATIOphantom) between signals in each tube with <b>gadodiamide</b> injection and in the one without it was calculated. A corresponding quotient (RATIOpatient) between signals in brain metastases and in gray matter was calculated in 16 patients examined at 0. 3 T (0. 1 and 0. 3 mmol Gd/kg b. w.) and in 5 patients examined at 1. 5 T (0. 1 mmol Gd/kg b. w.). RESULTS: Maximum RATIOphantom and RATIOpatient were more than 50 % higher at 1. 5 T than at 0. 3 T at equal concentrations using heavily T 1 -weighted sequences. The use of SE TR/TE 600 / 30 instead of 400 / 25 reduced the contrast effect 15 - 45 % depending on concentration. Comparing RATIOpatient to RATIOphantom suggests that the maximum T 1 effect of Gd contrast media occurs at higher doses than in current clinical use, as at 0. 1 mmol/kg b. w. we achieved 38 % (0. 3 T) and 56 % (1. 5 T) of the maximum phantoms. At 0. 3 mmol/kg b. w. we achieved 63 % (0. 3 T) of the theoretical maximum. CONCLUSION: The contrast effect of Gd contrast media is higher at 1. 5 T than at 0. 3 T. Higher doses than presently used might prove useful especially at lower field strengths where the contrast effect of Gd is less pronounced. Heavy T 1 -weighting is also important...|$|E

40|$|Background: Different {{doses of}} {{contrast}} agent are applied for magnetic resonance perfusion studies and mainly semiquantitative approaches {{have been reported}} for analysis. We aimed to determine the optimal dose for a visual detection of perfusion defects. Methods: 49 patients (59 ± 8 years; 33 male) scheduled for invasive angiography were examined at stress (0. 14 mg adenosine/kg body weight/minute) and rest using a TFE-EPI hybrid sequence (Philips ACS NT; 1. 5 T). Patients were assigned to three different dose groups of <b>gadodiamide</b> (0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 15 mmol/kg body weight) injected as a bolus via a peripheral vein. Visual assessment was used to detect a regional reduction of peak signal intensity or speed of contrast agent inflow at stress in comparison to rest. Results: Prevalence for coronary artery disease was 67 %. The highest diagnostic accuracy was reached for a dose of 0. 1 mmol gadodiamide/kg body weight (86 % p=nonsignificant vs. 0. 15 and 0. 05 mmol gadodiamide/kg). At this dose, no major artifacts related to the contrast agent were found. Conclusions: Visual assessment of myocardial perfusion using a high-flow rate contrast agent bolus injection and a TFE-EPI sequence can be best achieved with a dose of <b>gadodiamide</b> 0. 1 mmol/kg bodyweight...|$|E
