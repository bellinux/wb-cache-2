The implementation of the database system leads to closure of the gap in agency processes, where the incomplete and not always available summary of all the outbound orders complicates the running and <b>final</b> <b>invoicing</b> of the individual orders to clients...|$|R
50|$|Continuation or Recurring Invoicing is {{standard}} within the equipment rental industry, including tool rental. A recurring invoice is one generated on a cyclical basis during {{the lifetime of}} a rental contract. For example, if you rent an excavator from 1 January to 15 April, on a calendar monthly arrears billing cycle, {{you would expect to}} receive an invoice at the end of January, another at the end of February, another at the end of March and a <b>final</b> Off-rent <b>invoice</b> would be generated at the point when the asset is returned. The same principle would be adopted if you were invoiced in advance, or if you were invoiced on a specific day of the month.|$|R

40|$|Ausgangspunkt dieser Diplomarbeit ist meine Erfahrung bei der Durchführung eines {{international}} verteilten Software Implementierungsprojektes. Die Aufgabenstellung besteht darin, den Prozessablauf des Vertriebes zu beschleunigen, und die Qualität der Daten zur Ermittlung der Kennzahlen zu verbessern. Zusätzliche sollten weitere Daten gesammelt werden, die zukünftige Auswertungen über den Prozessdurchlauf ermöglichen. In jedem der beteiligten Unternehmen ist die Standard ERP Software Microsoft Dynamics NAV, Navision, im Einsatz. Innerhalb dieser bestehenden ERP Systeme, wird im Rahmen des Projektes ein zusätzliches Modul entwickelt, das den gesamten Vertriebsprozess vom ersten Kontakt des Kunden bis zur erfolgreichen Lieferung und Fakturierung unterstütz, sowie die Datenübertragung zwischen den beteiligten Systemen ermöglicht. Durch die einheitliche Entwicklung des zusätzlichen Moduls soll sichergestellt werden, dass der Prozess in allen Systemen nach den gleichen Regeln abläuft und die die Sammlung der Daten für das Reporting konsistent in den verschiedenen lokalen Installationen erfolgt. Im Rahmen der Diplomarbeit soll untersucht werden, wie der Prozess der Anforderungsanalyse verbessert werden kann. Als Vorgehensmodell wird das Software Capability Maturity Model herangezogen. Es soll geklärt werden, durch welche Maßnahmen die Qualität der Softwareentwicklung zu verbessern ist. Als Schwerpunkt wird die Überarbeitung der Anforderungen überprüft, ob diese in UML zu einem besseren Verständnis der Aufgabenstellung führen. Weiters soll untersucht werden, ob diese Darstellung den Wissenstransfer zu den Implementierungspartnern erleichtert. Im Detail wird dabei speziell auf die Erstellung eines erweiterten Use Case Templates eingegangen, sowie die genaue Ausformulierung einiger wichtiger Use Cases analysiert. Das Ergebnis dieser Diplomarbeit richtet sich an Software Entwickler im Bereich der Anpassung von Standard Software. Many Multinational enterprises {{do not use}} {{a central}} single instance of the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), instead they are utilizing local instance of the same ERP software. As the information used in managing a multinational enterprise originates in different locations, it is fragmented between these instances. With such an environment in place, {{it can be difficult}} to get a global distributed process mapped into the ERP systems. Starting point of this Diploma thesis was my personal experience during such an international distributed software implementation project. The task of this implementation project was the extension of existing standard ERP software to support the sales process to increase efficiency on the operational side, and to ensure consistent and comparable data for the sales reporting on the analytic side. Beside that, additional data for the monitoring of the process flow should be collected. The existing support of the process by IT systems has been found incomplete, especially concerning sales cases that transcend organizational units and are therefore represented in different ERP installations. Each of the involved companies uses the Standard ERP Software Microsoft Business Solutions Dynamics NAV, Navision. During this project an additional granule was developed, which supports the complete sale process, starting from the first inquiry from the customer until the <b>final</b> delivery and <b>invoicing.</b> Because of the central development of this granule, the implementation of this business process is based on the same rule set and the collection of the reporting data will be consistent in all systems. This thesis wants to analyze the possibilities for improvements on the requirements engineering for similar projects, which are implementing a business process into an existing ERP solution. The evaluation for the requirements is based on the Capability Maturity Model. The investigation wants to clarify, which practices are necessary to implement and will improve the quality of the software development process. The focus of this work is the verification of the rework on the existing documentation, if the use of the Unified Modeling Language is able to improve the understanding of the goals and tasks. It will also be investigated, if this representation in an UML model, in connection to the written requirements is able to improve the knowledge transfer to the international implementation partners. The focus will be the development of an extended use case Template, where some high important use case will be analyzed in detail. The target audiences for this thesis are software developers, who are involved in the field of customizing standard software...|$|R
