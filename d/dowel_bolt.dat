40|$|The spur and {{bevel gears}} of R- 11 engine fitted on MIG- 21 {{aircraft}} are fastened {{together by a}} set of six <b>dowel</b> <b>bolts.</b> A series of accidents caused by the failure of the <b>dowel</b> <b>bolts</b> had been reported. Bolts from five engines were examined in detail. The tell-tale marks on the gear assembly and on the fracture surface clearly indicate that there existed a gap between the gears leading to relative motion between the bolts and the bevel gear, resulting in fatigue failure...|$|R

This led to {{the separation of the}} two gears and disruption of drive to the various accessories of. the engine, resulting in an accident. Failure analysis revealed that the bolts had, failed by hydrogen embrittlement, the hydrogen pick up occurring during the phosphating treatment...|$|R
40|$|A {{fractured}} {{torque link}} lower sub-assembly and six fractured dowel pins belonging to main under-carriage of an aircraft {{were sent to}} the laboratory for fractographic analysis. Examination revealed that the eye-end of the torque link has opened up by tensile overload while all the <b>dowel</b> <b>bolts</b> got sheared off. There were no evidences of delayed failure like fatigue or stress corrosion cracking. It appears most probable that the main under-carriage has extended beyond the limit resulting in shearing off of all the dowel pins. This might have resulted in excessive load on the torque link lower sub-assembly causing it to fracture...|$|R

The results demonstrate that this bolt possesses the strength and stiffness necessary to achieve a satisfactory connection. Calculations based on the component approach of EC 3 predict that because {{the flexibility of the}} SHS face will, for most joint arrangements, limit the connection’s moment capacity, the strength of the blind bolt will normally be more than is required to match the strength of the equivalent joint configured with ordinary <b>dowel</b> <b>bolts...</b>|$|R

For elements in traction, a reduction of 25% in the working stress or an increase of 25% in the volume is therefore also necessary in the majority of cases. Determining the volume and the displacement of a structure using the indicators W and Δ is therefore reliable theoretically, providing that: ...|$|R

The complex is sited up to 350 ft, below grade principally in bedrock. The rock excavations were mined by TBM and drill and blast methods and supported {{by a combination of}} rock <b>bolts,</b> <b>dowels</b> and shotcrete. Water control was achieved using a combination of pre- and post-excavation grouting, drainage systems, drip shielding and air desiccation measures...|$|R

During past few years {{a wide variety of}} <b>dowels</b> and <b>bolt</b> types have been developed but most of them failed within {{a short period of time}} and the cost were high. Main objective of this research work was to design rock bolts using discarded cables at a low cost. The bolt consists of nearly 1. 6 m long cable and 16 cm of anchored part. Field data illustrated the amount of load that the bolt can carry as 5 KN. Suggestions were made to improve the design, which will enhance bolt performance. Field tests carried out at Bogala Graphite Lanka Ltd proved that cable bolts are effective in Sri Lankan conditions...|$|R
40|$|Eurocode 5 (EC 5) [1] as {{the current}} {{effective}} design code for timber structures contains a lot of rules for metal ­dowel-type fasteners like staples, nails, screws, <b>dowels</b> and <b>bolts.</b> At the moment engineers {{are not able to}} fullfill the requirements ­concerning stiness of connectors in an adequate mode only by use of the formulas implemented in EC 5. Growing availability of tools for modelling non-linearities within structures and materials even in commercial structural analysis software offers the chance to check traditional structural verifications with respect to their being up-to-date and to add or even replace them by more effcient strategies using modern software tools. As presented in this paper basic modelling only with beam elements is capable not only to reproduce the results according to the formulas of Johansen [5] for the ultimate load but also to predict the load-deformation-curve valid for every load level. Even the load level at the elastic limit can be deduced. Performance of the structural analysis of the whole system for both serviceability and ultimate limit state with only model is the big advantage of this approach, since the is no more the need of adjustment of the stiffness according to the corresponding load level. The current paper deals with a survey of the main design rules for dowel-type fasteners, the development of continuative strategies for a coherent system of approval based on timber specific fundamentals and the handling of the advanced approach using the example of a simple set of a dowel connector...|$|R
40|$|To design {{connections}} between timber parts with metal <b>dowels</b> (nails or <b>bolts),</b> two phenomena must be considered: bending {{of the metal}} dowel and the embedment strength in the wood. The Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR 7190 : 1997 proposes the methods used in the laboratory tests to determine the embedment strength with the metal dowell and, {{in the absence of}} testing, specifies relations to calculate the embedment strength from the compression strength. The aim of this research was to compare the embedment strength values obtained by experimental tests and calculated by the relationships established by the Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR 7190 : 1997. By the results of the hypothesis tests, it was possible to conclude that the estimate of the embedment strength parallel to the grain proposed by the Brazilian standard ABNT NBR 7190 : 1997, establishing equivalence with the strength compression results in the same direction, must be effective to the wood species Pinus taeda L., however, the same was not found in the perpendicular direction with respect to the grain, possibly explained by the alpha(e) values in the equation to calculed fe(90...|$|R
40|$|Adhesively bonded {{connections}} usually outperform traditional mechanical fasteners, as forexample <b>dowels,</b> screws of <b>bolts.</b> Among {{the most}} promising bonded joints commonly used intimber engineering, glued-in rods stand out for their capacity to achieve architecturallyappealing and yet mechanically performing connections [1]. Adhesively bonded connectionsrely upon a series of requirements to achieve adequate quality and performance; among themost critical are long curing times, minimum temperatures for curing, compliance with exactmixing ratios, and, {{in the case of}} glued-in rods, ensuring the complete filling of the borehole. The Fraunhofer IFAM has developed the so-called PASA technology (Pre ApplicableStructural Adhesive). These Adhesives allow a separation of the adhesive application and theactual joining process which can be carried out at different times and at different places [2]. The example considered in this research was realized as a reactive hotmelt epoxy resin; it issolid and tack-free at room temperature and is applied in melted state at about 80 °C. Thesubsequent curing of the adhesive occurs at a considerably higher temperature (> 120 °C), [3]. In the research presented herein, G-FRP rods were coated with a PASA filled with metallicparticles, leading to a semi-finished product, subsequently inductively heated, and finallytested for strength. The study demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} separate the adhesiveapplication (which requires much care) from the application on site (which much lessstringent requirements), thus lowering the hurdles for practitioners to consider adhesives forstructural applications...|$|R
40|$|Wood Plastic Composite (WPC) is wood based {{material}} that been produce by mixing sawdust as main composition and plastic polymer as bonding agent. Nowadays, WPC board already been produced in Indonesia using Sengon sawdust and recycle HDPE plastic. Sengon sawdust {{was used as}} WPC since its availability from plywood production waste, moreover HDPE plastic considered had higher strength and more rigid than PET plastic. WPC occasionally being used as non structural material, moreover from previous study about mechanical properties of WPC, {{it was found that}} WPC Sengon has high shear strength around 25 – 30 MPa. These lead that WPC Sengon had a potential used as shear wall sheathing, thus additional research need to be conducted in order to study the type of bolt and diameter of the bolt can be used for these shear wall. This study aimed to investigate the <b>dowel</b> bearing of <b>bolt</b> using full hole method based on ASTM D 5764 with type and bolt diameter as specimen variation. Two types of bolt were used in this study; stainless bolt and standard bolt with diameter each of 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm and 12 mm. According to ANOVA, there was insignificant result between stainless bolt and standard one, but there was significant result based on diameter of the bolt. Hereafter, it can be recommended the used of 10 mm diameter of bolt for structural purpose with dowel bearing strength around 67 – 70 MPa...|$|R
40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} methods are being progressively {{used to construct}} and replace bridges in North America. Unlike traditional {{bridge construction}} methods, accelerated bridge construction methods allow bridges {{to be built in}} a shortened period of time on the construction site. These methods reduce the road closure time and the traffic disruption that are associated with bridge construction. One of these methods is carried out by prefabricating the bridge elements offsite and then assembling them onsite in a time-efficient way to build the bridge. This construction method can be used to build steel-precast composite bridges, where steel plate girders are connected to full-depth precast concrete deck panels. For the expeditious construction of composite bridges, a proper shear connection detail is needed to develop composite action between the steel plate girders and the precast concrete deck panels. This research project investigated two types of shear connection that would accelerate the construction of steel-precast composite bridges. First, finite element analysis was used to study the behaviour of composite bridge girders with panel end connections. The girders were analyzed for their load-displacement behaviour, cross-sectional stress and strain profile, and connection force distributions. Secondly, experimental push tests were conducted to study the load-slip behaviour of bolted connections. The effects of steel-concrete interface condition, bolt diameter and bolt tension on the shear capacity of bolted connections were analyzed. Based on the finite element analysis results, it is concluded that the panel end connected girder exhibited strong composite action at service and ultimate load. The level of composite action decreased slightly when the panel end connection stiffness was reduced by a factor of ten. Based on the experimental results, it is concluded that the total shear capacity of the bolted connection is the sum of the friction resistance and the <b>bolt</b> <b>dowel</b> action resistance. The friction resistance of the connection depends on the interface condition and the bolt clamping force. An analytical model that can predict the ultimate shear capacity of bolted connections has been developed and recommended. The proposed model is shown to give reliable predictions of the experimental results. It should be noted that bolted connections exhibit good structural redundancy because the bolt fracture failures do not happen simultaneously...|$|R
40|$|This is an {{interpretation}} of my sculptures, developed during two years of creating and living with them, rather than a pre-conceived formula {{to which they were}} made. Initially, none of these ideas were consciously in mind; as time passed I came to understand what meanings and influences were at work. The content of this series has four basic aspects: materials, structural forms, energy and connections. These four intertwine in both obvious and subtle relationships; each is linked to, and incomplete without the others. Each sculpture emphasizes these aspects in varying degrees. The materials are bronze and wood. The inorganic and the organic, firmness and flexibility are combined to produce structural strength. These two particular materials take age and exposure well, becoming more beautiful with time, yielding rich colors and textures. The wood is weathered and cracked, and the bronze carries a heavy patina to impart a reeling of great age. The structural forms are kept within the limits of what I call a ???bronze age??? technology. This is less an historical criteria than a discipline of respect for the virtues and limitations of the metal. Respect for materials requires creating forms particularly appropriate to the materials, using their properties to fullest advantage, but not demanding performance beyond their capabilities. Bronze has strength when in mass, but is weak when light and thin. Therefore the bronze parts are heavy and massive and without such ???iron age??? devices as threads, nuts and bolts. Bronze is too soft to adequately support forms such as these under stress. The sculptures employ toggles, wedges and heavy links because devices such as these exhibit an obvious visual logic in how they work to hold the sculpture together. Nails, <b>dowels,</b> nuts and <b>bolts</b> do not have this blatancy and do not evoke the same visual excitement. The less decorative traditions of Japanese carpentry share this spirit, not attempting to hide or minimalize their attaching members or fabrication, but letting the joints, slots and wedges be seen in their own rugged, functional beauty. Shibui, a Japanese term difficult to translate, describes the understated elegance, the muted colors and weathered textures or rustic places, the quietude and reverence so typical of ancient Japanese art and architecture.
