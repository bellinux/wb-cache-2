5|$|As a star's core shrinks, the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> {{from that}} surface increases, {{creating}} such radiation {{pressure on the}} outer shell of gas that it will push those layers away, forming a planetary nebula. If what remains after the outer atmosphere has been shed is less than 1.4 , it shrinks to a relatively tiny object {{about the size of}} Earth, known as a white dwarf. White dwarfs lack the mass for further gravitational compression to take place. The electron-degenerate matter inside a white dwarf is no longer a plasma, even though stars are generally referred to as being spheres of plasma. Eventually, white dwarfs fade into black dwarfs over a very long period of time.|$|E
25|$|A planet's {{movement}} {{around its}} rotational axis must also meet certain criteria if {{life is to}} have the opportunity to evolve. A first assumption is that the planet should have moderate seasons. If there is little or no axial tilt (or obliquity) relative to the perpendicular of the ecliptic, seasons will not occur and a main stimulant to biospheric dynamism will disappear. The planet would also be colder than it would be with a significant tilt: when the greatest <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> is always within a few degrees of the equator, warm weather cannot move poleward and a planet's climate becomes dominated by colder polar weather systems.|$|E
25|$|For {{refractory}} materials (e.g. platinum, tungsten, tantalum, some carbides and nitrides, etc.) the extremely {{high melting point}} (typically considered to be above, say, 1800°C) may be determined by heating the material in a black body furnace and measuring the black-body temperature with an optical pyrometer. For the highest melting materials, this may require extrapolation by several hundred degrees. The spectral radiance from an incandescent body {{is known to be}} a function of its temperature. An optical pyrometer matches the radiance of a body under study to the radiance of a source that has been previously calibrated as a function of temperature. In this way, the measurement of the absolute magnitude of the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> is unnecessary. However, known temperatures must be used to determine the calibration of the pyrometer. For temperatures above the calibration range of the source, an extrapolation technique must be employed. This extrapolation is accomplished by using Planck's law of radiation. The constants in this equation are not known with sufficient accuracy, causing errors in the extrapolation to become larger at higher temperatures. However, standard techniques have been developed to perform this extrapolation.|$|E

2500|$|An {{isotropic}} radiator is a theoretical point source of electromagnetic or sound waves which radiates the same <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> {{in all directions}}. [...] It has no preferred direction of radiation. [...] It radiates uniformly in all directions over a sphere centred on the source. [...] Isotropic radiators are used as reference radiators with which other sources are compared, for example in determining the gain of antennas. [...] A coherent {{isotropic radiator}} of electromagnetic waves is theoretically impossible, but incoherent radiators can be built. [...] An isotropic sound radiator is possible because sound is a longitudinal wave.|$|E
2500|$|Feed {{illumination}} taper - The maximum {{gain for}} any aperture antenna is only achieved when {{the intensity of}} the radiated beam is constant across the entire aperture area. [...] However the radiation pattern from the feed antenna usually tapers off toward the outer part of the dish, so the outer parts of the dish are [...] "illuminated" [...] with a lower <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation.</b> [...] Even if the feed provided constant illumination across the angle subtended by the dish, the outer parts of the dish are farther away from the feed antenna than the inner parts, so the intensity would drop off with distance from the center. [...] So {{the intensity of the}} beam radiated by a parabolic antenna is maximum {{at the center of the}} dish and falls off with distance from the axis, reducing the efficiency.|$|E

2500|$|Heisenberg, after a {{collaboration}} with Kramers, {{began to understand}} that the transition probabilities were not quite classical quantities, because the only frequencies that appear in the Fourier series should be the ones that are observed in quantum jumps, not the fictional ones that come from Fourier-analyzing sharp classical orbits. He replaced the classical Fourier series with a matrix of coefficients, a fuzzed-out quantum analog of the Fourier series. Classically, the Fourier coefficients give the intensity of the emitted radiation, so in quantum mechanics the magnitude of the matrix elements of the position operator were the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> in the bright-line spectrum. [...] The quantities in Heisenberg's formulation were the classical position and momentum, but now they were no longer sharply defined. Each quantity was represented by a collection of Fourier coefficients with two indices, corresponding to the initial and final states.|$|E
2500|$|While x-rays would {{normally}} travel {{at the speed}} of light through a low-density material like the plastic foam channel filler between (2) and (3), the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> from the exploding primary creates a relatively opaque radiation front in the channel filler, which acts like a slow-moving logjam to retard the passage of radiant energy. [...] While the secondary is being compressed via radiation-induced ablation, neutrons from the primary catch up with the x-rays, penetrate into the secondary, and start breeding tritium via the third reaction noted in the first section above. [...] This Li-6 + n reaction is exothermic, producing 5 MeV per event. [...] The spark plug has not yet been compressed, and, thus, remains subcritical, so no significant fission or fusion takes place as a result. [...] If enough neutrons arrive before implosion of the secondary is complete, though, the crucial temperature differential between the outer and inner parts of the secondary can be degraded, potentially causing the secondary to fail to ignite. [...] The first Livermore-designed thermonuclear weapon, the Morgenstern device, failed in this manner when it was tested as Castle Koon on April 7, 1954. [...] The primary ignited, but the secondary, preheated by the primary's neutron wave, did not; thus, a weapon with a predicted one-megaton yield produced only 110 kilotons (the primary's yield).|$|E
2500|$|Nuclear weapons emit {{large amounts}} of thermal {{radiation}} as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, to which the atmosphere is largely transparent. This is known as [...] "Flash". The chief hazards are burns and eye injuries. On clear days, these injuries can occur well beyond blast ranges, depending on weapon yield. Fires may also be started by the initial thermal radiation, but the following high winds due to the blast wave may put out almost all such fires, unless the yield is very high, where the range of thermal effects vastly out ranges blast effects, as observed from explosions in the multi-megaton range. [...] This is because {{the intensity of the}} blast effects drops off with the third power of distance from the explosion, while the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>radiation</b> effects drops off with the second power of distance. This results in the range of thermal effects increasing markedly more than blast range as higher and higher device yields are detonated. Thermal radiation accounts for between 35–45% of the energy released in the explosion, depending on the yield of the device. In urban areas, the extinguishing of fires ignited by thermal radiation may matter little, as in a surprise attack fires may also be started by blast-effect-induced electrical shorts, gas pilot lights, overturned stoves, and other ignition sources, {{as was the case in}} the breakfast-time bombing of Hiroshima. Whether or not these secondary fires will in turn themselves be snuffed out as modern noncombustible brick and concrete buildings collapse in on themselves from the same blast wave is uncertain, not least of which, because of the masking effect of modern city landscapes on thermal and blast transmission are continually examined.|$|E
