5|$|Breathing {{involves}} <b>expelling</b> {{stale air}} from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs; a humpback whale's lungs can hold about 5,000 litres of air. Spout shapes differ among species, which facilitates identification.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to their function in respiration, the lungs also {{have a number of}} other functions. They are involved in maintaining homeostasis, helping in the regulation of blood pressure as part of the renin-angiotensin system. The inner lining of the blood vessels secretes angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) an enzyme that catalyses the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. The lungs are involved in the blood's acid-base homeostasis by <b>expelling</b> carbon dioxide when breathing.|$|E

50|$|If a student(s) {{has been}} <b>expelled</b> from two schools, then any state school is legally allowed to refuse {{admittance}} of that student. (Schools on special measures may refuse to admit {{a student who}} has been <b>expelled</b> from only one school.) Therefore, a student who has been <b>expelled</b> from two schools might be totally removed from the state education system. As a result, it is rare for a pupil to be <b>expelled</b> (or permanently excluded) in the UK's state sector.|$|R
5|$|The only {{significant}} Christian {{success of the}} Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the Holy Land, the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the capture of Lisbon, <b>expelling</b> its Moorish occupants.|$|E

5|$|After the {{revolution}} in Russia in 1917, the communist movement gradually gained footholds in many countries around the world. In Europe and the US, communist parties were formed, generally allied with trade union and labor causes. During the First Red Scare of 1919–1920, many Americans were fearful that Bolshevism and anarchism would lead to disruption within the US. In the late 1930s, state and federal legislatures passed laws designed to expose communists, including laws requiring loyalty oaths, and laws requiring communists to register with the government. Even the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), a free-speech advocacy organization, passed a resolution in 1939 <b>expelling</b> communists from its leadership ranks.|$|E

He initially traveled south to Daraa in the Hauran region where he gained the allegiance of local tribal leaders. However, a French ultimatum to the tribal leaders to expel Faisal or face the bombardment of their encampments compelled Faisal to head west to Haifa in British-held Palestine on 1 August and avoid further bloodshed. Faisal's departure from Syria marked an end to his goal of establishing and leading an Arab state in Syria.|$|E
5|$|An unusual type of {{predator}} deterrence {{is observed}} in the Malaysian exploding ant. Social hymenoptera rely on altruism to protect the entire colony, so the self-destructive acts benefit all individuals in the colony. When a worker ant's leg is grasped, it suicidally expels the contents of its hypertrophied submandibular glands, <b>expelling</b> corrosive irritant compounds and adhesives onto the predator. These prevent predation {{and serve as a}} signal to other enemy ants to stop predation {{of the rest of the}} colony.|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovakia's {{hardline}} {{communist government}} agreed {{to close its}} border with East Germany to choke off the exodus. The closure produced uproar across East Germany and the GDR government's bid to humiliate refugees by <b>expelling</b> them from the country in sealed trains backfired disastrously. Torn-up identity papers and East German passports littered the tracks as the refugees threw {{them out of the}} windows. When the trains passed through Dresden, 1,500East Germans stormed the main railway station in an attempt to board. Dozens were injured and the station concourse was virtually destroyed.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much {{attention}} has been given to the compound nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by <b>expelling</b> closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|In Besançon, {{the people}} called for Catholic Philip II of Spain {{to help fight}} all heresies in 1571. In {{response}} to this, the new archbishop, Claude de La Baume, demanded that anybody suspected of heresy be expelled from Besançon. Local authorities kept count of the Protestants in the city, <b>expelling</b> fifty of them later. The outcast Protestants took refuge in Switzerland and Montbéliard. In the midst of increasing violence in the region after the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572, the Protestant personae non gratae gathered in Montbéliard and Neuchâtel before marching to Besançon in 1575.|$|E
5|$|In his absence, {{the issue}} of female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) had become a topic of strong debate in Kikuyu society. The Protestant churches, backed by European medics and the colonial authorities, supported the abolition of this traditional practice, but the KCA rallied to its defence, claiming that its abolition would {{be a threat to}} the structure and customs of Kikuyu society. Anger between the two sides had heightened, with several churches <b>expelling</b> KCA members from their congregations, and it was widely believed that the January 1930 killing of the American nun, Hulda Stumpf, had been due to the issue. As Secretary of the KCA, Kenyatta soon attended a meeting with church representatives. There, he expressed the view that although he personally opposed FGM, he regarded its legal abolition as counter-productive, and that the churches should focus on eradicating the practice through education of its harmful effects on women's health. The meeting ended without compromise, and John Arthur—the head of the Church of Scotland in Kenya—later complained about what he described as Kenyatta's dishonesty during the debate, <b>expelling</b> him from the church. In 1931, Kenyatta took his son out of the church school at Thogota and enrolled him in a KCA-approved, independent school.|$|E

5|$|On 6 August, Quwatli {{established}} a long-term {{agreement with the}} USSR, entailing a long-term Soviet loan to fund development works in Syria and the Soviet purchase of {{a large portion of}} Syrian agricultural and textile surpluses. US fears that Syria was approaching a communist takeover had prompted an attempted CIA-sponsored coup to replace the Quwatli government with former president Shishakli. However, the coup plot was foiled by the head of Syrian intelligence, Abdel Hamid al-Sarraj, on 12 August and Syria consequently expelled the US military attaché from Damascus. The US, which denied the coup plot, responded by <b>expelling</b> the Syrian ambassador from Washington and recalling its ambassador from Syria.|$|E

40|$|Many cnidarians contain endosymbiotic zooxanthellae (Symbiodinium sp.). These algae {{translocate}} photosynthetic {{products to}} their host. However, in high light conditions the algae may produce {{reactive oxygen species}} which can damage the host, potentially triggering algal expulsion. The host may also preferentially <b>expel</b> dividing algae {{in order to maintain}} a constant algal density. In this study, algal expulsion was measured in the symbiotic sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. When the anemones were exposed to high light and high oxygen treatments, their algal density remained constant but their algal expulsion increased. Many of the <b>expelled</b> algae were dead, suggesting that the host may <b>expel</b> algae which have been damaged by reactive oxygen species. To determine if the host preferentially <b>expels</b> dividing algae, samples of algae that had been either <b>expelled</b> or artificially isolated from the host were incubated for various time periods. The mitotic index of the <b>expelled</b> algae initially dropped but began to increase during incubation, suggesting that the host may preferentially <b>expel</b> recently-divided algae. The mitotic index of the artificially isolated algae also appeared to increase during incubation, suggesting that the host may limit algal growth in hospite. ...|$|R

On the night of 27 August, Ahmat Acyl, leader of the Volcan Army, attacked Faya-Largeau with the support of Libyan troops in what was apparently an attempt by Gaddafi to remove Goukouni from the leadership of the FROLINAT, replacing him with Acyl. The attempt backfired, as Goukouni reacted by <b>expelling</b> all Libyan military advisors present in Chad, and started searching for a compromise with France.|$|E
5|$|Respiration {{involves}} drawing {{water into}} the mantle cavity through an aperture, passing it through the gills, and <b>expelling</b> it through the siphon. The ingress of water is achieved by contraction of radial muscles in the mantle wall, and flapper valves shut when strong circular muscles force the water out through the siphon. Extensive connective tissue lattices support the respiratory muscles {{and allow them to}} expand the respiratory chamber. The lamella structure of the gills allows for a high oxygen uptake; up to 65% in water at 20⁰C. Water flow over the gills correlates with locomotion, and an octopus can propel its body when it expels water out of its siphon.|$|E
