5|$|East of Montrose Road, {{the highway}} is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved median, and passes north {{of a forest}} as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> an {{interchange}} with the QEW. As well as a partial cloverleaf interchange that provides almost all directional movements, this four-level stack interchange features two flyovers that arc from south to east {{as well as a}} four lane mainline that curves from north to east, directing most westbound Highway420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.|$|E
5|$|East of the swamp, {{the road}} enters Essa, where it intersects the Sunnidale Road (Simcoe County Road40). From there to Barrie, the highway {{passes through a}} largely rural area. It intersects former Highway131, now Simcoe County Road27, then enters Barrie at Miller Drive, curving northeast. East of Ferndale Drive, the route crosses Highway400 at Exit96. Shortly thereafter, as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the {{waterfront}} of Kempenfelt Bay, the route ends at High Street in downtown Barrie.|$|E

5|$|Further downstream, {{the creek}} passes through Fair Oaks Ranch and Bulverde. The steady flow begins to {{dissipate}} {{in certain areas}} as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> Camp Bullis in northern San Antonio, leaving dry patches that reveal a rocky bottom. Such dry patches continue as it heads east, forming the boundary between Bexar and Comal Counties. Steady flows {{pick up on the}} boundary between Bexar and Guadalupe Counties, passing through Randolph Air Force Base.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes from supercells {{follow a}} {{recognizable}} life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it {{an area of}} quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the ground, and drags the supercell's rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.|$|E
5|$|NY391 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY277 (Herman Hill Road) in North Boston, a hamlet within {{the town of}} Boston. It heads to the northwest as Boston State Road, passing by suburban homes as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the Southern Expressway (US219). The two highways meet {{by way of a}} diamond interchange. West of the exit, NY391's surroundings become more rural as it enters the town of Hamburg, where it passes by open fields and a handful of houses.|$|E

5|$|The {{valley of}} Darby Creek is {{considerably}} narrower in its upper reaches, but widens out as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the Delaware River. Numerous {{reaches of the}} creek have been armored with boulders or riprap. Upstream of the tributary Cobbs Creek, the stream's channel is sinuous and the creek flows through a narrow valley bordered by low, steep hills. From Cobbs Creek downstream to its mouth, the creek is in a tidal flat.|$|E
5|$|This is Arizona's widest {{and most}} {{congested}} freeway, entering {{the metropolitan area}} on its western edge {{in the city of}} Buckeye as the Papago Freeway. It continues eastward through the cities of Goodyear, Avondale, and Tolleson; where it has an interchange with northbound Loop 101. Following Tolleson, I-10 reaches Phoenix's western city limits, and as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> downtown, there is a four-level symmetrical stack interchange with Interstate 17 known by locals as The Stack.|$|E
5|$|A {{member of}} the genus Latrodectus in the family Theridiidae, the redback belongs in a clade with the black widow spider, with the katipo as its closest relative. A 2004 {{molecular}} study supports the redback's status as a distinct species, as does the unique abdomen-presenting behaviour of the male during mating. The close {{relationship between the two}} species is shown when mating: the male redback is able to successfully mate with a female katipo producing hybrid offspring. However, the male katipo is too heavy to mate with the female redback, as it triggers a predatory response in the female when <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the web, causing the female to eat it. There is evidence of interbreeding between female katipo and male redbacks in the wild.|$|E

5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both directions in the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} ecology concept is r/K selection theory, {{one of the}} first predictive models in ecology used to explain life-history evolution. The premise behind the r/K selection model is that natural selection pressures change according to population density. For example, when an island is first colonized, density of individuals is low. The initial increase in population size is not limited by competition, leaving an abundance of available resources for rapid population growth. These early phases of population growth experience density-independent forces of natural selection, which is called r-selection. As the population becomes more crowded, <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the island's carrying capacity, thus forcing individuals to compete more heavily for fewer available resources. Under crowded conditions, the population experiences density-dependent forces of natural selection, called K-selection.|$|E
5|$|A simple model which predicts lyotropic phase {{transitions}} is the hard-rod model {{proposed by}} Lars Onsager. This theory considers the volume {{excluded from the}} center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, {{there is very little}} volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a decrease in the net positional entropy of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).|$|E

5|$|As <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the {{southern}} end of the Bruce Peninsula, the route bisects Port Elgin, then curves abruptly towards Lake Huron and passes through Southampton before curving to the east towards Owen Sound. Between those two places, the highway is generally straight, except at the boundary between Bruce and Grey Counties as well as the descent of the Niagara Escarpment at Springmount. Several communities line this inland stretch of highway, including Chippewa Hill, Kelly's Corners, Elsinore, Allenford, Alvanley and Jackson. At Springmount, the route encounters Highway 6, which joins Highway21 to form Ontario's only wrong-way concurrency east to Owen Sound.|$|E
5|$|As {{the route}} heads east, it passes Pine View Cemetery and several local businesses. At an {{intersection}} with Glenwood Avenue (CR34), the county's internal designation for NY254 becomes CR70, whereafter the route passes over Halfway Brook {{and under the}} Gerald B. Solomon Bikeway Bridgeâ€“ {{a part of the}} Warren County Bikeway. The highway progresses southeasterly upon intersecting NY9L as NY254 turns due southeast to avoid Floyd Bennett Memorial Airport. Along this stretch, NY254 heads through undeveloped land before entering another area of commercial development as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the outskirts of Hudson Falls. Here, the route meets NY32 at Highland Avenue before intersecting Lower Warren Street (here unsigned NY911E) {{on the banks of the}} Hudson River.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill, I-196 enters the urban core of Grand Rapids. The freeway runs eastward through {{residential}} neighborhoods on the city's west side as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the interchange with US131. This complex structure is adjacent to the Grand River north of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Museum. The carriageways for I-196 run through the interchange on different levels, with the eastbound traffic carried down near river level and the westbound lanes above the criss-crossing carriageways of US131's freeway. I-196 crosses the river {{on the opposite side of}} the interchange and both directions return to the same level. The freeway picks up an additional lane at this point as the median is replaced by a concrete barrier.|$|E

5|$|Even though Eris can be up {{to three}} times farther from the Sun than Pluto, <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> close enough {{that some of the}} ices on the surface might warm enough to sublime. Because methane is highly volatile, its {{presence}} shows either that Eris has always resided in the distant reaches of the Solar System, where it is cold enough for methane ice to persist, or that the celestial body has an internal source of methane to replenish gas that escapes from its atmosphere. This contrasts with observations of another discovered TNO, , which reveal the presence of water ice but not methane.|$|E
5|$|Gill Creek and NY61 {{continue}} to run parallel {{for one more}} block before they separate ahead of Pine Avenue, once known as NY62A and now designated as US62 Business. The intersection between Pine and Hyde Park Boulevard marks the southwestern limits of Hyde Park, {{one of the largest}} parks {{in the vicinity of the}} city. For the next dozen blocks, NY61 acts as the divider between the residential neighborhoods of downtown Niagara Falls and the open spaces of Hyde Park, passing Sal Maglie Stadium as it heads north. At Linwood Avenue, the homes return to both sides of NY61 as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> Porter Road, which carries NY182. While Porter Road ends here, NY182 turns north, joining NY61 for two blocks to Ontario Avenue, where NY182 turns west toward the Whirlpool Rapids Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Here, Route 31 {{begins a}} {{concurrency}} with U.S. Route 202, and both routes continue north as a four-lane divided surface road with jughandles, intersecting County Route 602 (Wertsville Road). The next intersection is for Old York Road, which {{heads to the}} southwest as Route 179 and to the northeast as County Route 514. Shortly past this intersection, the route briefly forms the border between East Amwell Township {{to the west and}} Raritan Township to the east before crossing entirely into Raritan Township. The road continues north through farms, reaching commercial development as <b>it</b> <b>approaches</b> the Flemington area. Past the intersection with County Route 611 (South Main Street), the road widens to six lanes and crosses into Flemington. The road comes to the Flemington Circle where Route 31 heads north and Route 12 heads west.|$|E
