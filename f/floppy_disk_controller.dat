25|$|Gary Kildall {{originally}} developed CP/M during 1974, as an operating system {{to run on}} an Intel Intellec-8 development system, equipped with a Shugart Associates 8-inch floppy disk drive interfaced via a custom <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>controller.</b> It was written in Kildall's own PL/M (Programming Language for Microcomputers). Various aspects of CP/M were influenced by the TOPS-10 operating system of the DECsystem-10 mainframe computer, which Kildall had used as a development environment.|$|E
25|$|The new B+ was {{incapable}} of operating some original BBC B programs and games, such as, for example, the very popular Castle Quest. A particular problem was {{the replacement of the}} Intel 8271 <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>controller</b> with the Western Digital 1770 – not only was the new controller mapped to different addresses, it was fundamentally incompatible and the 8271 emulators that existed were necessarily imperfect for all but basic operation. Software that used copy protection techniques involving direct access to the controller, simply would not operate on the new system. Acorn attempted to alleviate this, starting with version 2.20 of the 1770 DFS, via an 8271-backward- compatible Ctrl+Z+Break option.|$|E

25|$|A {{spindle motor}} {{in the drive}} rotates the {{magnetic}} medium at a certain speed, while a stepper motor-operated mechanism moves the magnetic read/write head(s) radially along {{the surface of the}} disk. Both read and write operations require the media to be rotating and the head to contact the disk media, an action originally accomplished by a disk-load solenoid. Later drives held the heads out of contact until a front-panel lever was rotated (5¼") or disk insertion was complete (3½"). To write data, current is sent through a coil in the head as the media rotates. The head's magnetic field aligns the magnetization of the particles directly below the head on the media. When the current is reversed the magnetization aligns in the opposite direction, encoding one bit of data. To read data, the magnetization of the particles in the media induce a tiny voltage in the head coil as they pass under it. This small signal is amplified and sent to the <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> <b>controller,</b> which converts the streams of pulses from the media into data, checks it for errors, and sends it to the host computer system.|$|E

However, the WD integrated circuit that arguably drove Western's forward integration was the 1771 chip, the first disk drive formatter/controller, replacing boards of TTL logic.

25|$|Apple {{encouraged}} hardware {{developers to}} produce PCI compatible peripherals {{that could be}} added to the Pippin. The only official method of producing add-ons for the Pippin was by developing PCI-compatible devices, and then placed in a docking station cabinet. A proprietary riser card interface (referred to by Apple as an X-PCI slot) is located on the bottom of a Pippin system, and is used by docking stations. A docking station for a Pippin can contain a variety of hardware, such as SCSI or <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive <b>controllers,</b> video interfaces, codecs, or network interfaces such as Ethernet. The logic board passes PCI signals through the X-PCI docking interface, and then to the docking station. Docking stations within the Pippin line do not provide pass-through support, thereby limiting a Pippin system to use only one docking station at one time. For example, a docking station for a <b>floppy</b> <b>disk</b> drive would need to be removed in order to attach a docking station for the magneto optical drive. Katz Media produced a generic docking station, containing a PCI slot, allowing a user to install PCI cards. No PCI-based peripherals were ever developed specifically for the Pippin.|$|R
