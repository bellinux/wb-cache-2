5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on whiskey. In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts {{by means of an}} increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on Whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).|$|E
5|$|Many farmers {{distilled}} their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, increasing its value while lowering its transportation costs. At that time, whiskey {{was used as}} a form of currency on the frontier. When the federal government imposed an <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E
40|$|I examine <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> levied on multiproduct retailers. <b>Excise</b> <b>taxes</b> reduce {{equilibrium}} {{output and}} decrease equilibrium product variety {{in the short}} run, but taxes can raise output per product {{in the long run}} and induce entry. <b>Excise</b> <b>taxes</b> are overshifted into prices {{in a wide range of}} cases, including under linear and concave demand conditions, and <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> shift less than one-for-one into prices only when demand is highly convex. Multiproduct transactions substantively alter the efficiency of ad valorem and specific forms of <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> and affect the comparison of relative tax performance over short-run and long-run time horizons.

5|$|Prior to the {{cessation}} of passenger-only service in 2003, the state legislature passed a bill allowing non-state entities to operate their own public or private ferries near Washington State Ferries routes. Kitsap Transit, a public transit agency serving Kitsap County with bus service, decided to place a 0.3 percent sales tax increase and motor vehicle <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on the November 2003 ballot to fund a passenger-only ferry service to replace the state-run ferries. The ballot measure was rejected by 61 percent of voters, with support mostly coming from Bainbridge Island, downtown Bremerton, and Kingston.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> {{continued}} through 1793 in the frontier counties of Appalachia. Opposition remained especially strident in western Pennsylvania. In June, Neville was burned in effigy by {{a crowd of}} about 100 people in Washington County. On the night of November 22, 1793, men broke into the home of tax collector Benjamin Wells in Fayette County. Wells was, like Neville, one of the wealthier men in the region. At gunpoint, the intruders forced him to surrender his commission. President Washington offered a reward for the arrest of the assailants, to no avail.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied with what he viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E

50|$|Both {{the federal}} and state {{government}}s levy <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> on goods such as alcohol, motor fuel, and tobacco products. The laws of the federal government and of some state governments impose excises known as the income tax. Even though federal <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> are geographically uniform, state <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> vary considerably. Taxation constitutes a substantial proportion of the retail prices on alcohol and tobacco products.|$|R

5|$|In {{response}} of diversifying revenues, as three-fourths of revenue gathered was from commerce with Great Britain, Hamilton attempted once again during his Report on Public Credit when presenting it in 1790 to implement an <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> both imported and domestic spirits. The taxation rate was graduated {{in proportion to}} the whiskey proof, and Hamilton intended to equalize the tax burden on imported spirits with imported and domestic liquor. In lieu of the excise on production citizens could pay 60 cents by the gallon of dispensing capacity, along with an exemption on small stills used exclusively for domestic consumption. He realized the loathing that the tax would receive in rural areas, but thought of the taxing of spirits more reasonable than land taxes.|$|E
5|$|The DSTT is {{open for}} 20 hours on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00am to 1:00am the {{following}} day, and for 18 hours on Sundays, from 6:00am to midnight. At {{the time of its}} opening in 1990, the Metro Bus Tunnel only operated from 5:00am to 7:00pm on weekdays and 10:00am to 6:00pm on Saturdays, with no Sunday service; the operating hours were temporarily extended into weekday nights from 1998 to 2000 {{at the request of the}} Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Mariners, but were cut after the passage of Initiative 695 and subsequent loss of motor vehicle <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> revenue. Preparations for Link light rail service restored late-night and full weekend hours for the tunnel, introduced in June 2009 after Sound Transit Express route 550 moved all of its trips into the tunnel.|$|E
5|$|The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 {{effectively}} made possession or {{transfer of}} marihuana illegal throughout the United States under federal law, excluding medical and industrial uses, through imposition of an <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on all sales of hemp. Annual fees were $24 ($637 adjusted for inflation) for importers, manufacturers, and cultivators of cannabis, $1 ($24 adjusted for inflation) for medical and research purposes, and $3 ($82 adjusted for inflation) for industrial users. Detailed sales logs {{were required to}} record marihuana sales. Selling marihuana to any person who had previously paid the annual fee incurred a tax of $1 per ounce or fraction thereof; however, the tax was $100 ($2,206 adjusted for inflation) per ounce or fraction thereof to sell any person who had not registered and paid the annual fee.|$|E
5000|$|In {{this broad}} sense, income taxes, value added taxes (VATs), sales taxes, and {{transfer}} taxes {{are examples of}} other <b>excise</b> <b>taxes,</b> but are typically not called <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> (in the United States) because of the different ways they are imposed. In the United States, essentially the only <b>taxes</b> called <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> are the taxes on quantities of enumerated items (whiskey, wine, tobacco, gasoline, tires, etc.). Other taxes on certain events may technically be considered <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> in the broad sense, but {{may or may not}} be collected under the name [...] "excise tax" [...] where the term is used in a different, more narrow sense.|$|R

5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 distillers in Pennsylvania who had not paid the <b>excise</b> <b>tax.</b> Under the law then in effect, distillers who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent distillers to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The voter {{approval}} of Initiative 695 in 1999, which eliminated the motor vehicle <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> used to fund ferry service, cut $93 {{million from the}} ferry system's budget {{by the end of}} 2001. Voter rejection of 2002's Referendum 51, which would have funded the replacement of car ferries with a gas tax, led the state to consider eliminating passenger-only service to Bremerton and Vashon Island {{to make up for the}} shortfall. In May 2003, the state legislature approved cuts to ferry service, including the elimination of passenger-only ferries. Passenger-only ferry service ceased operations on September 20, 2003, and the MV Chinook and MV Snohomish were sold in 2008 to Golden Gate Ferries in the San Francisco Bay Area after an unsuccessful auction on eBay.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the estates' {{contributions}} {{were limited}} to six years, yet the Frederick William obliged the estates to continue the payments thereafter and created a dedicated office to collect the contributions. The contributions were confirmed by the estates in 1662, but transformed in 1666 by decree from a real estate tax to an <b>excise</b> <b>tax.</b> Since 1657, the towns had to contribute not soldiers, but monetary payments to the army, and since 1665, the estates were able to free themselves from contributing soldiers by additional payments. The initial army size of 8,000 men had risen to 25,000 to 30,000 men by 1688. By then, Frederick William had also accomplished his second goal, to finance the army independently of the estates. By 1688, these military costs amounted to considerable 1,500,000 talers or half of the state budget. Ensuring a solid financial basis for the army, undisturbed by the estates, was the foremost objective of Frederick William's administrative reforms. He regarded military success {{as the only way}} to gain international reputation.|$|E

40|$|The {{views and}} interpretations {{in this paper}} {{are those of the}} authors and not {{necessarily}} of the affiliated institutions. <b>Excise</b> <b>taxes,</b> notably on tobacco and petroleum products and on alcoholic beverages, raise revenue equivalent to 1. 9 percent of gross domestic product in Sub-Saharan Africa. Their importance varies widely and inexplicably across countries, and shows no trend over time. In principle, <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> are good revenue sources, cheap to administer and potentially efficient, especially when applied to goods that cause negative externalities or face price-inelastic demand. Excises are consistent with a fair tax system, and complement broadly based taxes such as the value added <b>tax.</b> <b>Excise</b> <b>taxes</b> have, however, been largely ignored in the professional literature on developing countries. This article aims to begin to redress this imbalance, by asking what role excises do, and should, play in the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper formulates five propositions: â€¢ Revenue from <b>excise</b> <b>taxes</b> could, and should, be doubled in most African countries; â€¢ Considerable scope exists for efficiency-enhancing changes in the structure of <b>excise</b> <b>taxes...</b>|$|R
5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} of {{recommendations}} in his Second Report on Public Credit. The report called {{for the establishment of}} a national bank and an <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for government funds, and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the Bank Bill of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern financial interests dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E
5|$|Other {{accounts}} {{describe the}} indictment of 24 men for high treason. Most of the accused had eluded capture, so only ten men stood trial for treason in federal court. Of these, only Philip Wigle and John Mitchell were convicted. Wigle had beaten up a tax collector and burned his house; Mitchell was a simpleton who had been convinced by David Bradford to rob the U.S. mail. Both men were sentenced to death by hanging, but they were pardoned by President Washington. Pennsylvania state courts were more successful in prosecuting lawbreakers, securing numerous convictions for assault and rioting. While violent opposition to the whiskey tax ended, political opposition to the tax continued. Opponents of internal taxes rallied around the candidacy of Thomas Jefferson and helped him defeat President John Adams in the election of 1800. By 1802, Congress repealed the distilled spirits <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> and all other internal Federal taxes. Until the War of 1812, the Federal government would rely solely on import tariffs for revenue, which quickly grew with the Nation's expanding foreign trade.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William's <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.|$|E

He supported Alexander Hamilton's economic policies whereby the federal government assumed the debts of the state governments and established the First Bank of the United States, the United States Mint, and the United States Customs Service. Congress passed the Tariff of 1789, the Tariff of 1790, and an <b>excise</b> <b>tax</b> on whiskey to fund the government and, {{in the case of the}} tariffs, address the trade imbalance with Britain. Washington personally led federal soldiers in suppressing the Whiskey Rebellion, which arose in opposition to the administration's taxation policies. He directed the Northwest Indian War, which saw the United States establish control over Native American tribes in the Northwest Territory. In foreign affairs, he assured domestic tranquility and maintained peace with the European powers despite the raging French Revolutionary Wars by issuing the 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality. He also secured two important bilateral treaties, the 1794 Jay Treaty with Great Britain and the 1795 Treaty of San Lorenzo with Spain, both of which fostered trade and helped secure control of the American frontier. To protect American shipping from Barbary pirates and other threats, he re-established the United States Navy with the Naval Act of 1794.|$|E
