40|$|International audienceFor {{the past}} 20 years, {{different}} policy and regulatory {{tools such as}} the agrienvironment schemes (AES) and the Natura 2000 network {{have been used in}} Europe to halt the ongoing decline of farmland birds resulting from agricultural intensification. Despite their wide implementation, bird populations are still declining at national and <b>European</b> <b>scales,</b> thus questioning the effectiveness of these schemes. Here, we examined the impact of the designation in 2004 of a Special Protection Area (SPA) for the little bustard on the local trends of two non-targeted, common but declining farmland birds, the skylark and the corn bunting, in an intensive arable landscape of western France. From 1996 to 2012, trends in skylark presence or abundance decreased whereas trends in corn bunting abundance first decreased and then showed a recovery; the trends differed between outside and inside the SPA. Outside the SPA and consistently with trends at the national and <b>European</b> <b>scales,</b> skylark abundance sharply decreased whereas corn bunting abundance first decreased and then stabilized or even slightly increased. Within the SPA, the skylark declined less, and the corn bunting abundance increased at a faster rate than outside. Our results suggest that the implementation of a SPA in this arable landscape had a positive impact on these two farmland passerines, at least for corn buntings, for which the implementation of AES clearly improved habitat. Our results also suggest that the extensive implementation of SPAs may have had a positive impact on bird population trends in farmlands at a regional level, where c. 150 000 ha (15 - 20 % of total arable landscape) have been designated since 2004. However, the SPA network (within Natura 2000) currently covers a mere 3. 7 % of French arable landscape, and it is therefore no surprise that specialist birds in farmland are still declining nationally...|$|E

40|$|A study {{based on}} AFLP markers was {{conducted}} to characterise the present population genetic structure of Carpinus betulus in Europe and to formulate guidelines {{for the use of}} this species in plantations on a local scale in Flanders. High within-population diversity and little (but significant) genetic differentiation were detected at both Flemish and <b>European</b> <b>scales.</b> However, there was a pattern of isolation by distance only at the European scale. Within-population gene diversity, a new rarefaction-based measure of number of genotypes ('band richness') and percentage of polymorphic loci are lower north of major mountain chains, suggesting that the mountain ranges formed a second bottleneck for the hornbeam during postglacial recolonisation. In Flanders, despite lower gene diversity, there were more polymorphic loci than in other European populations, a pattern that might have been caused by the mixing of material through planting, e. g. in hedges. In view of these findings, it is advised to create a single Flemish seed zone and to use preferentially reproductive material from this seed zone for new plantations in Flanders...|$|E

40|$|Across much of Europe, {{farmland}} {{birds have}} declined {{more than those}} in other habitats; {{many of the most}} threatened birds are dependent on extensive farming systems. This paper describes two case studies in which bird abundance was monitored in relation to spatial and temporal differences in agricultural management, one in southern Portugal, the other in central England. In Portugal, bird abundance and species diversity were monitored in 1995 using transects in relation to three agricultural systems. Bird abundance and species diversity were both low in simple intensively managed farmland, and highest in extensively managed farmland incorporating agroforestry systems (Montado). However, species of greatest national and European conservation concern were most abundant in simple, open, extensively managed landscapes. These extensive systems are therefore important for species diversity at national and <b>European</b> <b>scales.</b> In England, a conventionally managed farming system was adapted to encourage gamebirds for shooting, and bird abundance was monitored annually. Transects were conducted within the study area from 1992 to 1998 and additional transects were conducted randomly in the surrounding farmland from 1995 to 1997. Bird abundance increased during the management period and was higher in the study area than in the surrounding area, especially fo...|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to acquire}} {{insights}} into processes and mechanisms behind {{the development of}} policies on universal citizenship rights at higher political scales. It considers politics on national minority rights at different scales {{in the context of}} thoughts on postnationalisation and denationalisation of citizenship, which are mainly based on globalisation theories, and in the context of thoughts on shifts in the scales of state activity from a regulation theoretical perspective. The development of common rules on the rights of minorities at the global and <b>European</b> <b>scales</b> is examined and confronted with policies of the individual states. From a systematic analysis of all national minorities in the European Union it appears that common rules at higher scales still allow for considerable diversity. The differences can be attributed to different characteristics of the minorities themselves {{as well as of the}} states concerned. Both reflect the vital legacy of strongly different historical paths of nation-state formation in different parts of Europe. The outcomes are better fitting in a regulation theoretical perspective than in a globalisation theoretical perspective on the development of common rules on minority rights in Europe. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{demands of}} europeanization of foreign {{language}} teaching in university contexts requiring meeting standards or standardised descriptors shared within Europe and being {{available for a}} variety of purposes depending on specific institutional contexts and requirements are dealt with in this paper. To satisfy the demands of europeanization, a foreign language standard for technically orientated universities is being constructed at Brno University of Technology. Studentsâ, postgraduatesâ, other language teachersâ, subject specialistsâ, and some future employers â needs are being collected and analysed. The format of the standard is based on the âCommon European Framework of Reference for Languages: Learning, teaching, assessment â (Council of Europe, 2001), which provides a sound basis for the mutual recognition of language qualifications thus supporting the language department accountability at a technical university. The system of standardised evaluation descriptors reflecting students â professional orientation and <b>European</b> <b>scales</b> and levels will accompany language skills of listening, reading, writing, spoken interaction and spoken production at the level B 1 (a lower level of an independent user) and the level B 2 (a higher level of an independent user).

In addition to sites with above-average potential for wind and solar power, the âwater towersâ of Europe provide flexible, low-carbon power generation as well as energy storage. In the future, hydropower systems are expected to become more than mere electricity generators, serving a key role as flexible complements to intermittent power generators and as providers of large-scale seasonal and daily energy storage. Energy transition on national and <b>European</b> <b>scales</b> can be facilitated by expanding the capacity of pumped storage hydropower (PSHP) plants. Yet the extension of hydropower production, in particular PSHP, remains controversial, primarily due to environmental concerns. Focusing on 2 Alpine countries, Austria and Switzerland, this paper provides a system view of hydropower production and energy storage in the Alps. It discusses advantages and drawbacks of various assessment tools and identifies gaps and needs for the integrated assessment of PSHP plants. It concludes that instruments that evaluate the impacts and sustainability of PSHP projects need to be developed, elaborated, and applied in a participatory manner, {{in order to promote}} public dialogue, increase social acceptance, and, ideally, encourage energy consumers to become advocates of a sustainable energy future...|$|E
40|$|Diagnostic units (horizons, {{properties}} and materials) are commonly applied {{in a number}} of international and national classification systems, including WRB, Soil Taxonomy, Hungarian and Irish systems. Diagnostic units can be established in the field, with laboratory analyses or derived from existing soil survey databases. These diagnostic units are designed to support the process of objective soil classification. The soil diagnostic units however carry important information by themselves and can be mapped and provide a better visualisation of the soil -landscape continuum, as and have been demonstrated in different projects (such as the e_SOTER). The LANDMARK project (EU 2020) has applied the diagnostic unit approach to explain five key soil functions evident in agricultural systems; 1) primary productivity, 2) water purification and regulation, 3) carbon storage and regulation, 4) provision of a habitat for biodiversity and 5) cycling of nutrients. Modelling the capacity of a soil to deliver multiple of these soils functions is the main approach of the LANDMARK project, with a focus at farm, regional and <b>European</b> <b>scales.</b> The diagnostic unit classes is one application currently being considered to define the functional behaviour of our soils.

At a west central European scale (Germany), where beech has a âyoungâ ecological and biogeographical history, Â we found 48 primeval forest relict species of saproxylic beetles associated with beech, 124 ground beetles and 91 molluscs Â inhabiting beech forest, yet none exclusive of west central European beech forests. High levels of faunal similarity between beech and other woodland trees suggested that many of the beech forest dwelling species are euryoecious and likely to Â originate from mid-Holocene mixed broadleaf forests. Beech forests of the mountain ranges in southern and east central Â Europe, which are ecologically and biogeographically âoldâ, were found to harbour distinct species assemblages, including Â beech forest specialists (such as 10 carabid species in the Carpathians) and narrow-range endemics of broadleaf forest.

Novel emission inventories of particle numbers have been compiled both on urban and <b>European</b> <b>scales.</b> We used atmospheric dispersion modelling for PNCs in the five target cities and on a European scale, and evaluated the predicted results against available measured concentrations. In all the target cities, the concentrations of particle numbers (PNs) were mostly influenced by the emissions originating from local vehicular traffic. The influence of shipping and harbours was significant for Helsinki, Oslo, Rotterdam and Athens, but not for London. The influence of the aviation emissions in Athens was also notable. The regional background concentration were clearly lower than the contributions originating from urban sources in Helsinki, Oslo, and Athens. The regional background was also lower than urban contributions in traffic environments in London, but higher or approximately equal to urban contributions in Rotterdam. It was numerically evaluated that the influence of coagulation and dry deposition on the predicted PNCs was substantial for the urban background in Oslo. The predicted and measured annual average PNCs in four cities agreed within approximately < 26 % (measured as fractional baises), except for one traffic station in London.
