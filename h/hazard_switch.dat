5000|$|As {{with the}} Mk2 Golf, Volkswagen {{did not make}} a {{convertible}} version of the Mk4 Golf. Instead, they face-lifted the front bumper, fenders, grille, and hood to resemble Mk4 Golf styling but to fit a Mk3 chassis. VW managed to incorporate some non-structural Mk4 parts as well such as fender repeaters, headlights, side mirror caps, rear license tag lights, 3-spoke steering wheel airbag, etc. The rear also received a redesigned bumper with the number plate tub moved from the hatch and a Mk4 handle with a larger VW emblem above it to resemble the rear of a Mk4 Golf. The interior largely remained the same as a Mk3 interior save for a Mk4 style 3-spoke leather steering wheel, a textured dashboard (also known as [...] "dimpled dash" [...] or [...] "shark skin dash"), heavily bolstered front seats with incorporated side airbags, and the <b>hazard</b> <b>switch</b> relocated from the steering column to the instrument panel. The interior lighting in the cabin was switched to the blue and red hue found in the Mk4 and some of the more familiar Mk3 parts were chromed such as the inner door handles, emergency brake button, door strikers, front seat belt anchors, key lock cylinders, and shifter button in automatic transmission equipped cars. There are some technical carryovers, as well, the main one being the immobilizer and engine computer from the Mk4 Golf being used with the older Mk3 engine mechanicals.|$|E

We calculate surge height and wind speed as functions of return period and sea surface temperature reduction by wind-wave pumps. We then estimate costs and economic losses with the FEMA HAZUS-MH MR 3 damage model and census data on property at risk. All areas experience more surge damages for short return periods, and more wind damages for long periods. The return period at which the dominating <b>hazard</b> component <b>switches</b> depends on location. We also calculate the seasonal expected fraction of control damage for different scenarios to reduce damages. Surge damages are best reduced through a surge barrier. Wind damages are best reduced by a portfolio of techniques that, assuming they work and are correctly deployed, include wind-wave pumps. Carnegie-Mellon University.

In the framework of the project PON SIGMA (Integrated Cloud-Sensor System for Advanced Multirisk Management), we developed a near real-time computer-assisted analysis and probabilistic evaluations that provide the identification of the areas prone to the highest vent opening hazard. The use of a code such BET_EF (Bayesian Event Tree_Eruption Forecasting) provide us a long-term hazard map mainly based on the past behaviour of the Etna volcano. The near real-time additional seismic and ground deformation data allow the long-term <b>hazard</b> map <b>switches</b> into a short-term future vent opening one. The short-term future vent opening was computed starting from the evaluation of deformation field over Etna surface. Analytical inversion of deformation and seismic data is performed to find the parameters of a magmatic source in an elastic, isotropic and homogeneous half-space and forward model is performed to compute the displacement field over Etna surface. We modelled the final intrusion of the Mount Etna May 2008 eruption that was accompanied by a violent seismic swarm and marked by ground deformation recorded at GPS stations.

5000|$|The {{power supply}} {{circuits}} in electronic equipment that produce direct current (DC) {{needed by the}} device from the alternating current (AC) supplied by mains use filter capacitors to smooth the DC current. A large electric charge can remain in these capacitors after the unit is turned off, constituting a shock <b>hazard.</b> For example <b>switching</b> mode power supplies use a bridge rectifier to convert mains AC power into DC at 320 V (for 220 V mains) or 160 V (for 115 V. mains), before the voltage is reduced by the chopper. These incorporate one or more filter capacitors to smooth the pulsing output voltage from the rectifier. These must typically store enough energy at this high voltage to power the load during the zero crossings of the AC input. In addition, the capacitors in many supplies are made large enough to supply the load during AC outages lasting for a significant fraction of a second. This stored charge is often enough to deliver a lethal shock. The capacitors in high voltage DC power supplies used in devices such as lasers, x-ray machines, radio transmitters and old style CRT computer monitors and televisions can have higher, more dangerous voltages.|$|R
40|$|Contemporary dynamic {{theories}} of self-employment choice focus on occupational switching costs, {{and the risk}} associated with entrepreneurial income streams. However little or no previous research has addressed {{the question of what}} factors determine the length of time that it takes aspiring entrepreneurs to switch into self-employment. Possible switching costs suggest that choice may be subject to “hysteresis ” (akin to investment under conditions of irreversibility and uncertainty). This paper presents empirical evidence on the dynamics of entrepreneurial transition drawing on data from Waves 8 to 14 of the British Household Panel Survey. The paper estimates a discrete-time duration model of the time between initial expression of aspiration to transition into self-employment. The model incorporates measures of local unemployment and house price volatility to capture uncertainty. Flexible semi-parametric baselines are preferred and reveal declining hazard rates (conditional probabilities of transition). Increased local unemployment volatility has a significant negative impact on the conditional probability of transition, and dominates broad regional differences. Increased local house price volatility has a no significant impact. Conditioning the model for background and demographic characteristics reveals little relationship, apart from age, between individual characteristics and the hazard rate. However conditioning for prior economic status shows that those considering self-employment from a position of economic inactivity or illness have, other things equal, higher <b>hazard</b> rates. Occupational <b>switching</b> costs may be very different for such individuals...|$|R
40|$|Background: We {{performed}} {{a review of}} a large incident peritoneal dialysis cohort to establish the impact of current practice and that of switching to hemodialysis. ♦ Methods: Patients starting peritoneal dialysis between 2004 and 2010 were included and clinical data at start of dialysis recorded. Competing risk analysis and Cox propor-tional hazards model with time-varying covariate (tech-nique failure) were used. ♦ Results: Of 286 patients (median age 57 years) followed for a median of 24. 2 months, 76 were transplanted and 102 died. Outcome probabilities at 3 and 5 years respectively were 0. 69 and 0. 53 for patient survival (or transplantation) and 0. 33 and 0. 42 for technique failure. Peritonitis caused technique failure in 42 %, but ultrafiltration failure account-ed only for 6. 3 %. Davies comorbidity grade, creatinine and obesity (but not residual renal function or age) predicted technique failure. Due to peritonitis deaths, technique failure was an independent predictor of death <b>hazard.</b> When successful <b>switch</b> to hemodialysis (surviving more than 60 days after technique failure) and its timing were analyzed, no adverse impact on survival in adjusted analysis was found. However, hemodialysis via central venous line was associ-ated with an elevated death hazard as compared to staying on peritoneal dialysis, or hemodialysis through a fistula (adjusted analysis hazard ratio 1. 97 (1. 02 – 3. 80)). ♦ Conclusions: Once the patients survive the first 60 days after technique failure, the switch to hemodialysis does not adversely affect patient outcomes.

40|$|Abstract Background The use of peritoneal {{dialysis}} (PD) has {{declined in the}} United States {{over the past decade}} and technique failure is also reportedly higher in PD compared to hemodialysis (HD), but there are little data in the United States addressing the factors and outcomes associated with switching modalities from PD to HD. Methods In a prospective cohort study of 262 PD patients enrolled from 28 {{peritoneal dialysis}} clinics in 13 U. S. states, we examined potential predictors of switching from PD to HD (including demographics, clinical factors, and laboratory values) and the association of switching with mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess relative <b>hazards</b> (RH) of <b>switching</b> and of mortality in PD patients who switched to HD. Results Among 262 PD patients, 24. 8 % switched to HD; with more than 70 % switching within the first 2 years. Infectious peritonitis was the leading cause of switching. Patients of black race and with higher body mass index {{were significantly more likely to}} switch from PD to HD, RH (95 % CI) of 5. 01 (1. 15 – 21. 8) for black versus white and 1. 09 (1. 03 – 1. 16) per 1 kg/m 2 increase in BMI, respectively. There was no difference in survival between switchers and non-switchers, RH (95 % CI) of 0. 89 (0. 41 – 1. 93). Conclusion Switching from PD to HD occurs early and the rate is high, threatening long-term viability of PD programs. Several patient characteristics were associated with the risk of switching. However, there was no survival difference between switchers and non-switchers, reassuring providers and patients that PD technique failure is not necessarily associated with poor prognosis. </p...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: Outcome measures included late death, reintervention, ECG and ambulatory ECG rhythm, new arrhythmia, and functional status. Average follow-up was 13. 4 (range 0. 32 to 17. 9) years for the Senning group and 11. 7 (range 0. 04 to 23. 9) years for the Mustard group. The Senning group had a better survival rate at 5, 10, and 15 years (95 % versus 86 %, 94 % versus 82 %, and 94 % versus 77 %, respectively). In both groups, the majority of late deaths were sudden, without preceding ventricular dysfunction. Survival and survival free of reintervention were significantly better in the Senning group (relative risk [RR] 0. 34, P= 0. 06 versus RR 0. 39, P= 0. 027). Loss of sinus rhythm was comparable and unrelated to death. After era correction, the incidence of atrial flutter was similar and strongly associated with late death in both groups.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In high-income countries, viral load is {{routinely}} measured to detect failure of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and guide switching to second-line ART. Viral load monitoring is not generally available in resource-limited settings. We examined switching from nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) -based first-line regimens to protease inhibitor-based regimens in Africa, South America and Asia. DESIGN AND METHODS: Multicohort study of 17 ART programmes. All sites monitored CD 4 cell count and {{had access to}} second-line ART and 10 sites monitored viral load. We compared times to switching, CD 4 cell counts at switching and obtained adjusted <b>hazard</b> ratios for <b>switching</b> (aHRs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) from random-effects Weibull models. RESULTS: A total of 20 113 patients, including 6369 (31. 7 %) patients from 10 programmes with access to viral load monitoring, were analysed; 576 patients (2. 9 %) switched. Low CD 4 cell counts at ART initiation were associated with switching in all programmes. Median time to switching was 16. 3 months [interquartile range (IQR) 10. 1 - 26. 6] in programmes with viral load monitoring and 21. 8 months (IQR 14. 0 - 21. 8) in programmes without viral load monitoring (P < 0. 001). Median CD 4 cell counts at switching were 161 cells/microl (IQR 77 - 265) in programmes with viral load monitoring and 102 cells/microl (44 - 181) in programmes without viral load monitoring (P < 0. 001). Switching was more common in programmes with viral load monitoring during months 7 - 18 after starting ART (aHR 1. 38; 95 % CI 0. 97 - 1. 98), similar during months 19 - 30 (aHR 0. 97; 95 % CI 0. 58 - 1. 60) and less common during months 31 - 42 (aHR 0. 29; 95 % CI 0. 11 - 0. 79). CONCLUSION: In resource-limited settings, switching to second-line regimens tends to occur earlier and at higher CD 4 cell counts in ART programmes with viral load monitoring compared with programmes without viral load monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} on state dependence {{indicates that a}} brand's purchase probabilities vary over time and depend on the levels of inertia and variety seeking and on {{the identity of the}} previously purchased brand. Brand-choice probabilities obtained from models such as the logit and the probit are, however, fixed over time, conditional on the previous brand purchased and on the levels of marketing variables. Consequently, state dependence has largely been studied as a time-invariant phenomenon in brand-choice models, with the levels of inertia and variety seeking assumed to be constant over time. To account for the time-varying nature of state dependence would require a model in which brand-switching probabilities depend upon interpurchase times. One modeling framework that can account for this dependence is based on the hazard function approach. The proposed approach works as follows. All other factors being equal, an inertial household purchasing a brand on a particular occasion is most likely to repurchase that brand on the next occasion. If the household switches, it will be to a brand located perceptually close, in attribute space, to the previously purchased brand. In other words, an inertial household has the highest <b>switching</b> <b>hazard</b> for the same origin and destination brands, with a progressively lower hazard rate for brands perceptually located farther and farther away from the origin brand. The amount by which the hazard is lowered depends upon the perceptual distance and the inertia level of the household. On the other hand, if the household is variety seeking, the most likely brand purchased would be a brand located farthest away from the previously purchased brand in attribute space. In other words, the hazard rate of repurchase is the lowest, with the rate increasing with the distance of the destination brand from the origin brand and the level of that household's variety-seeking tendency. The effects of inertia and variety seeking are, therefore, incorporated at the attribute level into a brand-purchase timing model. In doing so, we attempt to provide greater insight into the nature of state dependence in models of purchase timing. Our model and estimation procedure will enable us to distinguish between households that are inertial and those that are variety prone. In addition to accounting for state dependence, the model also accounts for the effects of unobserved heterogeneity among households in their brand preferences and in their sensitivities to marketing activities. A majority of studies in marketing using the hazard function approach to investigate purchase timing have not accounted for heterogeneity in marketing-mix effects. The study integrates recent methods that incorporate the effects of inertia and variety seeking in brand-choice models with a semi-Markov model of purchase timing and brand switching. The proposed model enables us to (1) infer market structure via a perceptual map for the sample households, and (2) investigate implications for the introduction of a line extension. We provide empirical applications of the proposed method using three different household-level scanner panel data sets. We find that differing levels of inertia and variety seeking characterize the three data sets. The findings are consistent with prior beliefs regarding these categories. In addition, our results indicate that the nature of interbrand purchase timing behavior depends upon the extent of inertia or variety seeking in the data. We are also able to characterize the structure of the three product markets studied. This provides implications for interbrand rivalry in the market. Further, we demonstrate how the model and results can be used to predict the location of a line extension in the perceptual space of households. Finally, we obtain implications for the timing of brand promotions. hazard models, purchase timing, brand choice...|$|R
