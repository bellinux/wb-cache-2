50|$|Radar jamming and <b>deception</b> (<b>electronic</b> countermeasures) is the {{intentional}} emission of radio frequency signals {{to interfere with}} the operation of a radar by saturating its receiver with noise or false information.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} detecting and classifying a radar target signal and a jamming signal produced by a <b>deception</b> <b>electronic</b> counter measure (ECM) system based on a digital radio frequency memory (DRFM) device. The disturbance is modeled as a complex correlated Gaussian process. The jamming is modeled as a signal belonging to a cone whose axis is the true target signal. Two different approaches are analyzed, based on the adaptive coherent estimator (ACE) and on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), yielding both to a two-block device. The performance of the two detection/classification algorithms are evaluated, analytically, when possible, and by Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} suppressing the repeat-intensive false targets produced by a <b>deception</b> <b>electronic</b> attack (EA) system equipped with a Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) device. Different from a conventional repeat jammer, this type of jamming intensively retransmits the intercepted signal stored in a DRFM to the victim radar {{in a very short}} time-delay interval relative to a radar pulse wide. A multipeak matched-filtering output is then produced other than the merely expected true target. An electronic protection (EP) algorithm based on the space time block code (STBC) is proposed to suppress the adverse effects of this jammer. By transmitting a pulse sequence generated from the STBC in succession and the following cancellation process applied upon the received signal, this algorithm performs successfully in a single antenna system provided that the target models are nonfluctuating or slow fluctuating and the pulse repetition frequency (PRF) is comparatively high. The performance in white and correlated Gaussian disturbance is evaluated by means of Monte Carlo simulations...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 133 - 138) A detailed {{investigation is}} undertaken {{in order to}} determine the potential usefulness of acoustic surface-waves in implementing various signal processing functions. The propagation of elastic, vibrational energy on the surface of an isotropic solid is determined, and the surface-localized particle motion and velocity characterized. The requirement for the generation and reception of surface-waves is then developed, utilizing the interdigital electrode structure on a piezoelectric substrate. Emphasis is on the selection of the substrate (lithium niobate) and on the design of efficient transducers. The theory developed is utilized to design several acoustic surface-wave signal processing devices. Acoustic bi-phase and linear FM coded matched filters are designed and evaluated for their usefulness in future communication and radar systems. Of particular importance is the performance of an electronically code-alterable bi-phase modulation generator. An acoustic surface-wave compressive receiver is breadborded or possible electronic intelligence receiver applications in the detection of unknown signals in a dense environment and the accurate determination of intercept frequencies. Also developed are an electronically variable tapped delay line (<b>electronic</b> warfare <b>deception</b> techniques) and a contiguous bank of bandpass filters (signal sorting techniques) both of which may find eventual use in electronic warfare signal processors. Each application's area is discussed in concept, as well as with respect to the role played by the respective surface-wave devices. In closing, the future of these microminiature signal processing devices is assessed with respect to what exists today and, even more important, what is needed to make the technology useful tomorrow...|$|R
5000|$|While Dai is {{the major}} author of INEW doctrine, the {{strategy}} stems from both U.S. and Soviet IW doctrine. During the Cold War, the Soviet Union had a doctrine called Radio-Electronic Combat (REC), which the U.S. Army describes as “the total integration of electronic warfare and physical destruction resources to deny us the use of our electronic systems.” [...] Multiple authors call INEW “REC on steroids.” This is because INEW adds additional dimensions to REC, specifically INEW moves beyond the tactical and theater realms of operations where REC was applied by elevating the INEW doctrine to a strategic level of war. Additionally, INEW adds cyber attacks and kinetic attacks on satellites to the REC doctrine. INEW also implements U.S. IW strategy from the AirLand Battle doctrine, the U.S. response to REC that integrated airpower, special operations forces, artillery, armor, and EW. Additionally, INEW implements lessons learned from U.S. information operations in Kosovo, the Balkans, and Iraq. Lessons learned from these U.S. military engagements may have influenced China's decision to apply IW doctrine at the strategic war level. INEW integrates the use of “EW, CNO, and limited kinetic strikes against key command, control, communication, and computer nodes to disrupt the enemy's battlefield network information systems.” CNO include computer network attack, defense, and exploitation. Aligning with Dai's ideology, INEW unites offensive and defensive IW under a single authority, specifically 4PLA. [...] One {{of the most important}} aspects of INEW is that it integrates IW into larger PLA operations, [...] calling for kinetic attacks that make use of opportunities created by IW operations, as Dai discussed above. [...] For example, INEW doctrine combines precision strikes and IW operations, likely targeting command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) targets in line with INEW doctrine. [...] INEW applies a variety of methods, to include the disruption and destruction of systems, creation of false realities through falsified information, <b>electronic</b> jamming, <b>deception,</b> and suppression, computer network attacks, computer intrusions to sabotage information processing, and impeding information transmissions. The goal of INEW is to weaken and/or paralyze an opponent's decision making capabilities and the political, economic, and military component's of the enemy's war infrastructure. [...] To do this, INEW doctrine calls for IW operations to seize control of opponent's information flows and maintain information dominance during campaigns. IW operations also aim to achieve information dominance that would result in denying the opponent access to information that is vital to continuing the conflict. [...] This dominance should be maintained throughout conflicts. INEW continues to be the dominant doctrinal core of PLA IW operations today, with 4PLA likely in the authoritative position to implement this strategy.|$|R

5000|$|China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has {{developed}} a strategy called [...] "Integrated Network Electronic Warfare" [...] which guides computer network operations and cyberwarfare tools. This strategy helps link together network warfare tools and electronic warfare weapons against an opponent's information systems during conflict. They believe the fundamentals for achieving success is about seizing control of an opponent's information flow and establishing information dominance. The Science of Military and The Science of Campaigns both identify enemy logistics systems networks as the highest priority for cyber-attacks and states that cyberwarfare must mark the start if a campaign, used properly, can enable overall operational success. Focusing on attacking the opponent's infrastructure to disrupt transmissions and processes of information that dictate decision-making operations, the PLA would secure cyber dominance over their adversary. The predominant techniques that would be utilized during a conflict to gain the upper hand are as follows, the PLA would strike with electronic jammers, <b>electronic</b> <b>deception</b> and suppression techniques to interrupt the transfer processes of information. They would launch virus attacks or hacking techniques to sabotage information processes, all {{in the hopes of}} destroying enemy information platforms and facilities. The PLA's Science of Campaigns noted that one role for cyberwarfare is to create windows of opportunity for other forces to operate without detection or with a lowered risk of counterattack by exploiting the enemy's periods of [...] "blindness," [...] "deafness" [...] or [...] "paralysis" [...] created by cyber-attacks. That {{is one of the main}} focal points of cyberwarefare, to be able to weaken your enemy to the full extent possible so that your physical offensive will have a higher percentage of success.|$|E

40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{are the most}} challenging networks for communication because of its resourceconstrained nature and the dynamical nature of network topographic anatomy. A lot of research is beinggoing on in the diverse {{parts of the world}} for optimum utilization of communication resources in thesespecial types of ad hoc networks. The utility and application domain of sensor networks ranges from commercial, public safety applications and military sector {{to be the most important}} ones. The magnificent challenges to the routing algorithms employed in such type of {{networks are}} due to the mercurial size of the network and its expandable topology that is quite dynamic in nature. The presentpaper offers a comparison and analysis of the packet drop at the MAC layer for different routing protocols under an experimental setup having different mobility condition based scenarios of the wireless sensor network application. The comparative study may have also an impact on the improvement of MAC layer performance for different simulation times of the experimental setup considering two of reactive as well as proactive protocols that are most widely used routing protocol in wireless sensor networks. Wireless sensor network application under consideration for the experimental is the battle field monitoring wireless sensor network and the comparative study has been performed for four different mobility patterns described as four different scenarios in the considered experimental application of wireless sensor networks. The sensor network simulative <b>electronic</b> <b>deception</b> architecture used is for the battle field monitoring application of wireless sensor networks.
