25|$|Charlotte can {{manipulate}} fiends very easily. It {{has been shown}} in many episodes that giving fiends sugar of any kind, or sometimes even <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> them affection, can make them turn benevolent. It is unknown whether this is a flaw present in all fiends, a mistake Vendetta repeats by accident, or some unspoken power of Charlotte's.|$|E
500|$|In 1999 Up Your Ass was re-discovered and {{produced}} in 2000 by George Coates Performance Works in San Francisco. Coates turned the piece into a musical, starring an all-female cast. Coates learned about Up Your Ass while at an exhibition at The Andy Warhol Museum, which marked the 30th {{anniversary of the}} shooting. The copy that Warhol had lost was discovered buried in a trunk of lighting equipment that was owned by Billy Name. Coates would consult with Solanas's sister, Judith, while writing the piece, and sought to create a [...] "very funny satirist" [...] out of Solanas, not <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> her as the attempted assassin of Warhol.|$|E

500|$|On how {{continuity}} was emphasized {{during the}} making of the episode, Bochco explained that for each of the episode's five acts there was a different stage of hair, makeup, and wardrobe so the crew could depict the physical changes to Simmons as time progresses. Rather than try and film the episode in complete order, which was [...] "impossible" [...] due to location scheduling needs, the production just tried to avoid changing from one stage to another, and then back again. On how much the episode shows 'the entity' on the planet, Bochco and Titley compared it to the shark in Jaws, with this episode <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> [...] " [...] fin from time to time", and a bigger reveal of the creature coming in a later episode.|$|E
500|$|Harley Carlson of MetalReview.com {{regarded}} Octavarium as [...] "successfully [...] the band's {{ability to}} craft emotive music," [...] although {{noted that it}} is [...] "unquestionably Dream Theater, yet there is something missing." [...] Vik Bansal of musicOMH praised [...] "Never Enough", [...] "Panic Attack" [...] and [...] "Sacrificed Sons", but dismissed [...] "The Root of All Evil" [...] as [...] "Dream Theater by the numbers". He criticized [...] "Octavarium" [...] as [...] "bloated", although noted that fans of the band's A Change of Seasons would enjoy it. He said that [...] "there's enough on the remainder of Octavarium to keep {{the rest of us}} interested and the prog rock haters whining dismissively". Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt praised the album's artwork and production, but said that [...] "there’s nothing that blows any minds here, or even gives a mild bend; hell, a good chunk of this disc feels like basic radio rock from the local old-guy bar band". He noted that although there were some longer songs on the album, [...] "this just feels like 76 minutes of overdramatic rock, too heavy on the light and weak, and not enough time spent on <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> off".|$|E
500|$|... "The Time Is Now" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff rated the episode—along with the preceding episode [...] "The Fourth Horseman—an [...] "A". VanDerWerff {{felt that it}} [...] "may {{be one of the}} four or five best cinematic depictions {{of the end of the}} world ever filmed", praising the uncommon approach of depicting the world ending, rather than <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> the aftermath. Bill Gibron, writing for DVD Talk, rated the episode 5 out of 5. Gibron felt that the two-part episodes were [...] "a one-two punch that many dramatic series would die for", finding the conclusion to have been effectively hinted at throughout the season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated [...] "The Time Is Now" [...] five stars out of five. Shearman felt that the episode would have been [...] "the best end to the show imaginable", had the series not produced a third season. He considered the episode's writing and conclusion to have been a brave decision, potentially alienating its viewers but producing [...] "a thrilling and unforgettable piece of television"; he also considered the season as a whole to be less consistent but more daring than the first season.|$|E

500|$|Since airing, [...] "Treehouse of Horror XXII" [...] has {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Josh Harrison of Ology was positive {{and gave the}} episode a rating of seven out of ten, but commented that he preferred [...] "episodes that feature longer, more involved storylines more than the spoof collections." [...] At The A.V. Club, Hayden Childs gave the episode a C+ grade, saying, [...] "The writers seem unwilling to mock the more outrageous aspects of the movies they are sending up and settle for weakly batting at the obvious. Some of the jokes land, but none land too solidly." [...] Meredith Woerner of io9 thought that [...] "he whole thing never quite achieved {{the same level of}} brilliance as some previous years — even though the Avatar bit was funny, we've seen so many Avatar spoofs by now that, well, it's tired. However we did get a lot of joy out of seeing Homer dressed up as Doctor Manhattan and Maggie as a wee-little chest burster." [...] Even more critical was CraveOnline's Blair Marnell who gave the episode a rating of three out of ten. He commented that [...] "there is no stronger argument for ending 'The Simpsons' than the latest Halloween installment of 'Treehouse of Horror'" [...] and further said that [...] "in all honesty, it's amazing how tame 'The Simpsons' has become over the years. This show used to be the 'South Park' of its day. Now it's <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> its age and it's no longer the cool TV rebel that it used to be." [...] Alex Strachan had the opposite reaction in a review in Calgary Herald and concluded that we should [...] "orget all that talk about The Simpsons being past its prime. Based on tonight's sharp-eyed, keen-witted Treehouse of Horror XXII - funnier, faster and more fright-worthy than last year's dud, thankfully - there's a lot of ink left in the old ink pot yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1995 to 2000, MTV played 36.5% fewer music videos. MTV {{president}} Van Toeffler explained: [...] "Clearly, {{the novelty}} of <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> music videos has worn off. It's required us to reinvent ourselves to a contemporary audience." [...] Despite targeted efforts to play certain types of music videos in limited rotation, MTV greatly reduced its overall rotation of music videos by the mid-2000s. While music videos were featured on MTV up to eight hours per day in 2000, the year 2008 saw an average of just three hours of music videos per day on MTV. The rise of social media and websites like YouTube as a convenient outlet for the promotion and viewing of music videos signaled this reduction.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Havins {{was asked}} if she felt that Babe had been {{redeemed}} since the baby switch. Havins replied, [...] "More or less. That's not {{something that can be}} done overnight; it takes time. And I don't think it's necessarily acts, like one heroic act, that redeem someone." [...] She clarified: It's <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> change. She's very remorseful and there's regret with the whole situation. It's one thing if somebody didn't feel sorry for what they did, but she repented for her sins. Everyone has a past. Everyone makes mistakes. The only {{thing you can do is}} move on and try to be a better person from that point forward. When Bianca forgives Babe in 2007 for keeping her child from her, there were viewers who still felt that it was due to Bianca being in love with Babe, and were upset that Bianca could not seem to resist any interaction with her. In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, Havins seemed perplexed that a significant number of viewers had still not forgiven Babe for the baby switch, and felt that the character had been redeeming herself.|$|E

And you know I know you stole that from me, right?" [...] Rico Love commented on the recording sessions of the song {{in an interview with}} magazine Rap-Up, saying that [...] "it was a really interesting situation because of the history that was in the room and the energy was so positive. It was electric. I really wanted to try my best to pull the most explosive vocals out of them. ´ It kinda carried on the next part of the story, <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> their growth and their maturity, and making it real and true to both singers. It was an amazing energy, an amazing vibe. The girls were all positive. It was just fun. We had a great time and I learned so much from both of them during the session." [...] Love also revealed that they did alternate versions of the song for both Monica and Brandy's albums. He noted that the changes were minimal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{representations of}} the Nativity itself are very simple, <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> the infant, tightly wrapped, lying near {{the ground in a}} trough or wicker basket. The ox and ass are always present, even when Mary or any other human is not. Although they are not mentioned in the Gospel accounts they were regarded as confirmed by scripture from some Old Testament verses, such as Isaiah 1,3:"The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib" [...] and Habakkuk 3,2: [...] "in the midst of the two beasts wilt thou be known", and their presence was never questioned by theologians. They were regarded by Augustine, Ambrose and others as representing the Jewish people, weighed down by the Law (the ox), and the pagan peoples, carrying the sin of idolatry (the ass). Christ was arrived to free both from their burdens. Mary is only shown when the scene is the Adoration of the Magi, but often one of the shepherds, or a prophet with a scroll, is present. From the end of the 5th century (following the Council of Ephesus), Mary becomes a fixture in the scene; then as later Joseph is a more variable element. Where a building is shown, it is usually a tugurium, a simple tiled roof supported by posts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} {{was shot in}} Los Angeles, California on November 20, 2007. It premiered on music video {{channels}} MTV, BET, and Fuse TV {{during the week of}} December 3, 2007. In a November 8, 2007 interview with MTV, Brown stated that he co-directed the video as well. [...] "And it shows me more solo. Like, it shows the grown side of Chris – it doesn't show the kiddie side. 'Cause with this album, I wanted to blend, I wanted to do all different visuals of me.

[...] The video was quite popular in American television, reaching number 1 on BET's 106 & Park for 6 days, and staying on the countdown for 38 days. It has also reached number 1 on MTV TRL for 10 days, replacing Flo Rida's [...] "Low" [...] and finally retired at number 1 after it stayed on the countdown for 35 days. The music video won the accolade for [...] "Best Male Video" [...] at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards.|$|E
2500|$|The protagonist, Bruce Delamitiri, is {{an artist}} {{who works in the}} motion picture industry. Many people in the US think that, by making these movies, Bruce makes killing cool. Numerous {{characters}} throughout the book imply that he encourages everyone who's watching these movies to kill for fun. Bruce, on the other hand, defends himself by telling everyone that he doesn’t think he encourages anyone to do anything. He says that there has always been violence but humans are not like robots, seeing something on the screen does not necessarily make us want to do it ourselves( [...] p.13 [...] "people get up from the movie theatre or the TV and do what they just saw"). He also claims that he is <b>just</b> <b>showing</b> existing violence. Unfortunately for Bruce, Wayne and Scout (a pair of psychopaths known in the media as the [...] "Mall Murderers") have formulated a plan to hold him hostage and have him publicly announce that his movies are responsible for their crimes so they can avoid the death penalty (Wayne has a lengthy speech giving examples of how in America it is possible to be guilty and innocent at the same time.) As the novel progresses, Bruce and a critically injured Brooke Daniels are joined inside his house by his wife and daughter and a TV camera crew. The siege reaches its climax as Wayne holds a ratings monitor and announces on live TV that he will spare the hostages if everyone stops watching the siege in the next few minutes - however, this does not happen and he begins firing as the LAPD begin a frantic attempt to subdue him. Many of the characters die in the ensuing violence and the epilogue of the story reveals grim details as to how all the survivors have found a way of escaping responsibility for the tragedy using varying routes from lawsuits and finding religion to making documentaries which explicitly blame everyone else. The book ends with the line [...] "No one has taken responsibility" [...] — echoing an earlier rant by Bruce that we have created a blame free society in which any problem or shortcoming can be blamed on others rather than accepting responsibility for our own actions.|$|E
