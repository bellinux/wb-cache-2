The number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> (cumulative number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts,</b> average number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> per practice, and average number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> per session) was found to be statistically different between linemen and skill players except in the metric of the number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> per game.

50|$|To {{address the}} {{vaulting}} and rollover crashes, energy-absorbing terminals were developed.

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the current}} study was to study the {{kinematics}} of adult pedestrians and assess head injury risks based on real-world accidents. Methods: A total of 43 passenger car versus pedestrian accidents, in which the pedestrian's <b>head</b> <b>impacted</b> the windscreen, were selected from accident databases for simulation study. According to real-world accident investigation, accident reconstructions were conducted using multibody system (MBS) pedestrian and car models under MADYMO environment (Strasbourg University) to calculate <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> conditions in terms of <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity, <b>head</b> position, and head orientation. Pedestrian <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> conditions from MADYMO simulation results were then used to set the initial conditions in a simulation of a head striking a windscreen using finite element (FE) approach. Results: The results showed strong correlations between vehicle <b>impact</b> velocity and <b>head</b> contact time, throw distance, and <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity using a quadratic regression model. In the selected samples, the results indicated that Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 2 + and AIS 3 + severe head injuries with probability of 50 percent were caused by <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> velocity at about 33 and 49 km/h, respectively. Further, the predicted head linear acceleration (head injury criterion, HIC) value, resultant angular velocity, and resultant angular acceleration for 50 percent probability of AIS 2 + and AIS 3 + head injury risk were 116 g, 825, 40 rad/s, 11, 368 rad/s(2) and 162 g, 1442, 55 rad/s, 18, 775 rad/s(2), respectively, and the predicted value of 50 percent probability of skull fracture was 135 g. Conclusions: The present study provides new insight into pedestrian <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> conditions in terms of velocity, angle, and impact location based on a number of real-world cases.

50|$|Though {{they have}} usually {{prevented}} {{far more serious}} accidents, guardrail is considered a roadside obstacle as well and transportation engineers must weigh whether placing guardrail will reduce the severity of an impact as compared to what may be impacted if the guardrail were not placed. In general, the minimum length of guardrail with an end anchor at the trailing end and an end terminal on the approach end will be 62.5 to 75 feet in length. An example would be where an overhead roadside sign structure is placed within what is considered the clear recovery zone, and an engineer determines that the structure has a potential to be impacted {{and the impact of}} a vehicle withthat structure would be much more severe than impacting the guardrail that was placed to contain and redirect a vehicle away from that structure, knowing that the potential to impact the guardrail will be much higher than that of the sign structure. Guardrail has frequently ranked amongst the highest sources of injury and fatality collisions with a fixed-object crash. Among the primary reasons for {{this is the type of}} treatment used at the end of the guardrail facing oncoming traffic. Most end terminal designs will either gate and allow a vehicle to pass through the system within the first 12.5 feet or redirect a vehicle if impacted beyond the first 12.5 feet. Some end terminals also have energy absorbing properties when impacted in the head on position, and will actually slow a vehicle upon impact by absorbing the vehicles kinetic energy and dispersing it through the rail. This is typically accomplished by forcing rail elements through an extrusion <b>impact</b> <b>head</b> that has smaller dimensions that the rail being forced through it. The force rate and flattening of the rail through the head absorbs kinetic energy dissipating it through the extrusion head and slowing the vehicle. These types of systems have demonstrated that an errant vehicle, impacting a system in the head on position, can be effectively stopped in a distance of 50 feet or less. As compared to non-energy absorbing end terminals which can allow a vehicle to pass through the system and travel in excess of 250 feet behind and beyond the system.|$|E

40|$|Football safety has {{increased}} over time, {{in part due}} to improvements in equipment and body mechanics, but there are still inherent risks involved, including exposure to repetitive <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> (RHI). Significant <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> can result in a constellation of symptoms including nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, and amnesia, which typically assist in the diagnosis of concussion. However, {{it has been shown that}} subconcussive impacts may result in microstructural changes and physiological alterations in the brain. This is particularly concerning because athletes may be undergoing changes in the brain in the absence of outwardly visible symptoms. Poorer neurologic outcomes later in life have been associated with cumulative exposure rather than number of diagnosed concussions. Accelerometers installed in helmets have shown that college football players may receive up to 1, 850 <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> throughout the course of one season. The concussion rate is obviously much lower, indicating there are a high number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> per diagnosed concussion. Axons are especially susceptible to damage from RHI because of their extension throughout the nervous system. The subtle changes thought to result from RHI are not easy to measure, but several modalities have been proposed. These include diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), plasma tau protein, and King-Devick testing. The proposed study will look to quantify cumulative <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> exposure in college football players prior to the start of a season and see if this has any impact on the variables. They will then participate in one season of football wearing helmet accelerometers to measure the number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> sustained.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{evidence}} indicates that concussions depend not only on a single offending <b>head</b> <b>impact,</b> but also on the series of subconcussive <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> prior to concussion. Talavage et al. have shown that several subjects in their cohort of high school football players exhibit substantial changes in their neural health due to subconcussive blows without developing any outward symptoms. They probed neural health through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Breedlove et al. subsequently demonstrated that changes in fMRI correlate with the number and location of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> experienced throughout the football season. ^ This work builds upon the analysis of Breedlove et al. Regression models based on an updated and expanded data set are presented. This analysis confirms that the number and location of subconcussive <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> are factors in eliciting deleterious changes in neural health as measured by fMRI. Further analysis indicates that the peak linear acceleration of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> is also a factor in eliciting changes in fMRI. Collectively, these results indicate that the subconcussive injury mechanism is analogous to mechanical fatigue or soft tissue overuse injury. Furthermore, comparison of player <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> based on position (i. e., linemen versus skill positions) indicates that player position may be a risk factor for subconcussive injury due to the large number of <b>head</b> <b>impacts</b> characteristic of linemen. ^ These analyses help elucidate the connection between <b>head</b> <b>impact</b> biomechanics and subconcussive pathophysiology. Analyses indicate that improvements in football equipment and changes in coaching and rules would likely have a protective effect in the prevention of subconcussive and concussive injury in football. ...|$|R
