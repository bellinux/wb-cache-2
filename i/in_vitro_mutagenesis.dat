5000|$|The {{fact that}} NS1 is {{involved}} in the pathogenicity of influenza A viruses makes it a good target to attenuate these viruses. Several studies demonstrated that influenza viruses with partial deletions in NS1 proteins are attenuated and do not cause disease, but induce a protective immune response in different species including mice, pigs, horses, birds and macaques. [...] Although it had been known {{for more than a decade}} that influenza viruses with partial deletions in NS1 proteins were attenuated, all but one NS1 truncation variants of influenza A viruses were generated by <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis.</b> Wang et al. later demonstrated that the naturally truncated variant [...] had propensity to generate new variants when passaged in ovo. [...] Remarkably, the new variants were excellent live-attenuated influenza vaccine candidates. The ability to attenuate influenza viruses by truncation of the NS1 protein presents a novel approach in design and development of the next generation live-attenuated influenza vaccines for both poultry and humans.|$|E
50|$|Although {{there are}} many other {{molecular}} display technologies, such as phage display, bacterial display, yeast display, and ribosome display, mRNA display technology has many advantages over the others. The first three biological display libraries listed have polypeptides or proteins expressed on the respective microorganism’s surface and the accompanying coding information for each polypeptide or protein is retrievable from the microorganism’s genome. However, the library size for these three in vivo display systems is limited by the transformation efficiency of each organism. For example, the library size for phage and bacterial display is limited to 1-10 × 10^9 different members. The library size for yeast display is even smaller. Moreover, these cell-based display system only allow the screening and enrichment of peptides/proteins containing natural amino acids. In contrast, mRNA display and ribosome display are in vitro selection methods. They allow a library size as large as 10^15 different members. The large library size increases the probability to select very rare sequences, and also improves the diversity of the selected sequences. In addition, in vitro selection methods remove unwanted selection pressure, such as poor protein expression, and rapid protein degradation, which may reduce the diversity of the selected sequences. Finally, in vitro selection methods allow the application of <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and recombination techniques throughout the selection process.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Aflatoxin B₁ (AFB₁) is a mold-produced toxin {{which has}} been shown to be a potent hepatocarcinogen in many animal species. Of the species studied thus far, rainbow trout have proven to be the most sensitive. Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate various aspects of AFB₁ metabolism in this species, including <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis,</b> and effects of dietary modifiers of AFB, carcinogenesis on in vitro metabolism and mutagenesis. A comparative study of AFB₁ metabolism in two salmonid species was also conducted. In the first study, the relative mutagenic potencies of several alfatoxin metabolites were evaluated using a trout liver fraction system. Preliminary studies characterizing trout liver fractions for use as an activation system were described. The results from comparative mutagenicity experiments demonstrated that in vitro mutagenic potencies qualitatively correlated with the in vivo carcinogenic activities of various aflatoxins in rainbow trout. The importance of these findings is discussed. In the second study fish hepatocytes were characterized to examine possible differences in activation of AFB₁ to bacterial mutagens by hepatocytes from rainbow trout and coho salmon, two species which are known to differ markedly in sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of AFB₁. Activation efficiency was approximately three times greater in hepatocytes from trout compared to salmon. A more marked difference was seen when S 20 liver fractions from the two species were used. Analysis of unbound [³H]AFB₁ metabolites revealed that trout hepatocytes metabolized [³H]AFB₁ to a greater extent than salmon. The results accurately reflected in vivo carcinogenesis trends in salmonid fish. Additional experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary modifiers of AFB₁ carcinogenesis on <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and metabolism of AFB₁. Dietary β-naphthoflavone (β-NF) was shown to induce the production of a novel trout metabolite of AFB₁, aflatoxicol M₁ (AFL-M₁). AFL-M₁ exhibited a mutagenic potency less than AFB₁ or aflatoxicol (AFL), but greater than that of aflatoxin-M₁ (AFM₁). Dietary β-NF, however, appeared to have no effect on in vitro mutagenic activation of AFB₁ using hepatocytes or liver S 20 fraction from trout. Dietary PCBs (Aroclor 1254) was shown to significantly decrease <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of AFB₁, which reflected a similar PCB-mediated inhibitory effect on AFB₁ carcinogenesis in trout in vivo. Cyclopropenoid fatty acids (CPFAs) present in the diet (0 - 600 ppm) were shown to have no effect on <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of AFB₁, indicating CPFAs may not significantly alter in vivo initiation of AFB₁ carcinogenesis...|$|E

40|$|Biological {{oxidation}} of cyclic alcohols normally {{results in}} {{formation of the}} corresponding dicarboxylic acids, which are further metabolized and enter the central carbon metabolism in the cell. We isolated an Acinetobacter sp. from an industrial wastewater bioreactor that utilized cyclohexanol as a sole carbon source. A cosmid library was constructed from Acinetobacter sp. strain SE 19, and oxidation of cyclohexanol to adipic acid was demonstrated in recombinant Escherichia coli carrying a SE 19 DNA segment. A region that was essential for cyclohexanol oxidation was localized to a 14 -kb fragment on the cosmid DNA. Several putative open reading frames (ORFs) that were expected to encode enzymes catalyzing the conversion of cyclohexanol to adipic acid were identified. Whereas one ORF showed high homology to cyclohexanone monooxygenase from Acinetobacter sp. strain NCIB 9871, most of the ORFs showed only moderate homology to proteins in GenBank. In order to assign functions of the various ORFs, <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> transposon <b>mutagenesis</b> was performed using the cosmid DNA as a target.

The {{ability of}} microinjected calmodulin to {{temporarily}} restore an ion channel-mediated behavioral phenotype of a calmodulin mutant in Paramecium tetraurelia (carol) {{is dependent on}} the amino acid side chain that is present at residue 101, even when there is extensive variation {{in the rest of the}} amino acid sequence.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the deduced amino acid sequence of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) DNA polymerase reported here suggests that the polymerase structure consists of domains carrying separate biological functions. The HSV- 1 enzyme is known to possess 5 '- 3 '-exonuclease (RNase H), 3 '- 5 '-exonuclease, and DNA polymerase catalytic activities. Sequence analysis suggests an arrangement of these activities into distinct domains resembling the organization of Escherichia coli polymerase I. In order to more precisely define the structure and C-terminal limits of a putative catalytic domain responsible for the DNA polymerization activity of the HSV- 1 enzyme, we have undertaken <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> and computer modeling studies of the HSV- 1 DNA polymerase gene. Sequence analysis predicts that the major DNA polymerization domain of the HSV- 1 enzyme will be contained between residues 690 and 1100, and we present a three-dimensional model of this region, {{on the basis of}} the X-ray crystallographic structure of the E. coli polymerase I. Consistent with these structural and modeling studies, deletion analysis by <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>mutagenesis</b> of the HSV- 1 DNA polymerase gene expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has confirmed that certain amino acids from the C terminus (residues 1073 to 1144 and 1177 to 1235) can be deleted without destroying HSV- 1 DNA polymerase catalytic activity and that the extreme N-terminal 227 residues are also not required for this activity...|$|E
