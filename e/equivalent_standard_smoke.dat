40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{homogeneous}} {{model for the}} class of mixed horizontal linear comple-mentarity problems. The proposed homogeneous model is always solvable and provides {{the solution of the}} original problem if it exists, or a certificate of infeasibility otherwise. Our formulation pre-serves the sparsity of the original formulation and does not reduce to the homogeneous model of the <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> linear complementarity problem. We study the properties of the model and show that interior-point methods can be used efficiently for the numerical solutions of the homoge-neous problem. Numerical experiments show convincingly that it is much more efficient to use the proposed homogeneous model for the mixed horizontal linear complementarity problem than to use known homogeneous models for the <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> linear complementarity problem...|$|R

Simulated bit error rate (BER) performance curves of the two codes confirm the behavior predicted using EXIT charts. For example, our PUM-based turbo code design outperforms the standard Inmarsat turbo code by 0. 5 dB for {{the same number of}} decoder iterations. Similarly, the UMTS standardized turbo code loses roughly 0. 5 dB in the error-floor region compared to the PUM-based turbo code of same complexity...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present SPREFQL, an {{extension}} of the SPARQL language that allows appending a PREFER clause that expresses "soft" preferences over the query results obtained by {{the main body of the}} query. The extension does not add expressivity and any SPREFQL query can be transformed to an <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> SPARQL query. However, clearly separating preferences from the "hard" patterns and filters in the WHERE clause gives queries where the intention of the client is more cleanly expressed, an advantage for both human readability and machine optimization. In the paper we formally define the syntax and the semantics of the extension and we also provide empirical evidence that optimizations specific to SPREFQL improve run-time efficiency by comparison to the usually applied optimizations on the <b>equivalent</b> <b>standard</b> SPARQL query.
