40|$|In {{spite of}} a {{somewhat}} disappointing performance throughout the crisis, {{and a series of}} high-profile scandals, investors are showing interest in hedge <b>funds.</b> Still, <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds</b> keep on experiencing outflows. Can this phenomenon be explained by the failure <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> managers to deliver on their promise to add value through active management, or is it symptomatic of a move toward greater disintermediation in the hedge fund industry? Little attention has been paid so far to the added value, and the sources of the added value, <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds.</b> The lack <b>of</b> transparency that is characteristic <b>of</b> the hedge <b>funds</b> arena and makes the performance attribution exercise particularly challenging is probably an explanation.

[...] Secondary investments provide institutional investors with the ability to improve vintage diversification, particularly for investors that are new to the asset class. [...] Secondaries also typically experience a different cash flow profile, diminishing the j-curve effect of investing in new private equity funds. [...] Often investments in secondaries are made through third party fund vehicle, structured similar to a <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> although many large institutional investors have purchased private equity fund interests through secondary transactions.

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{theoretical}} model <b>of</b> <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> net leverage and alpha where {{the cost of}} borrowing is increasing with net leverage, thereby impacting the performance. We use this model to determine {{the conditions under which}} the leverage has a negative or a positive impact on investor’s alpha. Moreover, we show that the manager <b>of</b> a <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> has an incentive to take a leverage that hurts the investor’s alpha. Next, we develop a statistical method combining the Sharpe style analysis and a time-varying coefficient model; this method allows the weights of the regression to vary over time while being constrained to sum up to 1. Subsequently, we use this method to get estimates of the leverages <b>of</b> a sample <b>of</b> <b>funds</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>funds.</b> The estimates <b>of</b> leverages are then used in predictive regression analyses to confirm the negative impact <b>of</b> leverage on <b>fund</b> <b>of</b> hedge <b>fund</b> alphas and appraisal ratios.
