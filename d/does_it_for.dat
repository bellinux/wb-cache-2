25|$|Various {{characters}} are shown entering the fifth DOA tournament, {{which takes place}} at the platform. Each <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> their own reasons, often to either see once more or to defeat some other character. Usually they join it after either being approached by Zack, who is shown finding, fighting and recruiting them around the world. After Tina decides to return to fighting, her father Bass enters it as well, adopting a ring name of Mr. Strong; eventually, they reunite as a team. While stalking Jann Lee, Leifang eventually confronts him before the tournament and there is sexual tension between them. Hitomi, who still hopes to see Ein (Hayate), advances to the quarterfinals, defeating Mila and then Eliot. During a break, Hitomi meets Hayate, who wishes her good luck. Jann Lee, who had won constructive matches against Leifang and Mr. Strong, defeats her, emerging as the winner from the tournament but not attending the championship award ceremony out of a personal grudge for Rig, whom he lost to in an earlier fight.|$|E
500|$|The result kept Burton in {{the lead}} in the Drivers' Championship. After the race, Jeff Gordon (who was {{involved}} in the lap-137 accident) was less optimistic about his championship chances: [...] "This pretty much <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> us as far as I'm concerned for the championship. You knew exactly that something like that was going to happen." [...] In the Manufacturers' Championship Chevrolet increased its point total to 231; Dodge moved into second place with 180 and Ford was a close third with 179. The race took three hours, ten minutes and twenty-three seconds to complete; because it ended under caution, no margin of victory was recorded.|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Iconic" [...] {{talks about}} {{taking control of}} your life and letting your inner fire burn and {{encourages}} listeners to pursue their dreams. During the song, she urges the listeners to [...] "making [...] voices heard before someone <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> [...] " [...] with her voice [...] "echoing like the announcer in the ring." [...] In another part, during the motivational encouragement, she informs that [...] "there's only two letters difference between 'I Can't' and 'Icon'," [...] while also inspiring the listeners {{to find their own}} greatness, singing: [...] "Just shine your light like a beautiful star / Show the world who you are." [...] Tyson opening speech talks about how he's ‘the best the world's ever seen' and that he [...] "worked hard and sweated [...] tears." [...] He later proclames: [...] "I'm never falling again and if I did, I'll come back." [...] Chance, on the other hand, raps about idolatry.|$|E
500|$|Alec Mapa of The Advocate elaborates: [...] "While {{the rest}} of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our {{childhood}} fantasies... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm going to wear this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
500|$|Lennon's quote was {{featured}} in a 3 July article in The New York Times Magazine and provoked no reaction. In late July, when Datebook republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote [...] "I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" [...] on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me. I {{am not going to}} play the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} will," [...] said the Countess. [...] "But then Carstairs is {{so very much}} in earnest. He would have <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> himself if you hadn't <b>done</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> him." ...|$|R
2500|$|American writer George Saunders, {{when asked}} for a {{literary}} influence said [...] "There's a Russian writer named Isaac Babel that I love. I can drop in anywhere in his works, read a few pages, and go, Oh yeah, language. It's almost like if you were tuning a guitar and you heard a beautifully tuned one and you say, Yeah, that's what we want. We want something that perfect. When I read him, it recalibrates my ear. It {{reminds me of the}} difference between an OK sentence and a really masterful sentence. Babel <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} episodes, Rocko bears crushes {{for other}} characters. In [...] "S.W.A.K.", Rocko has been {{vying for the}} attention from the pretty kangaroo mail-lady that comes to his door every day; he writes her a love note that he is too scared to send so Heffer <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> him instead. Rocko fails to retrieve the letter and gets {{the impression that the}} mail-lady would rather go out with Heffer. This {{turns out to be a}} joke on the mail-lady's part and she actually returns Rocko's feelings. In [...] "Wallaby on Wheels", Rocko learns to roller skate to impress Sheila, a girl who hangs out at the roller rink, and becomes jealous when it is implied she is attracted to Heffer. In the end, he wins her over after saving Heffer's life. In [...] "I See London, I See France", Rocko tries to win over Claudette, who turned out to be his female wallaby pen pal from Paris, but she is more interested in Heffer.|$|E
