5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the third group of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained <b>hands-on</b> <b>experience.</b> In addition to piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled from the Grand Canyon to learn about geography {{all the way to}} Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.|$|E

Tyntesfield, a 19th-century Victorian country house and grounds, was bought and opened up by the National Trust in 2002. An edition of the North Somerset Times is published as the Nailsea Times.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final phase was {{operational}} training for the astronauts. This focused on giving them <b>hands-on</b> <b>experience</b> using the instruments and equipment required during their spaceflight. They received training in the effects of microgravity and rapid acceleration. The astronauts spent time in simulators, aboard cargo planes that simulated weightlessness, underwater to practice extravehicular activities (EVAs), and on visits to manufacturing plants {{to check on the}} progress of the hardware.|$|E
30|$|Results from Experiment 2 reaffirm that <b>hands-on</b> <b>experiences</b> might {{highlight}} the heaviness {{of objects and}} thus lead to mistaken performance. In {{order to understand the}} seriousness of these effects, we next examined whether the negative influence of <b>hands-on</b> <b>experiences</b> would persist over time.|$|R
30|$|The {{results were}} clear: Despite using a setting that invites <b>hands-on</b> <b>experiences</b> (e.g., Flick, 1993; Haury & Rillero, 1994), {{we could not}} find support for claimed benefits. In fact, the {{opportunity}} for <b>hands-on</b> <b>experiences,</b> compared to viewing static images, led to more mistakes in both naïve performance and after training. It appears that <b>hands-on</b> <b>experiences</b> solidified systematic mistakes about how an object’s heaviness relates to its sinking rate. Thus, the beneficial effect of embodied experience was either absent or in the wrong direction. These findings undermine blanket claims about the advantages of hands-on, embodied learning. In what follows, we elaborate on this point.|$|R

5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov {{eventually}} became an excellent {{teacher and a}} fervent believer in academic training. He revised everything he had composed prior to 1874, even acclaimed works such as Sadko and Antar, {{in a search for}} perfection that would remain with him throughout the rest of his life. Assigned to rehearse the Orchestra Class, he mastered the art of conducting. Dealing with orchestral textures as a conductor, and making suitable arrangements of musical works for the Orchestra Class, led to an increased interest in the art of orchestration, an area into which he would further indulge his studies as Inspector of Navy Bands. The score of his Third Symphony, written just after he had completed his three-year program of self-improvement, reflects his <b>hands-on</b> <b>experience</b> with the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Technical Institute (STI) was {{established}} in 1948 in barracks {{on the campus of}} Naval Air Station Atlanta (now DeKalb Peachtree Airport) in Chamblee, northeast of Atlanta. At that time, all colleges in Georgia were considered extensions of the state's four research universities, and the Southern Technical Institute belonged to Georgia Tech. STI {{was established}} as an engineering technology school, to help military personnel returning from World War II gain <b>hands-on</b> <b>experience</b> in technical fields. Around 1958, the school moved to Marietta, to land donated by Dobbins Air Force Base. STI was split from Georgia Tech in 1981, {{at a time when most}} other regional schools separated from the University of Georgia, Georgia State University, and Georgia Southern University.|$|E
