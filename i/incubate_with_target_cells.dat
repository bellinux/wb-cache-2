40|$|The {{in vitro}} {{cytotoxic}} effect of spleen cells of mice immunized by tumour allografts was studied by measuring <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> inactivation {{as a function}} of release of radioactive label (51 Cr) or loss of cloning efficiency.

In this study we have examined the delivery efficiency of drugs entrapped in heat-sensitive immunoliposomes. Immunoliposomes composed of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine with entrapped [3 H]uridine were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> at 4 degrees C. The cell-liposome mixture was then heated to 41 degrees C and the uptake of [3 H]uridine into the intracellular pool of phosphorylated uridine-containing molecules was measured. The immunoliposomes showed maximal release of the uridine at 41 degrees C, the phase transition temperature of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The largest accumulation of [3 H]uridine in the <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> also took place at 41 degrees C. The initial level of uptake of [3 H]uridine released from immunoliposomes by heating was greatly enhanced over that observed for free [3 H]uridine and [3 H]uridine released from liposomes without attached antibody. The nucleoside uptake inhibitors nitrothiobenzylinosine, dipyridamole, and unlabeled uridine were able to inhibit uptake of [3 H]uridine released from immunoliposomes. This supports {{the hypothesis that the}} enhanced uptake is due to a heat-induced release of [3 H]uridine at the cell surface followed by transport and phosphorylation of [3 H]uridine by the <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicate the feasibility of using the heat-sensitive immunoliposomes as a target-specific drug delivery system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Carbamazepine and selegiline, {{although}} neuroprotective themselves, are {{presumed to}} have toxic metabolites. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the possible metabolism-induced toxicity of selegiline and carbamazepine with a novel in vit ro method: The drugs were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> (neuroblastoma SH-SY 5 Y) with or without a pre-incubation with mouse or human hepatocytes. The viability of SH-SY 5 Y cells was then measured by using total cellular ATP as an indicator of the cell viability. For the pre-incubation with hepatocytes two different methods were used: Hepa-tocytes were grown either in multiwell plates (Model 1) or in filter inserts (Model 2). Selegiline itself increased SH-SY 5 Y viability, but the pre-incubation with both mouse and human hepatocytes made se-legiline slightly toxic to SH-SY 5 Y cells. The biotransformation of carbamazepine seemed to be more complex and showed variation in different hepatocyte models. In general, human hepatocytes increased carbamazepine toxicity to SH-SY 5 Y cells, whereas mouse hepatocytes had no such effect. The methodology used (especially Model 1) could form a ba-sis in developing a test system for a qualitative detection of metabolism-induced (neuro) toxicity in the early phase of drug discovery. In this respect, the present study might be promising for further evaluation by means of a larger number of in-dependent experiments and different types of compounds.

40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported that a}} potent new beta-blocker, tertatolol, when given at therapeutic doses to healthy volunteers, rapidly {{reduced the number of}} human mononuclear leukocyte beta-receptors. In the present study, the mechanism of receptor regulation by beta-antagonists <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro was investigated. Two different cell types (human mononuclear leukocytes and S 49 murine lymphoma cells) were used, and beta-adrenergic receptors were measured using either the hydrophilic ligand 3 H-CGP 12177 (specific for surface receptors) or lipophilic 125 I-pindolol (which measures total receptors). In a comparison between beta-blockers, tertatolol and bopindolol, but not propranolol and pindolol, were found to rapidly (1 hour at 37 degrees C) reduce the number of beta-adrenergic receptors. This was paralleled by a reduction in isoproterenol-stimulated cyclic AMP accumulation. The reduction in receptors was the same whether surface or total receptors were measured; thus, it was not due to receptor sequestration. This effect was not caused by partial agonist activity (bopindolol is a weak partial agonist); in parallel experiments, tertatolol and bopindolol, but not pindolol (potent partial agonist) and isoproterenol (full agonist), reduced beta-adrenergic receptors. Finally, this effect was not due to irreversible binding: the receptor reduction induced by the irreversible blocker bromo-acetyl-alprenolol-methane (BAAM) was stable for several hours, while the effect of tertatolol and bopindolol was slowly reversed over the same time course. We suggest that tertatolol and bopindolol have two effects on beta-adrenergic receptors: they bind competitively, and then they modify the receptors so that they are no longer available for binding by ligands or catecholamines...|$|R
40|$|Platelets are potent antibody- and complement-dependent {{cytotoxic}} effector cells. We showed previously that {{a single}} platelet can lyse a <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> sensitized <b>with</b> immunoglobulin G (IgG) and complement components up to C 3 (C integral of 3 b denotes the target cell-bound fragment of complement up to C 3; the precise nature of the bound C 3 fragment has not been established), and that the complete cytotoxic system capable of specific recognition and lysis resides in platelet membranes. To define the components of platelet membranes required for cytotoxicity, a set of inhibitors of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) that act by different chemical mechanisms was tested. The lytic reaction is blocked at appropriate concentrations of bromophenacylbromide, mepacrine, and manoalide. When platelets are treated with bromophenacylbromide, inhibition of cytolytic activity and that of PLA 2 enzymatic activity occur in parallel. Platelets release arachidonate when <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> bearing IgG and C integral of 3 b, confirming that Fc gamma R and complement receptor trigger both PLA 2 action and efficient lysis. Inhibition by thimerosal of a reverse reaction, i. e., reacylation catalyzed by acyltransferase, causes increased <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> lysis, presumably by increasing the products of PLA 2 action. Platelet cytotoxicity is increased when platelets are pretreated with some products of PLA 2 : exogenous lysophospholipids and not free arachidonic acid increase cytotoxicity. Electron microscopy suggests that platelets and <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> may fuse, possibly {{as a result of}} the formation of lysophospholipids which are well-known membrane fusogens. Fixation with paraformaldehyde does not affect platelet cytotoxicity, suggesting that the complete cytotoxic system resides as a preformed complex in platelet membranes.

40|$|The naturally-occurring antibody-independent {{cellular}} cytotoxic activity (NOCC) {{of normal}} circulating human monocytes and neutrophils was investigated employing {{a number of}} erythrocytes and the K- 562 <b>cell</b> line as <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> simultaneously. The identity of the effector cell(s) was shown to be dependent upon or {{be a function of}} the type of <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> selected for the assay system. A number of erythrocyte targets (rabbit, horse, sheep and ox erythrocytes) were lysed to varying degrees by neutrophils and monocytes and not by lymphocytes.

In contrast, the cytotoxic cells using the K- 562 <b>target</b> <b>cell</b> were lymphocytes. Monocytes and neutrophils were inactive. The cytotoxic-enhancing activity in normal human serum exhibits specific and non-specific properties which suggests that more than one factor is involved. With respect to the monocyte cytotoxic cells, only the rabbit erythrocytes could totally absorb the serum factor in a specific fashion. Absorption of the serum with horse, sheep or ox erythrocytes resulted in a significant loss of potentiating activity with respect to all of the erythrocyte targets but a more marked loss of activity using the absorbing erythrocytes as <b>targets.</b> <b>With</b> respect to the polymorphonuclear leucocyte effector cells, only the rabbit RBC were capable of specifically absorbing out the cytotoxic-enhancing factor present in the normal human serum. Absorption of the serum with sheep, horse or ox RBC resulted in total cross-absorption of the enhancing factor. Chicken and human RBC, which do not serve as targets for the NOCC assay, could not absorb out the cytotoxic-enhancing factor with respect to any of the target erythrocytes. The composition of the soluble serum factor(s) is under current investigation but it is not an immunoglobulin since pure serum albumin can substitute for normal serum in the NOCC assay. The mechanism of erythrocyte lysis by the cytotoxic monocyte was investigated.

Because local anesthetics are known to attenuate inflammatory reactions, ropivacaine was tested for its possible antiinflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide-induced lung injury in rat alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) and rat pulmonary artery endothelial cells (RPAECs) in vitro and in vivo. Methods: AECs and RPAECs were stimulated for 4 h with lipopolysaccharide or lipopolysaccharide and 1 [mu]m ropivacaine. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 was assessed. Isolated neutrophils were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> stimulated <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> to quantify adhesion and neutrophil-induced cytotoxicity in AECs and RPAECs. In vivo, lipopolysaccharide was instilled intratracheally with or without 1 mm intratracheally or intravenously administered ropivacaine. Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed 5 h later to determine neutrophil and albumin content, as well as concentrations of inflammatory mediators. Results: In AECs and RPAECs, ropivacaine attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced up-regulation of mRNA for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 by 41 % and 24 %, respectively (P < 0. 05). In the presence of ropivacaine, increased neutrophil adhesion was down-regulated by 58 % and 44 % (P < 0. 005), whereas cytotoxicity in AECs and RPAECs was diminished by 28 % and 33 %, respectively (P < 0. 05). Enhanced neutrophil count in lipopolysaccharide lungs was reduced by 56 % in the presence of intratracheally instilled ropivacaine (81 % with intravenous ropivacaine; P < 0. 005). Albumin was decreased by 46 % with intratracheal ropivacaine (38 % with intravenous ropivacaine; P < 0. 05), and inflammatory mediators were decreased by 48 - 59 % (69 - 81 % with intravenous ropivacaine; P < 0. 01).

We {{found that the}} proportion of CD 56 (bright) NK cells was significantly decreased in cord blood from these newborns, suggesting they may have been recruited to secondary lymphoid organs. The remaining CD 56 (bright) NK cells exhibited a defective ability in the production of interferon (IFN) -gamma following in vitro activation with interleukin (IL) - 12 + IL- 2 or IL- 12 + IL- 15 cytokines, as compared with NK cells from uninfected newborns. In addition, cord blood NK cells from congenitally infected newborns stimulated with cytokines have a decreased release of granzyme B (GrB) when <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> K 562 <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> This defect in cytotoxic effector function is associated with a reduced surface expression of activating NK receptors (NKp 30, NKp 46, and NKG 2 D) on CD 56 (dim) NK cells compared with uninfected newborns.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{simple and}} rapid method for {{measuring}} the hybridization stability of duplexes of DNAs and other oligomers in different environments is described. When added to an oligomer duplex, the thiazole orange (TO) dye intercalates and in this state is fluorescent. Therefore, when duplex dissociation occurs, the release of TO results in a detectable change in fluorescence intensity. This assay was developed primarily to screen antisense oligomer duplexes that are stable in serum and in the cytoplasm but unstable {{in the presence of}} their target messenger RNA (mRNA). METHODS: The two antisense oligomers of this investigation were both 25 mer phosphorothioate (PS) DNAs, one directed against the RIα mRNA and the other directed against the mdr 1 mRNA. The former duplex was first used in the solution studies, in most cases duplexed with a 16 mer phosphodiester (PO) complementary DNA (i. e., PS-DNA 25 /PO-cDNA 16). Both duplexes were then tested in a series of cell studies using SK-BR- 3 (RIα+), KB-G 2 (mdr 1 ++), and KB- 31 (mdr 1 +/-) cells. RESULTS: Preliminary measurements in solution showed that maximum fluorescence was achieved when more than ten TO molecules were bound to each duplex. When a 25 mer PO-DNA or PO-RNA with the base sequence of the RIα mRNA was added, the dramatic change in fluorescence intensity that followed signified dissociation of the antisense DNA from the study duplex and reassociation <b>with</b> the <b>target</b> DNA. Kinetic measurements showed that this process was completed in about 3 min. Fluorescent measurements of SK-BR- 3 (RIα+) cells incubated at 37 degrees C with the anti-RIα study duplex over time showed a maximum {{at the point where the}} loss of fluorescence due to dissociation of the study duplex, probably by an antisense mechanism, began to dominate over the increasing fluorescence due to continuing cellular accumulation. A similar result was observed in the KB-G 2 (mdr 1 +) cells <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> the anti-mdr 1 study duplex. CONCLUSIONS: When study duplexes shown to be stable in serum were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> their <b>target</b> <b>cells,</b> the assay successfully detected evidence of dissociation, most likely by an antisense mechanism. Thus, a TO fluorescence assay has been developed that is capable of detecting the dissociation of DNA duplexes...|$|R

Objective: To investigate the cytotoxic activity and perforin expression of CD 8 lymphocytes in the airway lumen of patients with COPD. Methods: Thirty-six male smokers with COPD, 25 male smokers without COPD, and 10 healthy nonsmokers participated in the study. T-lymphocytes of induced sputum samples were labeled with appropriate monoclonal antibodies and measured using flow cytometry. The cytotoxic activity of CD 8 cells was defined by <b>incubating</b> them <b>with</b> specific <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> (K 562). Results: The percentage and the total number of CD 8 lymphocytes were significantly higher in COPD smokers compared to non-COPD smokers (p 0. 01 and p 0. 005, respectively) or to healthy nonsmokers (p 0. 02 and p 0. 01, respectively). Perforin expression in CD 8 cells was significantly higher in smokers with COPD compared to the other two groups (p 0. 001). Increased cytotoxic activity of T cells was also observed in induced sputum of patients with COPD in comparison to the other two groups. Conclusion: CD 8 cells are not only increased in number in sputum samples of smokers with COPD but are highly activated, expressing high levels of perforin.

40|$|T-suppressor-cell {{activity}} was analyzed {{by use of}} an intermediate culture system that allows the study of T-cell interactions {{in the absence of}} concomitant inducer effects on B cells. Activated suppressor T cells were <b>incubated</b> <b>with</b> their potential <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> [immune Ly- 1 +,Ly- 2 - (Ly- 1) cells] for 24 - 48 hr, and then the Ly- 1 cells were reisolated by removing the suppressor cells with an appropriate antiserum (Ly- 2). The functional consequences of the interactions that occurred during the incubation period were then assessed. Suppressor cells deleted the functional activity of two inducer-T-cell subsets; the helper T cell, which induces B-cell production of antibody, and the T cell that induces Ly 2 + T suppressor cells. This latter activity is more sensitive to suppression than is the former. As suppressor T cells inactivate the cells that are responsible for their activity (i. e., their specialized Ly- 1 inducer cells), a form of negative regulation of suppressor-T-cell activity, in which the down regulation of suppressor cells is effected by their removal of their own inducer cells, can be postulated. In addition, these findings show that clonal deletion and active suppression need not be mutually exclusive mechanisms of immune unresponsiveness. Suppressor cells can produce a functional deletion of immune activity that persists after they themselves are removed, for example, by antisera, or in physiological situations by the negative form of regulation postulated...|$|R
40|$|Broadening the {{understanding}} of mechanisms linked to innate immunity is of primordial importance {{in a time of}} continuous emergence of rapidly spreading viral diseases. The domestic cat represents an ideal model for the study of host-virus interactions, as it is an outbred species naturally susceptible to many viruses sharing biological properties with those affecting humans. Additionally, due to their acquisition of infallible transmission strategies, rapid propagation of feline viruses within a group is particularly difficult to inhibit, reflecting the challenges linked to the prevention of pandemics. The present work was designed to gain insights on the innate immune responses of the domestic cat to viruses, and to determine whether early antiviral mechanisms can be manipulated to enhance resistance to viral infection in this species. In a first phase, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems were developed, enabling to measure the expression of feline genes considered to be hallmarks of innate responses to viral infection, including various interferon (IFN) ? and IFN? subtypes, IFN?, intracellular antiviral Myxovirus resistance (Mx) factor, natural killer (NK) cell stimulator IL- 15 and effectors perforin and granzyme B, as well as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3, 7, 8 and 9. These tools could then be employed to evaluate innate immune parameters in both in vitro and in vivo models of infection, conferring valuable information not only regarding strength, breadth and kinetics of antiviral defences in feline cells, but also possible biological properties of important viruses affecting the cat. In a further step, the newly developed PCR assays were utilized to assess the immunomodulatory potential of various immune response modifiers (IRMs) in feline cells in vitro. The IRMs mimicking natural viral components were selected, namely Poly IC and Resiquimod (R- 848), artificial models of viral dsRNA and ssRNA, as well as dSLIM? and ODN 2216, synthetic oligonucleotides containing several unmethylated CpG motifs. Although all analysed IRMs positively modulated the innate immune state of treated peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs), ODN 2216 induced by far the most potent response: this molecule not only altered the gene expression profile of feline PBMCs in an antiviral orientation, but also significantly enhanced the proliferation of these immune cells and increased the presence on their surface of co-stimulatory molecules necessary for the diffusion of immunological defence signals. Moreover, when <b>incubated</b> in vitro <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> of epithelial and fibroblastic origin, the supernatants of ODN 2216 -stimulated PBMCs not only induced high production of intracellular antiviral proteins in these cells but also inhibited the replication of five feline viruses, namely the feline calici- (FCV), herpes- (FHV), parvo- (FPV), corona- (FCoV) and leukemia (FeLV) viruses. Altogether, this study procures a better understanding of innate antiviral mechanisms in an outbred species and highlights the promising potential of CpG-containing molecules such as ODN 2216 to protect domestic cats against a broad range of virus infections. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations will determine the feasibility of stimulation of the innate immune system by such molecules to prevent viral propagation in humans, cats and other species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{cytotoxic}} T lymphocyte (CTL) {{response to}} dengue virus-infected <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> is described. Effector cells were generated in an in vitro secondary culture {{and appeared to}} be T cells possessing both the Lyt 1. 1 and Lyt 2. 1 surface antigens. A stronger CTL response was noted with the H- 2 k haplotype compared to H- 2 d, and H- 2 compatibility was required between CTL and <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> CTL generated showed some cross-reactivity <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> infected <b>with</b> Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), another flavivirus, but not <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> infected <b>with</b> an alphavirus, Sindbis. The significance and importance of these findings are discussed. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are activated following infection {{with a wide variety of}} viruses and may play both protective and pathogenic roles. Among the togaviridae, CTL has been demonstrated to the alphaviruses (9) but there is meagre evidence of a CTL response to flaviviruses. The dengue viruses (dengue 1 - 4) are flaviviruses and are the causative agents of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS), an important cause of morbidity and mortality in many parts of the tropical world. Although the pathogenesis of DHF/DSS is not full...|$|R

40|$|Activation {{of natural}} killer cells can be {{mediated}} by different receptors. Stimulation of the receptors 2 B 4, NTB-A and CRACC, members of the SLAM-related receptor family, induces cytotoxicity and cytokine production. The surface expression of 2 B 4 and other activating natural killer cell receptors is down-modulated after receptor engagement, which results in a weaker response to consecutive stimulation. We tested whether this regulatory mechanism applies to all SLAM-related receptors expressed by primary human natural killer <b>cells.</b> After co-culture <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> expressing the respective ligands different effects on receptor surface expression were observed. While 2 B 4 ex-pression was strongly reduced, NTB-A showed less prominent down-modulation and the expression level of CRACC remained unchanged. The expression levels of the receptor-proximal signaling molecules SAP, EAT- 2 and FynT did not change after receptor engagement. Co-culture <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> expressing the ligands for NTB-A or CRACC had no impact on subsequent NTB-A or CRACC-mediated NK cell activation...|$|R

40|$|Measles virus (MV) encodes {{the fusion}} protein (F) that mediates cell fusion and {{intercellular}} {{spread of the}} virus, and is homologous to the carboxy terminus of the neuropeptide substance P (SP). In addition, the oligopeptide Z-D-Phe-L-Phe-Gly, also homologous to F and SP, inhibits MV fusion <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> These observations {{raise the question of}} whether MV uses the SP receptor (SPR) during a specific phase of its infectious cycle. In this report, we examine the structural and functional consequences of this interaction and show, using cross-linking studies, that MV and SP specifically bind to a 52 - 58 -kD protein, previously reported to comprise the SPR on human IM- 9 lymphoblasts. Moreover, bound MV and SP are shown to reciprocally displace each other from these cells. In addition, we demonstrate that anti-SP antisera inhibits the cell-to-cell spread of MV, and that SP blocks MV fusion <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells.</b> These results indicate the presence of MV-SPR interactions during viral fusion, and suggest possible novel mechanisms for viral entry into cells...|$|R
40|$|Immunological {{control of}} cancer lesions {{requires}} local uptake of tumor-specific antigen {{followed by the}} activation and expansion of tumor specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL). An efficient effector phase further depends upon the entry of activated CTL into the tumor microenvironment and scanning of tumor tissue, which leads to direct interaction of the CTL <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> followed by apoptosis induction and shrinkage of the tumor lesion. Whereas the antigens and pathways that lead to efficient activation of tumor-specific CTL are well established, the local mechanisms that enable efficient - or deficient - CTL function in the tumor tissue are poorly understood. Firstly, effector T lymphocytes need to be mobile to reach the tumor lesion. Next, they must physically interact with and scan tumor cells for antigenic MHC/peptide complexes. Lastly, CTLs must undergo activation and functional conjugation <b>with</b> <b>target</b> <b>cells</b> to induce apoptosis either by the release of perforins or the engagement of Fas/FasL. All these steps of effector function are interdependent and require the amoeboid migration of CTL through tissue to reach, engage with and leave encountered cells...|$|R
