5|$|Adjuvant {{radiotherapy}} {{is commonly}} used in early-stage (stage I or II) endometrial cancer. It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy (VBT), which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity, or <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (EBRT). Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected; {{in the case of}} endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina. <b>External</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body. VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina, whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery. However, the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial. Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis, overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved.

5000|$|Radiotherapy is {{the most}} common {{treatment}} for secondary brain tumors. The amount of radiotherapy depends {{on the size of the}} area of the brain affected by cancer. Conventional <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> [...] "whole-brain <b>radiotherapy</b> treatment" [...] (WBRT) or [...] "whole-brain irradiation" [...] may be suggested if there is a risk that other secondary tumors will develop in the future.

25|$|The {{rationale}} for IORT is {{to deliver a}} high dose of radiation precisely to the targeted area with minimal exposure of surrounding tissues which are displaced or shielded during the IORT. Conventional radiation techniques such as <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumor have several drawbacks: The tumor bed where the highest dose should be applied is frequently missed due to the complex localization of the wound cavity even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay between the surgical removal of the tumor and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumor cells. These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumor cells. Another aspect is that wound fluid has a stimulating effect on tumor cells. IORT was found to inhibit the stimulating effects of wound fluid.|$|E
25|$|More recently, Cherenkov {{light has}} been used to image {{substances}} in the body. These discoveries have led to intense interest around the idea of using this light signal to quantify and/or detect radiation in the body, either from internal sources such as injected radiopharmaceuticals or from <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> in oncology. Radioisotopes such as the Beta emitters 18-F and 13-N or positron emitters 32-P or 90-Y have measurable Cherenkov emission and isotopes 18-F and 131-I have been imaged in humans for diagnostic value demonstration. External beam radiation therapy has been shown to induce a substantial amount of Cherenkov light in the tissue being treated, due to the photon beam energy levels used in the 6 MV to 18 MV ranges. The secondary electrons induced by these high energy x-rays result in the Cherenkov light emission, where the detected signal can be imaged at the entry and exit surfaces of the tissue.|$|E
25|$|Radiation therapy {{eliminates}} the microscopic cancer cells that may remain near {{the area where}} the tumor was surgically removed. The dose of radiation must be strong enough to ensure the elimination of cancer cells. However, radiation affects normal cells and cancer cells alike, causing some damage to the normal tissue around where the tumor was. Healthy tissue can repair itself, while cancer cells do not repair themselves as well as normal cells. For this reason, radiation treatments are given over an extended period, enabling the healthy tissue to heal. Treatments using <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> are typically given over a period of five to seven weeks, performed five days a week. Recent large trials (UK START and Canadian) have confirmed that shorter treatment courses, typically over three to four weeks, result in equivalent cancer control and side effects as the more protracted treatment schedules. Each treatment takes about 15 minutes. A newer approach, called 'accelerated partial breast irradiation' (APBI), uses brachytherapy to deliver the radiation in a much shorter period of time. APBI delivers radiation to only the immediate region surrounding the original tumor and can typically be completed over the course of one week.|$|E

It can be shown that if the maximum percentage initial uptake g- 1 uptake in normal or tumour tissue is less than 0. 046 or 0. 23 for an administered activity of 50 mCi of 90 Y or 131 I respectively, then the radiation-induced damage will certainly be less than for 2 Gy fraction- 1 <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> therapy for the same total dose.

2500|$|Radiotherapy {{is given}} after surgery {{to the region}} of the tumor bed and {{regional}} lymph nodes, to destroy microscopic tumor cells that may have escaped surgery.

Conventionally radiotherapy is given after the operation for breast cancer. [...] Radiation can also be given at the time of operation on the breast cancer.

2500|$|Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy, X-ray therapy, or irradiation) {{is the use}} of {{ionizing}} radiation to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Radiation therapy can be administered externally via <b>external</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (EBRT) or internally via brachytherapy. The effects of radiation therapy are localised and confined to the region being treated. Radiation therapy injures or destroys cells in the area being treated (the [...] "target tissue") by damaging their genetic material, making it impossible for these cells to continue to grow and divide. Although radiation damages both cancer cells and normal cells, most normal cells can recover from the effects of radiation and function properly. The goal of radiation therapy is to damage as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting harm to nearby healthy tissue. Hence, it is given in many fractions, allowing healthy tissue to recover between fractions.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to World War 2, {{the only}} {{practical}} sources of radiation for radiotherapy were radium and its [...] "emanation", radon gas, and the x-ray tube. [...] <b>External</b> <b>beam</b> <b>radiotherapy</b> (teletherapy) {{began at the}} turn of the century with relatively low voltage (<150nbsp&kV) x-ray machines. [...] It was found that while superficial tumors could be treated with low voltage x-rays, more penetrating, higher energy beams were required to reach tumors inside the body, requiring higher voltages. [...] Orthovoltage X-rays, which used tube voltages of 200-500nbsp&kV, began to be used during the 1920s. [...] To reach the most deeply buried tumors without exposing intervening skin and tissue to dangerous radiation doses required rays with energies of 1nbsp&MV or above, called [...] "megavolt" [...] radiation. [...] Producing megavolt x-rays required voltages on the x-ray tube of 3 to 5 million volts, which required huge expensive installations. [...] Megavoltage x-ray units were first built in the late 1930s but because of cost were limited to a few institutions. [...] One of the first, installed at St. Bartholomew's hospital, London in 1937 and used until 1960, used a 30 foot long x-ray tube and weighed 10 tons. [...] Radium produced megavolt gamma rays, but was extremely rare and expensive due to its low occurrence in ores. [...] In 1937 the entire world supply of radium for radiotherapy was 50 grams, valued at £800,000, or $50 million in 2005 dollars.|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{international}} {{codes of}} practice based on absorbed dose to water standards have been published for the clinical reference dosimetry of <b>external</b> <b>beams</b> 1. It has become widely accepted that dosimetry of radiotherapeutic beams {{should be based on}} these standards. These {{codes of practice}} are a major improvement over earlier ones that used air kerma calibration factors as they are based on a calibration directly in a phantom in terms of the quantity of interest. The previous codes begin with calibration in air in terms of air kerma, then use theoretical and generic conversion factors to obtain dose to water that do not take account of chamber-to-chamber variation. Other good reasons for implementing the new codes are that they are conceptually simpler, include improved physical data and improve the consistency for various ionisation chamber types as well as between different beam types.
