2500|$|An {{external}} collet is {{a sleeve}} with a (normally) cylindrical inner surface and a conical outer surface. The collet can be squeezed against a matching taper such that its inner surface contracts to a slightly smaller diameter, squeezing the tool or workpiece {{to hold it}} securely. Most often this is achieved with a spring collet, made of spring steel, {{with one or more}} [...] cuts along its length to allow it to expand and contract. An alternative collet design is one that has several tapered steel blocks (essentially tapered <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks)</b> held in circular position (like the points of a star, or indeed the jaws of a jawed chuck) by a flexible binding medium (typically synthetic or natural rubber). Regardless of the collet design, the operating principle is the same: squeeze the collet against the tool or workpiece to be held, resulting in high static friction.|$|E

The {{principle of}} contactless <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> calibration combines low-coherence interferometry and laser interferometry.

40|$|An {{instrument}} for {{the measurement of}} ball diameters in the 0. 5 - 20 mm range in a <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> interferometer is realized. The measurement principle is that the ball is positioned between an optical flat and a calibrated <b>gauge</b> <b>block.</b> The total length is measured in a <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> relative to the optical flat and proper measurement of the deformations due to the measuring force. The parallelism is adjusted while viewing the interference patterns on the <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> and the optical flat. The measuring force can be varied in the 0. 03 - 2. 35 N range. The applied force is calibrated. Experiments show that commonly used formulas to calculate the ball indentation {{as a function of}} the applied force are approximately correct; this instrument however provides a direct means to measure this dependence and to apply a proper extrapolation to zero measuring force. The design is rather compact so it will fit in commonly used <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> interferometers. The uncertainty which can be achieved is less than 0. 1 micrometer...|$|R

5000|$|An {{important}} feature of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> {{is that they can}} be joined together with very little dimensional uncertainty. The blocks are joined by a sliding process called wringing, which causes their ultra-flat surfaces to cling together. A small number of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> can be used to create accurate lengths within a wide range. By using 3 blocks from a set of 30 blocks, one may create any of the 1000 lengths from 3.000 to 3.999 mm in 0.001 mm steps (or [...]3000 to [...]3999 inches in 0.0001 inch steps). <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> were invented in 1896 by Swedish machinist Carl Edvard Johansson. [...] They are used as a reference for the calibration of measuring equipment used in machine shops, such as micrometers, sine bars, calipers, and dial indicators (when used in an inspection role). <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> are the main means of length standardization used by industry.|$|E

40|$|AbstractGauge block {{plays an}} {{important}} role in dimensional metrology as a standard for calibration. There are several techniques to calibrate <b>gauge</b> <b>block,</b> one of which is an optical method, such as, Michelson interferometer. The interference pattern is recorded for <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> comparison. The stability of light source is important for the calibration. In this work, we developed a reliable constant current control circuit of 7 mW laser diode for the <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> interferometer with a closed-loop feedback temperature control, which utilized the advantage of an embedded system. A PID controller was used to maintain the temperature at 25. 0 °C within ± 0. 5 °C of uncertainty. We tested the system for 60 minutes by monitoring the stability of the laser wavelength. The results showed that the wavelength of the laser was unstable during the first 20 minutes before becoming constant at 655. 525 nm...|$|R
50|$|Angles are {{measured}} using a sine bar {{with the help}} of <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> and a dial gauge or a spirit level. The aim of a measurement is to measure the surface on which the dial gauge or spirit level is placed horizontally. For example, to measure the angle of a wedge, the wedge is placed on a horizontal table. The sine bar is placed over the inclined surface of the wedge. At this position, the top surface of the sine bar is inclined the same amount as the wedge. Using <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks,</b> the top surface is made horizontal. The sine of the angle of inclination of the wedge is the ratio of the height of the <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> used and the distance between the centers of the cylinders.|$|E

5000|$|Tungsten carbide is {{a common}} {{material}} used {{in the manufacture of}} <b>gauge</b> <b>blocks,</b> used as a system for producing precision lengths in dimensional metrology.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{consider}} {{this is that the}} real value often has the characteristics of an irrational number. In real-world measuring situations, improving the measurement technique will eventually begin yielding unpredictable least significant digits. For example, a 1-inch long <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> will measure to be exactly 1 inch long until the measuring techniques reach a certain degree of precision. As techniques improve beyond this threshold, it will become clear that 1 inch is not the real value of the <b>gauge</b> <b>block</b> length, but some other number approximates it.|$|R

50|$|In use, {{the blocks}} {{are removed from}} the set, cleaned of their {{protective}} coating (petroleum jelly or oil) and wrung {{together to form a}} stack of the required dimension. <b>Gauge</b> <b>blocks</b> are calibrated to be accurate at 68 F and should be kept at this temperature when taking measurements. This mitigates the effects of thermal expansion.
