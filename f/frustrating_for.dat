5|$|Game {{designer}} Roberta Williams, {{co-founder of}} Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the Phantasmagoria gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive {{so it would}} be more accessible and less <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from Computer Gaming World, the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.|$|E
5|$|The 1966–67 season proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> United, {{despite the}} {{introduction}} of another club great {{in the form of}} Eddie Gray. Leeds finished fourth, five points behind champions Manchester United, and exited the FA Cup at the semi-finals after defeat to Chelsea. They made progress in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, beating DWS (Netherlands), Valencia, Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the final, where they were beaten 2–0 on aggregate by Yugoslavian outfit Dinamo Zagreb. At {{the end of the season}} he was named as the Footballer of the Year, succeeding his brother who had won it the previous year. During the award ceremony he told a number of amusing stories and won a standing ovation from the crowd, this started him on a successful sideline as an after-dinner speaker.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{season was}} <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> the midfielder, who was sidelined {{for two months}} by knee and head {{injuries}} and first considered retirement in April 2005. Although Juventus won Serie A titles that year and in 2006, the titles were revoked after the Calciopoli match fixing scandal. After the 2005–06 season, which ended with Juventus' relegation from Serie A despite its first-place finish, many stars (such as Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram) left the club and the remaining players' future was uncertain. After the 2006 World Cup, Nedvěd dispelled rumours about his departure by reiterating his desire to help Juventus regain promotion to Serie A, citing {{his family and his}} commitment to the club as reasons for his decision. He received a five-match ban after a red card against Genoa in December 2006, and repeated his threat to retire. However, he remained with the club {{until the end of the}} season and scored 11 league goals in the 2006–07 Serie B.|$|E

5|$|While the Ordainers {{were at work}} {{drafting}} their reform document, Edward {{decided to}} address {{one of the main}} causes behind the discontent: the Scottish situation. Edward II had, almost immediately after his accession, abandoned the relentless Scottish campaigns of his father. As a result, Robert the Bruce had been able to regain the initiative in the war, reconquer lost territory, and stage destructive raids into the north of England. To aggravate matters, Edward had continued to raise extortionate taxes, ostensibly for the war in Scotland, but without showing any result. If the King could produce victory against the Scots, this {{would go a long way}} towards undermining the work of the Ordainers. In June, the King summoned the magnates for a military campaign, but most of the Ordainers refused on the basis of the work they were performing. When the King departed for Scotland in September, only Gloucester, Warenne and Gaveston among the earls accompanied him. The campaign proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Edward, when Bruce refused to engage in open battle, or even get involved in negotiations. In February, Gaveston was sent with an army north from Roxburgh to Perth, but he failed to track down the Scottish army.|$|E
25|$|The {{return of}} cricket proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Park {{particularly}} in 1948 when {{they failed to}} win a single game all season and ended up finishing bottom of the table.|$|E
25|$|But {{the last}} day was to prove curiously <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> a crowd of 22,000.

25|$|The mining {{industry}} {{had fallen into}} severe neglect in {{the first decades of}} the century, however. Many mines had been abandoned and flooded. During the years following independence, efforts to revive the industry were generally <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> both domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Effort after effort was abandoned because of civil disturbances, lack of transportation, and poor health conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{cultures}} that value outspokenness and overt confidence, shyness can {{be perceived as}} weakness. To an unsympathetic observer, a shy individual may be mistaken as cold, distant, arrogant or aloof, which can be <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> the shy individual. However, in other cultures, shy people {{may be perceived as}} being thoughtful, intelligent, as being good listeners, and as being more likely to think before they speak.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{introduction}} of the DVD, some high budget films include the simultaneous option of both subtitles and/or dubbing. Often in such cases, the translations are made separately, rather than the subtitles being a verbatim transcript of the dubbed scenes of the film. While this allows for the smoothest possible flow of the subtitles, it can be <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> someone attempting to learn a foreign language.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Frustrated</b> <b>for</b> {{being unable}} to harm the JSA, Degaton uses his time-traveling {{abilities}} to [...] "watch life hurting enemies". Sequentially confronting the JSA members, he tells them that he saw them die, and reveals some hints on their final moments. Now equipped with a time disc, Degaton {{has the ability to}} live [...] "between seconds", apparently ageless in an intangible state, which he can only be removed from with the concentrated tachyons found in the hourglass of Hourman.|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} {{was mixed}} to positive, with reviewers praising the film for its objective illumination of cultural issues {{in relation to}} gender status in Indonesia. Many reviewers praised the film for its potential as an educational tool within Bali {{as well as in}} Western classrooms. Critics of the film believed it to be too narrow in its focus. Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, “Intriguing enough in what it shows, Bitter Honey nonetheless <b>frustrates</b> <b>for</b> what it doesn’t.” ...|$|R
25|$|On January 26, 2010, Hill {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the St. Louis Cardinals with an invite to Spring training. General Manager John Mozeliak said that Hill was recovered from his surgery and was expected {{to compete for the}} fifth starter job. Hill struggled in spring training games, which was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> him and he was beaten out by Jaime García in the battle for the fifth starter spot.|$|E
25|$|On 13 February, Rovers {{played their}} next {{pre-season}} friendly against First Division side, Monaghan United {{in front of}} a crowd of just 400. Just before the break, Rovers were brought down to 10 men when Dean Kelly was sent off. Then, just 3 minutes {{before the end of the}} game, Conor McCormack was sent off. The game ended in a draw. A lot of chances for Rovers made the game very <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Rovers. The man of the match was Dan Murray.|$|E
25|$|Work on the jet-powered {{propeller}} proved <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Wittgenstein, who {{had very}} little experience working with machinery. Jim Bamber, a British engineer who was his friend and classmate at the time, reported that “when things went wrong, which often occurred, he would throw his arms around, stomp about, and swear volubly in German.” According to William Eccles, another friend from that period, Wittgenstein then turned to more theoretical work, focusing {{on the design of}} the propeller — a problem that required relatively sophisticated mathematics.|$|E

5000|$|Dustin Hucks, for Ain't It Cool News, wrote [...] "Love can {{at times}} get very broad with scenes, dialogue, and flow… if you’re keen on clarity and the linear, Love {{is going to}} leave you <b>frustrated.</b> <b>For</b> others, however - the {{challenge}} of understanding what is what may lead to a desire for repeat viewings, which for me - is a lot of fun… This is a film that’s clearly not for everyone - but has a lot to offer the Inception and Moon crowds." ...|$|R
5000|$|Relations {{with the}} E&GR became {{difficult}} at this stage, and a start on construction was <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> some time. In the interval the Slamannan Railway {{and the other}} [...] "coal railways" [...] in west Central Scotland changed their gauge from 4 ft 6 in to standard gauge (4 ft 8½ in) in July 1847, and they merged, forming the Monkland Railways on 14 August 1848. The powers to build the Slamannan and Borrowstounness Railway were transferred to the Monkland Railways at the same time.|$|R
25|$|For a short time, under Captain Josiah Myrick, Shoshone carried {{miners and}} their {{equipment}} from Olds Ferry to the mining areas around Boise. The mining traffic {{then took a}} different route, {{and there was no}} business for the Shoshone. She was laid up for three years, with only two watchmen keeping an eye on her. This was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> O.S.N. which had enjoyed spectacular success with almost all of its boats, often earning more on a single trip than it had cost (generally not long before) to build the steamboat in the first place.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the work}} on the Redstone rocket, the 12 years from 1945 to 1957 were {{probably}} some of the most <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> von Braun and his colleagues. In the Soviet Union, Sergei Korolev and his team of scientists and engineers plowed ahead with several new rocket designs and the Sputnik program, while the American government was not very interested in von Braun's work or views and only embarked on a very modest rocket-building program. In the meantime, the press tended to dwell on von Braun's past {{as a member of the}} SS and the slave labor used to build his V-2 rockets.|$|E

He opened the innings with skipper Cook on the second day, and top-scored with 40 runs in a {{generally}} composed innings. In the second Test, in Adelaide, Carberry scored 60, his maiden Test half-century. Even though {{the remainder of the}} tour was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> Carberry, as he was unable to convert a number of good starts into significant scores, he did finish the Ashes series with the third highest English batting average, above the likes of Root, Bell and Cook.|$|E

2500|$|Pseudobulbar affect [...] (PBA), or {{emotional}} incontinence, {{is a type}} of emotional disturbance characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays. PBA occurs secondary to a neurologic disorder or brain injury. Patients may find themselves crying uncontrollably at something that is only moderately sad, being unable to stop themselves for several minutes. Episodes may also be mood-incongruent: a patient may laugh uncontrollably when angry or <b>frustrated,</b> <b>for</b> example. Sometimes, the episodes may switch between emotional states, resulting in the patient crying uncontrollably when having sex.|$|R
50|$|Alan Camp {{has written}} a book on eugenics, and is looking to prove his theories. His sister, Edith Goodhue, and her husband, Gilbert have been <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> years with their {{inability}} to have children. Alan convinces them to let him to create a child through eugenics for them to adopt. Chosen to be the parents of this eugenic child are Joe Garvin, who happens to be Alan's chauffeur, and Nora, the Goodhues' maid. The two are offered $15,000 each if they conceive and deliver a child within twelve months, to which they agree.|$|R
25|$|People with {{executive}} dysfunction have {{a slower}} cognitive processing speed and thus often {{take longer to}} complete tasks than people who demonstrate typical executive function capabilities. This can be <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> the individual and can serve to impede academic progress. Disorders affecting children such as ADHD, along with oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, high functioning autism and Tourette’s syndrome have all been suggested to involve executive functioning deficits. The main focus of current research has been on working memory, planning, set shifting, inhibition, and fluency. This research suggests that differences exist between typically functioning, matched controls and clinical groups, on measures of executive functioning.|$|E
25|$|The war was <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> both sides. Both sides {{tried to}} invade the other and were repulsed. The American high command {{remained}} incompetent until the last year. The American militia proved ineffective because the soldiers were reluctant to leave home and efforts to invade Canada repeatedly failed. The British blockade ruined American commerce, bankrupted the Treasury, and further angered New Englanders, who smuggled supplies to Britain. The Americans under General William Henry Harrison finally gained naval control of Lake Erie and defeated the Indians under Tecumseh in Canada, while Andrew Jackson ended the Indian threat in the Southeast. The Indian threat to expansion into the Midwest was permanently ended. The British invaded and occupied much of Maine.|$|E
25|$|Nonetheless, on March 1, 1970, von Braun and {{his family}} {{relocated}} to Washington, DC, when he was assigned the post of NASA's Deputy Associate Administrator for Planning at NASA Headquarters. After a series of conflicts associated with the truncation of the Apollo program, and facing severe budget constraints, von Braun retired from NASA on May 26, 1972. Not only had it become evident by this time that NASA and his visions for future U.S. space flight projects were incompatible, but also it was perhaps even more <b>frustrating</b> <b>for</b> him to see popular support for a continued presence of man in space wane dramatically once the goal to reach the Moon had been accomplished.|$|E
50|$|The lyrics {{tell the}} story of an actor at young age that gets a role that makes him very famous, and life {{eventually}} provides him with everything an artist could wish. However, he didn't make a life for himself, and he decides to give that role to someone else and start a new life. In another interview, Kakko, gave a different version of his end, stating the character was <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> having nobody to share his achievements with and he ultimately decides to search for someone, who he eventually finds.|$|R
50|$|THR {{was able}} to make money by {{supplying}} parts for YEC locomotives and carrying out repairs and maintenance work. The THR service department now had two full-time representatives on the road selling parts and service agreements. The sudden addition of around 700 locomotives to the potential market in the UK provided a great boost, although <b>frustrated</b> <b>for</b> some years by a policy laid down by Rolls-Royce that THR must supply diesel engine spares only for Sentinel and Vanguard locos and refer all Yorkshire locomotive users to Cripps (the Rolls-Royce main distributor) for engine parts.|$|R
