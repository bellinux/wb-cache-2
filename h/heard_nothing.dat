With the death of Emmanuel's son in 1734, no close male relatives remained to succeed the Prince. His closest relative, therefore, was Louis Thomas's unmarried daughter, Princess Maria Anna Victoria of Savoy, whom Eugene had never met and, as he had <b>heard</b> <b>nothing</b> but bad of her, made no effort to do so.|$|E

For weeks, the Qing court had <b>heard</b> <b>nothing,</b> and then the news finally came. The Emperor was shocked and ordered an immediate halt to all military actions until he could decide what next to do. Generals returning from the front line cautioned {{that there was no}} way Burma could be conquered. But there was no real choice but to press on. Imperial prestige was at stake.|$|E

An SOS signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area, among them were HMS Scourge and HMS Heroic, but Britannic <b>heard</b> <b>nothing</b> in reply; unknown to either Bartlett or the ship's wireless operator, {{the force of the}} first explosion had caused the aerial communication wires slung between the ship's masts to snap. This meant that although the ship could still send out transmissions by wireless, she could no longer receive them.|$|E

25|$|Arnold disliked {{infantry}} troop {{duties and}} volunteered to assist Capt. Arthur S. Cowan of the 20th Infantry, {{who was on}} temporary assignment in the Philippines mapping the island of Luzon. Cowan returned to the United States following completion of the cartography detail, transferred to the Signal Corps, and was assigned to recruit two lieutenants to become pilots. Cowan contacted Arnold, who cabled his interest in also transferring to the Signal Corps but <b>heard</b> <b>nothing</b> in reply for two years. In June 1909, the 29th Infantry relocated to Fort Jay, New York, and en route to his new duty station by way of Paris, France, Arnold saw his first airplane in flight, piloted by Louis Blériot. In 1911, Arnold applied for transfer to the Ordnance Department because it offered an immediate promotion to first lieutenant. While awaiting {{the results of the}} required competitive examination, he learned that his interest in aeronautics had not been forgotten.|$|E

His literary assets at death were valued at £5,007. Though Keable received a Protestant burial in Papeete, some accounts suggest {{that in the last}} weeks of his life he formally converted to Catholicism. Other commentators suggest the pagan sentiments he expressed about the birth of his new son as a riposte to social convention tend to indicate otherwise. Hugh Cecil argues that, at his death, Keable most likely just became [...] "able to reconcile his two ideals, romantic-erotic and religious, and could die peacefully accepting the rituals he loved." ...|$|E

[...] Foraker was impatient with McKinley's policy towards Spain, decrying the President's State of the Union communication to Congress in December 1897 and his so-called [...] "war message", which some deemed insufficiently bellicose, in April 1898.

On July 1, at Hitler's behest, Theodor Eicke, Commandant of the Dachau concentration camp, and his SS adjutant Michel Lippert visited Röhm. Once inside Röhm's cell, they {{handed him a}} Browning pistol loaded with a single bullet {{and told him he}} had ten minutes to kill himself or they would do it for him.

[...] Having <b>heard</b> <b>nothing</b> in the allotted time, they returned to Röhm's cell at 14:50 to find him standing, with his bare chest puffed out in a gesture of defiance. Eicke and Lippert then shot Röhm, killing him. In 1957, the German authorities tried Lippert in Munich for Röhm's murder. Until then, Lippert {{had been one of the}} few executioners of the purge to evade trial. Lippert was convicted and sentenced to 18 months in prison.|$|E

[...] As second-in-command of Prince of Wales, Dewar was present for part of the naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign against the Turkish positions. [...] Following aborted attempts to lend heavy-gunfire support to the troops at ANZAC Cove, Dewar wrote an unofficial memo to the Rear-Admiral commanding the Eastern Mediterranean Squadron, with suggestions for the employment of indirect fire to attack Turkish targets. [...] Dewar <b>heard</b> <b>nothing</b> of his proposals, and it was not until November, 1915 that indirect fire was used with good effect by the bulged cruiser Edgar. [...] Following the campaign, in October Dewar was given command of HM Gunnery School, Devonport.

500|$|In {{the early}} hours of January 15, 1978—one week after his arrival in Tallahassee—Bundy entered FSU's Chi Omega {{sorority}} house through a rear door with a faulty locking mechanism. Beginning at about 2:45a.m. he bludgeoned Margaret Bowman, 21, with a piece of oak firewood as she slept, then garroted her with a nylon stocking. He then entered the bedroom of 20-year-old Lisa Levy and beat her unconscious, strangled her, tore one of her nipples, bit deeply into her left buttock, and sexually assaulted her with a hair mist bottle. In an adjoining bedroom he attacked Kathy Kleiner, breaking her jaw and deeply lacerating her shoulder; and Karen Chandler, who suffered a concussion, broken jaw, loss of teeth, and a crushed finger. Tallahassee detectives later determined that the four attacks took place in a total of less than 15 minutes, within earshot of more than 30 witnesses who <b>heard</b> <b>nothing.</b> After leaving the sorority house Bundy broke into a basement apartment eight blocks away and attacked FSU student Cheryl Thomas, dislocating her shoulder and fracturing her jaw and skull in five places. She was left with permanent deafness, and equilibrium damage that ended her dance career.

Markham's reply was a non-committal one-line acknowledgement, after which Bruce <b>heard</b> <b>nothing</b> for a year. He was then told, indirectly, {{to apply for a}} scientific assistant's post. On 21 March 1900 Bruce reminded Markham that he had applied a year earlier, and went on to reveal that he [...] "was not without hopes of being able to raise sufficient capital whereby I could take out a second British ship". He followed this up a few days later, and reported that the funding for a second ship was now assured, making his first explicit references to a [...] "Scottish Expedition". This alarmed Markham, who replied with some anger: [...] "Such a course will be most prejudicial to the Expedition A second ship is not in the least required I do not know why this mischievous rivalry should have been started". Bruce replied by return, denying rivalry, and asserting: [...] "If my friends are prepared to give me money to carry out my plans I do not see why I should not accept it [...] there are several who maintain that a second ship is highly desirable". Unappeased, Markham wrote back: [...] "As I was doing my best to get you appointed (to the National Antarctic Expedition) I had a right to think you would not take such a step without at least consulting me". He continued: [...] "You will cripple the National Expedition [...] in order to get up a scheme for yourself".|$|E

Bettis was surprised and went over to Lind's house, where he warmly received the new recorded version of the song. It had a different arrangement from the demo version, and the arrangement was done by composer Rob Mounsey who rearranged the original track and added the background vocals. Bettis said: [...] "We owe a big debt of gratitude to [...] He really made a hit record out of [...]" [...] Mounsey was introduced in the project by record producer John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez who was producing [...] "Crazy for You".
