5|$|While at the discothèque, De Simone and Savage were {{together}} throughout the evening, and DeSimone did not consume any alcoholic drinks. They left the night club together, and Savage <b>drove</b> DeSimone {{back to the}} Tom Tackle car park, arriving sometime between 00:30 and 01:00 (12:30 and 1:00a.m.) on 5December. Savage testified that she <b>drove</b> into the covered parking area and that they sat chatting {{for a while before}} DeSimone made the short walk to her car, at which point Savage reversed out and <b>drove</b> away from the scene. Savage was the last witness to see DeSimone before she was killed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Rachael {{worked out of}} the ABC Sale office in Victoria. She met her ex-husband, John Treasure, in 1996 while a {{reporter}} and started helping John and his brother with their High Plains <b>Droving</b> horse riding business on weekends. This entailed taking tourists on their cattle <b>droving</b> and salting trips on the Dargo High Plains. The Treasure family has been <b>droving</b> cattle in this area since the 1870s.|$|R
25|$|A 1928 Royal Commission {{into the}} price of beef in Western Australia led to the repair of the wells and the {{re-opening}} of the stock route. Around 20 <b>droves</b> took place between 1931 and 1959 when the final <b>droving</b> run was completed.|$|R
5|$|Brynn <b>drove</b> to {{the home}} of her friend Ron Douglas and confessed to the killing, but {{initially}} he did not believe her. The pair <b>drove</b> back to the house in separate cars, and Brynn called another friend and confessed a second time. Upon seeing Hartman's body, Douglas called 911 at 6:20a.m. Police subsequently arrived and escorted Douglas and the Hartmans' two children from the premises, by which time Brynn had locked herself in the bedroom and committed suicide by shooting herself in the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{was lucky}} to escape from a crash in the Masaryk Grand Prix. He and Chiron were chasing Fagioli when Fagioli crashed into a wooden footbridge, {{bringing}} it crashing down onto the road. Caracciola and Chiron <b>drove</b> into a ditch {{at the side of}} the road to avoid the debris; while Chiron <b>drove</b> out of the ditch and was able to continue, Caracciola <b>drove</b> into a tree and retired. Despite this accident, Caracciola again performed strongly in the Hillclimbing Championship; he won eight climbs in his SSKL to take the title. Perhaps his most significant achievement of 1931 was his win in the Mille Miglia. The local fleet of Alfa Romeos battled for the lead early in the race, but when they fell back Caracciola was able to take control. His win, in record time, made him and his co-driver Wilhelm Sebastian (who allowed Caracciola to drive the entire race) the first foreigners to win the Italian race. The only other foreigners to win the race on the full course were Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in 1955.|$|E

Foust <b>drove</b> a 2010 Dodge Challenger while Wood rode as a passenger. The advertisement showed Foust drifting around the environment and ended with a top-down shot of the pad.
