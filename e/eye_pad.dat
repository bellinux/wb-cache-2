40|$|Lifting is an {{essential}} part of almost every offshore operation, which includes a variation of structures with different sizes, shapes and weights. To ensure safe lifting operations, lifting equipment must be utilized. Among these lifting equipment, <b>pad</b> <b>eyes</b> and shackles play a significant role. These <b>pad</b> <b>eyes</b> must have high safety, reliability and appropriate costs. To test and analyze the capacity of <b>pad</b> <b>eyes,</b> traditional checking methods, such as laboratory testing are usually used, which can be exhausting, time-consuming and somewhat expensive. Therefore, a simpler, equally precise, less time consuming and more cost effective would be a proper alternative solution. This alternative approach to the traditional checking methods would be the FE simulation software, Abaqus/CAE. The purpose of this thesis is to compare the FE simulation results of the capacity of the <b>pad</b> <b>eyes,</b> with the experimental and theoretical results of the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> capacity obtained from the previous study “Offshore Hook-up Project Management”[1]. To conduct the simulation analyses of the design load capacity of <b>pad</b> <b>eyes,</b> several tests had to be made. Theses tests included different pinhole sizes in the <b>pad</b> <b>eyes,</b> different strain directions of <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> pinholes, and different loads that acted on the <b>pad</b> <b>eyes.</b> The purpose of this is to check the importance of following the requirements given in related standards. Each of the simulation tests that were carried out in two different cases. The first case was when the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> was without a plate, while the second was when the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> was firmly welded to a base plate. The purpose of this was to see how the addition of the plate to the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> affected the load capacity of the <b>pad</b> <b>eyes.</b> The results that were obtained showed that the addition of the plate to the <b>pad</b> <b>eyes</b> increased the capacity of the <b>pad</b> <b>eyes.</b> They further showed that the larger the pinhole size, the less capacity the <b>pad</b> <b>eye</b> had, which indicates the importance of following standard’s requirements. It was also observed that a reduction of the load capacity was recognized for angled loading relative to the vertical loading case, even though theoretical capacities provide the same for both cases. Finally, when the results were compared, it revealed that some of the simulation results were close to the experimental and the theoretical results, while others were somewhat far from them. Some factors, including the uncertainty of material behavior, may have caused these deviations...|$|R

METHODS: The retrospective study included 114 eyes of 101 patients who underwent the pterygium excision combined with conjunctival transplantation from June 2012 to June 2013 in our hospital. The patients {{were divided into}} three groups according to the postoperative treatment. In group A, 30 cases(38 eyes) wore bandage contact lens; In group B, compression bandage was used in all the 33 cases(38 eyes); In group C, 38 eyes(38 cases) were covered with normal <b>eye</b> <b>pad.</b> All patients were examined 1, 3, 5 d after surgery. RESULTS:No complications such as corneal ulcer, granuloma, etc. or recurrence occurred in 114 eyes. Eye irritations in group A were less severe than {{in the other two}} groups. Postoperative repair time of corneal epithelium was shorter in group A and B than in group C. CONCLUSION: Bandage contact lens can significantly reduce the irritations after pterygium excision combined with conjunctival transplantation and promote corneal epithelium repair in the defected area.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the correlation between}} skin bilirubin (transcutaneous bilirubin: TcB) and total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels in preterm jaundice infants during phototherapy. Methods: Levels of TcB and TSB during phototherapy were measured in preterm jaundice neonates who required phototherapy during September 2011, 1 st to July 2012, 31 st in Charoenkrung Pracharak Hospital. The TcB was measured over the unexposed (TcBUE) skin underneath the <b>eye</b> <b>pad</b> (glabella region) and exposed skin (TcBE) of the forehead. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were determined. Factors possibly influencing TSB, including TcBUE and TcBE, were analysed with a stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. Factors with significant correlation with TSB were entered into the equation to obtain the predicted TSBs. The predicted TSBs derived from TcBUE and from TcBE were then compared with the actual TSB. Results: Sixty preterm infants were involved in this study. We found strong correlation between TcBUE- TSB (r= 0. 73; p-value < 0. 001) and TcBE- TSB (r= 0. 71; p-value < 0. 001). Factors which impacted the predicted TSB from TcB during phototherapy were birth weight.

Her sensitivity to sound and light meant that she had to live in a darkened room wearing <b>eye</b> <b>pads</b> and earplugs. Mirza refused to attend an appointment with a consultant immuno-pathologist at Bart's Hospital in 2000 on the grounds that she did not want to take 'conventional medicine'. As her condition continued to deteriorate, concerns were raised by numerous family members and friends that the care she was receiving from her mother was inadequate. At around the same time a referral was made to a centre specialising in the treatment of Chronic Fatigue, but Mirza turned down the placement after hearing that treatment was biased towards psychological methods and that if patients did not improve they were given a different diagnosis before being sent home. As complaints about her living conditions continued, the suggestion was made that she should be assessed under the Mental Health Act to determine what components of her issues were physical, and what psychological. Mirza refused the offer of being looked after by professional carers rather than her mother, and also rejected offers of support from the Community Mental Health Team.

To identify potential sites of OXT action via the OXT receptor (OXTR) in the newborn mouse, we performed receptor autoradiography on 20 μm sagittal sections of whole postnatal day 0 male and female mice on a C 57 BL/ 6 J background using the 125 iodinated ornithine vasotocin analog ([125 I]-OVTA) radioligand. A competitive binding assay on both wild-type (WT) and OXTR knockout (OXTR KO) tissue {{was used to assess}} the selectivity of [125 I]-OVTA for neonatal OXTR. Radioactive ligand (0. 05 nM [125 I]-OVTA) was competed against concentrations of 0 nM, 10 nM, and 1000 nM excess unlabeled OXT. Autoradiographs demonstrated the high selectivity of the radioligand for infant peripheral OXTR. Specific ligand binding activity for OXTR was observed in the oronasal cavity, the <b>eye,</b> whisker <b>pads,</b> adrenal gland, and anogenital region in the neonatal OXTR WT mouse, but was absent in neonatal OXTR KO. Nonspecific binding was observed in areas with a high lipid content such as the scapular brown adipose tissue and the liver: in these regions, binding was present in both OXTR WT and KO mice, and could not be competed away with OXT in either WT or KO mice. Collectively, these data confirm novel OXT targets in the periphery of the neonate. These peripheral OXTR sites, coupled with the immaturity of the neonate's own OXT system, suggest a role for exogenous OXT in modulating peripheral physiology and development...|$|R

Its large upright ears - {{a hallmark of the}} breed - are broad at the base and frame a long and elegant headpiece. The neck is long and lean. It has a unique front assembly with well laid-back shoulders and relatively straight upper arm. Coming in both smooth and wire-coated varieties, their coat is a combination of red and white with the nose, ears, <b>eye</b> rims, and <b>pads</b> of feet being a light tan color. Its eyes are a striking amber color and have an alert and intelligent expression. The Ibizan may range in height, depending on which Standard you follow, from 22 to 29 in and weigh from 45 to 65 lb, males being larger than females. The Ibizan Hound coat can also range from smooth to Wire. wire coats are to be hard and can range from 1-3 inches in length.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} {{the reliability and}} correlations with age of the balance components of the EPESE, NHANES, and the Good Balance Platform System (GBPS) in a normal population of adults. Design. Cross-sectional. Setting. Urban Medical Center in the Pacific. Participants. A random sample of 203 healthy offspring of Honolulu Heart Program participants, ages 38 – 71. Measurements. Subjects were examined twice at visits one week apart using the balance components of the EPESE, NHANES, and the good balance system tests. Results. The EPESE and NHANES batteries of tests were not sufficiently challenging to allow successful discrimination among subjects in good health, even older subjects. The GBPS allowed objective quantitative measurements, but the test-retest correlations generally were not high. The GBPS variables correlated with age only when subjects stood on a foam pad; they also were correlated with anthropometric variables. Conclusion. Both EPESE and NHANES balance tests were too easy for healthy subjects. The GBPS had generally low reliability coefficients except for the most difficult testing condition (foam <b>pad,</b> <b>eyes</b> closed). Both height and body fat were associated with GBPS scores, necessitating adjusting for these variables if using balance {{as a predictor of}} future health...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to the loading angle at the <b>pad</b> <b>eye,</b> the types of applied forces will affect the failure mode and the capacity of suction caisson in a soft clay seabed. In this study, a specially designed platform was used to perform model tests with different loading angles and cyclic parameters. First, the short-term static capacities and the failure modes for the typical inclined loading angles were studied, and then the influences of cyclic amplitude, number of cycles and cyclic period on the subsequent failure mode, and caisson capacity were investigated by applying a series of one-way cyclic loadings. The experimental results showed that when the loading angle decreases from 50. 2 ° to 32. 0 °, the model caisson’s failure mode changes to a combined mode consisting vertical motion, horizontal motion, and anticlockwise rotation, and its corresponding capacity noticeably increases. However, the increases in amplitude, number, and frequency of the previous cyclic loadings would turn this combined failure into a dominant vertical pullout and reduce its capacity to some degree. Therefore, {{the influence of the}} previous cyclic loadings should be taken into account to accurately estimate the holding capacity of the suction caisson. Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the suppressive {{effects of a}} chymase inhibitor (CI) on conjunctival scarring in a canine model of symblepharon induced by alkali burns. Methods: Symblepharon models were made in beagle <b>eyes.</b> A cotton <b>pad</b> soaked in 1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) {{was placed in the}} conjunctival sac of each eye for 90 seconds, followed by washing the sac with 100 ml of physiological saline. Immediately post treatment, one eye drop (50 μl) including 1 mM-CI or the vehicle (CI-treated group and vehicle-treated group, respectively) was instilled in 5 eyes of 5 beagles once daily for 5 weeks. Fellow eyes were left untreated and served as the normal group. The severity of symblepharon was graded by macroscopic observation. After the eyes were enucleated, conjunctival and scleral tissue specimens were histologically evaluated. Results: Macroscopic observation revealed that symblepharon was induced in all NaOH-treated eyes, while symblepharon scores were significantly lower in the CI group than in the vehicle-treated group. Histological observation indicated a significant reduction in the adhered area in the CI-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated group. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that vimentin-, α-smooth muscle actin-, chymase-, and angiotensin II-positive cells as well as mast cells increased in the vehicle-treated group compared to the normal group, whereas they were reduced in the CI-treated group. Conclusions: Our macroscopic and histological findings indicated that a multiple application of CI eye drops suppressed conjunctival scarring in a canine symblepharon model, suggesting that the topical application of CI may be a promising therapy for symblepharon...|$|R
