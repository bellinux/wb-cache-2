The development, nature of and rationale for the scheme are discussed. Results to a survey of household heads in villages in the neighborhood of state forests in the Midnapore region of West Bengal are reported. The survey provides information about the dependence of villagers on forest resources, the sustainability of current forest use as perceived by villagers, and reports their views about forest management issues, including the <b>Joint</b> Forest <b>Management</b> Scheme. The concerns of villagers about <b>joint</b> forest <b>management</b> are identified and analyzed. It is suggested that some writers have been too ready to promote the sustainability and social welfare benefits of <b>joint</b> forest <b>management</b> as now practiced. Some of its important limitations are identified. While it is preferable to open-access, the system in India is as yet deficient in terms of communal and social management...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: India has {{embarked}} upon a community involvement process to restock the state-owned forests through a recent approach called <b>Joint</b> Forest <b>Management.</b> But {{the success of}} the <b>Joint</b> Forest <b>Management</b> program lies in the provision of alternative livelihoods to woodcutters and grazers. This article presents how the forest department of a southern state of India devised a potent tool of microfinance promotion for weaning those who are dependent on the forest by implementing a massive externally aided <b>Joint</b> Forest <b>Management</b> Project. Based on a study of 27 program villages in the Tamilnadu state, this paper proves that the success of <b>Joint</b> Forest <b>Management</b> is dependent on and directly linked to the provision of microfinance to villagers through a people’s representative body—the Village Forest Council. The forest department was suc-cessful in this unusual task of promoting microfinance even in villages where formal microfinance institutions have failed, which corroborates an earlier find-ing that microfinance is more workable and successful if it is properly packaged in a locally suitable development program...|$|R

25|$|Following his report, Pilkington {{prompted}} {{the government to}} impose a levy on ITV's revenue, the effects of which were heightened by a recession in 1970 when revenue had declined by 12percent in real terms. Despite a reduction of the levy, Tyne Tees {{was one of the}} contractors facing collapse. To ensure Tyne Tees' survival, the ITA allowed it to affiliate with Yorkshire Television under a <b>joint</b> <b>management</b> company named 'Trident Television'. The third 'prong' of Trident was intended to be Anglia Television, but the IBA ruled out their involvement. Trident Television was formed in March 1969 as a joint venture to sell advertisements for Tyne Tees and Yorkshire. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees then came under Trident's ownership on 1 January 1974. For the first time, one company owned two distinct and separate ITV franchises although the new company was dominated by the larger, stronger Yorkshire whose shareholders owned 71.5percent of the new company. Trident had sales offices in London, where most agencies are located and where most advertising is bought and sold.|$|E
25|$|The first {{rules were}} created in 1970. The {{original}} six Common Market members realised that four countries applying to join the Common Market at that time (Britain, Ireland, Denmark including Greenland, and Norway) would control the richest fishing grounds in the world. The original six therefore drew up Council Regulation 2141/70 giving all Members equal access to all fishing waters, even though the Treaty of Rome did not explicitly include fisheries in its agriculture chapter. This was adopted {{on the morning of}} 30 June 1970, a few hours before the applications to join were officially received. This ensured that the regulations became part of the acquis communautaire before the new members joined, obliging them to accept the regulation. In its accession negotiations, the UK at first refused to accept the rules {{but by the end of}} 1971 the UK gave way and signed the Accession Treaty on 22 January 1972, thereby bringing into the CFP <b>joint</b> <b>management</b> an estimated four fifths of all the fish off Western Europe.

40|$|Decentralization {{initiatives}} are on-going {{in many developing}} countries. In Burkina Faso, the government {{has embarked on a}} long-term decentralization effort that groups rural villages into self-governing communes with the capacity to plan their own development programs. Nearly two decades before this process, a system of <b>joint</b> forest <b>management</b> was introduced. The new form of administrative decentralization has impacted on <b>joint</b> forest <b>management.</b> This study sought {{to examine the effects of}} decentralization on <b>joint</b> forest <b>management</b> and the livelihoods of the rural poor. Information was obtained through semi-structured interviews, interviews with local forestry officials, direct observation, and by reviewing existing literature. The results indicated that administrative decentralization brings legality to <b>joint</b> forest <b>management,</b> which was already legitimated by local people. In return, <b>joint</b> forest <b>management</b> generates benefits to local people through socio-economic infrastructure, wood and non-wood forest products, to the local government through tax collection systems, and to the forest through some extent improved ecological sustainability. There were shortcomings however, such as land tenure insecurity, low local organizational capacity; lack of transparency in the wood fuel market, low level of diversification of the sources of revenue and weakness of local institution to implement their functions. Thus, a concerted effort should be made to manage the remaining natural forests through the development of appropriate strategies to empower local communities to manage and benefit from forest resources through the new arrangements for administrative decentralization. Caution is needed regarding transparency, financial and technical incentives and long-term commitment from the central government...|$|R
