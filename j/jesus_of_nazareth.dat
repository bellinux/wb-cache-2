5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} that <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth</b> never existed; or if he did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels. Stories of Jesus' birth, along with other key events, have so many mythic elements that some scholars have suggested that Jesus himself was a myth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi and <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth</b> {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only weapon that is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet. Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth</b> over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.|$|E
5|$|Tourism {{is a major}} industry, {{estimated}} in 2001 to support around 23,000 people.

The town of Glastonbury has mythical associations, including legends of a visit by the young <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth</b> and Joseph of Arimathea, with links to the Holy Grail, King Arthur, and Camelot, identified by some as Cadbury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort. Glastonbury also gives its name to an annual open-air rock festival held in nearby Pilton.

5|$|Films {{in which}} Richardson {{appeared}} in the later 1970s and early 1980s include Rollerball (1975), The Man in the Iron Mask (1977), Dragonslayer (1981) in which he played a wizard and Time Bandits (1981) in which he played the Supreme Being. In 1983 he was seen as Pfordten in Tony Palmer's Wagner; this was a film of enormous length, starring Richard Burton as Richard Wagner and was noted at the time, and subsequently, for the cameo roles of three conspiratorial courtiers, played by Gielgud, Olivier and Richardson – the only film in which the three played scenes together. For television, Richardson played Simeon in <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth</b> (1977), made studio recordings of No Man's Land (1978) and Early Days (1982), and was a guest in the 1981 Morecambe and Wise Christmas Show. His last radio broadcast was in 1982 in a documentary programme about Little Tich, who he had watched at the Brighton Hippodrome before the First World War.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{an event}} without precedent: that a woman, and what is more a “sinful woman,” becomes a “disciple” of Christ.

40|$|This article {{presents}} in broad outline the theological concept of deep incarnation and brings it into dialogue with correlative ideas of deep history and deep sociality. It will {{be argued that}} neither Christology, nor evolution, can be properly understood from a chronocentric perspective. Evolution is not only about development {{but also about the}} exploration of ecospace. Likewise, a contemporary Christology should explicate incarnation as a divine assumption of the full ecospace of the material world of creation. It will then be argued that an interactionist view of deep history is preferable to the evolutionary cognitive theory of religion (ECTR). Against this background, the paper will explore <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth’s</b> role in the context of post-axial mentalities...|$|R

The wooden image of Christ, by unknown artist, in a Renaissance-style representation of the Ecce Homo, represents the episode <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> <b>of</b> <b>Nazareth's</b> life when the martyred religious figure was presented to the crowd following his whipping, and includes a crown of thorns, uncovered torso and bruised/beaten body.

Christian theology holds that the Holy Spirit helps believers in the [...] "mortification of the sins {{of the flesh}}."

40|$|In {{addition}} to his renowned musical output, Richard Wagner produced a logorrhoeic prose oeuvre, including a dramatic sketch of the last weeks of the life <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> Christ entitled Jesus von Nazareth. Though drafted in 1848 - 1849, it was published only posthumously, and has therefore been somewhat neglected in the otherwise voluminous Wagnerian literature. This thesis first examines the origins <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> von <b>Nazareth</b> amidst the climate of revolution wherein it was conceived, ascertaining its place within Wagner’s own internal development and amongst the radical thinkers who influenced it. While Ludwig Feuerbach has traditionally been seen as {{the most prominent of}} these, this thesis examines Wagner’s sources more broadly. The thesis then summarizes and analyzes Jesus von Nazareth itself, particularly in terms of Wagner’s use of biblical scripture. The thesis demonstrates how his not infrequent misuse thereof constitutes one way in which Wagner transmogrifies Jesus as mutable lens through which his own ideology of social revolution is reflected. It also attempts to provide a critical assessment of the relative dramatic merits <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> von <b>Nazareth</b> and looks into Wagner’s ultimate decision not to complete the work. The thesis then briefly summarizes the changes that occurred in Wagner’s mature Christological outlook subsequent to his drafting <b>of</b> <b>Jesus</b> von <b>Nazareth,</b> attempting to concisely demonstrate some developments beyond Wagner’s well-known encounter with the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. The thesis concludes with an evaluation <b>of</b> how <b>Jesus</b> von <b>Nazareth</b> informed Wagner’s general religious outlook {{and the extent to which}} this worldview is a productive one...|$|R
