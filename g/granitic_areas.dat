Optimal complex formation was reached in 1 h at 209 / 1 8 C and was slightly favoured when developed in daylight. The formation rate declined with decreasing reaction temperature and no influence of any of the competitive anions tested (at concentrations usually found in natural waters of <b>granitic</b> <b>areas)</b> was noted.

The other two wells further north at Ayete and Tapa were characterised by lower yield that is[*]<[*] 60  m 3 /day. High groundwater yield at Idere is attributable to topographic effect (Fig.  11 d) and nearness to fracture and rock contact zones (Fig.  9). The elevations of wells at Idere are both[*]>[*] 200  m, whereas the wells’ elevations at Tapa and Ayete are[*]<[*] 160  m (Table  3). Conversely, the possibilities of siting bedrock aquifers are rare on granitic terrain due to paucity of fractures. Nonetheless, from the good yield of the mainly regolith aquifers at elevated granitic terrains, the groundwater prospect is fair.

Therefore, the sustainability of the weathered-regolith aquifers in <b>granitic</b> <b>areas</b> to a large extent depends on the climatic conditions. Also, the likelihood of contamination of groundwater from surface effluent is high in granitic terrains, since the aquifer system is mainly the saprolite.

Therefore, the knowledge of radon concentrations inside the houses (where people stay longer) is important {{from the point of}} view of radiological protection. The main goal of this study was to assess the radon concentration in an area previously identified with a potentially high level of residential radon.

The radon concentration in studied dwellings, ranged between 75 and 7640 Bq m(- 3), with a geometric mean of 640 Bq m(- 3) and an arithmetic mean of 1078 Bq m(- 3). Based on a local winter-summer radon concentration variation model, these values would correspond to an annual average concentration of 860 Bq m(- 3). Several factors contribute to this large dispersion, the main one being the exact location of housing construction in relation to the geochemical nature of the soil and others the predominant building material and ventilation.

An initial study used the gamma-spectrometric data of the Serra do Mar Sul AerogeophysicalProject, performed during the 70 ’s for CPRM. Later, terrestrial gamma-spectrometric surveys focused on the study of the differentiatedJoaquim Murtinho Granite (JMG) in the NW corner of CGC, and the Serra do Carambeí Granite, to the SW. In this paper,the results obtained for JMG are presented in two parts. The fi rst deals with methodology and the presentation of several gamma-spectrometric“color-scale” maps, indicating that results obtained in granites depend strongly on a climatic factor, given the mobility of Kduring weathering in subtropical climates with strong rainfalls, also favoring a greater mobility of U. Minerals that are U and Th hosts,documented in granites, are reviewed, together with the weathering processes that control the mobility of K, U and Th in soils. StrongK signals in <b>granitic</b> <b>areas</b> submitted to these climates document the presence of fresh rock and/or effects of hydrothermal alteration,while weak or nil signals are evidence of strong leaching of K during weathering. U and Th will be retained in the residual soils, in partleading to their selective enrichment, also coupled with soil migration to lower topographic levels by colluvial transport. The larger solubilityof U (as uranyl ion) allows its liberation under oxidizing conditions, and its migration, limited by the possibility of absorptionin newly formed mineral and organic soil phases.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, 1979 Previous {{vegetation}} {{studies on}} granitic soils in the Klamath Region of Northern California suggest {{the area is}} typically floristically rich and vegetationally complex. My initial reconnaissance suggested the Bear Lakes area is much simpler in both respects. A descriptive and comparative study of this apparently different area was designed. Some 318 vascular plants were inventoried. The vegetation was then sampled following the Braun-Blanquet releve method. There were 198 releves taken. Vegetative and habitat data were analyzed by tabular comparison. Twelve vegetation types resulted; three herb-dominated, three shrub-dominated and six tree-dominated. Detailed comparison of the results with several previous works from nearby <b>granitic</b> <b>areas</b> shows the study area to be relatively floristically depauperate and xerophytic. This {{is reflected in the}} simplicity of its vegetation pattern. Dry herbaceous and chaparral types are extensive and are elevationally independent as compared to the less extensive, elevationally zoned forests. Forest zonation at Bear Lakes is similar to other areas in the region. Some forest type descriptions suggest appreciable similarities which become greatest, at higher elevations. The relatively small orographic mass of the study area is principally responsible for differences seen there. It results in steep terrains which support few, extensive, xerophytic communities. More gentle and mesic environments, supporting species-rich vegetation elsewhere, are scarce. The physiography of the study area also results in relatively little snowpack and reduced local climatic gradients. A regional climatic gradient makes the area drier as well. Extensive disturbance by fire promotes simplicity of pattern in the study area. Disturbance in nearby areas, with more complex vegetation patterns, enhances habitat diversity. Differences between Bear Lakes and other areas in the Klamath Region are in both degree and kind. This illustrates the complexity of the Klamath Region vegetation and suggests that regional descriptions need to be flexible...|$|E
40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScIn the Kruger National Park (KNP) {{which is}} the {{flagship}} conservation area in South Africa, the impact on groundwater should be {{kept to a minimum}} as groundwater plays a vital role in sustaining ecosystem functioning and sustaining baseflow to streams and rivers. For this reason groundwater has been {{recognized as one of the}} environmental indicators that need to be monitored. The KNP has adopted a Strategic Adaptive Management (SAM) approach with clear ecosystem management goals. The achievement of these goals is evaluated by using environmental indicators. These indicators are evaluated against thresholds of potential concern (TPC). TPCs are a set of boundaries that together define the spatiotemporal conditions for which the KNP ecosystem is managed. TPCs are essentially upper and lower limits along a continuum of change in selected environmental indicators. Historically, groundwater recharge and surface water interaction with rivers has tended to be overlooked in the KNP. This study proposes a conceptual model of groundwater recharge processes in the KNP, defining when and how groundwater recharge occurs. Two methods were used, the Cumulative Rainfall Departure (CRD) and stable isotopes of ²H and ¹⁸O. An adapted version of the CRD which incorporates a long and short term memory of the system was used to identify possible recharge processes. Further, using the CRD method a reliable reconstruction of the long term groundwater level trends are simulated using monthly rainfall totals with reference to the average rainfall over the entire time series 1936 - 2009. The stable isotope of ²H and ¹⁸O samples from cumulative rainfall samplers, surfacewater (streams and rivers) and groundwater from boreholes were collected monthly for approximately one year (May 2010 to July 2011). The isotope composition of the groundwater was used to establish whether recharge was immediate or delayed. Additionally, the isotopic composition of surface-water from rivers and streams were compared to that of groundwater to identify surface-water interactions. Groundwater recharge in KNP occurs during the rainy summer months (December to March) and very little to none during the dry winter season (April to September). Recharge takes place during rainfall sequences 100 mm or more. The stable isotope records collected from cumulative rainfall, groundwater and surface water (streams and rivers) indicate that groundwater experiences evaporation prior to infiltration. As the KNP experiences high evaporation rates, insignificant rainfall sequences contribute little or zero to recharge. The CRD analysis of groundwater level fluctuations shows that recharge to the aquifers respond to dry and wet cycles that last for 6 to 14 years. The KNP experienced several periods of below-average rainfall and hence no significant recharge took place to the basement aquifers. During a normal rainy season the water levels rise somewhat then starts receding again. It is only during major rainfall events that may occur every 100 yrs to 200 yrs causing the aquifers to fully recharge. This was perfectly illustrated by the high groundwater levels after the 2000 major rainfall event that recharged the aquifers fully. During below average rainfall years the overall water level trend is drastically declining. The system experiences higher natural losses than gains due to outflow of groundwater to streams and rivers. The KNP is divided down the center by two geological formations, granites along the west and basalts along the east. The combination of the CRD model and the stable isotopic analysis suggest that the dominant recharge processes that occur in the southern region of the KNP are direct recharge via piston flow and indirect recharge via preferred pathways particularly streams and rivers. Along the eastern half of the KNP on the Basalts and Rhyolite direct recharge via piston flow are dominant. Groundwater is not recharged via small streams and rivers (Sweni and Mnondozi Rivers) as it was found that at these particular sites these rivers are detached and do not interact with groundwater. Along the western <b>granitic</b> <b>areas</b> the dominant recharge process are indirect recharge. Recharge takes place via preferred pathways particularly streams and rivers. It was found that ephemeral rivers (Nwatsisonto River) act as sinks for groundwater recharge and influent-effluent conditions are experienced along seasonal rivers (Mbyamiti River). The large perennial Sabie and its tributary the Sand River are consistently fed by groundwater, above all maintaining base flow during the dry season. These rivers act as basin sinks receiving groundwater discharge all year round. Using the stable isotope composition of rainfall, surface-water and groundwater to act as a natural tracer, in combination with the CRD method proved invaluable to confirm the plausible recharge processes. The study provided a conceptual understanding of the groundwater system in the KNP forming the foundation to developing acceptable limits (TPCs) of the groundwater levels in the KNP. The model will serve as a guide for the recharge processes and for deciding on the location and time frames for data collection to ultimately set TPCs for groundwater in the KNP to sustainably manage the resource...|$|E

Thermochemical calculations on {{the concentrations of}} Si, Na, K, Ca, H+, and HCO 3 - in shallow groundwater (Tsukuba-Kaba area, central Japan) in equilibrium with silicate minerals in granitic rocks indicate that the equilibrium between shallow groundwater and silicate minerals (feldspars, kaolinite, amorphous silica) is not attained. Therefore, a coupled fluid flow-dissolution kinetics model was applied to interpret the {{chemical composition}} of shallow groundwater. Assuming reasonable values of residence time, solubilities (equilibrium concentration), and dissolution rate of Na-Ca feldspar, {{the ratio of the}} surface area of rock to the mass of water (A/M) for shallow groundwater was estimated to be 0. 15 ～ 8. 7. The width of a fracture in a granitic rock is estimated to be 0. 2 mm～ 2 cm, considering estimated A/M and uncertainty of parameter values. The estimated value of the width is much wider than that obtained by pore sizes experimentally determined using the mercury intrusion method for a hand-specimen scale granitic sample, which is n × 10 - 1 μm. It is suggested that the interaction of groundwater and country rocks takes place dominantly on the surface of a fracture with a width of ca. 2 mm and the chemical composition of groundwater is controlled by such interaction and fluid flow in the fracture.

Moreover, Meehania urticifolia lower unit occurs on upper valleys and Waldsteinia ternata lower unit occurs on terraces in valleys. In this syudy, the terraces in this region are covered by rocks of lava which were deposited in valleys by volcanoes. On the other hand, Rhododendron wadanum-Abies homolepis community does not occur in volcanic areas. Sasa nipponica lower unit of this community occurs in the <b>granitic</b> <b>area,</b> Cacalia yatabei lower unit occurs on steep mountain slopes consisting of mudstone, and Carex reinii lower unit occurs on the area of Tertialy greentuff. The Species composition of Abies homolepis forests in this area is affected by climate and geology, because volcanic activity or active faulting along the Itoigawa-Shizuoka Tectonic line in Fossa Magna created remarkable features and disturbances, and Abies homolepis growing on rocks and unfertile soil in this area are influenced by mother rocks...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} as one {{part of an overall}} biological assessment of The Nature Conservancy’s Pennington Creek site. A 9. 6 hectare area was surveyed during the 1995 and 1996 growing seasons for plants in fertile condition. They were collected, identified and voucher specimens were deposited in the OSU Herbarium (OKLA). Physiographic and ecological aspects of the site were described using Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques. Two hundred-three species representing 157 genera and 63 families were collected. Four plant communities are present: forest, grassland, granitic outcrop, and riparian. Characteristic taxa of the forest community include Quercus stellata, Q. marilandica, Carya texana, C. cordiformis, Symphoricarpos orbiculatus, and Elymus canadensis. Tridens flavus, Setaria lutescens, Sorghastrum nutans and Gaillardiapulchella are dominants found in the grasslands. The <b>granitic</b> outcrop <b>areas</b> provide habitat for: Sedum pulchellum, S. nuttallianum, Krigia virginica, Chaetopappa asteroides, and Polypodium polypodioides. Characteristic species of the riparian community include Carex spp., Chasmanthium latifolium, Platanus occidentalis, and Alnusmaritima...|$|R
40|$|Department of Botany, 1951 The {{following}} papers record {{an investigation}} of some relations between vegetation and the soil in three major types of habitat - (1) Lake District woodland on non-calcareous glacial drift, (2) aquatic and waterlogged sites in the same region, and (3) an upland <b>granitic</b> <b>area</b> in Scotland. An attempt {{has been made to}} relate certain properties of the soil exchange complex to processes of soil development, and to vegetational differentiation and nutrient status. The major conclusions drawn may be summarized as follows: (1) In the woodlands studied, topography appears to be the main factor in determining whether a flushed brown earth with a mull humus layer and an ash-sycamore-oak-hazel tree community will develop, or a leached podzolic brown earth with a more humus layer and oak, birch and rowan as the characteristic trees. (2) In passing; from relatively inorganic underwater soils - through marsh, fen and lacustrine bog, soils - to highly organic raised bog peats; both the amount and strength of soil acids increase, C/N ratio rises, and base saturation falls. This is reflected in the nutrient status of the plants; those from underwater habitats being highest in minerals and nitrogen, and those from raised bogs being loci in both these constituents. (3) It appears that the first addition of organic matter to the Scottish granitic soils brings about a sharp increase in acidity and a marked fall in base saturation. The presence of comparatively strong acids in the humus produced by the colonizing plants is suggested as a possible advantage, in view of the difficulty of obtaining mineral nutrients from the c smite substratum. A study has also been made of some elements and chemical properties figuring in the exchange complex of a peat profile (Journal of Ecology, 1949). Some of the variations may well be related to those in the vegetational composition of the peats, for a sequence of plant communities of very different character has occupied the site as distance from the mineral soil has increased. Conjointly with A. M. Mayer {{an investigation of}} iron and manganese in natural vegetation of the Lake District has been carried out (Annals of Botany, 1951). The content of both elements is higher in natural vegetation than is usual in crop plants, probably because of the greater acidity and organic content of the natural soils. The amounts absorbed are shown to vary with the species, the plant group, and the habitat...|$|R
40|$|Ripping is {{a process}} of {{breaking}} harder ground by dragging tines attached to a bulldozer. Rippability of materials in moderately weathered (grade III) to completely weathered (grade V) has always been vague where the material behaviour is not fully understood due to their â€˜rock-soilâ€™ characteristics. This research is to examine factors that influence the rippability and establish a comprehensive method that effectively assessed the weathered sedimentary rock masses. The assessment of rock mass properties was mainly based on recording the presence, nature, orientation and occurrence of discontinuities. The information gathered from the monitoring was used for determining the excavatability of rocks. Monitored ripping tests were conducted at four different locations namely; Bukit Indah, Mersing, Kempas and Desa Tebrau which consisted of sandstone, shale and old alluvium. In order to rectify issues in different rock types, investigation was also conducted on <b>granitic</b> <b>area</b> at Masai and Ulu Tiram. Three main factors were identified to affect the rippability performance, these are; rock material, rock mass and the machine properties. Field measurements, in situ and laboratory test results are presented and their relation with the weathering grade was established. Some of the standard strength tests were not suitable to test very weak materials with weathering grade V (completely weathered), due to sampling difficulties. Thus, modifications to the test methods were done in order to get more accurate results. It is also found that there are significant relationships between productivity and the weathering grade. By measuring the ripping process, the relationships between the rock properties and the production were established. The data was analyzed statistically by using the Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software regression analytical techniques to produce sets of equations for different weathering grades from which the machine performance can be predicted. It was revealed that a single parameter is not able to predict significantly the productivity but combinations of different parameters are able to predict satisfactorily the production rate. Different sets of factors were found to influence the productivity of the ripper machine for each weathering grade. By classifying and performing the tests required for that particular weathering grade, a significant correlation between the predicted and actual production rate was established. Identification of weathering grade, joint spacing, ripping direction and some measures of strength in addition to the machine properties are found to be the major factors in predicting the ripper performance. Methodology developed for predicting production rate for different weathering grades of these weathered rock masses {{is considered to be a}} significant advance as compared to the previously published methods...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} a sedimentological {{description}} and interpretation of a strip of continental deposits of Cretaceous age along the southern border of the Cantabrian Mountains. In this work they are designatedas Voznuevo Formation (Evers, 1967). They belong {{to the type of}} deposits which have commonly been referred to as ‘sediments in Wealden facies’. As regards stratigraphy, palynological analyses (apart from pollen, the Voznuevo Formation proved completely barren) {{made it clear that the}} transition between the Lower Cretaceous and the Upper Cretaceous runs obliquely through the formation. Hence, the Voznuevo sediments are diachronic deposits, decreasing in age in a westerly direction and forming the continental counterparts of successively younger shallow marine deposits towards the west. In comparison with similar deposits in Wealden facies in other parts of Spain they represent one of the last vestiges of continental deposition in Upper Cretaceous times. Sedimentological investigations made it clear that the Voznuevo sediments are of purely fluvial origin, derived from a <b>granitic</b> source <b>area,</b> probably now partly hidden, which must have been situated on the arc of granitic rocks which runs from Galicia via northern Portugal to the Sierra de Guadarrama, N ofMadrid. Especially paleocurrent directions indicate a transport from southwesterly directions. Typical final products of weatheringofgranites kaolinite and quart...|$|R
40|$|Radon, the {{heaviest}} of the noble gases on {{the periodic table}} of elements, is a natural radioactive element {{that can be found}} on water, soils and rocks. The main goal of this work is to present an evaluation of radon concentration on samples of water, used for human consumption, collected on uranium-rich <b>granitic</b> rock <b>areas.</b> Once the geological features of the sampling region evidence the presence of this natural radionuclides, their slow dissolution steadily increases concentration in ground water. Although, the most important contribution of natural radiation, for most populations, is from inhaled radon (generic term used commonly to refer to the isotope 222 Rn), in some circumstances, exposure to natural radionuclides, through drinking water, could exceed acceptable levels, and also present a hazard. Despite the fact that radon can be reduced if the water is boiled, this gas, dissolved in ground water, can be released into the air during household activities such as showering, dishwashing and laundry. So, the short lived radon decay products will contribute {{to increase the number of}} those which are present in particles suspended in the indoor air and can be accumulated up to dangerous concentrations. Once the radon progeny emits highly ionizing alpha-radiation, they may cause substantial health damage after long-term exposure. Radon concentration measurements were performed on thirty three samples collected from water wells at different depths and types of aquifers, at Covilhã's County, Portugal with the radon gas analyser DURRIDGE RAD 7. Twenty three, of the total of water samples collected, gave, values over 100 Bq/L, being that 1690 Bq/L was the highest measured value...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a report}} on the general geology of the Elysian Park-Silver lake district; a six square mile tract of hilly country lying just north of the city of Los Angeles. The rock units present are granitio bedrock of Jurassic(?) age, sediments of Tertiary age and Quaternary alluvium. The bedrock is a granodiorite; the Tertiary beds which are divided into the Topanga of middle Miocene and Modelo of upper Miocene ages are made up of {{sandstone}} and shale; and the Quaternary alluvium consists of reworked Tertiary and granitic bedrock detritus. The main structural feature over most of the area is a wide east-west anticline. A few extensive faults and a great many minor faults occur, all of which dip at a high angle. The geologic history of the area began with the intrusion of the <b>granitic</b> bedrock. The <b>area</b> was then extensively eroded exposing the bedrock to the surface* Then followed the unconformable deposition of the Topanga formation, followed by folding and faulting. Later unconformable deposition of the Modelo occurred, followed by more folding and faulting. There is a time break between upper Miocene and upper Pleistocene in sedimentation. In upper Pleistocene time alluvial fans were deposited over the northern part but later partially eroded off to give present landscape. ...|$|R
40|$|Kasumi Rock is {{situated}} in the amphibolite-facies metamorphic zone in the Lutzow-Holm Complex, East Antarctica. In this <b>area,</b> <b>granitic</b> rocks occur as steeply dipping linear dykes with sharp intrusive contacts, and cross-cut the foliation of layered metamorphic rocks. A geochronological study of this post-metamorphic granite (PMG) has been performed. An Rb-Sr whole rock isochron for five granitic rocks defines an age of 492. 1 +- 23. 4 Ma with an initial ^ 87 Sr/^ 86 Sr ratio of 0. 70535 +- 0. 00027 (MSWD= 0. 08). In the Sm-Nd isochron diagram, four rock samples yield an age of 498. 4 +- 90. 6 Ma with an initial ^ 143 Nd/^ 144 Nd ratio of 0. 511782 +- 0. 000101 (MSWD= 0. 05). The whole rock isochron ages and mode of occurrence suggest that the Kasumi PMGs were intruded after regional cooling of the area, and probably affected local reequilibrium for isotopic systems of surrounding metamorphic rocks. The PMGs might have been slowly cooled and crystallized after the intrusion. The Kasumi PMGs have no genetic relation to the Oku-iwa PMGs as regards Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic systems, because the initial ratios of both PMGs are quite different from each other. This is interpreted to mean that the PMGs in the Lutzow-Holm Complex were originated from different source materials or had different chemical reaction processes with crustal materials...|$|R
40|$|The Davie Bay deposit is an {{elongate}} northwest. southeast trending body of grey fine to cryptocrystalline limestone {{with minor}} dolomite and is exposed on the southwestern slopes of Texada Island above Davie and Mouat Bays. In 1955 and 1956 British Columbia Cement Company Limited (now awned by Gerlstar Limited) did some exploration work on its land holdings covering the southeastern p,ut of the deposit. Land {{in the central}} part of the limestone body has been held by Lafarge Canada Ltd. 3 claims since 1970 and an extensive drilling program was carried out between 1972 and 1976. Areas with best bedrock exposures are mainly in the southeastern end and along the northeastern edge of the deposit, mainly on the steeper slopes. The middle of the limestone body has small ridges (or ribs) of limestone separated by overburden while the southwest side and the northwest part are extensively covered. Most of the overburden is a silty clayey till with rounded cobbles and boulders of volcanic and <b>granitic</b> rocks. Small <b>areas</b> indicate the presence of Quadra sand on the surface. The limestones of Davie Bay have been correlated by McConnell (1914) with similar limestones of the Marble Bay Formation on the north end of the island.
