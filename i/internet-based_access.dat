Challenges and Significance A major barrier facing CenSSIS researchers is the storing, indexing, and sharing of subsurface image and sensor data. The geographical separation between and the diverse disciplines of CenSSIS members make collaboration a particular challenge.

The development of a centralized database system to store, organize and retrieve subsurface imaging data is key to addressing these challenges.

40|$|International audienceThe Cloud {{computing}} is {{the widely}} spread model of utility-computing that proposes an on-demand <b>internet-based</b> <b>access</b> to configurable resources available within data centers. If public providers enable simple {{access to resources}} for companies and users who have sporadic computation or storage needs, private clouds could sometimes be preferred for security or privacy reasons, or for cost reasons due to a high frequency usage of services. However, in many cases a choice between public or private clouds does not fulfill all requirements of companies and hybrid cloud infrastructures should be preferred. A hybrid cloud solution could, for example, answer sudden workload increase, security or fault tolerance requirements, or even latency issues thanks to data-locality. Solutions have already been proposed to address hybrid cloud infrastructures, however {{most of the time}} the placement of a distributed software on such infrastructure has to be indicated manually. For this reason, the automation of software deployment on hybrid clouds is still under research. The placement problem is a NP-hard multi-dimensional and multi-objective bin-packing problem. In this paper we propose new specific placement constraints and objectives adapted to hybrid clouds infrastructures in our solution OptiPlace, and we address this problem through constraint programming. Furthermore we evaluate the expressivity and performance of the proposed solution on a real case study...|$|E
40|$|The paper proposes an {{integrated}} approach for risk assessment of natural disasters using cloud computing, based on joint application of fuzzy logic models and an actuarial model. A hierarchical {{fuzzy logic system}} with several inputs and one output is designed. The risk assessment problem {{is defined as a}} multicriterial task that evaluates input variables (natural disaster indicators) and takes into account available information sources and the expert knowledge. The natural disaster indicators represent product of the probability of occurrence of a particular natural disaster and the aggregate loss caused by its action. The aggregate loss assessment is carried out by an actuarial model, more accurately, by the collective risk model. The main components of the collective risk model are discussed - the natural disaster magnitude (adverse events) and the negative consequences (severity of the damages). It is noted that the cloud computing is a model for providing on-demand <b>Internet-based</b> <b>access</b> to a shared pool of computing resources, including networks, storage and applications. The risk assessment results can support the state and local government to take more informed decisions regarding the efficient allocation of the available funding for the improvement of the population and infrastructure from natural disasters.

Early treatment can prevent sudden cardiac death and disease progression. However, data on long-term outcome in unselected genotyped patients are scarce {{due to a lack of}} large registries. In 2005, a national internet-based registry for familial heart diseases in the Netherlands, named GENCOR, was developed in collaboration with the Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands (ICIN). GENCOR aims to assess the prevalence of familial heart diseases in patients and families in the Netherlands and to facilitate research to improve the quality of diagnostics and therapy in familial heart diseases. Patients who visit the (cardio) genetic outpatient clinic are informed about GENCOR and asked to consent to the storage of information about cardiac examinations, family history and DNA diagnostics from all their visits. Patient data are entered into the internet-based GENCOR database by the cardiologist or clinical geneticist in attendance. Additional information can be stored for scientific research. Four university hospitals are actively obtaining informed consent from the patients, which resulted in the inclusion of more than 300 patients. In 2006, more university hospitals will start using GENCOR and the aim is that all university hospitals will participate. Three research projects have already started using GENCOR.

This paper reports on two research projects that highlight the importance of cognitive style, visualisation and multiple representations on future course designs. BACKGROUND The University of Southern Queensland (USQ) teaches and researches as a dualmode university with triple-option teaching styles (students can study on-campus or by ‘traditional ’ distance education or online via the Internet). It offers over 300 accredited awards, consisting of over 1, 000 subjects/courses across five Faculties and provides access to educational opportunities to approximately 25, 000 students annually. The quality and standing of the University’s teaching and learning activities are widely recognised, having been joint Winner of the Good Universities Guides ʹUniversity of the Year ʹ for 2000 - 2001 for developing the ʹe-university ʹ where students learn and are supported through the innovative and strategic use of educational web-based technologies. In addition, USQ was judged the best dual mode university in 1999 for its global education initiatives and expertise in providing flexible learning opportunities. Through the years, the University has prospered across the four mainstream generations of distance education development, namely, • the correspondence model (with print), • the multimedia model (print, audiotape, videotape, computer-based learning and interactive video), • the telelearning model (audioconferencing, videoconferencing, audiographic communication, broadcast TV/radio and audioconferencing), • the flexible learning model (interactive multimedia, <b>Internet-based</b> <b>access</b> to WWW resources, and computer-mediated communication).

30|$|Panel C reports novel {{information}} on ICT usage and job search strategies among jobseekers participating in public labor-market intermediation. The {{average number of}} search methods used by the sample is close to two. We find that 96 {{percent of the sample}} regularly use mobile phones, while 49 percent do so for job search purposes, and in particular, to contact prospective employers (57 percent), private (26 percent) and public (11 percent) labor-market intermediaries. Further, 84 percent of the sample has experience using the Internet, which is a relatively high percentage with respect to the population. Sixty-one percent of the sample used the Internet for job search purposes. Importantly, 4 out of 5 <b>Internet-based</b> searchers <b>access</b> the Internet from Internet café shops, where for a small amount of money they can rent computers with online access. Only 25 percent of the sample access Internet from home. Moreover, the data show that, on average, our sample spent 0.9  hours-per-week on public search channels, which accounts for only 20 percent of the total weekly search time. This means that job search in Peru is mainly done outside of the public intermediation system since the weekly (average) number of hours devoted to active job search is 4.5. The p-value of the F-test for the equality of means does not reject the equality of means for all ICT-related variables. This result is important because it shows that all groups can potentially have the same access to the Internet version of the CIL-PROEMPLEO labor-market intermediation program.|$|R
