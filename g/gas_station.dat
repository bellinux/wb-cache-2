5|$|Ambler's Texaco <b>Gas</b> <b>Station,</b> {{also known}} as Becker's Marathon <b>Gas</b> <b>Station,</b> is a {{historic}} filling station located {{at the intersection of}} Old U.S. Route 66 and Illinois Route 17 in the village of Dwight, Illinois, United States. The station has been identified as the longest operating <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> along Route 66; it dispensed fuel for 66 continuous years until 1999. The station {{is a good example of}} a domestic style <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> and derives its most common names from ownership stints by two different men. North of the station is an extant outbuilding that once operated as a commercial icehouse. Ambler's was the subject of major restoration work from 20052007, and reopened as a Route 66 visitor's center in May 2007. It was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco <b>Gas</b> <b>Station,</b> {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, wooden frame building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from the pond and stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date that is also unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for the <b>gas</b> <b>station.</b> The building features a double wall with sawdust stuffed in between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E

5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> less than two miles from the Garridos' home. The caller {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. The caller then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; the caller, the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. The caller never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|Scully {{learns that}} the {{lockdown}} population is infected with an exceedingly deadly contagion, finding {{a pile of}} body bags stored for incineration in the prison's boiler room. Scully cuts open Torrance's body bag and examines his corpse, but Dr. Osbourne, {{a member of the}} CDC team, tries to stop her. A pustule on Torrance's body erupts in Osbourne's face, causing him to flee the room. Meanwhile, the fugitives steal an RV and stop at a <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> where Paul calls his girlfriend, Elizabeth, looking for shelter. The station's clerk finds an infected Steve in the restroom; he is knocked unconscious by Paul. Scully calls Mulder after the Marshals raid the <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> telling him that the contagion could spread into the population if the fugitives are not captured. Mulder sees a CDC biohazard team arrive at the scene, forcibly taking away the clerk in a helicopter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Aimed at {{the puzzle}} of data {{integration}} share resulted from its diversity and privacy of protocols in the monitoring system for <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> in China, the paper designed a monitoring system of <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> in retail network for oil products. Based on the embedded dynamic Web, it constructed the system frame, built the software system structure, researched the protocol conversion among the forecourt equipments and the module of IFSF, designed message transmission module of IFSF protocol on TCP/IP based on Ethernet, and realized the integrated management between <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> equipment and system monitoring. The basic experiments based on embedded dynamic Web were made, and it could complete telnet monitoring, parameter configuration, data auto-transmission and auto-upload as well as management of <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> information. The actual experiment demonstrates its rationality and feasibility of the proposed solution...|$|R
5|$|The {{combined}} {{grant and}} village-funded restoration included door, window, and roof repairs, along with {{interior and exterior}} repainting. The repainting matched the station's 1940s color scheme. On April 24, 2007, the National Park Service presented a plaque commemorating the restoration project at the station. In early May 2007, with the restoration completed, Ambler's Texaco <b>Gas</b> <b>Station</b> reopened as a visitor's center.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} {{also included}} turning the building into {{a museum of}} its own history, giving it the authentic appearance of a working 1940 <b>gas</b> <b>station.</b> With $1.7 million in funding by the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, the restoration was completed in July 2003.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Corgan reading {{a comic book}} dressed in an ice cream man uniform. A clip of the intro to the song is played and stopped {{repeatedly}} before the song begins. Groups {{of two or more}} people are kissing each other around Corgan as he drives in an ice cream van through a desert. Corgan picks up a dress-wearing Iha and the two drive for a while before stopping at a <b>gas</b> <b>station,</b> where Chamberlin and Wretzky appear as gas attendants. After Iha changes into a yellow and white cowboy outfit, the band paints the van in a multitude of colors. More people are shown kissing in the hills as the band drives away from the <b>gas</b> <b>station</b> in the van. However, Corgan is ultimately kicked out of the van, and the video ends with Corgan walking off the road wearing a cowboy hat as the van drives away. The video was filmed on August 29, 1993.|$|E
40|$|Mexican <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> {{across the}} country buy and sell {{gasoline}} at regulated common prices. Therefore, authorities that set these prices do {{not take into account}} competition conditions of each market. In this paper we establish the effect of a regulated mark-up price as well as competition on the incentives that <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> in Mexico have to dispense less amount of gasoline than what consumers pay for. The results of theoretical and empirical work indicate that a higher regulated mark-up price reduces the incentives of <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> to cheat. Similarly, more intense competition among the retailers of a given market decreases the average shortage. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{combined}} effects of the locations and the brands of retail gasoline outlets in Tucson, Arizona on market prices. We apply an innovative approach to model the impact of competing <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> that avoids limiting analysis to predetermined nearby locations. We show that: (1) increased brand diversity is associated with higher prices; and, (2) <b>gas</b> <b>stations</b> affiliated with mass-merchandisers and grocery stores reduce market prices by a larger amount and over a greater distance than other types of <b>gas</b> <b>stations.</b> We demonstrate that our conclusions are not sensitive to the choice of distance metric...|$|R
