The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam will admit water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly.

The use of CO 2 in heat pump dryers is feasible if operating temperatures are appropriate. In heat pump dryers working with CO 2 {{according to the}} transcritical cycle, {{one of the most}} important operating conditions is optimum <b>gas</b> cooler <b>inlet</b> pressure, which gives the maximum coefficient of performance (COP). In this study, a model was developed by using MATLAB software for heat pump tumble dryer working with CO 2. The model was validated by experimental data taken from existing literature. Then, COP, moisture extraction rate (MER), and specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) were found by running the model at different <b>gas</b> cooler <b>inlet</b> pressures (80 – 140 bars).

40|$|During {{solar cell}} firing, {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOC) and {{a small number of}} metal particles were removed using the gas flow. When the gas flow was disturbed by the thermal field of infrared belt furnace and structure, the metal particles in the discharging gas flow randomly adhered to the surface of solar cell, possibly causing contamination. Meanwhile, the gas flow also affected the thermal uniformity of the solar cell. In this paper, the heating mechanism of the solar cell caused by radiation, convection, and conduction during firing was analyzed. Afterward, four 2 -dimensional (2 D) models of the furnace were proposed. The transient thermal fields with different <b>gas</b> <b>inlets,</b> outlets, and internal structures were simulated. The thermal fields and the temperature of the solar cell could remain stable and uniform when the gas outlets were installed at the ends {{and in the middle of}} the furnace, with the <b>gas</b> <b>inlets</b> being distributed evenly.

The trajectories of particles with diameters of 1 mum, 0. 1 mum, and 0. 01 mum were examined in this study. When the <b>inlet</b> <b>gas</b> temperature was {{lower than that of}} the disk, particle-free zones were created due to upward thermophoretic force for 1 mum and 0. 1 mum particles.

When the <b>inlet</b> <b>gas</b> temperature was higher than the disk temperature, particle deposition onto the disk was enhanced due to the downward thermophoretic force for 1 mum and 0. 1 mum particles.

50|$|In 1951, Koehler and later, in 1972 Flammersfeld {{introduced}} a trick {{in the original}} Rüchardt setup, {{to increase the number}} of oscillations that are limited by the unavoidable friction-damping and gas leak (through the piston-tube seal): they made a thin hole on the tube (at half-height) and provided a gas-feeding pump to keep constant the pressure inside the vessel. By properly trimming the <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> flux (through a throttling valve) they obtained the following result: during the oscillations the piston is pushed-up by the gas overpressure until it crosses the hole position; then the gas leakage through the hole reduces the pressure, and the piston falls back. The force acting onto the piston varies at a rate that is regulated by the piston oscillation frequency leading to forced oscillation; fine adjustment of the throttle valve allows to achieve maximum amplitude at resonance.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates a {{possible}} practical solution for reasonable oxygen supply during the {{pluripotent stem cells}} expansion processes, where the stem cells propagate as aggregates in stirred-suspension bioreactors. Low glucose and low oxygen concentrations are preferred for efficient proliferation of pluripotent stem cells.

5000|$|It {{has been}} shown that growing cells and tissues have very {{individual}} oxygen requirements. Due to this reason {{it is important that the}} content of oxygen can be adapted in individual perfusion culture experiments. The technical solution is a gas exchanger module containing a <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet (Fig. 6a). Further a spiral with a long thin-walled silicon tube for medium transport is mounted inside the module. Since the tube is highly gas-permeable, it guarantees optimal diffusion of gases between culture medium and internal atmosphere of the gas exchange module. In consequence, the desired gas atmosphere can be adjusted by a constant flow of a specific gas mixture through the module. This way the content of oxygen or any other gases can be modulated in the medium by diffusion. Applying this simple protocol it became possible to decrease the oxygen partial pressure within the transported medium during long term culture experiments under absolutely sterile conditions 7.|$|E
50|$|Ion-beam {{sputtering}} (IBS) is {{a method}} in which the target is external to the ion source. A source can work without any magnetic field like in a hot filament ionization gauge. In a Kaufman source ions are generated by collisions with electrons that are confined by a magnetic field as in a magnetron. They are then accelerated by the electric field emanating from a grid toward a target. As the ions leave the source they are neutralized by electrons from a second external filament. IBS has an advantage in that the energy and flux of ions can be controlled independently. Since the flux that strikes the target is composed of neutral atoms, either insulating or conducting targets can be sputtered. IBS has found application {{in the manufacture of}} thin-film heads for disk drives. A pressure gradient between the ion source and the sample chamber is generated by placing the <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> at the source and shooting through a tube into the sample chamber. This saves gas and reduces contamination in UHV applications. The principal drawback of IBS is the large amount of maintenance required to keep the ion source operating.|$|E

The pigs must be removed, as many pigs are rented, pigs wear and must be replaced, and cleaning (and other) pigs push contaminants from the pipeline such as wax, foreign objects, hydrates, etc., which must be removed from the pipeline. There are inherent risks in opening the barrel to atmospheric pressure so care must be taken to ensure that the barrel is depressurized prior to opening. If the barrel is not completely depressurized, the pig can be ejected from the barrel and operators have been severely injured when standing in front of an open pig door. By accident, one pig was shot out of the end of a pipeline without a proper pig receiver and went through the side of a house 500 feet away. When the product is sour, the barrel should be evacuated to a flare system where the sour gas is burnt. Operators should wear a self-contained breathing apparatus when working on sour systems.|$|E

Simulations could not accurately reproduce the experimental trend for the case when highly reactive nickel oxide was used as the oxygen carrier material, but in general satisfactory quantitative agreement was observed. The failure to correctly capture the experimental trend was primarily attributed to the fine length-scales at the feed <b>gas</b> <b>inlets</b> not being adequately resolved even at the finest grid investigated. The trend quickly worsened when coarser grids were used, indicating that the generality of the model is lost when grid dependence effects are present. A number of possible dimensional effects were also discussed.

The model captured this trend correctly because the reaction was now limited by the reaction rate and not by species transfer to the large scale gas-emulsion interfaces.
