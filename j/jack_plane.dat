50|$|The film {{follows the}} lives of 3 three World War II {{veterans}} living in a rural midwestern town in 1958. It opens on pilot Jack Fisher (Michael Haskins), who gets a call from his sheriff brother Henry (Beau Kiger) with word about a suspected serial killer he has been tracking. They arrive to find the brothers' longtime friend Bob Halloran (Brandon Eaton), has a posse formed in a standoff with the suspect holding a young girl hostage in a barn. Once the posse discovers the hostage is dead, they unload bullets into the barn, injuring the suspect. The Fisher brothers and Halloran load the bleeding suspect into <b>Jack's</b> <b>plane,</b> but a decision is made during the flight that propels mounting tension between the 3 men.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{presented}} at the Technology Education Isues Symposium, Maui, Hawaii, in June 1996. 71 knowledge of practice (specific technological applications), and (c) impacts of technology on society and the environment (Wright, 1992). With this as a basis for the field, curriculum development can begin. As development of curriculum is considered, disagreement arises. Here is where the curricular friction begins to take place and be noticed. For much of the profession the current curriculum framework is little different from the old vocational models used in years past that concentrate on the technical aspects of selected tools and materials. It is packaged differently, modules are used instead of unit shops, computers and robots are used instead of <b>jack</b> <b>planes</b> and handsaws, but the philosophical basis remains the same. Educators concentrate the majority of their efforts on the technical procedures used to create artifacts and give the processes used by technologists and the impacts of technology on society only cursory attention. Students sometimes gain knowledge about the technological processes and the impacts of technology as a by-product of the curriculum. These outcomes occur in a haphazard way, however, rather than through a coordinated curriculum that shares the stage with the major elements of the technology education curriculu...|$|R
5000|$|Different {{types of}} bench planes are {{designed}} to perform different tasks, with the name {{and size of the}} plane being defined by the use. Bailey iron bench planes were designated by number respective to the length of the plane. This has carried over through the type, regardless of manufacturer. A No. 1 plane is but little more than five inches long. A typical smoothing plane (approx. nine inches) is usually a No. 4, <b>jack</b> <b>planes</b> at about fourteen inches are No. 5, an eighteen inch foreplane will be a No. 6, and the jointer planes at twenty-two to twenty-four inches in length are No. 7 or 8 respectively. A designation, such as No. 4½ indicates a plane of No. 4 length but slightly wider. A designation, such as 5-1/2 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly wider (actually, the width of a No. 6 or a No. 7), while a designation, such as 5-1/4 indicates the length of a No. 5 but slightly narrower (actually, the width of a No. 3). [...] "Bedrock" [...] versions of the above are simply 600 added to the base number (although no [...] "601" [...] was ever produced, such plane is indeed available from specialist dealers; 602 through 608, including all the fractionals, were made).|$|R
50|$|The main {{character}} is Jack Thompson, {{a member of}} a US air force strategic bomber squadron during World War II. During a mission above Germany his plane gets attacked by German fighters and catches fire. Somehow, a portal opens up as the plane is going down, and it enters what is presumably a parallel universe or an alternate timeline. Jack finds himself descending not upon the German countryside, but on a strange, unfamiliar jungle landscape. Meanwhile, on the ground, we see a tied up young woman, struggling to get loose as a gigantic carnivorous dinosaur approaches. <b>Jack's</b> <b>plane</b> luckily hits and decapitates the creature, preventing the woman from being eaten. At the last second Jack bails out, and {{at the beginning of the}} game he dangles in his parachute from a tree, with a boot-knife as his only weapon.After cutting the woman loose, she is revealed to be a princess who was going to be sacrificed as an attempt to save her father's life. She becomes Jack's companion throughout the game. The adventure consists of a large number of static panels across which the player moves to solve puzzles and battle dinosaurs. Objects can be picked up, and using them in the right context is often required to progress to the next screen. Other problems are often solved by jumping or interacting with the princess.|$|R
5000|$|In {{preparing}} stock, the <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> is used {{after the}} scrub plane {{and before the}} jointer plane and smoothing plane. The name {{is related to the}} saying [...] "jack of all trades" [...] as jack planes can be made to perform some of the work of both smoothing and jointer planes, especially on smaller pieces of work.|$|E
50|$|The {{jointer plane}} (also {{known as the}} try plane or trying plane) {{is a type of}} hand plane used {{primarily}} to straighten the edges of boards in the operation known as jointing. A jointer plane may also be used to flatten the face of a board. Its long length is designed to 'ride over' the undulations of an uneven surface, skimming off the peaks, gradually creating a flat surface. In thicknessing or preparing rough stock, the jointer plane is usually preceded by the fore plane or <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> and followed by the smoothing plane.|$|E
5000|$|Early {{planes were}} all wood, {{except for the}} cutter, or {{combined}} a wood base with a metal blade holder and adjustment system on top. Although there were earlier all-metal planes, Leonard Bailey patented a number of all-metal planes and improvements in the late 19th century.A <b>jack</b> <b>plane</b> came {{to be referred to}} as a [...] "No. 5" [...] plane or a [...] "Bailey pattern No. 5" [...] {{at the end of the}} 19th century. The [...] "No." [...] nomenclature originally used by Stanley Tools to label its Bailey pattern plane products continues to identify planes made by various manufacturers. Not all manufacturers of the era had the same number scheme for their planes. Millers Fall and Sargent used different numbers to refer to the same planes.|$|E

40|$|The Club’s annual year end {{function}} {{was attended by}} 70 members and {{took the form of}} a lunch at Café Mariposa owned and operated by the Guerrero family in Lopinot. This rural village is located in a valley 10 km north of Arouca. It was named after the French Count Josef de Lopinot de la Fresilliere who arrived in 1800. Along with his family and 100 slaves he established a cocoa estate on 400 acres of land awarded for services to the royal family. The ambiance is quite charming, welcoming to both internationa l and local visitors with its mix of international and regional flags as well as displays of antique tools such as, a hand drill, <b>jack</b> <b>plane,</b> knife sharpener, scrubbing board and a shoemaker’s last. After some last minute mingling we were welcomed in song by the manager, Bianca Hamel-Smith (formerly Guerrero), and three of her six sisters.

However, Heller's plan to get Logan to quietly resign backfires when Christopher Henderson uses Audrey as leverage to get the recording from Jack. Jack and Audrey recapture Henderson but they find that he has passed the recording on to a co-conspirator aboard a diplomatic flight. <b>Jack</b> boards the <b>plane</b> and reclaims the recording by taking the co-pilot hostage. This triggers a response from Charles Logan who tries to have the plane shot down, citing that it could be used to attack civilian targets on the ground. This causes others in Logan's inner circle to become suspicious of his motives. Jack Bauer lands the plane and delivers the recording to CTU. Logan decides to commit suicide to avoid the spectacle of a public trial, but before he can do so, a Homeland Security employee intervenes and destroys the recording, and is rewarded with a promotion by Logan.|$|R
50|$|Unable to land his <b>plane,</b> <b>Jack</b> crash-lands in the {{entrance}} to the Easter Island shrine. Unable to catch either Wolf or the Carnivore in the ten minutes remaining until the final pillar must be placed, Jack uses the remains of the Halicarnassus to cover the ground between himself and Carnivore. Jack kills the former KGB operative with the plane's sole remaining gun, which literally blasts him to nothingness. Lily, the only person Jack trusts - not least of all because she {{is the only one who}} can read the Word of Thoth - carries out the final placement. The reward for the sixth pillar is power, the ability to make one's thoughts a reality. Imbued with the power of the pillar, Lily goes on a murderous rampage, killing Cassidy and Mao Gongli in a grotesque fashion before Jack is able to stop her. As the Great Machine activates and the world is saved from the Dark Sun, Jack kicks the pillar into the void beneath the Vertex. Wolf gives chase, but the Halicarnassus causes the balcony overlooking the void to collapse, and he falls to his death as he chases the pillar. We learn that because it was Wolf's blood and not Jack's on the third pillar in Hokkaido, it was a vision of Wolf's death that Jack saw. Jack and Lily leave Easter Island, returning to Siberia in time to free their friends and the Carnivore's victims from the fomaldehyde tanks.|$|R

Engleberg argue over putting an {{unconscious}} Rosie back in the field when Nero suggests it can control the submarine by itself. Mecha Shark returns to sea, but it is critically damaged by the megalodon. After Rosie awakens, she is summoned to Emma's research facility in Auckland, New Zealand, where Emma reveals that the megalodon is headed toward Sydney, a spawning ground of its species millions of years earlier. Sydney is promptly evacuated while Nero goes back online, yet Jack cannot pinpoint the glitch that caused its defeat. As predicted, the megalodon arrives in Sydney's shores; the Mecha Shark with Nero in control is once again deployed to engage it in battle. Nero once again malfunctions; this time, the Mecha Shark enters Drone Mode, a fail-safe system programmed to complete its task without the safety protocols. The megalodon tackles Mecha Shark and hurls it toward the Sydney Opera House. Jack rushes to Sydney and reunites with Rosie, but Mecha Shark goes back online and determines all humans in sight as hostile after soldiers point their guns at it. As the Mecha Shark goes into amphibious mode and terrorizes the streets, Emma calls Rosie and suggests to lure {{it back into the}} ocean and convince the megalodon to destroy it. Rosie rushes in to board the Mecha Shark to trigger the pulse generator. Meanwhile, the megalodon sinks the Charles Davis, kiling Adm. Engleberg and everyone aboard. The Mecha Shark is blasted back into the water by a squadron of fighter <b>planes.</b> <b>Jack</b> boards a second shark submarine to board the Mecha Shark and get Nero back online. Jack and Rosie leave the Mecha Shark before the megalodon bites {{the left side of the}} submarine, triggering a dislodged torpedo which destroys both combatants in the explosion.

As she sets out to do this, she is guided by visions of Booker, and later learns that she herself had died earlier in Rapture; she {{made a deal with}} the Lutece twins to combine all her quantum selves and memories of future time into one mortal body to return to this place at this time to rescue Sally, effectively leaving all alternate versions of herself in their own respective universes. She struggles with this, and further learns that Dr. Suchong of Rapture had worked with Jeremiah Fink from Columbia to collaborate on technology. Suchong forces her to briefly return to Columbia via a tear to obtain a Lutece particle that will raise the sunken Rapture building, where she further learns that the Luteces had convinced Daisy Fitzoy to threaten Fink's child to make Elizabeth kill her as to mature her. She returns and amid an attack by Andrew Ryan's men, completes the task. Atlas launches his war against Ryan and tortures Elizabeth to try to make her tell him the location of Ryan's [...] "Ace in the Hole". In a flash of panic, she is able to remember the location, and Atlas makes her go retrieve it. The Ace is revealed to be a piece of paper with a coded message. She willing gives it over to Atlas knowing that he plans to kill her, but is privy to one last memory from before - that of seeing <b>Jack</b> on the <b>plane</b> that would crash near Rapture, and the note containing Jack's trigger phrase [...] "Would you kindly".

40|$|Deformation {{and fluid}} {{processes}} in thrust sheets are studied {{using a small}} thrust system n the footwall of the Gavarnle Thrust, central Pyrenees. This system comprises a set of blind thrusts that Imbricate a thin Mesozoic cover succession (Triassic red beds and Upper Cretaceous limestone) in the Cirque de Barroude and produce a culmination in the Gavamle Thrust. An Intense cleavage developed within the culmination associated with the oblique tipping of thrusts as they climb from the basement into the cover strata. The distributed strain associated with the fault tips locally reactivated earlier folded thrusts {{by the development of}} upper strain detachments. The main detachment occurred along the Pic de Port Vieux thrust which forms the roof of the culmination. The reactivation occurred along the back-limbs of folds in the thrust and produced faults that cut across the fold crests. The movement on these upper strain detachments was intermittent and the faults were gently folded when inactive. The faults that formed within the zone of distributed strain are discontinuous and their development did not conform to foreland or hinterland propagation and more than one fault moved simultaneously. The overlying Gavamie Thrust sheet extended sub-parallel to transport during {{the early stages of the}} culmination development. The concurrence of shortening in the footwall and extension in the hanging wall of the thrust implies that the it acted as mechanical boundary between two differently deforming plates. The extension of the upper plate (the Gavarnie Thrust sheet) Is considered to have occurred during gravity spreading in response to an Increased critical taper In the south Pyrenean thrust wedge. The increased taper possibly resulted from the shortening associated with the underplating of the lower thrust sheets in the central Pyrenees. The composition and source of the ambient fluid in the thrusts and the fluid flow processes that operated during the fault activity have been studied using fluid inclusion mlcrothermometry from cavity-fill quartz and from the chemistry of secondary phases in the cavities. The cavities formed by the hydraulic <b>jacking</b> of fault <b>planes</b> and they indicate the presence of syntectonic high fluid pressures. These pressures appear to have been generated in situ during the distributed deformation in the culmination and seismic pumping does not appear to have operated. The fluid is a high salinity Ca-Na-CI brine. The presence of bitumen in the inclusions suggests the brine is a connate basinal brine and not of metamorphic origin. Heterogeneity of brine compositions between the different samples studied suggests that the fluid reservoir in the culmination was heterogeneous and produced by limited dilution of the connate brine with meteoric water. Fluid-rock ratios were low and the close correspondence between vein mineralogy and wall rock composition suggests that the fluids were equilibrated with the strata in the culmination. Local fluid flow pathways have been mapped using Mgvariations within chlorite. These show that limited fluid transfer occurred between the Cretaceous limestone and the adjacent basement or the Triassic red beds. This transfer appears to have been related to dilatancy pumping associated with the hydrofracture events. Large-scale fluid migration along the active faults did not occur even though local fracture permeabilities were high...|$|R
40|$|The printmaker, Harvey Breverman (b. 1934) makes visual {{statements}} {{through his}} artistic reaction to atrocities of the Jewish holocaust during World War II and the ethics, social aspects and {{crimes against humanity}} that have been connected to it. Energetic and emblematic of forces to be reckoned with, he reports the truth visually in poetic graphic form. Breverman depends on the dissemination of propaganda against neo Nazism in his compositions. He systemically implants his ideas aimed at the hearts, minds and hands {{of the women and}} men in society. Breverman makes artistic statements vis-a-vis, the eyes and written texts of the authors, Raymond Federman (b. 1928) and Leslie Fiedler (1917 - 2003), University at Buffalo professors of legend. The assemblage of legendary professors from the late 1960 s and early 1970 s, John Barth and Robert Creeley to name a few, are meshed into contemporary scenarios rendering visual impact, as in Melangue, where a committee meeting also reveals a triangular geometric drawing in the background. In The Creeleys (Bob and Pen), Breverman puts the poet and his wife in a somewhat abstracted tweaked caricature format, an aged television antenna in the background reflects and repeats old world burnt sienna shading. Samuel Beckett has presence in many of Breverman's scenarios, although, focusing on his more recent work where the Jewish holocaust is omnipresent, the irony of propaganda exists dramatically. The Golden Age Dutch printmaker, Rembrandt, (1606 - 1669), left an indelible mark on Breverman, where surface tone, variation of wiped ink and rough gouging and burnishing has a semblance of chiaroscuro and parallel both artists work. R. B. Kitaj and Breverman share a love of humanity and the Kabbalah. Interpretation of historical reality and the abstraction of Jewish identity and Diaspora are interpreted on both artists' picture <b>plane.</b> <b>Jack</b> Levine also studied the Dutch Masters and applied some of the Rembrandtesque technique to his painting as has Breverman. WPA artist Levine {{was a part of the}} Jewish American social realist movement and an influence on Breverman's style as seen in brush stroke movements and in visualized social satire. They were both printmakers in the 1960 's resurrecting the graphic medium in etching, mezzotint, aquatint and drypoint. But Breverman is his own person, his originality is self taught, self produced, his students emulate him. He sets precedent and is a hard act to follow. He comes from the same school, as Andy Warhol, Carnegie Mellon University, but Breverman has invented his own iconography, his own reality grounded in an abstract philosophy. Imbedded with historical Jewish American social realist qualities from the 1930 s, Breverman's artwork and his ideas are propagated and supported by the writings of Helen Langa. She has brought to the surface, "social viewpoint" prints in her 2004 publication, Radical Art, Printmaking and the Left in 1930 's New York, and offers a visual and verbal discourse of the Jewish American artists that labored intensely to bring an urgent awareness to the atrocities that were taking place in Eastern Europe in 1930 s- 1940 s. Langa's research is innovative because she has bridged not only printmaking but Jewish American printmaking to the new millennium and made it part and parcel of contemporary art history discussion. Langa has linked the cultural gap between the Jewish American authors Matthew Baigell, Sybil H. Milton, Stephen C. Feinstein, Ori Z. Soltes and Carol Zemel and contemporary American art and mainstreamed their messages about the Jewish holocaust into Western art historical discussion. Langa has dragged Jewish American art out of the closet and like an archaeologist she has documented and explained material remains and artifacts brought into fruition by Baigell, Milton, Feinstein, Soltes and Zemel. Breverman propagates these authors ideas into his artistic matrix by using symbolic elements brought to the forefront through their investigations. In the conclusion, Breverman gives visual references to historical memory and contributes to a better understanding of the Jewish holocaust. Breverman unpacks Nazi propaganda with a twist of Jewish irony within pedagogy, society, ethics and aesthetics in the sphere of twentieth-century American art. Thesis (M. A.)
