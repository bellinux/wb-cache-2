40|$|Starting with an {{analysis}} of the recent launch of EUTube, this article poses a number of different questions about the <b>EU’s</b> <b>visibility,</b> particularly from a Central and East European perspective. Arguing against the more commonly held belief that the <b>EU’s</b> <b>visibility</b> is on the decline, the article showcases a number of alternative examples of visibility whereby other actors, coming from the publicity world, critically engage with problems surrounding the EU such as discrimination, the work-visa regime, the EU Constitution and the CAP reforms. Focusing on the Polish Plumber campaign in France and Poland as well as the Bucegi and Ursus beer campaigns in post-enlargement Romania, the article argues that such campaigns could and should {{play an important role in}} expanding the visual horizon of the EU and opening the door to other ‘legitimate’ authors of ‘text’ and ‘images’ pertaining to the EU...|$|R
40|$|Through the {{creation}} of a European External Action Service (EEAS) the EU has attempted to increase the consistency and visibility of its external action abroad. However, in the Western Balkans the impact of this new diplomatic service of the EU is not always obvious: EU enlargement, as the dominating policy framework, remains outside the EEAS’ scope of competence. In Kosovo and Bosnia, with their strong CFSP dimension, synergies are still limited. Whereas the mutation of the EC Delegations into EU Delegations under the authority of the EEAS (but with a strong Commission component) had the benefit of raising the <b>EU’s</b> <b>visibility</b> in the Western Balkans, questions remain about internal coordination and the risk of a possible hijacking of the new service by member states. Although the EEAS can facilitate the streamlining the EU’s external action in the Western Balkans, such an outcome depends more on the behaviour of the actors involved than on institutional arrangements...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: European {{integration}} {{has entered}} {{a new and more}} difficult phase of its existence, characterized by mass Euroscepticism, the rise of radical and anti-establishment parties and a mainstreaming of anti-EU rhetoric (Brack & Startin 2015; Vasilopoulou 2013). The ongoing economic and financial crisis has not only re-opened debates on the raison d’être of European integration and the legitimacy of European Union (EU) ’s intervention but it has also increased the <b>EU’s</b> <b>visibility</b> in the public sphere. This context has provided fertile ground for the galvanization of oppositions to the EU. As a result, there has been an unprecedented success for Eurosceptic parties such as UKIP, the Front National in France, Syriza in Greece and the Danish People’s Party, leading some commentators to talk about a “Eurosceptic storm in Brussels” (Financial Times, 26 May 2014). Although their success varies from country to country, both soft and hard Eurosceptic parties increased their representation in the European Parliament (EP) after the 2014 elections. This seems to confirm the argument made by Usherwood and Startin (2013) that Euroscepticism has become persistent and embedded at both the national and the supranational levels, which may have considerable consequences for the EU...|$|R
40|$|News {{coverage}} {{about the}} European Union (EU) {{has the potential}} to inform citizens about and to involve them in matters of European integration. Investigations of factors that explain variation in EU news coverage, however, are rare. This study explains weekly variation in the <b>visibility</b> of <b>EU</b> news in newspapers from seven EU member states for the period 1990 to 2006. It identifies exogenous factors that relate to the EU polity, its policies and national politics. The descriptive results show that <b>EU</b> news <b>visibility</b> has increased overall and that weekly variation is rather similar in the seven member states. News visibility is substantially influenced by infrequent polity-related events such as European Parliamentary (EP) elections or Council summits but also by EP sessions. Also policy-related and national events affect visibility. The findings are discussed in light of the democratic deficit of the EU and the potential consequences of visible EU news coverage...|$|R
40|$|News {{about the}} European Union (EU) looks {{different}} {{in different countries}} {{at different points in}} time. This paper investigates explanations for cross-national and over-time variation in the news media coverage of EU affairs. The paper draws on large-scale media content analyses of newspapers and television news in EU- 15 (1999), EU- 25 (2004) and EU- 27 (2009) in relation to European Parliament elections. It investigates predictors for variation within and change between the coverage of these elections. It focuses in particular on explanatory factors pertaining to the country, the media, and the political elites. Results show that national elites play an important role for the coverage of EU matters during European Parliament election campaigns. The more strongly national parties are divided about the EU, the more visible the news is, the stronger the increases in <b>EU</b> news <b>visibility</b> are, and the less European-focused the news is. The implications of these findings for the nature of public opinion about the EU are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Regional Cohesion Policy {{is one of}} {{the most}} visible <b>EU</b> policies, <b>visibility</b> gained by setting targets for {{reducing}} economic disparities and promoting economic competitiveness and employment in the 271 regions. Planning and implementation of all EU policies should take into account the impact on economic, social and territorial cohesion. Regardless of the territorial dimension more or less clear, the impact of these policies cannot be denied, but it is quite difficult to measure and quantify, especially because of the interdependent effects of different policies. This article presents the main directions of the assessment in the use of Structural Funds, emphasizing the role of this process in the context of preparing the programming period 2014 to 2020. Romania cannot afford to ignore this first experience as a beneficiary of Structural Funds; on the contrary, we must use it in order that the next National Strategic Reference Framework to be in compliance with the national socio-economic context and based on our own expertise in accessing European funds. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} a cross-national {{comparative}} content analysis of the coverage of Euro-pean Union politics in British,Danish,Dutch,French,and German television news. The study identifies key characteristics of the coverage and investigates influences shaping the coverage. In the majority of countries studied, EU politics was marginally repre-sented in national television news. EU officials, too,were absent in the news. However, if the EU was covered,EU politics was more prominently presented than other politi-cal news. Three influences were found to positively contribute to the amount and prominence of EU news: it was more prominent in public broadcasting news pro-grams,in countries {{with higher levels of}} public satisfaction with democracy,and during periods around <b>EU</b> summits. The <b>visibility</b> of <b>EU</b> officials in television news was highest in public news programs. The findings suggest that,with EU coverage being of limited visibility and without protagonists, the Europeanization of television news coverage is more an illusion than reality...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the visibility}} of European Union (EU) citizens in EU news during the 2009 European Parliament election. It argues {{that the presence of}} EU citizens in EU news is vital for responsiveness of European governance. First, the theoretical notion of EU citizens is considered. Next, a new way of defining EU citizens is proposed: EU citizens are divided into national and supranational <b>EU</b> citizens. The <b>visibility</b> of <b>EU</b> citizens in EU news of 27 EU member states is analysed aiming to explain cross-country differences. The paper is based on a large-scale content analysis of TV and newspaper articles gathered during the 2009 European Parliament election. To explain different levels of visibility, a multi-level analysis is carried out. The results suggest that EU citizens are visible in the EU news, yet, their presence strongly varies across countries. The findings indicate that explanations for different levels of visibility can be found at both the media and country level...|$|R
40|$|The EU’s role {{to assist}} Turkey in its democratization efforts has been debated during Turkey’s candidacy. However, {{in the second}} decade of the 21 st century, this role of the <b>EU</b> lost its <b>visibility</b> while Turkey seemed to lose its {{interest}} in reform movements. This paper, inspired by Pevehouse, defines the EU as a supplier of democratization mechanisms and Turkey as an actor in need. Although lack of enthusiasm and disengagement have come to characterize Turkey-EU relations, this study aims to demonstrate that {{there are differences between}} the governing and the opposition actors’ views on the EU and its role in the democratization of Turkey. Data collected from the speeches of opposition parties’ parliamentarians between 1 January 2011 and 31 August 2016 demonstrates the similarities observed in these parties’ concerns regarding democratic practices and the perception of the EU as an actor strengthening democracy, while indicating that the EU, as a supplier, overlooked their concerns during the process...|$|R
40|$|While {{previous}} research has taken into account different normative theories when examining {{the concept of the}} public sphere at the national level, the underlying normative conceptualisation of the European public sphere has often remained vague. However, better understanding whether the European public sphere is functional and able to fulfil its democratic role needs further specification of the underlying normative criteria. This study considers different normative public sphere theories {{in the context of the}} European Union (EU) news coverage. Specifically, it focuses on one main criterion, namely the actor structure, and examines which normative theory is able to describe the actor structure of the <b>EU</b> best. The <b>visibility</b> of national and European governmental actors, civil society actors and citizens is examined by drawing on secondary data of a large-scale content analysis of television and newspaper articles of all 27 EU member states gathered during the 2009 European Parliament election campaign (N[*]=[*] 12, 850) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the possible}} {{impact of the}} European Union (EU) {{on the development of}} the relations between business interest groups and the government in Turkey, more precisely on the interventions of the business interest groups in domestic policy-making. Hence it deals with the links between the progress of the relationship between Turkey and the EU and the development of domestic interest group activity in Turkey. The progress of Turkey’s relations with the <b>EU</b> enhanced the <b>visibility</b> of the Turkish Peak Business Organizations (PBOs) in representing Turkish business interests in Brussels. Moreover, the evolution of the activities of the PBOs, provides a broader understanding of the developments of the general characteristics of the relations between the government and business interest groups in Turkey. Hence the investigation focuses on the major Turkish PBOs. We examine the relations of Turkish PBOs with the EU, essentially, on the basis of the observation of their transnational actions within the EU as well as their participation in financial and technical assistance programmes of the EU and in the joint institutional structures of the association regime between Turkey and the EU. By analysing these two dimensions we assess the repercussions of the socialization of the Turkish PBOs on their strategies of action in dealing with European Affairs, on discourses they adopted regarding domestic policy-making and on their organizational structure and policy agenda. We elaborate our topic with reference to the Europeanization concept, which covers the examination of the consequences of the European governance on national systems. Through the Europeanization concept we observe the correlation between the progress of the Turkey-EU relations and the ongoing process of change in the patterns of interventions of the Turkish business interest groups in domestic policy-making.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{research}} is a small Finnish town of Kankaanpää, its cultural and physical transformation from a 1950 's rural village into a modern art town. The foundation for this transformation was laid {{by a group of}} artists called Kankaanpää Colony and the Kankaanpää School of Arts established in 1965. The interaction between town planning and art from 1995 to 2006 has resulted in the Kankaanpää Circle of Art, a collection of over a hundred public works of art in the urban space. The core of the case study research is comprised of the culture-oriented development project Eyes on Kankaanpää of Kankaanpää town centre realised between 1995 and 1999 to battle against regional decline. The picture on the {{object of the}} research is complemented as the text progresses and is interlaced with background, theory and literature. The objective of the research is to find out what have been the processes and discourses through which the cultural and physical transformation of Kankaanpää from a rural village into an art town has been possible. The research can be categorised as qualitative owing to diversity in both methodology and data. The theoretical frame of reference is provided by urban planning, cultural and image theories. Primary data consists of interest group surveys, interviews of key persons and an abundant collection of mediatexts. Among others things, surveys of the public have been used as background material. In addition, abundant administrative material and the researcher's own knowledge and experiences have been available. The researcher's own role could not be excluded from the data which has caused ethical deliberation. The broad empirical data has been categorised into themes using discourse analysis. Discourse is interpreted broadly to cover speech, texts, imagery as well as works and acts of art. Through understanding explanation the research identifies an interpretation model for Kankaanpää's development from a rural village into an art town. The research analyses phenomena in society development, cultural politics, urban renewal and environmental art so that the development of Kankaanpää can be set to a larger frame of reference. The Narrative of the Circle of Art participates in the contemporary discussion of the image and regional development effects of culture and the physical environment. Culture's direct and indirect impacts on the economy have been discussed for a few decades but immaterial phenomena having indirect effects also on the economy, such as the birth processes of identity and image, have so far received relatively little study. Their empirical verification is the focus of the research. The embeddedness of cultural change then reveals itself as a central factor. Three turning points can be identified in Kankaanpää's development into an art town: the birth of art life and establishment of the School of Arts in the 1950 's and 60 's, the stabilisation of the School of Arts as a middle-level municipal school {{at the end of the}} 1980 's, and the emergence of the Circle of Art starting from the mid 1990 's bringing art greater <b>visibility.</b> <b>EU</b> funding opened up the possibilities for many projects combining town planning and art life. The interactive nature of these projects and the visibility in the media that the projects have received have greatly amplified the town's cultural change. According to the research urban planning and the practises applied in its different paradigm stages have an important role in the formation of a town's identity and image. The foundation for Kankaanpää's distinct urban structure has been laid by rational planning. The communicative approach to planning combined with strategic and cultural objectives have characterised the urban planning and town centre development processes in recent years. The end result of planning and design, the public urban space, will remain as a permanent part of people's lives. The process affects also the actors. Urban art influences in people's experience environment, speech, and visual imagery. The efforts to improve a town's image appear important in a competitive economy and a society of images. Image and identity are in interaction. The impact of media and outside attention on people's opinions and therefore image (reputation) is crucial. If art life is embedded as part of Kankaanpää's identity, there are grounds for the formation of a genuine image. The data shows that despite many differences there is transition happening to this direction. In the research discourse has been interpreted broadly to include speech, texts and imagery as well as works and acts of art. The discourses promoting art image include regional development, Eiffel and community discourses whereas moderating discourses can be characterised as basic services first, conflict and emotional depression. The data shows that the discourse aiming for change usually originates from actors - often reinforced with authoritative speech. This is further followed and amplified by media discource. Gradually there emerges spontaneous, self-guiding discource and action which is interpreted as the gradual embeddedness of art life. Finally, all discourses amplify each other. Discourse cumulates. The key finding of the research is the Circles of Discourse which comprises of several mutually amplifying circles. The model it provides can be used to illustrate how material and immaterial factors affect discourse and the formation of image. Material results such as physical urban environment and urban art as well as established institutions, associations, etc. represent structural embeddedness. Relational embeddedness (Kainulainen 2005) appears as spontaneous discource the formation of cultural identity. The immaterial factors category is reinforced by communicative action when a joint process has increased the level of involvement. All these factors have interacted with each other and contributed to the formation of the identity and image of an art town. The Circles of Discourse points out the possibility of a positive feedback loop but the model works equally well the other way round. Based on literature and results it can be concluded that the Kankaanpää Circle of Art holds in any case significant potential for image building. The town's image resources are both material and symbolic (Äikäs 2001). There exist elements for original narrative (Jensen 1999). Chain thought is fulfilled when art and high quality urban environment are easily accessible year round. Art life has in addition a great relative significance within the town (Kainulainen 2005). The formation of cultural capital is a fact and Kankaanpää can be justifiably called an art town...|$|R
