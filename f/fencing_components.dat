40|$|The {{traditional}} hardwood paling {{fence in}} Australia is installed untreated. Treatment attempts {{fall short of}} Australian Standard requirements due to limited penetration in heartwood. Nevertheless, evidence is presented that sub-standard treatment of Eucalyptus regnans and E. obliqua <b>fencing</b> <b>components</b> with either copper-chromium-arsenic or pigment emulsified creosote is beneficial to above-ground (H 3) components. Palings and rails H 3 exposed at Clayton near Melbourne were mostly without decay after 13. 5 years. However, the top ends of chromated copper arsenate treated posts sometimes had decay, and tops sloped for increased water-shedding did not reduce this damage. Treatment benefit was less clear for in-ground (H 4) sawn fence posts. Treated posts were usually in worse condition against decay than untreated naturally durable E. camaldulensis posts after 7. 5 years in an accelerated field simulator and 13. 5 years at Clayton. The reverse was true after 13. 5 years at Walpeup, where the main hazard was from termites...|$|E

The name reflects the club’s status as the oldest, largest and most successful fencing club in Australia. The Australian Fencing Federation has recognised VRI Fencing Club as the nation’s High Performance Club of the Year every year since the award was introduced in 2002. On 19 April 2012 the VRI Fencing Club {{training centre}} at the Punt Road Oval became the State Centre for Excellence in Modern Pentahlon, providing elite level fencing training and development for the <b>fencing</b> <b>component</b> of the Olympic multi-sport discipline.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic {{materials}} used for residential fences {{can be in}} a solid cast form, or a reinforced hollow rail design that resembles sawn timber, Most commonly extruded profiles. Higher quality vinyl <b>fence</b> <b>components</b> are ribbed or include reinforcements, often of aluminum, for added strength. For agricultural use, synthetic fencing can consist of a heavy synthetic strapping product inlaid with cable, synthetic-coated high-tensile wire, or a synthetic coating over a wood or metal rail or plank. Residential synthetic fencing products are usually hollow, and thus too fragile to contain livestock, but some designs may be suitable for containing dogs or other pets. Residential grade rails are also made of a thinner material.|$|R
40|$|This {{project has}} been {{proposed}} by the UCT Knowledge Partnership Project. This institution is aimed at providing assistance to under-privileged communities in the Western Cape. A pre-school fence material which is low cost is to be investigated. The following criterions were set to be met for the material: -The material is to have no fuel usage value such as wood, which can be burnt for space heating -The material is to have no scrap metal value such as steel and wire fencing material as this easily gets stolen. -The material is not to block visibility which harbors criminal activity in the area. Fences such as concrete slabs and brick block visibility. The materials considered in this project are: -Various plastic polymer materials -Plastic Lumber composite material -Recycled Plastic -Rubber reinforced concrete Plastic lumber and recycled plastic HDPE were considered {{for use in the}} fence material. After considering the available <b>fence</b> <b>components</b> and loading on the fence, 100 x 100 mm cross section plastic lumber and recycled plastic section were chosen to be used. The fence design was based on existing patents which were modified. A design showing the meter of the fence was designed and is shown in the document...|$|R
30|$|Upon {{realizing the}} {{shortcomings}} of TGLP, the government introduced the National Policy on Agricultural Development (NPAD) in 1991. The aim of NPAD was to provide subsidies to improve productivity in the livestock sub-sector by promoting the sustainable use of rangeland resources through fencing of communal grazing areas (GoB 1991). So in essence, the <b>fencing</b> <b>component</b> of NPAD simply accelerated the implementation of TGLP and failed to tackle some of the earlier concerns like dual grazing rights. But not everyone was practicing pastoralism. Some ranches had displaced non-pastoral populations and denied them access to natural resources of land, water, veld products and animals (Hitchcock 1978). So for other traditional rural livelihoods such as hunting and gathering, part of the reserve land was later demarcated into Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) {{in an attempt to}} balance the scales. WMAs are multiple-use areas combining wildlife conservation with the creation of economic opportunities for the rural population (GoB 1999). Intense developments within WMAs such as borehole drilling are prohibited, while hunting is controlled through permits or total bans. There are complementary polices and pieces of legislation predicated on sustainable utilization of natural resources also governing these areas, such as the Wildlife Conservation Policy (1986), Tourism Policy (1990), National Conservation Strategy (1990), Wildlife Conservation and National Parks Act (1992), Tourism Act (1992) and Community Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) concept.|$|R
30|$|In February 1995, an {{outbreak}} of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), known as cattle lung disease, occurred in western Ngamiland, with the first cases reported along the Xaudum valley (Figure  1). Respondents reported that this period was the most disturbing period of their lives as pastoralists: ‘…many families were impoverished and {{had to rely on}} government temporary relief programmes…’ (Oral history data, 69 -year-old Mbanderu pastoralists, Sehithwa, 2015). CBPP is an acute or chronic disease of cattle and wild buffaloes. According to officials at the Department of Veterinary Services (DVS), during the early stages, the disease was confined to {{the western part of the}} district. Despite control measures, the disease spread rapidly to the east, prompting the government to resort to total eradication by clearing the entire district of cattle. In total, 320, 000 cattle were killed of which 114, 000 cattle were eradicated from ranches and 206, 000 were eradicated from communal lands (DVS 2000). According to respondents, the CBPP caused enormous disruption to the spatial configuration of the pastoral landscape. Following the outbreak, more veterinary fences were introduced. Three major fences were constructed as emergency control measures in 1995 to contain the spread of CBPP: Samochima (Red line fence), Ikoga (Yellow line fence) and Setata (Green line fence) (Raborokgwe 1997) (Figure  1). Pastoralists in the villages of Semboyo and Makakung indicated that the Setata fence changed their land use patterns completely. Livestock movements were curtailed and grazing lands bisected, with some water resources becoming inaccessible. Restocking started in 1997, and by the end of the year, about 70, 000 cattle had been reintroduced (DVS 2000). The period also coincided with the implementation of the NPAD <b>fencing</b> <b>component.</b> The﻿ policy restated the TGLP assertion that growth in livestock numbers had caused significant overgrazing and degradation and recommended fencing off a large portion of communal lands as commercial private ranches.|$|R
40|$|Dystrophin is {{the product}} of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene locus, whose absence results in {{progressive}} skeletal muscle breakdown. Despite considerable work on the localisation of dystrophin and its associated complex, its role in muscle function remains unclear. In the light of the structural and mechanical instability of the dystrophic membrane, the idea was tested that dystrophin might impart membrane integrity and strength by anchoring membrane proteins and/or delineating the surface into specialised subcellular functional domains. Specifically, because dystrophin shows high sequence, structural and spatial similarities to the cytoskeletal protein spectrin; and because spectrin is proven to sterically restrict protein lateral diffusion through a subplasmalemmal network; the capacity of dystrophin to act as a 'molecular fence' to membrane diffusion was studied by comparing lateral mobility of membrane glycoproteins by fluorescence photobleach recovery in mdx and normal tissue. Secondly, as dystrophin has been proven to interact directly with proteins of the dystrophin associated glycoprotein complex in vivo, experiments addressed whether specific binding and immobilisation of the complex by dystrophin at the membrane was essential for function. Finally, given the homology of dystrophin and spectrin, the presence of dystrophin at the neuromuscular junction, and the importance of spectrins in immobilisation of voltage gated sodium channels in the nervous system, the role of dystrophin in regulating voltage gated sodium channel distribution at the neuromuscular junction was investigated. The results show that membrane glycoproteins were immobile in the presence and absence of dystrophin, suggesting dystrophin is not an essential molecular <b>fence</b> <b>component.</b> Alternatively, viability may have been the major influence on protein and lipid diffusion in these fibres and suggestions are made as to how this may be recognised and overcome for subsequent investigation. Three novel exon specific anti-dystrophin peptide antibodies were generated during the work that will be useful for studies into Duchenne muscular dystrophy in general, and dystrophin revertant fibres in particular...|$|R

40|$|Eradication of {{invasive}} vertebrate pests from increasingly large islands {{has become an}} important wildlife management and conservation tool internationally. Success on islands has prompted attempts to exclude and eradicate vertebrate pests from mainland sites. Early mainland exclusion efforts often failed due to ineffective or poorly maintained barriers to pest reinvasion. Over the last 10 years, we have conducted extensive experiments to design effective pest exclusion technology. We have determined the behavior and physical abilities {{of many of the}} vertebrate pest species found in New Zealand {{and other parts of the}} world. Pest species have been tested against a variety of fence designs with the aim of developing 100 % effective barriers. We found that fences which relied on the use of electrified wires proved ineffective for most species, whereas barriers that exceeded the physical capability of the target pests were reliable. Two multispecies fence designs excluded every pest tested. The designs excluded rodents (including mice), lagomorphs, mustelids, hedgehogs, brushtail possums, cats, dogs, feral pigs, goats, deer, Javan macaque and domestic livestock. The outcome of this research program has been the commercial availability of two designs of Xcluder™ pest proof <b>fence.</b> Supporting <b>components</b> and technology, such as pest-free pedestrian and vehicle gates, waterway gates and remote surveillance systems to mitigate reinvasion risks have enabled projects to succeed. Over 20 exclusion barrier systems have now been constructed in areas up to 3, 400 ha in size and have allowed multi-species eradication attempts. With the successful removal of vertebrate pests, many projects are now undertaking significant restoration programs including the reintroduction of threatened wildlife species to mainland sites...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of power delivery can be profoundly improved by preventing wildlife-related power outages. This {{can be achieved}} by insulating electrical substation components with non-conductive covers. The manufacture of custom-built covers requires as-built models of the salient components. This study presents new, automated methodology to recognize key components of electrical substations from 3 D LiDAR data acquired using terrestrial laser scanning. The proposed methodology includes six novel algorithms to recognize key <b>components</b> (<b>fence,</b> cables, circuit breakers, bushings and bus pipes) of electrical substations. Three datasets with different resolutions and configurations are used in this study. A Leica HDS 6100 laser scanner was used to acquire the first dataset and a Faro Focus 3 D laser scanner was employed to collect the second and third datasets. The obtained results indicate that 178 and 171 out of 181 electrical substation elements were successfully recognized in the first and second dataset, respectively, and 183 out of 191 components were identified in the third dataset. The results also demonstrate that an average 97. 8 % accuracy and average 98. 8 % precision at the point cloud level can be achieved...|$|R
