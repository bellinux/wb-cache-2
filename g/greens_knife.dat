Only spores of the two species were observed, and infections caused no obvious pathological changes in the brain...|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that {{isolates}} of Edwardsiella ictaluri obtained from infected channel catfish in the southeastern United States harbor two cryptic plasmids, designated pCL 1 (5. 7 kb) and pCL 2 (4. 9 kb). These isolates appear to be serologically homogeneous. To extend these studies, we focused our analyses on two isolates of nonictalurid origin. Plasmid analyses of a danio isolate showed that it harbored plasmids which were similar if not identical to pCL 1 and pCL 2. This strain was also serologically indistinguishable from those isolated from channel catfish. In contrast, a <b>green</b> <b>knife</b> fish (GNF) isolate harbored four plasmids with relative mobilities of 6. 0, 5. 7, 4. 1, and 3. 1 kb. Southern blot analyses indicated that only the 5. 7 - and 4. 1 -kb plasmids strongly hybridized under high-stringency conditions to probes specific for pCL 1 and pCL 2, respectively. The GNF isolate showed minimal reactivity when reacted with polyclonal antiserum prepared against a channel catfish isolate. However, polyclonal antiserum to the GNF isolate strongly reacted with the GNF isolate in both surface fluorescence and agglutination reactions. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses of cell lysates showed that the protein banding patterns of the strains compared were similar. However, Western blots of proteinase K-digested cell extracts showed that O antigen of the GNF isolate was antigenically distinct from the O antigen of the other isolates. These studies indicate that there are different serotypes of E. ictaluri and suggest that plasmid and serological analyses of future isolates of E. ictaluri can be used to determine whether structurally distinct strains are emerging in major channel catfish aquaculture areas...|$|R

5000|$|Dang Fong {{originally}} began learning Hung Ga Kuen from Lam Sai Wing, the {{disciple of}} Wong Fei Hung. At that time Lam Sai Wing was teaching in Guangzhou’s Chan Tong District. Dang Fong was popular and had many friends, {{two of which}} were Sui Lo Yuk and Sui Lo Yin, both students of Wong Fei Hung. They taught {{a lot of their}} kung fu to Dang and later introduced him to Wong Fei Hung to become an indoor disciple learning martial arts and Tit Da. He reported that Wong’s teaching style was to teach students according to their abilities. For example, he taught Ling Wan Gai mainly the skills of the staff and Lam Sai Wing the skills of the fist and hand forms. When Wong Fei Hung saw Dang Fong perform the Left-handed Plum Flower Spear he saw a lot of potential, but for his own reasons focused Dang’s training on Tit Da and herbal skills. As Dang Fong was determined to learn Kung Fu he would ask other students of Wong Fei Hung to teach him. He learned Fifth Brother Eight Trigram Staff (Ng Long Pah Kua Guang) from Ling Wan Gai, the Generals Broadsword (Ji Fai Do) from Lam Sai Wing, the <b>Green</b> Dragon <b>Knife</b> (Ching Lung Yan Yuet Do) from Chan Din Biu, etc. Then one day when Wong Fei Hung saw Dang Fong practicing the <b>Green</b> Dragon <b>Knife,</b> which he had never taught him, he realized his passion for learning and changed his focus to teaching Dang Fong his Hung Ga Kuen.Afterward with Wong’s permission, Dang Fong opened a school in Yi Yung Tong, in Tai Ho Road of Sai Kwan District in Guangzhou. He invited Wong’s wife Mok Gwai Lan to be the martial art and lion dancing trainer for female students, and the school became famous for male and female lion dancing. One day Dang Fong had a fight with a master named Yuen Hoi and defeated him. The fight gained him the name [...] "Tiger of Sai Kwan". During the Lok Sin Theater incident, Dang Fong was one of the participants and injured many people and had to leave Guangzhou going to Southeast Asia. Dang Fong returned to China after the Ching Dynasty and after the Sino-Japanese war he moved to Hong Kong. In 1948, the Kowloon Jewelry Association and Hong Kong Fisher Market of the Eastern District invited Dang Fong to be their martial arts and lion dance teacher.|$|R
5000|$|At 18:00 {{as the sun}} began {{setting a}} third attempt to rescue the East Beach force was attempted, using Jolly Green 11 as the rescue ship and with gunfire support from Jolly <b>Green</b> 12, <b>Knife</b> 51 and the gig from the Wilson {{mounting}} four M60s. Nail 68 first ordered gun runs by an AC-130 followed by F-4s and A-7s {{along the edge of}} the East Beach, as this was going on five C-130s arrived over Koh Tang carrying BLU-82 [...] "daisy cutter" [...] bombs — a 15,000-pound device and the largest conventional explosive weapon in the U.S. arsenal at the time. Not seeing any practical use for the BLU-82s, Nail 68 ordered them dropped well south of the Marines' positions. At 18:15 Jolly Green 11 approached the East Beach, but did not actually set down because the hulk of Knife 23 was sitting on the beach; instead, the pilot (1LT Donald Backlund) skilfully hovered the helicopter several feet off the ground just north of the original beach LZ. The extraction was difficult because the helicopter would see-saw up and down. Only a few Marines at a time could board the helicopter's rear ramp in this fashion by timing their jumps to coincide with the downward motion of the aircraft. Jolly Green 11 was hit numerous times, but managed to transport its cargo of 20 Marines and five Airmen to the Coral Sea. Shortly after Jolly Green 11 evacuated the East Beach, the first BLU-82 was dropped causing a huge explosion and sending a shockwave across the West Beach, Lt. Col Austin quickly called the Cricket with the instruction that no more of the bombs should be dropped. A report from Jolly Green 11 indicated that a Marine might be in the wreckage of Knife 31 and Jolly Green 12 went in to search for any survivors, Jolly Green 12 hovered above the wreck, while a crewman was lowered on a rescue hoist to survey the wreckage, no Marine was recovered and Jolly Green 12 suffered extensive damage in the rescue attempt and flew to the Coral Sea.|$|R
5000|$|Aversionline.com {{gave the}} album 6 out of 10 stars: [...] "Here's some fairly diverse metalcore with both {{some of the}} melodic Swedish death metal thing and the chaotic/technical angle happening, {{as well as some}} more {{straightforward}} metalcore with a blend of chugging hardcore rhythms {{and a little bit of}} melody. The vocals are straight screams with the occasional sort of [...] "singing shout" [...] style, which sounds pretty cool here, because it's literally a [...] "singing shout"... if that makes any sense at all? This is definitely better than average, because the transitions are fluid and the songs, while long, tend to carry themselves well. Take for instance the lengthy instrumental, [...] "Soundtrack to a Failing Relationship", starting very calmly with lush clean guitars under heavy delay and eventually leading in to forceful distorted chord progressions with a plodding rhythm section and sparse lead lines. The recording isn't half bad. It's a little bit on the abrasive side, but barely, because the bass tone is thick as hell and the percussion sounds totally natural (two thumbs up there). There's a nice amount of clarity, but I think I'd drop the vocals back a smidge and maybe add some crunch to the guitars, but not too much... just a little. The layout is very consistent all around. Everything is done in shades of brownish green and cream, with some high contrast graphics over subtle cardboard looking textures. Inside the lyrics are arranged at haphazard angles over those same cardboard textures against jagged black space. I'm not into the lyrical content, though. They're pretty generic and a lot of the topics and lines use trendy metaphors and thematic issues such as the following: [...] "I never noticed the color of your eyes until I saw them in the reflection of this <b>knife,</b> <b>Green</b> with envy for a life you never had, Bloodshot contempt when I extend my hand..." [...] What it is with these bands always talking about knives and shit in reference to girls who've likely [...] "wronged" [...] them? Despite their strengths, I do think the tracks are too long (most over five minutes, some right at seven), but mainly because the CD runs 52 minutes, and that's just too much to take in one sitting... and I think I'd rather hear nine slightly shorter songs than seven or eight long songs. This band is definitely on the right track, because they're not totally generic (while not totally original) and they're competent writers, so with a bit more honing of their skills they could far outshine the competition. (6/10)" ...|$|R
