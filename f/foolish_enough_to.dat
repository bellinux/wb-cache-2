It {{is set in the}} Genroku period, itself within the larger Edo period, during the reign of the shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi. Tsunayoshi's thirst for power has created conflict around ownership of the Demon Blades, samurai swords forged by the legendary swordsmith Muramasa Sengo that crave blood when drawn and bring madness and death to those <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> draw them. Due to the chaos generated by this, the Demon Blades' powers begin summoning demons from Hell, along with causing ancient gods to stir from long slumber.|$|E

25|$|Mercian {{military}} {{success was}} {{the basis of their}} power; it succeeded not only 106 kings and kingdoms by winning set-piece battles, but by ruthlessly ravaging any area <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> withhold tribute. There are a number of casual references scattered throughout the Bede's history to this aspect of Mercian military policy. Penda is found ravaging Northumbria as far north as Bamburgh and only a miraculous intervention from Aidan prevents the complete destruction of the settlement. In 676 Æthelred conducted a similar ravaging in Kent and caused such damage in the Rochester diocese that two successive bishops gave up their position because of lack of funds. In these accounts there is a rare glimpse of the realities of early Anglo-Saxon overlordship and how a widespread overlordship could be established in a relatively short period. By the middle of the 8th century, other kingdoms of southern Britain were also affected by Mercian expansionism. The East Saxons seem to have lost control of London, Middlesex and Hertfordshire to Æthelbald, although the East Saxon homelands do not seem to have been affected, and the East Saxon dynasty continued into the ninth century. The Mercian influence and reputation reached its peak when, in the late 8th century, the most powerful European ruler of the age, the Frankish king Charlemagne, recognised the Mercian King Offa's power and accordingly treated him with respect, even if this could have been just flattery.|$|E

500|$|Clarence {{did well}} in school, and upon his {{graduation}} from Waltham High School in 1903, he took the entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed, and after taking basic courses at the school, did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J.B. Worcester & Co., a firm which had constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Soon afterwards, Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A popular story about Howe was that Swain had Howe and fellow engineer James Barker toss a coin to see who would get the job. Barker denied the tale later in life, stating he {{had no interest in}} the position and no one who knew Howe would be <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> gamble with him, as Howe had shown himself to be uncommonly lucky. [...] In any event, Howe had no better prospects in sight; unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.|$|E

Now this was a <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> thing <b>to</b> do, seeing the sort of man with whom he had to deal, and that there was bush where anyone could hide to within a hundred and twenty yards of his washing place. So it proved indeed, for just as Ralph had mounted his horse and was about to ride on, he felt a sharp stinging pain across his shoulders, as though someone had hit him on the back with a stick, and heard the sound of a gunshot fired from the cover of the bush, for there above the green leaves hung a cloud of smoke.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1840s Maykov entered Belinsky's circle and {{became friends with}} [...] Nikolai Nekrasov and Ivan Turgenev.

Later, having been interrogated about his involvement, Maykov avoided arrest (he {{did not have a}} significant role in the group's activities), but for several years was kept under secret police surveillance. In the years to come Maykov, who never believed in the ideas of socialism, often expressed embarrassment over his involvement in the Petrashevsky affair. In an 1854 letter to M. A. Yazykov he confessed: [...] "At the time I had very vague political ideas and was <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> join a group where all the government's actions were criticized and condemned as wrong a priory, many of [...] applauding every mistake, according to the logic of 'the worse they rule, the quicker they'll fall'. In the 1850s Maykov, now a Slavophile, began to champion 'firm' monarchy and strong Orthodox values. Writing to Aleksandr Nikitenko he argued: [...] "Only a form of political system which had been proven by the test of history could be called viable". In 1852 Maykov moved into the office of the Russian Committee of Foreign censorship, where he continued working for the rest of his life, becoming its chairman in 1882.|$|E

Ireland is still tied, as she has been for centuries past, to take part in England's wars. In the Six Counties, a large number of Republican soldiers are held prisoners by England. Further weakness on the part of some of our people, broken faith and make-believe, have postponed the enthronement of the living Republic, but the proclamation of Easter Week and the declaration of independence stand and must stand for ever.

2500|$|The {{successful}} {{conclusion of}} the Normandy campaign saw {{the beginning of the}} debate between the [...] "American school" [...] and [...] "British school" [...] as both American and British generals started to advance claims about who was most responsible for this victory.

It is no wonder that Monty's real high ability is not always realised. Especially so when 'national' spectacles pervert the perspective of the strategic landscape". About Montgomery's conduct of the Normandy campaign, Badsey wrote: [...] "Too much discussion on Normandy has centered on the controversial decisions of the Allied commanders. It was not good enough, apparently, to win such a complete and spectacular victory over an enemy that had conquered most of Europe unless it was done perfectly. Most of the blame for this lies with Montgomery, who was <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> insist that it had been done perfectly, that Normandy – and all his other battles – had been fought accordingly to a precise master plan drawn up beforehand, from which he never deviated. It says much for his personality that Montgomery found others to agree with him, despite overwhelmingly evidence to the contrary. His handling of the Battle of Normandy was of a very high order, and as the person who would certainly have been blamed for losing the battle, he deserves the credit for winning it".|$|E
2500|$|The Peace of Amiens {{temporarily}} left Baker {{without a}} ship, but {{he returned to}} active service with the resumption of hostilities, taking command of the 36-gun [...] on 28 April 1803. He {{was assigned to the}} Channel Fleet under Admiral William Cornwallis, and on 10 August 1805 he came across the 40-gun French frigate [...] off Cape Finisterre. Prior to the sighting the Phoenix had intercepted an American merchant, en route from Bordeaux to the United States. The American master had been invited onto the Phoenix, sold the British some of his cargo of wine, and had toured the Phoenix before being allowed to continue on his way. The Phoenix had at this time been altered to resemble from a distance a large sloop of war. The Didon, which was carrying despatches instructing Rear-Admiral Allemand's five ships of the line to unite with the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Vice-Admiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, intercepted the American merchant and from him received news that a 20-gun British frigate was at sea and might be <b>foolish</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> attack the Didon. The Didons commander, Captain Milius, decided to await the arrival of the British ship, and take her as a prize. The Phoenix was therefore able to approach and engage the Didon before the French realised that she was a larger frigate than they had anticipated. After a sharp action lasting several hours, with Baker on one occasion having his hat shot off his head, the French surrendered. The Phoenix had 12 killed and 28 wounded, the French sustained losses of 27 killed and 44 wounded. By intercepting the ship carrying the despatches for Allemand, Baker had unwittingly played a role in bringing about the battle of Trafalgar, but he was to play an even greater role a few days later, possibly even staving off an invasion of England.|$|E
