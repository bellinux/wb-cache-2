5|$|Lexus {{first entered}} the {{motorsport}} arena in 1999 when its racing unit, Team Lexus, fielded two GS 400 race {{vehicles in the}} Motorola Cup North American Street Stock Championship touring car series. In its 1999 inaugural season, Team Lexus achieved its first victory with its sixth race at Road Atlanta. Led by Sports Car Club of America and International Motor Sports Association <b>driver</b> <b>Chuck</b> Goldsborough, based in Baltimore, Maryland, Team Lexus capitalized on the debut {{of the first generation}} Lexus IS by entering three IS 300s in the third race of the 2001 Grand-Am Cup season at Phoenix, Arizona. Team Lexus won its first IS 300 victory that year at the Virginia International Raceway. In 2002, Team Lexus' competitive efforts in the Grand-Am Cup ST1 (Street Tuner) class achieved victories in the Drivers' and Team Championships, as well as a sweep of the top three finishes at Circuit Mont-Tremblant in Quebec, Canada.|$|E
5|$|Andretti {{made his}} Champ Car debut on April 19, 1964 at the New Jersey State fairgrounds in Trenton, New Jersey. He started sixteenth and {{finished}} eleventh. Andretti {{was introduced by}} his USAC sprint car owner, Rufus Gray, to veteran mechanic Clint Brawner. Brawner was not impressed since sprint car drivers Stan Bowman and Donnie Davis had recently died, and Brawner's current <b>driver,</b> <b>Chuck</b> Hulse, had been critically injured. Chris Economaki recommended Andretti to Brawner, so Brawner watched Andretti race at Terre Haute, Indiana. Brawner was convinced {{that he had found}} the new driver for his team. The two stayed together for six years. Andretti finished eleventh in the USAC National Championship that season. Andretti won his first championship car race at the Hoosier Grand Prix on a road course at Indianapolis Raceway Park in 1965. His third-place finish at the 1965 Indianapolis 500 in the Brawner Hawk (a mechanical copy of the current Brabham Formula 1 design) earned him the race's Rookie of the Year award, and contributed towards Andretti winning the series championship. He was the youngest national champion in series history at age 25. He repeated as series champion in 1966, winning eight of fifteen events. He also won the pole at the 1966 Indianapolis 500. Andretti finished second in the IndyCars in 1967 and 1968. He also won a single non-championship drag race in 1967 in a Ford Mustang. In both 1967 and 1968, Andretti lost the season USAC championship to A. J. Foyt and Bobby Unser, respectively, in the waning laps of the last race of the season at Riverside, California—each by the smallest points margin in history.|$|E
2500|$|He soon {{begins to}} be {{attracted}} to Moore's rebellious daughter - Bobby's sister Ariel - who is dating dirt-track <b>driver</b> <b>Chuck</b> Cranston. After an insult from Chuck, Ren ends up in a game involving buses, and wins despite his inability to drive one. Reverend Moore distrusts Ren and forbids Ariel from ever seeing him again. Ren and his classmates want {{to do away with}} the law and have a senior prom. After a while Ariel begins to fall for Ren and dumps Chuck, they fight and Chuck hits her. Later in church, Moore asks if Ren beat up Ariel. When Moore demands Ren's arrest, Ariel tells him that he can't blame everything on Ren just like he did with Bobby. She then reveals that she is no longer a virgin, which prompts Moore to beg for her to not talk like that in church, having Ariel sarcastically ask Moore if he will pass another law, and how it didn't stop her and Chuck from having sex. But Moore slaps her without warning, which shocks Vi, Moore's wife, and prompts Ariel to tearfully and angrily criticize Moore for slapping her, and storm out of the church. Moore tries to apologize, but Vi stops Moore, telling him, [...] "You've done enough." [...] Vi is supportive of the dancing movement, explaining to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being good to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, Barbasol {{sponsored}} {{a car in}} the Indianapolis 500, and painted it to look like a tube of the cream. Driven by George Bailey, the car made it to lap 166 of 200 before suffering clutch problems. The following year, the Barbasol car finished in tenth place. The team got involved as a sponsor in the NASCAR Busch Series in the late 1990s, sponsoring Dick Bown's team and <b>drivers</b> <b>Chuck</b> and Jim Bown, Jim Sauter, and Greg Biffle in eleven races in 1996, then going to Akins Motorsports and drivers Glenn Allen, Jr. and Elton Sawyer starting in 1997.|$|R
50|$|Ten {{years after}} graduating high school, Sadler Racing in Nashville, Tennessee hired him. While being {{employed}} there {{he became a}} mechanic and rear tire changer for <b>drivers</b> <b>Chuck</b> Bown and Gary Bradberry in the Nationwide Series. He worked there for only two years before being employed at LAR Motorsports (headquartered in Columbia, Tennessee) as a chief mechanic for Casey Atwood and Jeff Purvis during the 1997 and 1998 seasons. In 1999, Ratcliff became the crew chief for then Nationwide Series rookie, Casey Atwood while being employed at Brewco Motorsports. After working as the crew chief for him two years, Casey moved to Evernham Motorsports. Afterward, Jamie McMurray became Ratcliff's new driver.|$|R
50|$|Nate {{meets with}} the <b>driver</b> of <b>Chuck</b> and Blair's limo. The driver {{tells him that}} the brakes were acting weird when he was driving. He later speaks to the limo service {{and it turns out}} that Blair was the one that called the car.|$|R
50|$|Government agent Captain James Madison (Neil Hamilton) spots {{a man in}} Washington D.C. that {{he thinks}} is Otto Lieberman (Victor Varconi), a {{fugitive}} that caused an aircraft crash that killed eight people. Without Lieberman's knowledge, Madison manages to identify him by his fingerprints on a water glass. He then learns his address after having his regular cab <b>driver,</b> <b>Chuck</b> (Lyle Latell), follow him. Lieberman has now assumed the identity of Dr. Frederic Haskell and is working with Bruce Lane (Charles C. Wilson), a wealthy lobbyist suspected of dealing with foreign agents.|$|E

50|$|Reventlow {{began his}} racing career in America in the mid-1950s, {{initially}} with a Mercedes {{before moving to}} an 1100cc Cooper in 1956. The next year he went to Europe to buy a Maserati, which he crashed heavily at Snetterton, escaping unhurt. He also briefly drove a Cooper Formula 2 car, {{before returning to the}} United States. He then set up his own company in Venice, California, to construct Chevrolet-powered race cars he named Scarab with Phil Remington as chief engineer. Along with hired <b>driver</b> <b>Chuck</b> Daigh, the two were initially successful in racing. They won the majority of major sportscar events they entered, often in competition with the Cunningham team of Lister Jaguars. Reventlow had looked at buying a Lister Jaguar, but thought that he could build a better car. Daigh drove a Scarab to victory in the 1958 Riverside International Grand Prix in California, beating a field of international race car teams, including the world-famous race car driver Phil Hill and the Ferrari Team. Carroll Shelby drove a Scarab to first place at Continental Divide Raceways in Castle Rock in Douglas County, Colorado, where he broke a course record.|$|E

5000|$|Biffle {{would go}} on a tear in 1999, when he won nine times, and was in {{contention}} for the championship {{for much of the}} season before finally losing to Jack Sprague. His 2000 season was less dominant with only five wins, but he was able to win the championship by 230 points over teammate Kurt Busch. With Biffle moving up to the Busch Series, in 2001, Roush hired Winston Modified Tour <b>driver</b> <b>Chuck</b> Hossfeld to drive the truck after he won 2000 Roush [...] "Gong Show" [...] competition. Hossfeld struggled in his rookie year, and soon he was released, with a Jon Wood driving the truck {{for the remainder of the}} season. Wood's audition was impressive enough to earn him a full-time run in 2002, and he posted twelve top ten finishes in the U.S. Navy sponsored truck and finished 12th in points in his first full year. Wood had two wins the next year, and finished 15th in points in 2004 before moving on to JTG Racing in the Busch Series. In 2005, Todd Kluever, another [...] "Gong Show" [...] winner, piloted the truck sponsored by Shell Rotella T and World Financial Group. Kluever earned six top five and twelve top ten finishes in his rookie season, winning the Rookie of the Year award. Erik Darnell piloted the newly renumbered 99 truck full-time in 2006 with at first Woolrich, but eventually Northern Tool and Equipment as sponsor to a 2006 Rookie of the Year title. 2007 brought about Darnell's first win at Kansas, but inconsistency left the team 12th in points at season's end. 2008 would be the 99's final season in the Truck Series, as the team was being moved up for a part-time schedule in the Nationwide Series. Darnell captured one win at Michigan by only [...]005 seconds over eventual champion Johnny Benson. This team was shut down after the 2008 season.|$|E

50|$|Kessler born in Seattle, Washington {{and grew}} up in Beverly Hills, California. He {{was the son of a}} {{clothing}} designer.

He raced the road race courses at Paramount Ranch and Willow Springs in California. He was a team <b>driver</b> along with <b>Chuck</b> Daigh for the Scarab race cars built by his good friend Lance Reventlow in the late 1950s.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1927, The Stevens Challenge Trophy {{was offered}} to any {{automobile}} manufacturer {{to run a}} strictly stock, production automobile at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, {{for a period of}} 24 hours at an average speed of 60 miles per hour or more. This was not a race as such, as only one team participated in any instance. Four manufactures earned the trophy over the next 27 years. The trophy was retired after Chrysler's win in 1954. Ford made an unsuccessful run 1956 with <b>drivers</b> Johnny Mantz, <b>Chuck</b> Stevenson, Chuck Davis, and Danny Ames.|$|R
5000|$|In {{examining}} Randall Sullivan's {{assertion that}} the LA Times {{was involved in a}} cover-up conspiracy with the LAPD, it is instructive to note that conflicting theories of the Wallace murder were offered in different sections of the LA Times. The Metro section of the Times wrote that police suspected a connection between the Notorious B.I.G.'s death and the Rampart Division police-corruption scandal, consistent with Sullivan and Poole's theory. The Metro section also ran a photo of Muhammad, identified by police as a mortgage broker unconnected to the murder who appeared to match details of the shooter, and the paper printed his name and <b>driver's</b> license. But <b>Chuck</b> Philips, {{a staff writer for the}} Business section of the Times, who had been following the Wallace investigation and had not heard of the Rampart-Muhammad theory, searched for Muhammad, whom the Metro reporters could not find for comment. It took Philips only three days to find Muhammad, who had a current ad for his mortgage broker business running in the Times. Muhammad, who was not an official suspect at the time, came forward to clear his name. The Metro section of the paper was opposed to running a retraction, but the business desk editor Mark Saylor said [...] "Chuck is sort of the world's authority on rap violence" [...] and pushed, along with Philips, for the paper to retract the article.|$|R
