5000|$|Many key {{upgrades}} {{came to the}} KDX200 in 1989. It received liquid cooling, {{a modified}} powervalve system with larger <b>expansion</b> <b>bottle</b> and valves, a heavier crank, dual disc brakes, heavier clutch springs and more plates, a newly modeled frame with a modern style linkage, KX125-based shock with 16 compression and 16 rebound adjustments, quick release access for rear wheel, large airbox, and a [...] fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|First, {{the late}} {{changes to the}} engine gave rise to design {{features}} that were questionable from an engineering perspective. For example, the water pump was set above the engine. If the engine became hot in traffic, coolant escaped from system via the <b>expansion</b> <b>bottle</b> and the overall fluid level then fell {{below the level of}} the pump. As well as preventing coolant from circulating, this also caused rapid failure of the pump. Even when the system was topped up again, the failed water pump would not circulate coolant and further overheating ensued. Water pump failures also occurred due to poorly hardened drive gears, which wore out prematurely and stopped the water pump.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{experiments}} would include releasing a multi-colored balloon that would remain tethered to the capsule, observing the behavior of liquid in a weightless state inside a closed glass bottle, using a special light meter to determine the visibility of a ground flare, making weather photographs with hand-held cameras, and studying the airglow layer - for which Carpenter would receive special training. The tethered balloon was a 30-inch mylar inflatable sphere, which was folded, packaged, and housed with its gas <b>expansion</b> <b>bottle</b> in the antenna canister. The whole balloon package weighed two pounds. Divided into five sections of different colors - uncolored aluminum, yellow, orange, white, and a phosphorescent coating that appeared white by day and blue by night - the balloon was to be cast off near perigee after the first orbital pass to float freely {{at the end of}} a 100-foot nylon line. The purposes of the balloon experiment were to study the effects of space on the reflection properties of colored surfaces through visual observation and photographic studies and to obtain aerodynamic drag measurements by use of a strain gauge ...|$|E

5000|$|The PBA {{increased}} its membership from 6 to 8 teams, with {{the entry of}} <b>expansion</b> franchises RFM/Cosmos <b>Bottling,</b> Inc. and Pepsi-Cola. The 6 regular PBA ballclubs were allowed to protect 9 players from its rosters, the two new teams will pick those players in the expansion pool.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, BRANA started bottling its own line of soft drinks under the name King Cola along with energy drink TORO. King Cola comes in a variety of flavors such as, banana, strawberry, grape, and cola champagne. The company furthered its product line <b>expansion</b> by adding <b>bottled</b> water to its line of products named Crystal Sources.|$|R
30|$|Simultaneously, {{measurements}} with MGM {{were carried}} out during the first 2  days after fertilization, when the NH 3 emissions {{were expected to be}} high for fertilized treatments. Gas sample suction for MGM started approximately 30  min after the closing of chamber to allow stabilization of NH 3 concentration in the <b>expansion</b> <b>bottle</b> and was repeated three times for treatment during each interval of measurement. Before each measurement, Teflon tubes connecting the system to MGM were cleaned with background air flush.|$|E
30|$|In {{the acid}} trap method, the air stream {{passing through the}} jar and the <b>expansion</b> <b>bottle</b> arrived to a NH 3 {{scrubber}} containing 100  ml of 0.1 N H 2 SO 4, in which absorbed NH 3 was converted to ammonium sulfate. All of the acid samples were stored at 4  °C until the analysis. The amount of NH 3 absorbed in each scrubber was determined using an ionometer (Ion lab, WTW). The NH 3 –N concentration in the outgoing air was calculated from the data of ionometer multiplied by the volume of acid trap.|$|E
50|$|In 1912, Emilio Bacardi {{travelled}} to Egypt, {{where he}} purchased a mummy (still on display) {{for the future}} Emilio Bacardi Moreau Municipal Museum in Santiago de Cuba. In Santiago, his brother Facundo M. Bacardí continued to manage the company along with Schueg, who began the company's international <b>expansion</b> by opening <b>bottling</b> plants in Barcelona (1910) and New York City (1915). The New York plant was soon shut down due to Prohibition, yet during this time Cuba became a hotspot for US tourists.|$|R
50|$|While the {{proposed}} <b>expansion</b> of the <b>bottle</b> bill includes provisions for both deposits paid by consumers {{as well as}} handling fees paid by industry, a portion of deposits paid are expected to remain unredeemed. These forfeited deposits are paid into the Commonwealth's General Fund. Revenue from unclaimed deposits has been estimated to be around $34million per year, prompting Governor Patrick to propose dedicating $6.5million of this new revenue to the state's Department of Environmental Protection recycling and solid waste program. Under {{the proposed}} ballot initiative, the forfeited deposits would be directed to environmental programs.|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{thermodynamics}} {{of the water}} rocket in the thrust phase, {{taking into account the}} expansion of the air with water vapor, vapor condensation and the energy taken from the environment. We set up a simple experimental device with a stationary bottle and verified that the gas <b>expansion</b> in the <b>bottle</b> is well approximated by a polytropic process PV^β= constant, where the parameter β depends on the initial conditions. We find an analytical expression for β that only depends on the thermodynamic initial conditions and is in good agreement with the experimental results.

40|$|Using {{observed}} data for wide-band type IV solar radio bursts, the onset time {{differences between the}} microwave and metric frequencies and the peak flux intensities of the metric component were analyzed {{as a function of}} the longitudinal position of associated flares on the solar disk. It is shown that this time difference is dependent on the position of associated flares and that the peak flux intensity reaches maximum when a flare occurs in the region 10 to 40 deg west of the central meridian of the solar disk. These results are explained by taking into account the eastward <b>expansion</b> of magnetic <b>bottles</b> which trap mildly relativistic electrons responsible for type IV bursts. Discussion is also made of the relation between these magnetic bottles and shock waves which excite type II radio bursts...|$|R
50|$|The local use of grog {{tempering}} for {{pottery and}} the gradual adoption of shell tempered pottery associated with other areas has allowed archaeologists to track trade {{interactions with the}} people of the Sims Site and peoples from these other areas. During the second occupation period trade expanded, and the local ceramics show connections to Lower Mississippi Valley peoples and Plaquemine peoples located near modern-day Barataria Bay and to peoples of the Pensacola culture, located on the upper Gulf Coast near what is modern-day Biloxi, Mississippi. This period, between 1100 and 1450 CE, was during the initial phases of occupation and <b>expansion</b> of the <b>Bottle</b> Creek Site, the major center of the Pensacola culture. This period also sees the most significant Plaquemine connections at the site. The next phase sees increasing contact with Mississipianized Plaquemine peoples from as far up the Mississippi River as the Baton Rouge area, as well as continued interaction with the Mississippian Pensacola peoples.|$|R
40|$|The {{consumption}} {{of bottled water}} is likely to emerge as a global trend in the coming decades. The <b>expansion</b> of the <b>bottled</b> water industry and rapid growth of bottled water sales has caused serious concerns regarding the possible contamination of bottled water, the impact of its refuse on the environment, and the management of water resources. Some factors accelerating the sales and use of bottled water are complex and multifaceted and involve pollution, values, politics, water shortages, commercial behaviors, consumption behaviors, a widening disparity {{between the rich and}} poor within society, and the unfair distribution of resources. Any single solution is unlikely to alter the overall circumstances. However, some relevant issues may be altered or alleviated through individual effort, such as the habit of drinking bottled water. Based on the data collected through surveys and interviews, if the user experience of a reusable water bottle can be improved by increasing its portability, the consumers’ intention to use reusable water bottles will increase, resulting in encouragement of the habit of drinking tap water and a decrease in the reliance on bottled water. The more that people drink tap water, then the less that bottled water consumption will negatively affect the environment, society, and the public health...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a new}} {{beverage}} container on the market, {{a bottle}} made out of pure aluminum {{as a replacement for}} the traditional container made out of glass. This new container has the potential to reduce both cost and pollution during transportation, the lighter and stronger construction has every advantage compared to the old one in glass. The new container has every possibility to make it on the market. Some of the biggest brands within the soft drink market already use these bottles in countries without any recycling demands like: Coca-Cola, Heineken and Pepsi. The only thing stopping these brands from the Swedish market is the lack of a functional return system, there is only one company that uses the bottle in Sweden today and they take care of their own used bottles. All their customers get to send in their bottles via postal service and then they transport the bottles to the dump. That system might work when selling an expensive bottle but the cost would far outnumber the profit if Coca-Cola used a similar system. By offering a system that deals with the bottle from the time of consumption until the aluminum it’s melting in the oven all problems in handling used bottles are eliminated. With a functional return system new brands can enter the market without having to create a system of their own. This way the need grows with the <b>expansion</b> of the <b>bottles.</b> This report describes how a perfect return system should work and the key areas that make it as efficient as it can ever be. The work effort has been focused on the heart of the project: the machine that’s going to reduce the volume and cut the bottles before transportation. A fully functional prototype has been modified and evaluated in the quest for the optimal cutting force. With a functional system that helps buyers and users, there is nothing that can stop the new aluminum bottle. It has the potential to completely take over after the glass bottle and eventually compete with the aluminum can...|$|R
40|$|This study uses {{life-cycle}} assessment (LCA) methodology {{to quantify}} life-cycle energy use, greenhouse gas emissions, solid waste generation and water use for delivering drinking water to consumer {{households in the}} United States. Three systems were considered in this analysis: 1) single-use disposable bottled water (500 ml) sold in 24 -packs, 2) Home and office delivery bottled water, 3) municipal tap water. For both the HOD and municipal tap systems, drinking water is served in a reusable drinking vessel (bottle or cup) that is periodically washed in a residential dishwasher. Variants of each system were constructed to represent a range of possible real-world scenarios using factors such as bottle type (virgin PET, rPET), water type (natural source, municipal source), distribution (regional, national, overseas), end-of-life treatment (landfill disposal, recycling), type of reusable drinking vessel (steel bottle, glass cup) and frequency of washing the reusable vessel. With respect to life-cycle energy, solid waste, greenhouse gas emission and water use, the municipal tap systems outperform both HOD and single-use bottled systems. Single-use bottled systems consume 11 - 31 times more energy than tap systems. Production of plastic bottles is responsible for over 70 % of the energy use of regional bottled systems, while with national and overseas distribution, transportation begins to dominate. Tap and HOD system energy use is dominated by residential washing of the reusable drinking vessel. Greenhouse gas emissions generally correlate with energy use. HOD systems consume 8 - 18 % of energy relative to single-use systems, while municipal tap systems use 35 - 55 % of HOD lifecycle energy. For solid waste, single-use systems perform the worst, followed by the HOD and municipal tap systems respectively. End-of-life treatment of bottles dictates single-use systems solid waste profile. From an environmental perspective, municipal tap water is the preferred drinking water system. Strategies to reduce the impact of bottled water may include bans at the organizational level (city governments, universities, and restaurants), education and outreach to encourage consumers to choose tap water and the <b>expansion</b> of state <b>bottle</b> bills to improve recovery of empty bottles. Results of this study {{can be used to}} inform consumers and legislators of the impacts of their choices with regard to drinking water...|$|R
