40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the concept of {{documentary}} filmmaking and the treating of reality herein. The paper estimates a conceptual definition of the documentary genre – and discusses the satisfaction of this concept later on. From the theories of the applied theoreticians, this study settles that a documentary is often a combination between several documentary modes, which can make its message and intention a complex issue. Furthermore, it is examined whether the staged subject has certain behaviour {{in front of the}} camera – and it is discussed how this can affect the overall understanding of the documentary’s portrayed story. With a starting point in an analysis of the present fiction cinematographic elements in the <b>dramatized</b> <b>documentary,</b> The Fear of 13, it is deliberated whether or not the documentary film can be considered a genuine representation of reality – a useful enlightenment about existence and possibly a relevant source in a political debate – or whether it is simply to be regarded as a form of art – and treated accordingly...|$|E
