Individual and population assays for this response were developed and mutants were selected <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>inability</b> to avoid high concentrations of fructose or NaCl. Seven nonavoiding mutants representing six complementation groups were isolated and characterized. Genetic studies indicate that the mutants each carry a single recessive mutation responsible for the defective osmotic avoidance behavior. The map locations of the six complementation groups identified by these mutations have been determined. Mutants isolated <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>inability</b> to avoid fructose are also unable to avoid NaCl and vice versa. The mutants move normally, exhibit normal touch sensitivity, and, like wild type, follow isotherms in a radial thermal gradient. All of the mutants are at least partially defective in the attraction to sodium chloride exhibited by wild type. None of the mutants is temperature sensitive, and all exhibit defective osmotic avoidance behavior as young L 1 larvae. Preliminary anatomical studies indicate selective sensory neuron changes in at least one mutant...|$|R

40|$|Economists {{have been}} blamed <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>inability</b> to {{forecast}} and address crises. This article attributes this inability to intertwined factors: {{the lack of}} a coherent definition of crises, the reference-class problem, the lack of imagination regarding the nature of future crises and sample-selection biases. Specifically, economists tend to adapt their views on crises to recent episodes, and omit averted and potential crises. Threshold-based definitions of crises run the risk of being ad hoc. Using historical examples, this article highlights some epistemological shortcomings of the current approach. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Ontogenetic {{variation}} in plasticity {{is important to}} understanding mechanisms and patterns of thermal tolerance variation. The Bogert effect postulates that, to compensate <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>inability</b> to behaviourally thermoregulate, less-mobile life stages of ectotherms are expected to show greater plasticity of thermal tolerance than more-mobile life stages. We test this general prediction by comparing plasticity of thermal tolerance (rapid cold-hardening, RCH) between mobile adults and less-mobile larvae of 16 Drosophila species. We find an RCH response in adults of 13 species but only in larvae of four species. Thus, the Bogert effect is not as widespread as expected. 4 page(s...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} how people compensate <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>inability</b> {{to accommodate the}} needs of others in service encounters. Being unable to meet others 2 ̆ 7 needs violates the positive face of one of the participants in a discourse. Many previous studies on speech acts demonstrate how people control their utterances to avoid causing a face-threatening act. However, the language behavior that follows a face-threatening act has not yet received much focus. This paper looks at two different kinds of data in Japan and the United State (hereafter 2 ̆ 2 U. S. 2 ̆ 2) using two different approaches: observation and role-play. In the first, the observational phase, the author acted as a customer in several convenience stores in Japan and asked for an item that they did not carry. In the U. S., a native English speaker interacted with the salesclerk as the customer. (No recording device was used in either situation.) All exchanges were immediately recorded by hand and later coded by semantic formulas. In the second, the role-play phase, native speakers were asked to role-play a parallel situation in which they acted as a salesclerk and had to react to not being able to satisfy customers 2 ̆ 7 requests. The results demonstrate that Japanese sales clerks compensate in the face of <b>their</b> <b>inability</b> to meet another 2 ̆ 7 s need (they avoid a direct face-threatening act) whereas most U. S. sales clerks do not attempt to compensate <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>inability.</b> These behaviors correlate with social expectations of the participants within both respective service encounters. Moreover, the results also suggest a re-thinking of speech acts and emphasize the importance of natural data...|$|R
