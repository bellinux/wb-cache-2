40|$|Abstract: Thermal {{remote sensing}} of soil {{moisture}} in vineyards is a challenge. The <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soil,</b> {{in addition to}} a standing grape canopy, create complex patterns of heating and cooling and increase the surface temperature variability between vine rows. In this study, we evaluate the strength of relationships between soil moisture, mechanical resistance and thermal inertia calculated from the drop of surface temperature during a clear sky night over a vineyard in the Niagara region. We utilized data from two sensors, an airborne thermal camera (height ≈ 500 m a. g. l.) and a handheld thermal gun (height ≈ 1 m a. g. l.), to explore the effects of different field of views and the high inter-row temperature variability. Spatial patterns of soil moisture correlated more with estimated thermal inertia than with surface temperature recorded at sunrise or sunset. Despite the coarse resolution of airborne thermal inertia images, it performed better than estimates from the handheld thermal gun. Between-row variation was further analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. Despite the limited spatial variability of soil properties within a single vineyard, the magnitudes of the model coefficients for soil moisture and mechanical resistance ar...|$|E

On the pure sand, plant seedlings formed higher air-dry matter in comparison with the soil from a farming field. Independently of soil material, soybean and winter wheat seedlings formed the longest roots, aboveground parts and highest content of air-dry matter. On the soil from the grassy side space of the street roots of seedlings were significantly longer than roots of seedlings germinated on soil from a farming field.

40|$|An image {{obtained}} by the C-band VV-polarized ERS- 1 SAR is examined with respect to potential land applications. A scene obtained near noon on August 15, 1991, along the U. S. -Canadian border near Sault Ste. Marie is calibrated relative to an array of trihedral corner reflectors and active radar calibrators distributed across the swath. Extensive contemporaneous ground observations of forest stands are used to predict the radar backscattering coefficient sigma {{at the time of}} the SAR overpass using a first-order vector radiative transfer model. These predictions generally agree with the calibrated ERS- 1 data to within 1 dB. It is demonstrated that the dynamic range of sigma is sufficient to perform limited discrimination of various forest and grassland communities even for a single-date observation. Furthermore, retrieval of near-surface soil moisture is feasible for <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soils</b> when plant biomass is less than 1 tonne/ha...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to assess the {{effectiveness}} of two grass covers (buffer zone and grass-covered inter-row), to reduce pesticide leaching, and subsequently to preserve groundwater quality. Lower amounts of pesticides leached through <b>grass-cover</b> <b>soil</b> columns (2. 7 e 24. 3 % of the initial amount) than the bare soil columns (8. 0 e 55. 1 %), in correspondence with their sorption coefficients. Diuron was recovered in higher amounts in leachates (8. 9 e 32. 2 %) than tebuconazole (2. 7 e 12. 9 %), in agreement with their sorption coefficients. However, despite having a sorption coefficient {{similar to that of}} diuron, more procymidone was recovered in the leachates (10. 2 e 55. 1 %), probably due to its facilitated transport by dissolved organic matter. Thus even in this very permeable soil, higher organic matter contents associated with grass-cover reduce the amount of pesticide leaching and limit the risk of groundwater contamination by the pesticides. The results of diuron and tebuconazole transfer through undisturbed buffer zone soil columns are in agreement with field observations on the buffer zone...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to perform imaging radar and scatterometer measurements over the Konza Prairie {{as a part of}} the First International land surface climatology project Field Experiments (EIFE) and to develop an mm-wave radiometer and the data acquisition system for this radiometer. We collected imaging radar data with the University of Kansas Side-Looking Airborne Radar (SLAR) operating at 9. 375 GHz and scatterometer data with a helicopter-mounted scatterometer at 5. 3 and 9. 6 GHz. We also developed a 35 -GHz null-balancing radiometer and data acquisition system. Although radar images showed good delineation of various features of the FIFE site, the data were not useful for quantitative analysis for extracting soil moisture information because of day-to-day changes in the system transfer characteristics. Our scatterometer results show that both C and X bands are sensitive to soil moisture variations over <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soils.</b> Scattering coefficients near vertical are about 4 dB lower for unburned areas because of the presence of a thatch layer, in comparison with those for burned areas. The results of the research have been documented in reports, oral presentations, and published papers...|$|R
40|$|A <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soil</b> filter {{of native}} {{calcareous}} loam, 200 -feet long, 4 -feet wide and 5 -feet deep, was tested for effectiveness as a water-quality treatment for Tucson urban storm runoff. Water was pumped from Arcadia Wash {{and applied to}} the filter in four trials in Fall 1971. Inflow and outflow volumes were measured, sampled and analyzed for important water-quality variables. For grass and grass-soil filtration respectively, the following maximum percent reductions, compared to untreated runoff, occurred: For chemical oxygen demand (COD), 19 and 88; for suspended solids, 34 and 99. 6; for volatile suspended solids, 26 and 97; for turbidity, 97 and 98; for total coliforms, 84 and 98; and for fecal coliforms, 50 and 98. Grass-soil filtration, during the four trials, produced water too saline for most uses. After the initial stabilization period, grass-soil filtration was more effective than grass filtration in water-quality improvement. Grass soil filtration had, with time, increasing COD and salt concentrations {{in the early part}} of each trial, and decreasing infiltration rates. Grass maturity and soil compaction, following construction of the filter, initially increased efficiency of the water-quality improvement process. Grass filtration upgraded cool-season urban runoff for recreation, irrigation, artificial groundwater recharge, fisheries and wildlife, except in the initial part of some trials and in the grass establishment period when COD, volatile suspended solids and coliforms increased. Chlorination of treated runoff is necessary, particularly for warm-season flows, when recreational water use is anticipated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Climatic {{changes at}} the Earth’s surface {{propagate}} slowly downward {{into the ground and}} modify the ambient ground thermal regime. However, causes of soil temperature changes in the upper few meters are not well documented. One major obstacle to understanding the linkage between the soil thermal regime and climatic change is the lack of long-term observations of soil temperatures and related climatic variables. Such measurements were made throughout the former Soviet Union with some records beginning {{at the end of the}} 19 th century. In this paper, we use records from Irkutsk, Russia, to demonstrate how the soil temperature responded to climatic changes over the last century. Both air temperature and precipitation at Irkutsk increased from the late 1890 s to the 1990 s. Changes in air temperature mainly occurred in winter, while changes in precipitation happened mainly during summer. There was an anti-correlation between mean annual air temperature and annual total precipitation, i. e., more (less) precipitation during cold (warm) years. There were no significant trends of changes in the first day of snow on the ground in autumn, but snow steadily disappeared earlier in spring, resulting in a reduction of the snow cover duration. A <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soil</b> experiences seasonal freezing for more than nine months each year and the long-term average maximum depth of seasonally frozen soils was about 177 cm with a range from 91 cm to 260 cm.

40|$|Soil {{water content}} and actual water {{repellency}} were assessed for soil profiles at two sites in a bare and grasscovered plot of a sand pasture, {{to investigate the}} impact of the grass removal on both properties. The soil of the plots was sampled six times in vertical transects to a depth of 33 cm between 23 May and 7 October 2002. On each sampling date the soil water contents were measured and the persistence of actual water repellency was determined of field-moist samples. Considerably higher soil water contents were found in the bare versus the grass-covered plots. These alterations are caused by differences between evaporation and transpiration rates across the plots. Noteworthy are the often excessive differences in soil water content at depths of 10 to 30 cm between the bare and grass-covered plots. These differences are a consequence of water uptake by the roots in the grass-covered plots. The water storage in the upper 19 cm of the bare soil was at least two times greater than in the <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soil</b> during dry periods. A major part of the soil profile in the grass-covered plots exhibited extreme water repellency to a depth of 19 cm on all sampling dates, while the soil profile of the bare plots was completely wettable on eight of the twelve sampling dates. Significant differences in persistence of actual water repellency were found between the grass-covered and bare plots...|$|E
40|$|Endemic to the Namib Desert, Fairy Circles (FCs) are vegetation-free {{circular}} patterns surrounded and delineated by grass species. Since {{first reported}} the 1970 ’s, many theories {{have been proposed}} to explain their appearance, but none provide a fully satisfactory explanation of their origin(s) and/or causative agent(s). In this study, we have evaluated an early hypothesis stating that edaphic microorganisms could be involved in their formation and/or maintenance. Surface soils (0 – 5 cm) from three different zones (FC center, FC margin and external, <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soils)</b> of five independent FCs were collected in April 2013 in the Namib Desert gravel plains. T-RFLP fingerprinting of the bacterial (16 S rRNA gene) and fungal (ITS region) communities, in parallel with two-way crossed ANOSIM, showed that FC communities were significantly different to those of external control vegetated soil and that each FC was also characterized by significantly different communities. Intra-FC communities (margin and centre) presented higher variability than the controls. Together, these results provide clear evidence that edaphic microorganisms {{are involved in the}} Namib Desert FC phenomenon. However, we are, as yet, unable to confirm whether bacteria and/or fungi communities are responsible for the appearance and development of FCs or are a general consequence of the presence of the grass-free circles.

When the 9 cm thick humous topsoil was wetted to 20 - 25 vol. %, preferred flow paths, or fingers, were formed in the sandy subosil. The fingers started at the layer interface at `weak' spots with a relatively low degree of potential water-repellency, and protruded vertically into the sandy subsoil. The fingers disappeared during dry periods and recurred at the same locations during new rain events...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Air {{temperatures}} and soil temperatures at the surface, two inches, and four inches under a grass cover were recorded over a 93 day period. These data were used {{along with other}} temperature data from bare soil {{in the construction of}} three sets of models for the prediction of maximum and minimum daily temperatures at several depths below bare and <b>grass-covered</b> <b>soils.</b> The model set having the most accurate predictions was used in conjunction with models for predicting the temperature-dependent postdiapause development of the western cherry fruit fly, Rhagoletis indifferens Curran. Postdiapause developmental rates of R. indifferens pupae collected from Albany, Oregon and Zillah, Washington were determined under constant temperature conditions. Mean times until adult emergence from Albany puparia and Zillah puparia exposed to the same constant temperature were found to be significantly different (α =. 01) for all temperatures tested (15. 5 °C., 19. 5 °C., and 25. 5 °C.). Mean times until adult emergence from Zillah puparia held in moist sand at 15. 5 °C. and in dry sand at 15. 5 °C. were also found to be significantly different (α =. 01). Thus, geographical location and presence or absence of moisture were implicated as factors which may affect the accuracy of the postdiapause development models. Albany puparia were exposed to two alternating temperature regimes to determine if the mean time of adult emergence under alternating temperature conditions can be predicted using constant temperature developmental rate data. The observed mean time of emergence from puparia exposed to a regime with extreme temperature changes was found to be significantly different (α =. 01) from the expected mean time of emergence. No significant difference (α =. 01) was found between observed and expected mean times of emergence from puparia exposed to the other regime, in which temperatures more closely simulated those found in the field. Albany puparia from which no emergence occurred were dissected to determine the developmental stages of their contents. These data were used in an attempt to determine the upper and lower temperature thresholds for postdiapause development. Thirty degrees C. was established as the upper threshold. A lower threshold was not clearly shown, although the data suggest that it is greater than 6 °C. Four models of the postdiapause development of R. indifferens were constructed and evaluated for accuracy of predictions of the times of several levels of adult emergence from an experimental abandoned orchard in Albany, Oregon. The models predict temperature-dependent postdiapause development based on soil temperatures predicted by the soil temperature model set. Three of the models predict postdiapause development on the basis of day-degree relationships. The predictions of the fourth model are based upon a nonlinear temperature-dependent developmental rate function. This model predicted the times of adult emergence with mean errors of ca. two days per year. Thus, it was found to likely be more accurate than other models reported here and elsewhere for the prediction of the times of various levels of emergence of the adult western cherry fruit fly...|$|R
40|$|The {{removal of}} enteric and tracer viruses by the {{overland}} runoff mode of domestic wastewater treatment was evaluated. Raw and {{primary and secondary}} treated wastewaters were sprayed onto <b>grass-covered,</b> 36 -m <b>soil</b> plots of fine, sandy loam overlying an impermeable clay subsoil. Tracer bacteriophage f 2 was seeded into the applied wastewaters, which were subsequently sampled at several points {{along the length of}} the plots. Assay of effluent samples revealed modest tracer virus removals of 30 to 60 %. Data from timed experiments indicated that advancement of tracer virus to the bottom of the slopes proceeded at the same rate as wastewater, reaching the plot effluents within 50 to 90 min after application. Indigenous enteric virus levels were reduced by approximately 68 to 85 % during migration down the treatment slopes. Soil sampling revealed that, although some f 2 virus was found associated with the wastewater-saturated topsoil, little penetration of virus into the soil profile occurred. Laboratory soil adsorption studies revealed that poliovirus I was adsorbed much more readily than f 2 virus. Comparison of virus removal characteristics during overland runoff with chemical removal characteristics of wastewater did not reveal any obvious correlations that could be used to predict virus removal...|$|R
