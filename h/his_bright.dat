25|$|George Peppard's screen {{presence}} {{has some}} agreeable anomalies. He is tough, assured and insolent – {{in a way}} that recalls late Dick Powell rather than early Bogart; but <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> blue eyes and blond hair, his boyish face suggest the all-American athlete, perhaps going to seed. The sophistication is surface deep: you can imagine him in Times Square on a Saturday night, sulky, defiant, out of his depth, not quite certain how he wants to spend the evening.|$|E
25|$|One of Abu Tir's most {{noticeable}} physical attributes and trademarks is <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> orange beard. The orange {{is actually a}} dyed substance called henna, a natural dyestuff, which needs to be applied periodically {{in order to maintain}} its lustrous colour. In an interview with the Israeli Channel 10 television Abu Tir stated that he had decided to dye his beard with henna because the prophet Muhammad had done so and also because it was a remedy for headaches and dandruff. Islam bans the use of black hair dyes; however, {{there is no mention of}} a ban on the use of other colours. Residents in his native village of Umm Tuba say that his signature beard does help him stand out when he is out campaigning at public events and functions.|$|E

25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. <b>His</b> <b>bright</b> nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and thought it might be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had to rush to her side.|$|E

500|$|In Norse mythology, Surtr (Old Norse [...] "black" [...] or [...] "the swarthy one") is a jötunn. Surtr is attested in the Poetic Edda, {{compiled}} in the 13th century {{from earlier}} traditional sources, and the Prose Edda, {{written in the}} 13th century by Snorri Sturluson. In both sources, Surtr is foretold as being a major figure during the events of Ragnarök; carrying <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> sword, he will go to battle against the Æsir, he will do battle with the major god Freyr, and afterward the flames that he brings forth will engulf the Earth.|$|E

500|$|While Sinatra never {{formally}} {{learned how}} to read music, he had an impressive understanding of it, and he worked very hard from a young age to improve his abilities {{in all aspects of}} music. A perfectionist, renowned for his dress sense and performing presence, he always insisted on recording live with his band. <b>His</b> <b>bright</b> blue eyes earned him the popular nickname [...] "Ol' Blue Eyes". Sinatra led a colorful personal life, and was often involved in turbulent affairs with women, such as with his second wife Ava Gardner. He went on to marry Mia Farrow in 1966 and Barbara Marx in 1976. Sinatra had several violent confrontations, usually with journalists he felt had crossed him, or work bosses with whom he had disagreements. He was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors in 1983, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Ronald Reagan in 1985, and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997. Sinatra was also the recipient of eleven Grammy Awards, including the Grammy Trustees Award, Grammy Legend Award and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After his death, American music critic Robert Christgau called him [...] "the greatest singer of the 20th century", and he continues to be seen as an iconic figure.|$|E

In the case of William Tucker, the first Black person born in the colonies, freedom was <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> right. He was son of [...] "Antony and Isabell", a married couple from Angola who worked as indentured servants for Captain William Tucker whom he was named after. Yet, court records show {{that at least one}} African had been declared a slave by 1640; John Punch. [...] He was an indentured servant who ran away along with two White indentured servants and he was sentenced by the governing council to lifelong servitude. This action is what officially marked the institution of slavery in Jamestown and the future United States.|$|E

He was elected to the position in the Palestinian legislative elections that were held on 25 January 2006. Abu Tir is known for <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> orange henna-dyed beard which separates him from most other politicians and members of his community. He tended to keep a low media profile before he was placed in Israeli prison for four years: On 29 June 2006, Abu Tir was arrested by Israeli military authorities in the 2006 Israel-Gaza conflict. He was held until June 2010, after which Israel ordered him to leave the country because he refused to resign from the Hamas legislature. [...] On June, 2010, he was rearrested after he failed to leave East Jerusalem.|$|E

2500|$|Pepper gave lukewarm {{support to}} Harry S. Truman in 1948, saying the Democrats should {{nominate}} Dwight D.

Ed Ball, a power in state politics who had broken with Pepper, financed his opponent, U.S. Representative George A. Smathers. A former supporter of Pepper, Smathers repeatedly attacked [...] "Red Pepper" [...] for having far-left sympathies, condemning both his support for universal health care and his alleged support for the Soviet Union. Pepper had traveled to the Soviet Union in 1945 and, after meeting Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, declared he was [...] "a man Americans could trust."

Although many hagiographers remark about <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> clothing, rich friends, and love of pleasures, his {{displays}} of disillusionment toward the world that surrounded him came fairly early in his life, as {{is shown in the}} [...] "story of the beggar". In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for alms. At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets. His friends quickly chided and mocked him for his act of charity. When he got home, his father scolded him in rage.|$|E

2500|$|To his {{responsibilities}} Eugene attached {{his own personal}} values—physical courage, loyalty to his sovereign, honesty, self-control in all things—and he expected these qualities from his commanders. Eugene's approach was dictatorial, but {{he was willing to}} co-operate with someone he regarded as his equal, such as Baden or Marlborough. Yet the contrast to his co-commander of the Spanish Succession war were stark. [...] "Marlborough," [...] wrote Churchill, [...] "was the model husband and father, concerned with building up a home, founding a family, and gathering a fortune to sustain it"; whereas Eugene, the bachelor, was [...] "disdainful of money, content with <b>his</b> <b>bright</b> sword and his lifelong animosities against Louis XIV. The result was an austere figure, inspiring respect and admiration rather than affection. The huge equestrian statue in the centre of Vienna commemorates Eugene's achievements. It is inscribed on one side, 'To the wise counsellor of three Emperors', and on the other, 'To the glorious conqueror of Austria's enemies'.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Rothko {{was one of}} the {{painters}} that Greenberg referred to as a Color Field painter exemplified by Magenta, Black, Green on Orange, although Rothko himself refused to adhere to any label. For Rothko, color was [...] "merely an instrument." [...] In a sense, his best known works – the [...] "multiforms" [...] and his other signature paintings – are, in essence, the same expression, albeit one of purer (or less concrete or definable, depending on your interpretation) means, which is that of the same [...] "basic human emotions," [...] as his earlier surrealistic mythological paintings. What is common among these stylistic innovations is a concern for [...] "tragedy, ecstasy and doom." [...] By 1958, whatever spiritual expression Rothko meant to portray on canvas, it was growing increasingly darker. <b>His</b> <b>bright</b> reds, yellows and oranges of the early 1950s subtly transformed into dark blues, greens, grays and blacks. His final series of paintings from the mid-1960s were gray, and black with white borders, seemingly abstract landscapes of an endless bleak, tundra-like, unknown country.|$|E

Darwin wrote at the time, [...] "Our only consolation is that she passed a short, though joyous life." [...] For three years he had deliberated about the Christian meaning of mortality. This opened a new vision of tragically circumstantial nature. His faith in Christianity had already dwindled away and he had stopped going to church. He wrote out his memories of Annie, but no longer believed in an afterlife or in salvation. Emma believed that Annie had gone to heaven and told this to the children, with the unfortunate result that Henrietta wondered, if all the angels were men, did women go to heaven?, and worried for months that her naughtiness while Annie was alive would mean that {{she would go to}} hell unless God forgave her.|$|E
