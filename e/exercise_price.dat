25|$|Selling a {{straddle}} (selling both a put and {{a call at}} the same <b>exercise</b> <b>price)</b> would give a trader a greater profit than a butterfly if the final stock price is near the <b>exercise</b> <b>price,</b> but might result in a large loss.|$|E
25|$|A trader who {{expects a}} stock's price to {{decrease}} {{can buy a}} put option to sell the stock at a fixed price ("strike price") at a later date. The trader will be {{under no obligation to}} sell the stock, but only has the right to do so at or before the expiration date. If the stock price at expiration is below the <b>exercise</b> <b>price</b> by more than the premium paid, he will make a profit. If the stock price at expiration is above the <b>exercise</b> <b>price,</b> he will let the put contract expire and only lose the premium paid. In the transaction, the premium also plays a major role as it enhances the break-even point. For example, if <b>exercise</b> <b>price</b> is 100, premium paid is 10, then a spot price of 100 to 90 is not profitable. He would make a profit if the spot price is below 90.|$|E

40|$|Although <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> for {{executive}} {{stock options}} {{can be set}} either below or above the grant-date market price, in practice virtually all options are granted at the money. We offer an economic rationale for this apparent puzzle, by showing that pay-to-performance incentives for risk-averse undiversified executives are typically maximized by setting <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> at (or near) the grant-date market price. We provide an operationally useful alternative to Black-Scholes (1973) {{for the purpose of}} both valuing executive stock options and measuring the incentives created by options. Our framework has implications not only for exercise-price policies, but also for indexed options, option repricings, exchanges of cash for stock-based compensation, and the design of bonus plans. ...|$|R

25|$|In 2001, Jobs {{was granted}} stock {{options in the}} amount of 7.5million shares of Apple with an <b>exercise</b> <b>price</b> of $18.30. It was alleged that the options had been backdated, and that the <b>exercise</b> <b>price</b> should have been $21.10. It was further alleged that Jobs had thereby {{incurred}} taxable income of $20,000,000 that he did not report, and that Apple overstated its earnings by that same amount. As a result, Jobs potentially faced a number of criminal charges and civil penalties. The case was the subject of active criminal and civil government investigations, though an independent internal Apple investigation completed on December 29, 2006 found that Jobs was unaware of these issues and that the options granted to him were returned without being exercised in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The {{holder of}} an American style call option can sell his option holding {{at any time}} until the {{expiration}} date, and would consider doing so when the stock's spot price is above the <b>exercise</b> <b>price,</b> especially if he expects {{the price of the}} option to drop. By selling the option early in that situation, the trader can realise an immediate profit. Alternatively, he can exercise the option — for example, if there is no secondary market for the options — and then sell the stock, realising a profit. A trader would make a profit if the spot price of the shares rises by more than the premium. For example, if the <b>exercise</b> <b>price</b> is 100 and premium paid is 10, then if the spot price of 100 rises to only 110 the transaction is break-even; an increase in stock price above 110 produces a profit.|$|E
40|$|Various {{theoretical}} models show that managerial compensation schemes {{can reduce the}} distortionary effects of financial leverage. There is mixed evidence as to whether highly levered firms offer less stock-based compensation, a common prediction of such models. Both the theoretical and empirical research, however, have overlooked the leverage provided by executive stock options. In principle, adjusting the <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> of executive stock options can mitigate the risk incentive effects of financial leverage. We show that the near-universal practice of setting option <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> near the prevailing stock price at the date of grant effectively undoes most {{of the effects of}} financial leverage. In a large cross-sectional sample of Canadian option-granting firms, we find evidence that executives' incentives to take equity risk are negatively rather than positively related to the leverage of their employers.

40|$|In empirically {{deriving}} risk-neutral densities (RNDs) from option prices, {{one of the}} {{key assumptions}} that the strike prices should be continuous over the entire spectrum of nonnegative real numbers, is not met due to market trading mechanism. This study looks at how this failure affects the empirical RND. It also tests the possible impact that bid-ask spread has on the empirical RNDs. With Heston (1993) option pricing model of stochastic volatility as a mapping tool between option prices and risk-neutral price distributions and realistic assumptions of option specifications, simulation results show that RNDs are less stable and reliable when there are a limited number of different strike prices, even less so when bid-ask spread is incorporated into option prices. Nontechnical Summary Future risk-neutral asset price distributions can be derived from traded options that are written on the asset. In the empirical derivation of these risk-neutral densities (RNDs), some microstructure issues have to be considered. This study looks into the effect of two such issues on the empirical RNDs, the discrete and limited range of <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> and the existence of bid-ask spread. The study adopts a simulation-and-testing approach. It assumes that the underlying price distribution follows stochastic volatility and uses Heston's stochastic volatility model for European options as the pricing framework. With specified structural parameters for the Heston model and option specifications, including the current underlying asset price, the time to maturity, the interest rate, it simulates option prices first and tries to infer the assumed asset distribution with different subset of the option prices corresponding to varying number and level of <b>exercise</b> <b>prices.</b> When comparing the original assume RNDs with the empirical RNDs from a subset, we {{are in a position to}} detect the influence that discrete and limited range of <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> have on the empirical RNDs. Test statistics suggest that RNDs from the lower end of <b>exercise</b> <b>prices</b> deviate most from the original price distribution, especially in the tails. We then perturb the option prices with bid-ask spread. The bid-ask spread is estimated from a model, in which the spread is explained by option characteristics and underlying asset market activities. Statistical tests show that when the bid-ask spread is incorporated into option prices, the derived risk-neutral densities are even less accurate and stable. Therefore, great caution is needed when the empirical densities are used for pricing derivatives, asset market sentiments and so on. ...|$|R
25|$|Strategies {{are often}} used to {{engineer}} a particular risk profile to movements in the underlying security. For example, buying a butterfly spread (long one X1 call, short two X2 calls, and long one X3 call) allows a trader to profit if the stock price on the expiration date is near the middle <b>exercise</b> <b>price,</b> X2, and does not expose the trader to a large loss.|$|E
25|$|One {{well-known}} {{strategy is}} the covered call, {{in which a}} trader buys a stock (or holds a previously-purchased long stock position), and sells a call. If the stock price rises above the <b>exercise</b> <b>price,</b> the call will be exercised and the trader will get a fixed profit. If the stock price falls, the call will not be exercised, and any loss incurred to the trader will be partially offset by the premium received from selling the call. Overall, the payoffs match the payoffs from selling a put. This relationship is known as put-call parity and offers insights for financial theory.

In this application of the Black-Scholes model, a coordinate transformation from the price domain to the volatility domain is obtained. Rather than quoting option prices in terms of dollars per unit (which are hard to compare across strikes, durations and coupon frequencies), option prices can thus be quoted in terms of implied volatility, which leads to trading of volatility in option markets.|$|R
