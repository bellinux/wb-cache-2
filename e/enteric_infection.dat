40|$|Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), used {{to treat}} gastro-esophageal reflux and prevent gastric ulcers, {{are among the most}} widely used drugs in the world.

Moreover, we found that it is not only PPIs, but also antibiotics, antidepressants, statins and other commonly used medication were associated with distinct gut microbiota signatures. As a consequence, commonly used medications could affect how the gut microbiota resist <b>enteric</b> <b>infections,</b> promote or ameliorate gut inflammation, or change the host's metabolism.

40|$|The {{development}} of vaccines against enteric bacterial pathogens presents a challenge {{because of the}} large number of pathogens capable of causing disease and the requirement to induce immunity that is effective in the gut. A new generation of enteric vaccines based either on live or non-living antigens delivered orally or by injection are reaching the clinic in the early phases of evaluation. However, considerable technical barriers have to be overcome before these vaccines reach the general population. <b>Enteric</b> <b>infections</b> are still extremely common {{in all parts of the}} world.

40|$|The {{microbiota}} of the intestine, including bacteria, fungi, {{viruses and}} the meiofauna, contributes both to enteric dis-ease and homeostatic immune function (1 – 7).

40|$|Abstract: Enteric {{infections in}} the early years of {{childhood}} can exacerbate underlying malnutrition and, if not addressed, can lead to a vicious and synergistic cycle of malnutrition-enteric infection-malnutrition. Cognitive impairment is a key detrimental outcome associated with this cycle of malnutrition and <b>enteric</b> <b>infection.</b> Mechanistically, diversion of metabolic resources away from the developing brain under conditions of nutritional stress may underlie the impairment of cognitive function. Evidence indicates that the effects of the synergy between malnutrition and enteric pathogens last far beyond the time of infection and can lead to long-term effects on cognition. Indeed, emerging evidence suggests a potential for later-life vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases as a consequence of enteric infectious diseases on early-life brain development. Simple interventions for improving hygiene have proven to lessen the burden of enteric infectious disease. The mitigational role of good hygiene practices has the potential to break the vicious cycle of malnutrition and <b>enteric</b> <b>infection,</b> and contribute to improving the cognitive development potential of children at risk...|$|E

40|$|Review {{of several}} aspects of the biology of Strongyloides westeri, {{especially}} on the life cycle, are presented. The main reason {{is because of the}} potential renewed importance of these parasites since the recently recognized increase in their prevalence in horse foals. Indications are that the first and main source of <b>enteric</b> <b>infections</b> in foals maturing to adults in their small intestines is from parasitic third stage larvae (L 3) passing to them in milk of their dams. It appears that a lesser source of infection is from free-living L 3 which, when they are ingested with food or penetrate the skin, can mature in foals. In conclusion, the source of <b>enteric</b> <b>infections</b> of adult S. westeri in foals is mainly from parasitic L 3 that they ingest in milk of their dams...|$|R
40|$|To {{quantify}} {{the risk and}} types of sequelae attributable to prior enteric infections, we undertook a population-based retrospective cohort study using linked administrative records.

40|$|SummaryGenetic {{studies in}} Drosophila have {{demonstrated}} that generation of microbicidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the NADPH dual oxidase (DUOX) is a {{first line of defense}} in the gut epithelia. Bacterial uracil acts as DUOX-activating ligand through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that the Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway modulates uracil-induced DUOX activation. Uracil-induced Hh signaling is required for intestinal expression of the calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecule Cadherin 99 C (Cad 99 C) and subsequent Cad 99 C-dependent formation of endosomes. These endosomes play essential roles in uracil-induced ROS production by acting as signaling platforms for PLCβ/PKC/Ca 2 +-dependent DUOX activation. Animals with impaired Hh signaling exhibit abolished Cad 99 C-dependent endosome formation and reduced DUOX activity, resulting in high mortality during <b>enteric</b> <b>infection.</b> Importantly, endosome formation, DUOX activation, and normal host survival are restored by genetic reintroduction of Cad 99 C into enterocytes, demonstrating the important role for Hh signaling in host resistance to <b>enteric</b> <b>infection...</b>|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{determine}} {{rates of}} reportable bacterial infections among infants in New York City and identify populations {{at risk and}} preventable causes of morbidity. Study designThis retrospective cohort study matched live births in New York City from 2001 - 2009 to reported cases of bacterial infections among infants less than 1  year of age. Characteristics recorded on birth certificates were compared between infants with bacterial <b>enteric</b> <b>infection,</b> bacterial nonenteric infection, and no reportable bacterial infection. Multinomial logistic regression and multivariable logistic regression were used to identify risk factors for infection. ResultsBacterial infection was reported in 4. 6 cases per 1000 live births. Of 4524 infants with a reportable infection, the majority (2880, 63 %) had an <b>enteric</b> <b>infection.</b> Asian/Pacific Islanders in Brooklyn were the borough-level race/ethnic group with the highest <b>enteric</b> <b>infection</b> rate (8. 5 per 1000 live births). Citywide, infants with enteric infections were disproportionately male, from higher poverty neighborhoods, born to foreign-born mothers, and enrolled in Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children or Medicaid. In contrast, infants with nonenteric infections {{were more likely to}} have low birthweight and mothers characterized by US birth and black race or white Hispanic race/ethnicity. ConclusionsDistinct patterns of risk factors for enteric and nonenteric bacterial infections among infants were identified.
