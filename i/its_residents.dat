5|$|Historical records {{report that}} Minyue and Dongyue were emptied of people, and that <b>its</b> <b>residents</b> were {{deported}} to the territories between the Huai River and the Yangtze River. The alleged population transfer was a resumption {{of a policy}} that had been planned since 138 BC. The Han government considered the mountainous region difficult to control and was wary of trusting <b>its</b> <b>residents.</b> Modern historians doubt the event happened. The deportation of an entire kingdom is implausible, and nothing {{has been found to}} verify a migration of Han settlers to the Minyue region around the year 1, something that would have occurred had the area been abandoned while under Han control. There was only one town of Han settlers, Dongyue, in Minyue. Dongyue was built where the Min River meets the sea, around the time of Emperor Wu's reign. It is more likely that the assimilation of Minyue into Han Chinese culture through Han conquest happened later in the dynasty.|$|E
