The season after, Al-Talaba under {{the management of}} Yousif Abdul-Ameer finished in eighth place with only 30 points. This was their worst National League performance since 1975–76. That season, they also participated in the Al-Nasr Al-Adheem Cup (a tournament for the four Popular Teams of Baghdad) but failed to win the tournament.|$|E
5|$|In the 1979–80 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Khalaf Hassan, Al-Talaba finished in third place again with 27 points. Two of their most significant wins that season were beating the eventual league champions, Al-Shorta, 2–0 {{in the second round}} of matches on 26 September 1979 and beating Al-Tayaran 1–0 in the 20th round on 24 April 1980. In the 1979–80 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final for the first time but they were defeated on 8 February 1980 by Al-Jaish 4–2 on penalties after drawing 1–1.|$|E

5|$|After Al-Rasheed was {{promoted}} to the top division, most of Iraq's national team players signed for them, which {{made it difficult for}} the other teams to compete. Even so, in the 1985–86 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> League and under the management of Yahya Alwan, Al-Talaba won their third league title against all expectations. They finished the season with 25 points, two points ahead of the favourites Al-Rasheed. On 27 December 1985, {{one of the most important}} matches of the season, which could have decided the championship, was played between Al-Talaba and Al-Rasheed in front of 50,000 spectators at the Al-Shaab Stadium. The match ended in a 1–0 win for Al-Talaba with the goal being from a penalty taken by Hussein Saeed in the 63rd minute. Saeed was the season's joint top goalscorer along with Ahmed Radhi and Rahim Hameed. Al-Talaba participated in the 1986 Asian Club Championship where they reached the final round but finished last in the table with a single point. Al-Talaba also participated in the Saddam International Tournament in 1986, hosted in Baghdad, but finished third in their group and failed to reach the semi-finals. By winning the league, Al-Talaba qualified for the 1986 Al-Muthabara Cup but were defeated 2–1 by Al-Rasheed.|$|E
5|$|After almost {{achieving}} a treble in the 1992–93 season, Al-Talaba were managed by Hussein Saeed {{in the first}} half of the 1993–94 season and Ayoub Odisho in the second; they finished in third place with 75 points. In the 1993 Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, they came second in the Group One table behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya. In the semi-finals, Al-Talaba met Al-Zawra'a for the third time in a row and won 3–1. In the final, they faced Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya for the second time and defeated them 2–1 at the Al-Shaab Stadium, winning their second successive Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup under the management of Saeed. In the 1993–94 Iraq FA Cup, Al-Talaba again faced Al-Zawra'a in the final but lost by the same score as in the previous season, 2–1. In the 1994–95 <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> League, Al-Talaba finished fourth with 105 points, two points behind Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya in second place and Najaf in third. In the last round, Al-Talaba faced Al-Zawra'a needing a win to finish second, but they lost 2–1. In the fourth edition of the Umm Al-Ma'arik Cup, Al-Talaba reached the final against Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya but lost 4–3 on penalties after a 0–0 draw.|$|E

25|$|While {{the regular}} army was being formed, U.S. commanders {{around the country}} needed {{additional}} troops more quickly, and thus the Iraqi Civil Defense Corps (which became the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Guard by July 2004) was formed. Coalition commanders formed these militia-type units separately in each area; only later were they gradually brought together as one force. There were several instances where they have refused to take military action against fellow Iraqis, such as in Fallujah, deserted, or allegedly aided the resistance. It is alleged that most guardsmen were drawn from the Shia majority in Southern Iraq or the Kurdish majority in northern Iraq, {{rather than from the}} Sunni area which they were ordered to attack. In September 2004, {{a senior member of the}} National Guard, General Talib al-Lahibi was arrested on suspicion of having links with insurgent groups. In December 2004, it was announced that the <b>Iraqi</b> <b>National</b> Guard would be dissolved. At this time its strength was officially over 40,000 men. Its units became part of the army.
