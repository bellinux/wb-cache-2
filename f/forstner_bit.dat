25|$|<b>Forstner</b> <b>bits,</b> {{also known}} as <b>Forstner</b> flange <b>bits</b> or webfoot augers, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to the}} wood grain. <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> were invented and patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1874.|$|R
25|$|Sawtooth bits {{are also}} available, which include many more cutting edges to the cylinder. These cut faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have {{advantages}} over <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> when boring into end grain.|$|R
50|$|Metric {{dimensioning}} {{is routinely}} used for drill bits of all types, although {{the details of}} BS 328 apply only to twist drill bits. For example, a set of <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> may contain 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 mm diameter cutters.|$|R

50|$|A {{concealed}} hinge drilling jig {{is a type}} of support jig, designed for drilling 3 cm holes to fit {{concealed hinge}}s into modern wardrobe doors. As many of the complementary tools used in woodworking, it uses an electric hand-drill for its operation, making a <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit</b> to turn.|$|E
25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|R
25|$|<b>Forstner</b> <b>bits,</b> {{named after}} their inventor, Benjamin Forstner, bore precise, {{flat-bottomed}} holes in wood, in any orientation {{with respect to}} the wood grain. They can cut {{on the edge of a}} block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes. Because of the flat bottom to the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay. They require great force to push them into the material, so are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in portable drills. Unlike most other types of drill bits, they are not practical to use as hand tools.|$|R
50|$|The {{ubiquitous}} {{twist drill}} bits used in metalworking also {{work well in}} wood, {{but they tend to}} chip wood out at the entry and exit of the hole. In some cases, as in rough holes for carpentry, the quality of the hole does not matter, and a number of bits for fast cutting in wood exist, including spade bits and self-feeding auger bits. Many types of specialised drill bits for boring clean holes in wood have been developed, including brad-point <b>bits,</b> <b>Forstner</b> <b>bits</b> and hole saws. Chipping on exit can be minimized by using a piece of wood as backing behind the work piece, and the same technique is sometimes used to keep the hole entry neat.|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{drilling}} jig is to hold a <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit</b> in place, at a 90ยบ angle while drilling 3 cm pit hole. The angle of the tool is critical {{for the performance of}} concealed hinges, the jig allows maintaining the 90ยบ angle over a number of drilling sessions.|$|E
5000|$|In short, {{there are}} mainly {{two types of}} {{concealed}} hinge jigs, [...] "push jigs" [...] and [...] "hole template jigs". Push jigs are used to hold the <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit</b> perpendicular to the door surface and a [...] "hole template jig" [...] it is simply used for marking {{the place of the}} pit hole, placing it parallel to the door edge.|$|E
5000|$|Forstner {{was born}} in Beaver County, Pennsylvania. His {{successful}} invention of the <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit,</b> patented in 1886,was {{to make him a}} rich man. Without the lead screw (which Forstner called the [...] "gimlet-point") and cutting lips of more conventional wood boring bits it would prove especially useful to gunsmiths like himself and other high-end woodworkers. The bit was unsurpassed in drilling an exceedingly smooth-sided hole with a flat bottom. It was better than the Russell Jennings twist bits for boring at an angle and not following the grain of the wood. Forstner eventually worked out licensing arrangements for the manufacture and sale of his bit by a number of companies, most notably two Connecticut firms: the Colt's Manufacturing Company of Hartford and the Bridgeport Gun Implement Company, successors (in 1886) to the Union Metallic Cartridge Company. Even today, the <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit</b> continues to be manufactured, although it has changed to a split-ring design.|$|E

5000|$|For most {{concealed}} hinges to work properly, a pit hole must {{be created}} {{on the door}} at the point where it faces the static part of the hinge which is screwed to the inside wall of the wardrob [...]To create the pit hole, the jig must be fixed in place by means of the provided clamp, spin the <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit</b> by applying an electric hand-drill to its axle. The hole is drilled by pressing the hand-drill until a satisfactory pit hole is created.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} styles of jig {{available}} commercially. Fundamentally, all push jigs {{are similar in}} that they allow the user to clamp the jig tool in some way. The jig then has some means of placing {{the centre of the}} <b>Forstner</b> <b>bit</b> into to the centre of the marked hole, in a way that a 90ยบ angle is maintained respect to the door surface. A very common approach is to have a simple cardboard or aluminium template with marks for the distances to the door edges; these type of jigs are normally used with a hand drill fixed to a pedestal, for stability.|$|E
