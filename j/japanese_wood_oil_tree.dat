The participants were 12 male instructors aged between 37 and 60  years who worked at a university, who stayed for three nights in a room at an urban hotel where <b>Japanese</b> cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> was vaporized with a humidifier. After this, the concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the participants’ urine were reduced and natural killer cell activity was induced. Thus, olfactory stimulation by <b>Japanese</b> cypress <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> brought about improvements in immune functions.|$|R
40|$|Employee {{problems}} {{arising from}} mental illnesses have steadily increased {{and become a}} serious social problem in recent years. Wood is a widely available plant material, {{and knowledge of the}} psychophysiological effects of inhalation of woody volatile compounds has grown considerably. In this study, we established an experimental method to evaluate the effects of <b>Japanese</b> cedar <b>wood</b> essential <b>oil</b> on subjects performing monotonous work. Two experiment conditions, one with and another without diffusion of the essential oil were prepared. Salivary stress markers were determined during and after a calculation task followed by distribution of questionnaires to achieve subjective odor assessment. We found that inhalation of air containing the volatile compounds of <b>Japanese</b> cedar <b>wood</b> essential <b>oil</b> increased the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-s). Slight differences in the subjective assessment of the odor of the experiment rooms were observed. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that the volatile compounds of <b>Japanese</b> cedar <b>wood</b> essential <b>oil</b> affect the endocrine regulatory mechanism to facilitate stress responses. Thus, we suggest that this essential oil can improve employees’ mental health...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{an article}} in a November 1932 {{magazine}} article in the journal Nature by Herbert Beardsley, [...] "...the male larvae of a white insect, {{about the size of}} a mosquito, built a cocoon of pure, shining wax. The tree that produces the white wax insect grows in the Chien-Chang Valley, and there, about march, one may see, on the limbs and branches, round, brown forms, which contain innumerable white insects. If they are allowed to remain where they are, they will eventually drop off in a dead mass, for the food is not right for them; but if they are transported to other kinds of plants, the females will lay their eggs, the larvae will thrive and the male larvae will construct their shining palaces, which yield a profit to the wax-farmers. So, late in March, the insects are tied up in a leaf of the <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> <b>tree,</b> then placed in gourd like receptacles which are packed into two large bamboo baskets. Runners or porters lift the baskets on their shoulders, and, traveling entirely at night - for to submit the insects to the midday heat would cause the pupal stage to end too soon - traverse the rocky paths and lofty ascents of the Cze-Chuan Mountains to arrive finally at the farming districts. The baskets of insects are distributed to the farmers, who proceed at once to place the creatures upon the food plant, which is generally a species of flowering ash about five or six feet high. They are tied to the branches in small bags made of leaves, and holes are punched in the bags with a blunt needle so the adults may find their way out. When first emerging, the insects creep rapidly up to the leaves of the food plant, where they nestle for nearly two weeks. After this they begin to scatter and crawl along the branches. About the first of June, the females begin to lay their eggs, and the wax cocoons are formed in August in time completely coating every branch and stem. By the first of September the whole tree is literally covered with layers of pure white wax a quarter of an inch thick. The farmers then scrape the branches, and prepare the wax of the market." ...|$|R

30|$|We {{prepared}} carpet cleaners containing three <b>wood</b> <b>oils</b> {{extracted from}} Thujopsis dolabrata Sieb. et Zucc. var. hondai Makino, Chamaecyparis obtusa Endl., and Chamaecyparis taiwanensis Masamune et Suzuki and studied {{their effects on}} mites and perfumerists' impressions. The oil concentrations were set at 0.1 %, 0.2 %, 0.4 %, 0.8 %, and 1.6 %. The effects on Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus Trouessart were investigated. The sensory evaluations were conducted by seven male perfumerists using the SD method and {{they were asked to}} describe freely their impressions of the scents. These results showed that: (1) all three types of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> had a significant effect on making D. pteronyssinus inactive at 0.1 % concentration; and (2) the <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> of T. dolabrata evoked refreshing, natural, rich, and intellectual feelings; C. obtusa oil evoked vivacious, rich, and intellectual feelings; and C. taiwanensis evoked refreshing, natural, rich, rough, masculine feelings. According to the test subjects, T. dolabrata evoked “woody” and “earthy” impressions; C. obtusa evoked “woody,” “citrus,” and “pine-resin” impressions; and C. taiwanensis evoked “woody,” “citrus,” and “medical” impressions. Many issues remain to be investigated, but the inclusion of <b>wood</b> <b>oil</b> in carpet cleaners offered both good mite control and a pleasant aroma to humans. This study suggests a new potential for using these <b>wood</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|R
