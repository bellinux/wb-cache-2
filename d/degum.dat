The impact of environmental factors (temperature and relative humidity) at the time of filament formation during cocoon spinning on the <b>degumming</b> and dyeing properties of filaments were studied in the present investigation. Commercially exploited hybrids of silkworms viz., KA Ã NB 4 D 2 (bivoltine hybrid) and PM Ã NB 4 D 2 (multi Ã bi hybrid) were subjected to different environmental conditions of temperature and relative humidity during cocoon spinning. The filaments thus obtained from these cocoons were subjected to <b>degumming</b> analysis by employing varying concentrations of soap and soda and also the bacterial enzyme. The <b>degumming</b> weight loss percentage for different categories of filaments as a consequence of varying concentration of <b>degumming</b> agents and treatment duration were studied. The filaments with a normal <b>degumming</b> weight loss percentage of around 25 in case of bivoltine hybrid variety and 26 in case of multi Ã bi hybrid variety from all the treatments including control, were assessed for their mechanical, morphological and crystallinity index properties in order to ascertain the qualitative parameters of <b>degummed</b> filaments at a standard <b>degumming</b> weight loss percentage.

40|$|Background: As a {{non-invasive}} {{and readily}} available diagnostic tool, ultrasound {{is one of}} the most important imaging techniques in medicine. Ultrasound is usually trained during residency preferable according to German Society of Ultrasound in Medicine (<b>DEGUM)</b> standards. Our curriculum calls for undergraduate training in ultrasound of medical students in their 4 th year of undergraduate education. An explorative pilot study evaluated the acceptance of this teaching method, and compared it to other practical activities in medical education at Muenster University. Methods: 240 medical students in their 4 th year of undergraduate medical education participated in the training and completed a pre- and post-questionnaire for self-assessment of technical knowledge, self-assurance of the procedure, and motivation in performing ultrasound using a Likert scale. Moreover, students were asked about their interest in pursuing a career in internal medicine. To compare this training to other educational activities a standardized online evaluation tool was used. A direct observation of procedural skills assessment (DOPS) for the first time applied on ultrasound aimed to independently assess the success of our teaching method. Results: There was a significant increase in technical knowledge and self-assurance (p[*]<[*] 0. 001) of the students’ self-assessments. The clinical relevance and self-motivation of the teaching were evaluated positively. The students’ DOPS results demonstrated proficiency in the understanding of anatomic structures shown in ultrasonographic images, including terminology, machine settings, and transducer frequencies. Conclusions: Training ultrasound according to certified <b>DEGUM</b> standards was successful and should be offered in undergraduate medical education. The evaluation of the course affirmed the necessity, quality and clinical relevance of the course with a top ranking score of hands-on training courses within the educational activities of the Medical Faculty of Muenster. <br...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{estimate}} the trend of social welfare for Australia using 1983 - 84, 1988 - 89 and 1993 - 94 Household Expenditure Survey data. The functional form of the Social Welfare Function (SWF) was derived by Sen, <b>Degum,</b> Yitzhaki and Shesinski (all independently). Since the function contains the Gini coefficient as the inequality parameter, it could not be formally disaggregated by subgroups of population. This paper, using a method of subgroup decomposition of the Gini coefficient developed by Podder, attempts to disaggregate the SWF. With this method it is now possible to identify disadvantaged groups by their relative shares in total welfare. In addition the method is used to determine effect of economic growth on specific subgroups, and in turn, on total social welfare. This study is based on the Australian economy. We identify distribution of relative shares of total social welfare among various regional groups, groups determined by occupational status and groups determined by country of birth. The effect on society’s welfare for a percentage change in income of a group and the trend of relative welfare of a specific group are also computed. This information can be used in a variety of social decision making situations, including cost benefit analysis...|$|E

40|$|Silk is an {{important}} biomaterial for tissue engineering purposes due to its improved mechanical and biological properties. The natural fiber has two major components – the structural centre protein chain called fibroin and the outer glue like covering fiber called sericin. It {{has been well documented}} that sericin has the immunogenic properties in animal and human physiological system and so the silk is used only after the sericin is removed thus improving the mechanical and biological properties of silk. Removing sericin from silk is called degumming i. e. “removing the gum”. It should be done carefully {{in a way that the}} fibroin is not damaged. Sericin is removed by using a base such as anhydrous sodium carbonate as well as autoclaving by using water under pressure.

After identification of the best temporal bone window, the protocol required color-mode visualization and confirmatory flow measurements in the proximal M- 1 segment of both MCAs using spectral Doppler ultrasonography. Angle correction was not performed. The examiner could decide whether to extend the protocol to measurements in the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries (ACAs and PCAs, respectively). Proximal MCA occlusions were diagnosed when the ipsilateral ACA and/or the contralateral ACA and MCA could be visualized and imaging confirmed the existence of a sufficient temporal bone window with or without UCA. Distal MCA or MCA branch occlusions were defined according to criteria published by Zanette and coauthors [22]. The TCCS examination time was defined as the time between the first and last image, as documented in the imaging files.

Post-enzymatic treatment, the fabric quality and texture was compared with conventionally treated as well as untreated fabric in terms of degumming loss, tensile strength and yarn count and colour fastness to light/water. The isolate SM 1 (Bacillus thuringensis) was able to grow in Carbon Minimal Salt Medium (CMSM) with jaggery or tamarind as the carbon source (0. 3 % w/v).

This study {{is based on the}} reports of about 50 scientists including (some manufacturers and agencies) who published their results between 1900 and 2005. The scientists and researchers conducted the test, using different types of raw and refined oils. These experiments with raw biodiesel as fuel did not show the satisfactory results, when they used the raw biodiesel. The fuel showed injector coking and piston ring sticking. Some of the scientists mixed with methanol or ethanol in presence of KOH or NaOH and then filtered and washed. The process is called transeterfication and is used to <b>degum,</b> dewax and to remove triglycerides from the vegetable oils. Transeterfication decreases the viscosity, density and flash point of the fuel. The results obtained, by using such oils in compression ignition engines as fuel, were satisfactory only for short term. A vast majority of scientists mixed the transesterified biodiesel oil with diesel with different ratios. When tested in long run, blends of the oil above 20 % (B 20) caused maintenance problems and even sometimes damaged the engine. Some authors reported success in using vegetable oils as diesel fuel extenders in blends of more than 20 % even in long-term studies. The main conclusion derived by the researchers is that coking is a potentially serious problem with the use of unmodified vegetable biodiesel. However, the refined, chemically processed and degumed vegetable oil mixed with diesel can be used to run compression ignition engine for longer duration. It was reported that there was a slight decrease in brake power and a slight increase in fuel consumption. However, the lubricant properties of the biodiesel are better than diesel, which can help to increase the engine life. Moreover, the biodiesel fuel is environment friendly, produces much less NOx and HC and absolutely no Sox and no increase in CO 2 at global level.

With an rate of aneuploidy of 27 % the increased nuchal translucency thickness showed itself as an important non-specific marker for chromosome aberrations. Primarily the Trisomie 21 made a great contribution to the pathological results. The isolated appearance also provided an important reference to chromosomal abnormalities. Pathological chromosomal findings were just as frequently found at the intrauterine growth retardation. The share of chromosomal abnormalities amounted to the 48 cases with growth retardation of our study at 27 %. Despite outweighing the cases with additional sonographic malformations an isolated result also could be recorded with pathological chromosomal finding. Very different chromosome aberrations were associated so that the meaning of the intrauterine growth retardation as a non-specific marker could be underlined. The association described in the literature between the cystic hygroma colli and the Turner syndrome could not be confirmed by our results absolutely. An explanation can be the concept intermixing of the ultrasound indications neck oedema/neck fold/neck transparency which there still was during the examination time period and hygroma colli. In a complete collective of 98 cases with a hygroma colli we found 5 cases with 45, X 0 constellation diagnoses, the number of the Trisomie 21 cases, however, was considerably about this. The Trisomie 18 was also more frequent than the Turner syndrome with a number of 6. An isolated appearance already played an important role in the detection of pathological chromosome results like the neck oedema. Of the markers which have to be classified as a soft marker the single umbilical artery as an ultrasonographically detectable marker into combination with further changes provided an important reference to chromosomal abnormalities. So 3 pathological chromosomal results in our collective of 34 cases with single umbilical artery, in connection with further malformations, could be diagnosed. The significance of the plexus choroideus cyst as a marker for Trisomie 18 could be stressed. Among 22 cases with this change 3 pathological cases of which 2 were a Trisomie 18 were found. There existed all pathological results, however, in combination with other malformations. An isolated plexus cyst plays a subordinate role in detection of chromosomal defects. The ultrasonographically marker sandal gaps is associated with the Down syndrom. We found one chromosome anomaly (Trisomie 21) among 9 cases with sandal gap. Further ultrasonographically changes were described. Despite the low case number it does not astonish that the only pathological results support an association between sandal gap and Trisomie 21. A real boom experienced the ultrasound indication "white spot" since the description of a association to the Trisomie 21 in the year 1995 th. 29 cases with this indication found in our collective. 2 pathological results of which one was a Trisomie 21 arose. With the achieved results of the study the significance of the selected ultrasound indications for the detection of chromosomal abnormalities could be shown. Particularly the neck oedema and the intrauterine growth retardation as most important non-specific markers are so confirmed. The so-called soft markers plexus cyst, white spot, single umbilical artery and sandal gap must arrange for the medical examiner <b>DEGUM</b> step II or III centre or an institution quality standard like carry out detailed malformation exclusion of other body regions or organs or refer to this...|$|E
40|$|Introduction and Objectives Ultrasound {{has become}} {{indispensable}} as an imagining tool that allows quick differential diagnosis, {{identification of the}} most important medical emergencies and immediate introduction of targeted treatment. It enables the sonographer to decide about further proceedings and their urgency, like transport to a specialized clinic or immediate surgical intervention. Several studies illustrate significant differences in the diagnostic accuracy between experienced sonographers and less-experienced examiners. Therefore international organizations, like the German Society for Ultrasound in Medicine (<b>DEGUM)</b> or the World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology (WFUMB) demand better education programs and quality assurance in diagnostic sonography. Specialized diagnostic investigation is not available in every part of the world. Especially large countries and remote areas are having only few specialized clinics and the consultation of medical experts is associated with life-threatening delays and high transport costs. In those regions paramedics or nurses are practicing as the only medical professionals on site. They are of course no alternative to the physicians located in hospitals. To ensure rapid medical care for patients, even in poorly served regions with low resources, a guided tele-ultrasonographic-system, named ASYSTED II - Advanced System for Teleguided Diagnosis II, has been developed and implemented. ASYSTED-II allows a doctor located in a hospital to conduct an ultrasound examination in a remote area by precisely instructing a non-expert on site to operate the ultrasonic probe (teleassistance) while receiving the live imagery from this ultrasonic device. Methodology With expertise from many years of telemedicine in military applications a new teleassistance device for ultrasound diagnostics is currently in development. ASYSTED II (Advanced System for Tele-guided Diagnosis) provides intuitive visual and acoustic guidance to improve ultrasound probe placement and image acquisition. Using military proven videoconference systems for video, audio and file transfer ASYSTED II is available to operate using every IP-connection including satellite communications thus being operational ubiquitously (water, land, air). ASYSTED II can be used in connection with almost every ultrasound system commercially available. Thus examiners can use their own and well known (portable) ultrasound device while being instructed by a medical expert. ASYSTED II consists of software and hardware components and bases on a system for video, audio and data transmission. In detail the ASYSTED II Software connects the remote sonographer with the expert located in a central hospital by using the IP-connection available on-site. Satcom is supported so ASYSTED II can also be used on off shore installations or vessels. The expert is able to give acoustic and visual advice while observing the live imagery of the ultrasound device on a screen. Additional cameras on site can be selected by the remote expert to get an overview of the examination situation and the movements/positioning of the ultrasound probe performed by the examiner. The medical expert uses a commercial of the shelf three-dimensional joystick to transmit instructions visualized as directional indicators combined with information on the desired pressure or distance to move the probe. On the sonographer’s side the display of the ultrasound device shows the ultrasound picture, the screen of the mobile videoconference system presents the experts instructions. During the examination the expert can request still images created by the ultrasound device as DICOM-files. This allows focusing on interesting structures. As DICOM still images do not underly a lossy compression medical diagnostics is possible on this basis. The capabiity of a direct bidirectional communication between examiner on site and remote expert and remote support of allow prompt sonographic diagnostics even if a physician is not available on site. Medical treatment can be initiated earlier and quality of care in emergencies can thus be improved. Furthermore costs for innecessary transports can be avoided. In addition ASYSTED II offers the opportunity for distance education of inexperienced sonographers. Results The system is currently in development and will be available on the market in 2016. First demonstrations with a test model showed good results in optimizing communication between medical expert and examiner. All volunteers who tested the prototype system reported an intuitive usability of the guidance system and appreciated the faster workflow by using the automated DICOM transfer to the expert side. Conclusion By using intuitive audio and visual indicators quality and process improvements in teleguided ultrasound diagnostics are possible without the application of expensive robot systems for ultrasound probe placement. ASYSTED II helps the untrained examiner to easily follow the guidance of an experienced sonographer even in remote areas with rough environment and poor data connection. After the release of a first pre-series model of ASYSTED II a usability study together with a telehealth provider in the US will be conducted at the end of 2015...|$|E

40|$|The <b>degumming</b> {{process to}} remove sericin {{decreases}} silk fiber strength; however, {{the impact of}} <b>degumming</b> on the mechanical properties of regenerated silk biomaterials has not been established. This study investigated the effect of <b>degumming</b> temperature, time, alkaline component and alkaline concentration on the mechanical properties of silk fibroin films. Sericin removal was estimated using weight loss; 10 samples with 12. 2 – 29. 4 % weight loss were then further characterized in terms of fiber mechanical properties, fiber surface morphology, molecular weight distribution and film tensile strength. A negative correlation was found between weight loss and fiber tensile strength. This loss of fiber strength under harsher <b>degumming</b> conditions had {{a direct impact on}} the tensile strength of regenerated films. Mild <b>degumming</b> conditions (weight loss of 12. 2 %) led to higher film strength (8. 9  MPa), whereas aggressive <b>degumming</b> conditions (with 29. 4 % weight loss) resulted in significantly weaker films (4. 3  MPa). The presence of some residual sericin, after mild <b>degumming,</b> is likely to affect the mechanical properties of the regenerated silk films. These results will assist in the development of materials with mechanical and biocompatibility properties tuned to specific biomedical applications...|$|R
30|$|The {{disadvantages}} of traditional water retting include serious pollution, long <b>degumming</b> time, poor quality and stability, and high labor intensity. Chemical semi-degumming is disadvantageous because it causes heavy pollution and severe fiber damages; moreover, {{this method is}} costly. Chemical semi-degumming is inapplicable to jute fibers, which are short and existing as bundles. Therefore, the imperfect <b>degumming</b> technology restricts {{the development of the}} jute industry (Ahmed and Akhter 2001; Banik et al. 2007). Bio-degumming catalyzes and degrades non-cellulosic components (including pectin, hemicelluloses, and lignin) in jute bast by using enzymes secreted by microorganisms, resulting in cellulose extraction (Kozlowski et al. 2006). Bio-degumming is a clean, environmentally friendly, highly efficient, high-quality, and low-cost method and is becoming the leading jute <b>degumming</b> technology (Banik et al. 2007; Biswas et al. 2013; Liu and Peng 2004). Microbial <b>degumming</b> involves enzyme <b>degumming</b> and bacterial <b>degumming.</b> However, no research on enzyme catalytic mechanism on bio-degumming of jute has been reported. Moreover, the immature enzyme mixing technology and the costly enzymes restrict the applications of enzyme <b>degumming.</b> For bacterial <b>degumming,</b> some researchers have studied the screening and community structure of <b>degumming</b> bacterial strains of jute (Banik et al. 2007; Das et al. 2012; Haque et al. 2003; Munshi and Chattoo 2008). A mixed bacterial retting culture was inoculated during ribbon retting of jute, and most of the defects arising from conventional retting could be overcome by ribbon retting (Banik et al. 2003). An ecofriendly and water saving retting technology of jute has been developed by fermentation by fermentation procedure (Banik 2016).|$|R
