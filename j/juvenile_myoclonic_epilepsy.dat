5|$|The {{ability to}} {{categorize}} {{a case of}} epilepsy into a specific syndrome occurs more often with children since the onset of seizures is commonly early. Less serious examples are benign rolandic epilepsy (2.8 per 100,000), childhood absence epilepsy (0.8 per 100,000) and <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (0.7 per 100,000). Severe syndromes with diffuse brain dysfunction caused, at least partly, by some aspect of epilepsy, are {{also referred to as}} epileptic encephalopathies. These are associated with frequent seizures that are resistant to treatment and severe cognitive dysfunction, for instance Lennox–Gastaut syndrome and West syndrome. Genetics is believed {{to play an important role}} in epilepsies by a number of mechanisms. Simple and complex modes of inheritance have been identified for some of them. However, extensive screening have failed to identify many single gene variants of large effect. More recent exome and genome sequencing studies have begun to reveal a number of de novo gene mutations that are responsible for some epileptic encephalopathies, including CHD2 and SYNGAP1 and DNM1, GABBR2, FASN and RYR3.|$|E
25|$|In fact, <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and EA5 are allelic {{and produce}} {{proteins}} with similar dysfunction.|$|E

40|$|One by one, mutation-containing {{mendelian}} {{genes that}} cause monogenic <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (JME) and {{single nucleotide polymorphisms}} (SNP) -susceptibility alleles that increase risks for nonmendelian complex JME should fall {{to the power of}} molecular genetics. Of 15 chromosome loci, 3 mendelian genes (α 1 -subunit of the GABAA receptor [GABRA 1], chloride channel 2 gene [CLCN 2], and Myoclonin 1 /EFHC 1) and 2 SNP-susceptibility alleles of putative JME genes in epistases (bromodomain-containing protein 2 [BRD 2] and connexin [Cx]- 36) have been identified, so far. Antiepileptic drugs now can be designed against the specific molecular defects of JME...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: <b>Juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsies</b> (JME) {{are one of}} {{the most}} common forms of genetic {{generalized}} epilepsy. Genetic studies have shown that heterozygous mutations in EFHC 1 /Myoclonin 1 are responsible for 3 - 22 % of JME cases worldwide. The Myoclonin 1 protein contains three DM 10 domains of unknown function and an EF-hand domain. We have previously demonstrated that Myoclonin 1 is a microtubule-associated protein involved in cell division and radial migration during neocortex development. In cells, this protein co-localized with specific structures rich in microtubules (MTs) such as the centrosome, the poles of the mitotic spindle or the motile cilia but not with cytoplasmic MTs. This suggests post-translational modifications (PTM) of MTs may be important for the interaction between Myoclonin 1 and MTs Methods: We co-expressed the different enzymes catalyzing PTM of MTs with Myoclonin 1 in U 2 OS cell line, and then performed immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. We next performed pulldown and luciferase complementation assays to test protein interaction Results: With one of these enzymes, we observed a strong increase in PTM in the presence of Myoclonin- 1. Interestingly, the effect is observed even when a DM 10 domain alone is co-expressed with the enzyme, suggesting for the first time a role for this domain. This suggests that Myoclonin 1 may interact with and modulate the activity of this enzyme. By using luciferase complementation assay and pull down experiments, we could demonstrate that both proteins interact. Conclusions: Our data suggest Myoclonin- 1 modulates specific PTM of MTs. This is of prime importance for microtubule dynamic and notably for neuroblast precursor migration during neocortex development. This could be the mechanism that explains why pathological forms of myoclonin- 1 may affect brain development...|$|R

25|$|Both <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and EA5 are {{a result}} of {{mutations}} in CACNB4, a gene that encodes the calcium channel β4 subunit. This subunit coassembles with α-subunits and produces channels that slowly inactivate after opening.|$|E
25|$|The first {{citation}} of JME {{was made}} in 1857 when Théodore Herpin described a 13-year-old boy suffering from myoclonic jerks, which progressed to tonic-clonic seizures three months later. In 1957, Janz and Christian published a journal article describing several patients with JME. The name <b>Juvenile</b> <b>Myoclonic</b> <b>Epilepsy</b> was proposed in 1975 and adopted by the International League Against Epilepsy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> is an {{inherited}} genetic syndrome, {{but the way}} in which this disorder is inherited is unclear. Frequently (17-49%) those with JME have relatives with a history of epileptic seizures. There is also a higher rate of females showing JME symptoms than males. Almost all cases of JME, however, have an onset in early childhood to puberty.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to report a patient with late-onset <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in Down’s {{syndrome}} (LOMEDS) as a differential diagnosis of adult-onset progressive <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsies.</b> A 55 -year-old male with Down’s syndrome (DS) is described who developed progressively frequent myoclonus and generalized myoclonic–tonic seizures (GMTSs) at the age of 52. EEG recordings demonstrated background slowing and generalized polyspike-wave discharges occasionally associated with myoclonic jerks, leading to the classification of primary generalized epileptic myoclonus. Descriptions of late-onset epilepsy in DS patients are rare. However, a review of the pertinent literature revealed at least two other cases of elderly DS patients developing progressive <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> after the onset of dementia. We suggest that late-onset <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in Down’s syndrome as characterized here should be considered in the differential diagnosis of adult-onset <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsies.</b> LOMEDS apparently shares features with <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Unverricht–Lundborg disease (ULD) caused by a mutation on chromosome 21. Since life expectation of DS patients has markedly increased, LOMEDS may be more frequent than currently acknowledged...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEstablishing {{an early}} {{diagnosis}} of Lafora disease (LD) is often challenging. We describe two cases of LD presenting as myoclonus and tonic–clonic seizures, initially suggesting idiopathic generalized epilepsy. The subsequent {{course of the}} disease was characterized by drug-resistant <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> cognitive decline, and visual symptoms, which oriented the diagnosis toward progressive <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and, more specifically, LD. Early in the evolution in the first case, and before histopathologic and genetic confirmation of LD in both cases, [18]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) revealed posterior hypometabolism, consistent with the well-known posterior impairment in this disease. This suggests that FDG-PET could help to differentiate LD in early stages from other progressive <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsies,</b> but confirmation is required by a longitudinal study of FDG-PET in progressive <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy...</b>|$|R

25|$|Licensed for {{generalized}} tonic-clonic {{and complex}} partial seizures in the United Kingdom. In the United States, primidone is approved for adjunctive (in {{combination with other}} drugs) and monotherapy (by itself) use in generalized tonic-clonic seizures, simple partial seizures, and complex partimple partial seizures, and myoclonic seizures. In <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (JME), it is a second-line therapy, reserved for when the valproates and/or lamotrigine do not work and when other second-line therapiesacetazolamid work either.|$|E
25|$|Lamotrigine can {{induce a}} type of seizure known as a myoclonic jerk, which tends to happen soon after {{the use of the}} medication. When used in the {{treatment}} of myoclonic epilepsies such as <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> lower doses (and lower plasma levels) are usually needed, as even moderate doses of this drug can induce seizures, including tonic-clonic seizures, which can develop into status epilepticus, which is a medical emergency.

25|$|By 1980, {{primidone}} {{was seen}} as not worth mentioning as an option for childhood temporal lobe epilepsy by doctors in the United Kingdom. In January 1981, Dr. O'Brien and colleagues reported that primidone had {{a positive effect on}} the essential tremor of one of their patients. This led them to initiate a twenty-person prospective study. Twelve of the participants responded well. By 1984, valproic acid was the drug of choice for <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> and not the equally effective primidone. However, as late as 1985, primidone was {{still one of the most}} widely used anticonvulsants. At the close of the 1980s, primidone was still the preferred anticonvulsant for complex partial seizures in Germany. In 1989, Dainippon Pharmaceutical launched Exegran (zonisamide), the first new, chemically unique, non-benzodiazepine anticonvulsant in decades.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{suggested}} that lamotrigine acts presynaptically on voltage-gated sodium channels to decrease glutamate release. Several electrophysiological studies {{have investigated the}} effects of lamotrigine on voltage-dependent sodium channels. For example, lamotrigine blocked sustained repetitive firing in cultured mouse spinal cord neurons in a concentration-dependent manner, at concentrations that are therapeutically relevant {{in the treatment of}} human seizures. In cultured hippocampal neurons, lamotrigine reduced sodium currents in a voltage-dependent manner, and at depolarised potentials showed a small frequency-dependent inhibition. These {{and a variety of other}} results indicate that the antiepileptic effect of lamotrigine, like that of phenytoin and carbamazepine, is at least in part due to use- and voltage-dependent modulation of fast voltage-dependent sodium currents. However, lamotrigine has a broader clinical spectrum of activity than phenytoin and carbamazepine and is recognised to be protective against generalised absence epilepsy and other generalised epilepsy syndromes, including primary generalised tonic–clonic seizures, <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy,</b> and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, primidone, {{along with}} phenobarbital, was a second-line agent in partial {{epilepsy}} {{with or without}} secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures {{and was one of}} four agents (the others being carbamazepine, phenytoin and phenobarbital) that was used along with ethosuximide or a benzodiazepine for any absence or myoclonic seizures when valproate failed to control tonic-clonics (at least in the United States). After zonisamide, other new anticonvulsants came onto the market: felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, and vigabatrin. All four were structurally distinct both from other anticonvulsants already on the market. They all had larger protective indexes than conventional agents and unlike these agents, the new ones did not cause birth defects in laboratory animals or antagonize folic acid. They seemed to be relatively mild in terms of side effects. Out of all of them lamotrigine was the most similar to phenytoin in its pattern of efficacy. Felbamate was the most effective for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and was seen as a second-line agent in <b>juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> after valproate. These new agents were aggressively marketed. In 1994, felbamate became the anticonvulsant of last resort after ten people out of 100,000 came down with aplastic anemia.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Juvenile</b> <b>myoclonic</b> <b>epilepsy</b> (JME), {{also known}} as Janz syndrome, is a fairly common form of {{idiopathic}} generalized epilepsy, representing 5-10% of all epilepsy cases. This disorder typically first manifests itself {{between the ages of}} 12 and 18 with brief episodes of involuntary muscle twitching occurring early in the morning.

2500|$|Until recently, {{the medical}} {{literature}} did not indicate a connection among many genetic disorders; however, genetic syndromes and genetic diseases are now being found to be related.

[...] This emerging class of diseases are called ciliopathies. [...] The underlying cause may be a dysfunctional molecular mechanism in the primary cilia structures of the cell organelles, which are present in many cellular types throughout the human body. [...] The cilia defects adversely affect [...] "numerous critical developmental signaling pathways" [...] essential to cellular development and thus offer a plausible hypothesis for the often multi-symptom nature of a large set of syndromes and diseases.
