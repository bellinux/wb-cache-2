5|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 9th century there was an attempt to revive royal power at the much-diminished city of Tikal, as {{evidenced}} by a stela erected in the Great Plaza by Jasaw Chan K'awiil II in 869. This was the last monument erected at Tikal before the city finally fell into silence. The former satellites of Tikal, such as Jimbal and Uaxactun, did not last much longer, erecting their final monuments in 889. By the end of the 9th century the vast majority of Tikal's population had deserted the city, its royal palaces were occupied by squatters and simple thatched dwellings were being erected in the city's ceremonial plazas. The squatters blocked some doorways in the rooms they reoccupied in the monumental structures of the site and left rubbish that included a mixture of <b>domestic</b> <b>refuse</b> and non-utilitarian items such as musical instruments. These inhabitants reused the earlier monuments for their own ritual activities, far removed from those of the royal dynasty that had erected them. Some monuments were vandalized and some were moved to new locations. Before its final abandonment all respect for the old rulers had disappeared, with the tombs of the North Acropolis being explored for jade and the easier-to-find tombs were looted. After 950, Tikal was all but deserted, although a remnant population may have survived in perishable huts interspersed among the ruins. Even these final inhabitants abandoned the city in the 10th or 11th centuries and the rainforest claimed the ruins for the next thousand years. Some of Tikal's population may have migrated to the Peten Lakes region, which remained heavily populated in spite of a plunge in population levels in the first half of the 9th century.|$|E

25|$|Compared to an {{internal}} combustion engine of the same power rating, Stirling engines currently have a higher capital cost and are usually larger and heavier. However, they are more efficient than most internal combustion engines. Their lower maintenance requirements make the overall energy cost comparable. The thermal efficiency is also comparable (for small engines), ranging from 15% to 30%. For applications such as micro-CHP, a Stirling engine is often preferable to {{an internal}} combustion engine. Other applications include water pumping, astronautics, and electrical generation from plentiful energy sources that are incompatible with the internal combustion engine, such as solar energy, and biomass such as agricultural waste and other waste such as <b>domestic</b> <b>refuse.</b> However, Stirling engines are generally not price-competitive as an automobile engine, because of high cost per unit power, low power density, and high material costs.|$|E

However, with the ever-rising cost of providing these services, council funding is no longer sufficient to cover costs and user charges would free up council budgets for more worthwhile projects.|$|E

50|$|In NBA {{and most}} other {{basketball}} games, a player or coach is ejected from the game if he accumulates two technical fouls of an unsportsmanlike nature {{over the course of}} the game. Participants who commit fouls of violence or enter the stands are ejected summarily regardless of the number of technical fouls accumulated. Ejected players/coaches must leave the court area for the remainder of play, and must do so immediately, or else risk even heavier fines/suspensions. In the NBA, an ejection will result in, at minimum, a $1,000 fine; an ejection for leaving the bench during a fight carries at least a one-game suspension as well. In <b>domestic</b> games, <b>refusing</b> to leave after being ejected can result in a player being put on report. If being put on report does not provide enough encouragement for a player to leave the court, the official may award the game to the opposing team, regardless of score. Players who incur 16 technical fouls in a single NBA season are automatically suspended for one game; an additional suspension is imposed for each increment of two thereafter. Should a player receive the 16th technical foul in the last regular-season game, he will be suspended for the first game in the next season, unless if his team is in the playoffs, when he will be suspended for the first playoff game. In the playoffs, players are suspended if they receive seven technical fouls.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a study}} of Bronte’s Jane Eyre viewed from the feminist perspective. The objectives of this research are to identify woman’s oppressions experienced by Jane and to explain her responses to the oppressions from Victorian society illustrated in the novel. Feminism theory, especially socialist feminism, is implemented to answer {{the objectives of the}} research. This {{research is}} a qualitative study applying content analysis method. The object of this research is a novel entitled Jane Eyre written by Charlotte Bronte. The data collected are words, phrases, clauses, sentences, and paragraphs which are taken from the novel related to woman’s oppression in Victorian era and socialist feminism. The key instrument of this research is the researcher herself employing the socialist feminist theory by Juliet Mitchell. The data analysis was conducted through six steps: organizing and preparing the data, reading through all the data, coding the data, giving a description, interrelating descriptions, and interpreting the meaning of the descriptions. To obtain trustworthiness, the researcher used triangulation technique. There are two results of the research. The first result is the identification of woman’s oppressions, which is classified into two forms: patriarchal oppression and class oppression. Patriarchal oppression {{is in the form of}} giving Jane stereotypes, such as considering her as a dependent woman and making her as an object of men, while class oppression is in the form of giving her bad treatments from the upper class. The second result is the explanation of Jane’s responses to the oppressions which are classified into four actions: being an independent woman, breaking the social value that women are only placed in <b>domestic</b> life, <b>refusing</b> to be an object of men, and struggling to survive by showing her resistance...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} pair of {{domestic}} regimes {{known as the}} second and third | Czechoslovakian republic. The choice of these periods of the national history was conditioned by a relative absence of comparative political scientific works on these periods and by timelessness and topicality of the studying of <b>domestic</b> regimes, that <b>refused</b> the idea of a liberal democracy twice in ten years. The goal of the diploma thesis is to analyze, compare and categorize the second and the third Czechoslovakian republic in the framework provided by the theory of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes by Juan J.

In the first part the thesis describes the theoretical framework of the theory of authoritarian and totalitarian regimes with stress on the theory of authoritarian regimes, as it is the assumption of the thesis, that both the second and the third republic were cases of authoritarian regimes. The other parts of theory which deal with totalitarian and sultanistic regimes are only briefly mentioned.

The act ends with the couple shaking hands. When Ann wins the $100,00 prize, and Tom places second, his opposition to her mounts and reaches a climax near the end of Act Two.

Millicent announces her decision to marry the man, but it is clear to Ann that Millicent has come home out of a need to be guided in her confusion. Ann blames herself for Millicent's trouble because, during a holiday period when Ann was working on the frieze, Millicent stayed at school and obviously responded to the man out of loneliness.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaf 76). Domestic {{violence has}} been affecting families for generations. Often times, {{people are not}} equipped with the necessary information that can assist to decrease this social problem. Domestic violence affects men, women, and children of all ages, ethnic backgrounds, socioeconomic status, and education. The purpose of this workshop is to train and educate parents about domestic violence history, statistics, laws, community resources, safety planning, and children exposed to the violence. Parents who attend to this training, will gain awareness and understanding on the impact on children's behavior when exposed to domestic violence. Parents will also be provided with {{information on how to}} assist a victim of domestic violence. For example, phone numbers and addresses of local shelters, domestic violence hotlines, and types of alternative support that can be provided. A number of studies found that children exposed to domestic violence have a high risk of developing Depression, Anxiety, and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. It was also found that children exposed to domestic violence are at a higher risk of becoming easily angered and displaying aggressive behaviors, than those not exposed to domestic violence. When reviewing literature on statistics, it was found that approximately one in every three women around the world were assaulted and/or abused by an intimate partner. Research suggests that immigrant victims of <b>domestic</b> violence may <b>refuse</b> to speak about the violence and seek assistance for fear of increased violence, language barriers, and/or lack of information. Although research on domestic violence workshops is minimal, national surveys suggest {{that it is necessary to}} inform communities about laws and resources offered to victims. This thesis project will serve parents as a learning tool for domestic violence regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The goal is to target parents with children in primary centers, elementary and middle schools. Parents in these settings can serve as advocates to stop domestic violence by spreading the information learned in the workshop to the community. The workshop is available in both English and Spanish. Any parent who is interested in learning more about domestic violence laws, community resources, the effects it has on children and more, is welcome to attend the workshop...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issues of {{reporting}} domestic violence by third parties. As it turned out during the research and writing the thesis, it is a considerably uncharted field. Many authors (Dobnikar, Filipčič, Felson, Zaviršek and some others), also presented below, are mainly dealing with the reasons quoted by victims. They {{have a significant impact}} on the fact the victims remain in a violent relationship and don’t report domestic violence. Less is written about the third parties being aware of domestic violence and not reporting it, and their reasons for doing so. The theoretical part of this thesis initially discusses family as a community, on one side characterized by security and on the other by danger, what is reflected in the statistics on domestic violence. Considering the occurrence of domestic violence, the thesis also speaks about the sociality of this problem. Since domestic violence is certainly also present in the Slovenian space, a special section is dedicated precisely to review the situation of domestic violence in our country. Following is the review of Slovenian legislation which deals with domestic violence. In conclusion, different responses to domestic violence are presented, especially by the victims of such violence and also by the third parties being ignorant of domestic violence by not reporting it to the authorities. In the process of research I have come to conclusion that the third parties who are aware of domestic violence but remain silent, and their reasons for silence, are rather neglected. For this reason, the empirical part of the thesis wants to answer the question focused upon the title itself: Is reporting domestic violence really such a simple thing. The answer can be found in three different interviews that showing the broadness of this matter. Three individuals who found themselves or they still appear in different “roles” when talking about domestic violence responded to the invitation to participate: a third party who reported domestic violence to authorities, a third party who acknowledges <b>domestic</b> violence but <b>refuses</b> to report it, and a domestic violence victim who doesn’t report the violence. The reasons for silence stated by interviewees are very different. Some are common to all, whereas others are specific to just one of them. Generally, the three participants share the same answer to the question focused upon in the thesis and is at the same time the key consideration: reporting of domestic violence is not a simple thing. ...|$|R
