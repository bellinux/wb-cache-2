5|$|A {{number of}} genetically {{discrete}} subpopulations {{have been identified}} across the northern range of the Pacific angelshark. Several subpopulations exist along the coast from Point Conception northward to Alaska. In the Southern California Bight, {{there are at least}} three separate subpopulations off the mainland and northern and southern Channel Islands. The subpopulation along the Pacific coast of Baja California are distinct from those in the Gulf of California. These subpopulations have diverged from one another over time because Pacific angelsharks do not undertake long migratory movements outside of their preferred home areas, and deep waters serve as effective geographical barriers to population mixing. Heterozygosity, a measure of genetic diversity, is <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pacific angelshark than in other shark species that have been examined.|$|E
5|$|Alexander made a {{cautious}} and slow advance, intending to base his strategy {{on the structure}} of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit. Aware {{of the importance of the}} foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful – those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mountains.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the group}} of people at risk for SAH is younger than the {{population}} usually affected by stroke, the risk still increases with age. Young people are much less likely than middle-age people (risk ratio 0.1, or 10 percent) to have a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The risk continues to rise with age and is 60 percent <b>higher</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> very elderly (over 85) than in those between 45 and 55. Risk of SAH is about 25 percent higher in women over 55 compared to men the same age, probably reflecting the hormonal changes that result from the menopause, such as a decrease in estrogen levels.|$|E
