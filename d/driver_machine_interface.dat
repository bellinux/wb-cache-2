40|$|The {{number of}} older road users is getting {{increasingly}} larger in Europe. Therefore policy makers {{pay more attention}} to the abilities and limitations of this group of road users. Providing accessible and comfortable assistance and safety functions for mobility is a key challenge in the objective of extending autonomy, independency, safety and a good quality of life. In this paper an outlook is given on the action plan describing the recommendations for the European Commission. The preferred mode of transport for older road users is car driving as long as they can drive safely. In-car technology could help them maintain driving longer and safer. A cooperative Automatic Emergency braking system (C-AEB) was developed to improve bicycle collision avoidance for older <b>drivers.</b> Two Human <b>Machine</b> <b>Interfaces</b> were designed and evaluated with a usability test including both young and older drivers. Results showed a tendency for older drivers to prefer earlier warnings than younger drivers...|$|R

50|$|In December 2015 the ERA {{published}} the Baseline 3 Release 2 (B3R2) series including GSM-R Baseline 1. The B3R2 is publicly named {{to be not}} an update to the previous Baseline 3 Maintenance Release 1 (B3MR1). The notable change is the inclusion of EGRPS (GPRS with mandatory EDGE support) in the GSM-R specification, corresponding to the new Eirene FRS 8 / SRS 16 specifications. Additionally B3R2 includes the ETCS <b>Driver</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> and the SRS 3.5.0. This Baseline 3 series was accepted by European Commission with decisions 2016/919/EC in late May 2016. The decision references ETCS SRS 3.6.0 that was subsequently published by the ERA in a Set 3 in June 2016. The publications of the European Commission and ERA for SRS 3.6.0 were synchronized to the same day, June 15. The Set 3 of B3R2 is marked as the stable basis for subsequent ERTMS deployments in the EU.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Experimental {{evaluation}} {{is aimed at}} providing useful insights and results that constitute a confident representation of the system under evaluation. Although guidelines and good practices exist and are often applied, the uncertainty of results {{and the quality of}} the measuring system is rarely discussed. To complement such guidelines and good practices in experimental evaluation, metrology principles can contribute in improving experimental evaluation activities by assessing the measuring systems and the results achieved. In this paper we present the experimental evaluation by software-implemented fault injection of a safe train-borne <b>Driver</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (DMI), to evaluate its behavior in presence of faults. The measuring system built for the purpose and the results obtained on the assessment of the DMI are scrutinized along basic principles of metrology and good practices of fault injection. Trustfulness in results has been estimated satisfactory and the experimental campaign has shown that the safety mechanisms of the DMI correctly identify the faults injected and that a proper reaction is executed.

40|$|Abstract—In-vehicle {{infotainment}} applications {{often have}} to contend with different degrees of unpredictability. These applications can benefit if they can specify quality requirements to the service they access. This paper presents our attempt to apply Model Driven Architecture (MDA) technology to integrate the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for In-vehicle Human <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (HMI) clients of infotainment applications. QoS subsystem of Human <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> framework provides the essential QoS modelling support to specify QoS related requirements. QoS modelling constructs and components of the Infotainment Human <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> Framework (iHMIFw) support construction of platform independent model of infotainment HMI applications with required QoS specifications. A model transformation has been described that is supported by the framework and results into XML description of QoS specifications.

40|$|The ERTMS-ATC {{system is}} a {{distributed}} system where the <b>Driver</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (DMI) is a slave unit of the train onboard vital computer (EVC). Consequently, as for the information visualization and the input data acquisition, the data transfer between DMI and EVC must also be safe. A safe communication protocol stack has therefore {{to be provided for}} connecting safety-related peer agents as part of the architectural design. In this paper we analyze two types of communication protocols {{that could be used for}} the EVC-DMI interactions, based, respectively, on cyclic and acyclic messages ’ exchange. Using the Stochastic Activity Network formalism, we adopt a modular modeling methodology to assess their impact on some significant dependability-related indicators, like the probability to successfully complete a mission without failures (unscheduled train stops), the steady-state system availability and the probability that a DMI failure causes a mission failure. The analysis of the obtained results allows the early design refinement of the system architecture, pointing out the improvements in adopting an acyclic protocol, possibly with one spare DMI component...|$|E
40|$|In railway train-borne equipment, the <b>Driver</b> <b>Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (DMI) {{acts like}} {{a bridge between the}} train driver and the onboard {{automatic}} train control system (European Vital Computer, EVC). While the DMI is required to operate in a critical context, current DMIs have no safety requirements. This implies that the EVC may automatically stop the train whenever the DMI is suspected to misbehave, leading to delay of the train, inconvenience for passengers and consequent possible profit loss. For these reasons a DMI with higher safety requirements is worth to be taken into account, even if it implies higher costs. The SAFEDMI European project aims at developing (i) a DMI at Safety Integrity Level 2 (SIL 2) using off-the-shelf components and a simple hardware architecture to reduce costs, and (ii) a SIL 2 wireless communication support for maintenance. This paper describes the architecture of a DMI which satisfies these objectives. The main hardware and software characteristics will be shown, including the proposed error detection techniques and the related fault handling (characterized by a new operational mode that allows DMI to restart silently, thus reducing unexpected train stops). ...|$|E
