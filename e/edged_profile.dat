We investigate the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> optimality for 8 -QAM and 32 QAM constellations.

40|$|This paper investigates optimal {{constellation}} labeling in {{the context}} of the <b>edge</b> <b>profile.</b> A constellation’s <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> lists the minimum-distance edge for each binary symbol error. The paper introduces the symmetric-ultracomposite (SU) labeling structure and shows that this structure provides undominated <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> for 2 -PSK, 2 -PAM, and 22 -point square QAM. The SU structure is a generalization of the commonly used reflected binary Gray code. With the proper choice of basis vectors, SU labeling can support either set-partition or Gray-code labeling of 2 -PSK, 2 -PAM, and 22 -point square QAM. Notably, there are Gray-code and set-partition labelings that do not have the SU structure. These labelings yield inferior <b>edge</b> <b>profiles.</b> The SU structure does not apply to cross constellations. However, for any standard cross constellation with 32 or more points, a quasi-SU labeling structure can approximate the SU structure. With the correct choice of basis, quasi-SU labelings produce quasi-Gray labelings. However, the quasi-SU structure cannot support set-partition labeling. In fact, the quasi-SU structure provides a better <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> than standard set-partition labeling. Thus, for cross constellations there is a choice between <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> optimality and the group structure provided by set-partitioning. Here, the correct choice depends on whether the encoder trellis has parallel branches...|$|R
40|$|In human vision {{the first}} level of {{processing}} is edge detection. Edges {{are determined by the}} transitions from dark points to bright points in an image. For this paper, we consider an <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> model representing a boundary or edge in an image. From this model we can determine the strength of the edge, the width of the edge, and either the transition from dark to bright to dark or the transition from bright to dark to bright. Our first step was to take the given <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> and determine the type of edge that is represented and the characteristics of the edge, such as that of the varying width of the edge as the variable a is either increased or decreased. In the next step, we calculated the derivate of the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> model. The final step involved utilizing the properties of the function defined by the derivative.

40|$|Part I of this two-part paper {{proposed}} a robust way to detect local points on linear-isophote surface in an image. Only {{a subset of}} these points corresponds to linear surface in image irradiance and provides useful information about the camera response function (CRF). In Part II, we show that, for some images, this subset of linear points could constitute a very {{small portion of the}} candidate set and the remaining points are often considered as noise. Our previous approach was to eliminate the noise using a learning-based method. The learning-based method could only reduce the noise but not eliminate it completely. Hence, it fails when the proportion of linear points is too small. As a main contribution in Part II, we introduce the concept of <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> and consider the candidate points as discrete samples of an <b>edge</b> <b>profile.</b> Instead of eliminating the unwanted candidate points as noise, we use them to instantiate the <b>edge</b> <b>profiles.</b> Assuming that every <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> has a linear component in image irradiance, the interactions of the <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> in the space of linear geometric invariants may correspond to the linear part which is CRF-indicating.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{perforation}} <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> in micro-perforated plates (MPPs) is investigated and compared with the sharp edge case. MPPs are metal plates with small holes (perforations) that absorb incident sound waves using the Stokes boundary layers developed inside and {{in the vicinity of}} the perforations. The perforation diameter should be optimized so that the Stokes layers cover almost the entire perforation thus maximizing the absorbed sound energy due to viscosity. Hence, designing MPPs is a tuning problem. The existing analytical model for evaluating the transfer impedance of the MPPs is based on the assumption that the <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> of the perforations are sharp. In other words, the angle between the plate surface and the inner surface of the perforation is 90 ◦;. This case is not very practical to achieve in mass production of MPPs, since the perforations are formed by drilling and / or punching in manufacturing. To investigate {{the effect of}} the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> on the performance of the MPP, we design samples with different <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> such as sharp and 45 ◦-chamfers on both edges. We carry out open-end reflection coefficient measurements in a semi-anechoic room with 6 microphones. The relative error of this setup is measured to be less than 0. 5 % for closed-end reflection coefficient between 100 Hz and 700 Hz in the linear regime. The measurements are also compared with a linear numerical model.

Abrasive jet machining, a flexible process ideal for difficult-to-reach areas, is applied for edge generation. A conoscopy laser with small, 25 μm spot size is scanned across the edge for measurement. A B-spline curve is applied to fit the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> by an optimization method. Silicon carbide media, 50 μm average size, was used to erode a 90 º edge on a workpiece of Inconel 718.

It is found that the edge radius is limited to below 0. 15 mm using abrasive jet machining.

Yet, hardware event samples are typically not precise at the instruction or basic-block granularity. These inaccuracies lead to missed performance when compared to instrumentation-based FDO.

While being capable of minimizing the number of expression evaluations in some cases, they are, in general, not computationally optimal in achieving this objective. In addition, the experimental results for their effectiveness are mostly missing. This work addresses the following three problems: (1) Is the computational optimality of speculative PRE solvable in polynomial time? (2) Is <b>edge</b> <b>profiling</b> — less costly than path profiling — sufficient to guarantee the computational optimality? (3) Is the optimal algorithm (if one exists) lightweight enough to be used efficiently in a dynamic compiler? In this paper, we provide positive answers to the first two problems and promising results to the third. We present an algorithm that analyzes edge insertion points based on an <b>edge</b> <b>profile.</b> Our algorithm guarantees optimally that the total number of computations for an expression in the transformed code is always minimized with respect to the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> given. This implies that <b>edge</b> <b>profiling,</b> which is less costly than path profiling, is sufficient to guarantee this optimality. The key in the development of our algorithm lies in the removal of some non-essential edges (and consequently, all resulting non-essential nodes) from a flow graph so that the problem of finding an optimal code motion is reduced to one of finding a minimal cut in the reduced (flow) graph thus obtained. We have implemented our algorithm in Intel’s Open Runtime Platform (ORP).
