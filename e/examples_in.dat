50|$|The {{pigments}} in photoreceptor proteins either {{change their}} conformation or undergo photoreduction when they absorb a photon. This {{change in the}} conformation or redox state of the chromophore then affects the protein conformation or activity and triggers a signal transduction cascade. Examples for photoreceptor pigments include retinal (for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> rhodopsin), flavin (for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> cryptochrome), and bilin (for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> phytochrome).|$|R
5|$|The design, by John Pemberton, won the Design Council Award in 1977, as the Executive had in 1973, {{and there}} are <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> the {{collection}} of the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Sovereigns are highly collectible, and used models command high prices.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} coal balls {{was made in}} 1855 by Sir Joseph Dalton Hooker and Edward William Binney, who reported on <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> the coal seams of Yorkshire and Lancashire, England. European scientists did much of the early research.|$|E
5|$|According to Pentecostal biblical interpretation, the Gospel of John 20:22 {{shows that}} the disciples of Jesus were already born again before the Holy Spirit fell at Pentecost. They then cite biblical <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> the Book of Acts 2, 8, 10, and 19 {{to show that it}} was common in the New Testament for Spirit baptism to occur after conversion. In {{following}} the biblical pattern, they argue, Christians today should also pray for this baptism which results in greater power for ministry and witness.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{surface-active}} properties, α-cyclodextrin {{can also}} be used as emulsifying fiber, for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> mayonnaise as well as a whipping aid, for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> desserts and confectionery applications.|$|R

5000|$|Th-stopping is also {{commonly}} heard, specifically from {{speakers of}} working-class origins, in the American English dialects of the Inland North (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Milwaukee, Chicago, Cleveland, Buffalo, and Scranton), the Upper Midwest (for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> the especially Fennoscandian-descended locals of Minnesota's Iron Range and Michigan's Upper Peninsula), and Mid-Atlantic region (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Philadelphia and Baltimore), It is also {{heard in a}} minority of speakers of England's Estuary dialect (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> London), but only in case of the word-initial [...] Many speakers of Philippine English and some speakers of other variants in Asia also have th-stopping.|$|R
5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over the attackers, moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, {{the film}} also {{influenced}} many horror films throughout the 1950s and 1960s. In these ghost story films, greed commonly leads to murder and extramarital affairs, many involving former samurai characters. <b>Examples</b> <b>in</b> this genre include Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan (1959). The 1998 Japanese horror film Ringu also {{falls in the}} tradition of Japanese folklore and film, which includes Ugetsu, Tokaido Yotsuya kaidan, Kwaidan (1965) and Onibaba (1964). The 2001 anime fantasy film Spirited Away follows Ugetsu and Kwaidan as a cinematic adaptation of Japanese ghost mythology.|$|E
5|$|In a follow-up, to meet Specification O.21/44 for a two-seat strike fighter, the Spearfish was {{redesigned}} {{to accommodate}} a twin-coupled Rolls-Royce Merlin engine and contra-rotating propellers. A variety of other engines were considered and although a production order was placed for three <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> 1944, the programme was eventually shelved, remaining as an unfulfilled paper project.|$|E
5000|$|Grimme {{is one of}} the few {{internationally known}} German bondage riggers.

30|$|Although some {{case studies}} {{are very close}} to a CCEWS (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka), all were {{initiated}} by an agent external to the beneficiary community (that is, a government or an international agency) whereas participatory approaches highlight the need to have a process that is initiated and owned by the beneficiaries. Perhaps a way to overcome the challenges illustrated in the three case studies, including the cost issue (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Kenya), the erosion of traditional risk management knowledge (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Hawai'i), or the difficulty to ensure long-term community engagement in the EWS (for <b>example,</b> <b>in</b> Sri Lanka), is through the design of EWS that are truly initiated and run by the beneficiaries.|$|R
50|$|Homomorphic {{filtering}} {{is used in}} the log-spectral domain {{to separate}} filter effects from excitation effects, for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> the computation of the cepstrum as a sound representation; enhancements in the log spectral domain can improve sound intelligibility, for <b>example</b> <b>in</b> hearing aids.|$|R

5|$|Leaving Devizes, in 1952 Grinsell became Keeper of Anthropology and Archaeology at Bristol City Museum, {{remaining}} {{there until}} his retirement in 1972. He also published a number of academic articles and book reviews. During his holidays he often visited the Mediterranean, where he examined various prehistoric tombs. He also continued pursuing his interest in barrows, and by the 1970s had also catalogued those <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> Dorset, Gloucestershire, Somerset, and Devon.|$|E

5|$|While {{scholars}} know {{of patriarchal}} and matrifocal ancient societies, very little {{can be said}} about a society of a species, which is as remote as Australopithecus. On the basis of <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> today's chimpanzee and bonobo societies, Klaus Ebner introduced both patriarchal and matriarchal characters in the novel, Costello and Akshaya. Some of the female characters are very strong and self-conscious, such as Akshaya, who is so firm that even Costello s from her. While political power is controlled by the males, the social structure seems matrifocal and matrilineal, corresponding to the image of prehistoric societies exhibited by scholars.|$|E
50|$|The Mississippian Borden Formation is a mapped bedrock unit in Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia, and Tennessee.

5|$|While {{there are}} earlier <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> the Republican period and early Imperial period, {{the growth of}} domed {{construction}} increased under Emperor Nero and the Flavians in the 1st century AD, and during the 2nd century. Centrally planned halls become increasingly important parts of palace and palace villa layouts beginning in the 1st century, serving as state banqueting halls, audience rooms, or throne rooms. Formwork was arranged either horizontally or radially, {{but there is not}} enough surviving evidence from the 1st and 2nd centuries to say what was typical.|$|E
5|$|A truce term {{is a word}} {{or short}} phrase {{accepted}} within a community of children as an effective way of calling for a temporary respite or truce during a game or activity, such as tag or its variants. Common <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> English speaking cultures are barley, fainites, crosses, kings and exe(s)in the United Kingdom, pegs and nibs in New Zealand and variants of barley in Australia. In the United States, terms based on time-out have, from the 1950s onwards, largely supplanted earlier common terms based on kings and exe(s). Since the late 1980s time-out has been recorded in other English speaking cultures besides the US. Examples of use of truce terms are if a child has a stitch or wants to raise a point on {{the rules of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Arran has a {{particular}} concentration of early Neolithic Clyde Cairns, a form of Gallery grave. The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined with larger stone slabs. Pottery and bone fragments found inside the chambers suggest they were used for interment and some have forecourts, {{which may have been}} an area for public display or ritual. There are two good <b>examples</b> <b>in</b> Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E
