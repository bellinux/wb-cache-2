40|$|AbstractIn this article, {{based on}} {{simplifying}} of extinction agent's <b>extinguishing</b> mechanism and the fuel's combustion characteristic, an <b>extinguishing</b> model is established.

40|$|In my {{bachelor}} thesis {{about the}} Possibility of usage fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems for <b>extinguishing</b> fires I was mainly {{interested in the}} topic of fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems and their usage {{and also in the}} problematics of fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems installed and used in the SYNTHOS Kralupy a. s., SYNTHOS PBR s. r. o. and TAMERO INVEST s. r. o. (companies) For this purpose, four fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems were chosen based on the used fire <b>extinguishing</b> agent. According to these criteria were chosen water, foam, powder and gas based fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems, which are described in the thesis with regard to their construction, operation and usage. Chosen fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems were further evaluated regarding their capabilities for <b>extinguishing</b> fire. According to the conducted research current options for fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems are used. Even though current options of usage fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems are used it is possible to improve the usage of them by introducing technical and organizational measures. As a crucial technical measure, there is proposed a technical adjustment of the water based fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> system. For improving the usage of this fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> system and increasing the level of fire safety of the guarded object it is proposed to change this non-automatic fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> system to automatic. Other devices are automatic and the proposed improvements do not have such underlying character as it in case of the evaluated water based fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> system. In the theoretical part of the thesis there are described terms like fire, burning and conflagration (fire). There are named conditions and possibilities for the origin of fire and its spreading and is described the spreading of conflagration in time and space. Furthermore, the theoretical part of the thesis is concerned about named fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems. There is the history of their use for fighting fire, the overview of fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems based on the used agent and the description on the different kinds of fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems along with the description of the possibilities of their use for fighting fire. In the theoretical part are also mentioned new technologies used in the field of fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems. The conclusion of the thesis is focused on the problematics of operation and operational capability of fixed fire <b>extinguishing</b> systems...|$|R

By {{utilizing}} the fire dynamics simulation software FDS, simulate the fire <b>extinguishing</b> {{process of the}} diesel oil fire and gasoline fire with the compressed air foam agent, and compare it with the actual fire <b>extinguishing</b> test. Verify the reliability and {{the accuracy of the}} simulation implemented by FDS software on compressed air foam agent fire <b>extinguishing</b> process under the direct injection. Summary Foam <b>extinguishing</b> agent is a very important fire <b>extinguishing</b> agent. For category B fires, as the combustion is supported by the vapor of the liquid fuel, the water vapor will dilute the fuel vapor, slow down its combustion reaction, and the foam will cover the surface of the fuel to prevent the evaporation of the fuel vapor and isolate the oxygen. However, its <b>extinguishing</b> mechanism is complicated, comprising physical reaction and chemical reaction, therefore, {{it is very difficult to}} implement the fire <b>extinguishing</b> simulation by the conventional computer simulation software. The cost of the conventional fire <b>extinguishing</b> test is too high, and the products of the combustion have serious pollution to the environment. Therefore the research on the CFD fire <b>extinguishing</b> simulation is rapidly developing these years. Only implementing several effective tests associatin...|$|R
