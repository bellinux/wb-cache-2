Mats Wilander {{was the only}} tennis player to win the event on <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> on Rebound Ace surfaces, which he won twice on <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> once on the Rebound Ace. Roger Federer is the only player to have won on both the Rebound Ace and Plexicushion tennis surfaces.|$|E

5|$|Eggs {{are laid}} from early to mid-April in Britain and Ireland, from mid-May in {{southern}} Scandinavia, and from June in the north.

5|$|Quolls are {{suffering}} badly from urbanisation, housing development, mining development, {{and expansion of}} agricultural lands. Habitats are also being destroyed by large herbivores trampling the <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> overgrowth, making camouflage difficult. Forest fires and weeds also contribute to habitat destruction.|$|E
5|$|This sparrow feeds {{primarily}} on small <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> forb seeds, fresh grass stems, and tender plant shoots during autumn and winter. During these seasons, insects such as ants, grasshoppers, ground beetles, and scale insects {{as well as}} spiders make up {{a small part of}} its diet. In the spring and summer, the bird's diet includes a greater quantity and variety of insects.|$|E

5|$|A {{group of}} emigrants under Hendrik Potgieter {{passed through the}} Krugers' Caledon encampments in early 1836. Potgieter envisioned a Boer {{republic}} with himself in a prominent role; he sufficiently impressed the Krugers that they joined his party of Voortrekkers. Kruger's father continued to give the children religious education in the Boer fashion during the trek, having them recite or write down biblical passages from memory each day after lunch and dinner. At stops along the journey classrooms were improvised from reeds and <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> the more educated emigrants took turns in teaching.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching its neck, bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Carbohydrates, {{the main}} energy source in most rations, are usually fed {{in the form}} of hay, <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> grain. Soluble {{carbohydrates}} such as starches and sugars are readily broken down to glucose in the small intestine and absorbed. Insoluble carbohydrates, such as fiber (cellulose), are not digested by the horse's own enzymes, but are fermented by microbes in the cecum and large colon to break down and release their energy sources, volatile fatty acids.|$|E

40|$|Benzoxazinoids are {{constitutive}} protective compounds {{found in}} many <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> in single dicot species. Glucosylation prevents autotoxicity, and upon attack by herbivores and pathogens, the reactive aglucon is produced. Isolation of the benzoxazinoid-specific UDP-glucosyltransferase and β-glucosidase from larkspur reveals convergent evolution of these functions in <b>grasses</b> <b>and</b> in the dicot species...|$|R

5|$|Columbian mammoths {{inhabited}} the southern half of North America, {{ranging from the}} northern United States across Mexico {{as far south as}} Costa Rica. One Costa Rican specimen, a molar, was reported in 1963 but has since been lost. The environment in these areas may have had more varied habitats than those inhabited by woolly mammoths in the north (the mammoth steppe). Some areas were covered by grass, herbaceous plants, trees and shrubs; their composition varied from region to region, and included grassland, savanna and aspen parkland habitats. There were also wooded areas; although mammoths would not have preferred forests, clearings could provide them with <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> herbs.|$|E
5|$|David Nalbandian was Federer's biggest {{rival in}} his early career. The two played each other 19 times, with Federer leading 11–8. Nalbandian {{dominated}} early on, winning their first five matches from 2002–03. Federer reversed this trend at the 2003 Masters Cup, where he recorded his first victory, and {{would go on to}} win 11 of their last 14 meetings. Federer leads 6–5 on hard courts, 1–0 on <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> 3–1 on clay courts, while Nalbandian leads 2–1 on carpet. Notable meetings include Nalbandian's win in a fifth-set tiebreaker to win the 2005 Masters Cup, and Federer's win in the 2006 French Open semifinals. They met each other six times in Grand Slam tournaments, with Federer leading 4–2.|$|E
5|$|Grasses such as sea couch <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> sea poa grass are {{important}} in the driest areas of the marshes, and on the coastal dunes, where marram grass, sand couch-grass, lyme-grass and red fescue help to bind the sand. Sea holly and sand sedge are other specialists of this arid habitat, and petalwort is a nationally rare bryophyte found on damper dunes. Bird's-foot trefoil, pyramidal orchid, bee orchid, lesser centaury and carline thistle flower on the more stable dunes, where the rare Jersey cudweed and grey hair-grass are also found. The narrow 5-km (3-mi) belt of pines shelters creeping lady's tresses and yellow bird's nest.|$|E

5|$|Hunters of game {{have long}} {{made use of}} {{camouflage}} {{in the form of}} materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals. Field sports such as driven grouse shooting conceal hunters in hides (also called blinds or shooting butts). Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed with images of specific kinds of vegetation such as <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> branches.|$|E
5|$|In {{tropical}} {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier {{part of the}} year alternates with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. In tropical regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with <b>grass</b> <b>and</b> scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.|$|E
5|$|On January 12, {{the group}} {{stumbled}} into a Miwok camp looking so deteriorated that the camp's inhabitants initially fled. The Miwoks gave {{them what they}} had to eat: acorns, <b>grass,</b> <b>and</b> pine nuts. After a few days, Eddy continued on {{with the help of a}} Miwok to a ranch in a small farming community at the edge of the Sacramento Valley. A hurriedly assembled rescue party found the other six survivors on January 17. Their journey from Truckee Lake had taken 33days.|$|E
