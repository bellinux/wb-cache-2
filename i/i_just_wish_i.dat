500|$|The Oxford University Boat Club {{president}} and stroke Matthew Smith said [...] "It feels fantastic and I {{think it will}} take a while to top this feeling". [...] He went on to say: [...] "We have got an awesome bunch of guys in this squad... but I have such respect for Cambridge... with a lighter crew we've turned round the biggest weight deficit in history." [...] Nethercott remarked [...] "I really thought we had lost. [...] In the space of a few seconds I went from the lowest point in my life to absolute, unbridled ecstasy." [...] The Cambridge oarsman James Livingston said [...] "It was the worst margin to lose by. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could stop losing these epic races" [...] while the Cambridge coach Williams described the defeat as a [...] "blow to the heart". Wooge was disappointed: [...] "I pull my hat off to Oxford, that was an amazing race." [...] Rankov later revealed [...] "It’s the hardest I’ve ever had to work in an umpiring situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Referred to as a [...] "stoner rap" [...] by Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine, {{the lyrics}} are mostly nonsensical. The song's chorus, in which Beck sings the lines [...] "Soy un perdedor/I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?", is often {{interpreted}} as a parody of Generation X's [...] "slacker" [...] culture. Beck has denied the validity of this meaning, instead saying that the chorus is simply about his lack of skill as a rapper. Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times that [...] "The sentiment of 'Loser' [...] reflects the twentysomething trademark, a mixture of self-mockery and sardonic defiance", noting Beck's [...] "offhand vocal tone and free-associative lyrics" [...] and comparing his vocals to [...] "Bob Dylan talk-singing". After its recording, Beck thought that the song was interesting but unimpressive. He later said, [...] "The raps and vocals are all first takes. If I’d known the impact {{it was going to}} make, I would have put something a little more substantial in it." [...] The relationship between Beck and Stephenson soured after the release of [...] "Loser" [...] as a single. Stephenson regretted his involvement in creating the song, in particular the [...] "negative" [...] lyrics, saying [...] "I feel bad about it. It's not Beck the person, it's the words. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could have been more of a positive influence." ...|$|E

The song garnered him popularity as he was on top of major portal search rankings in South Korea after the song's release. Additionally, Yong Guk has been requested for multiple broadcast appearances as representatives expressed interest in his [...] "handsome looks and professional stage performances". However, TS Entertainment declined the offer and stated that “He’s still a trainee so he’s not set to appear in broadcasts other than for ‘Going Crazy’ promotions. However, thank you for giving your support to a new singer“. Representatives from TS Entertainment shared their views on Bang Yong-guk's performance and said, “Despite being a rookie, he received the opportunity to participate in Song Ji Eun’s solo album. He may be lacking, but thank you for showing him your interest.” Through Naver, Yongguk shared his sentiments on promoting [...] "Going Crazy":“I’ve realized that actually being on stage is vastly different from everything I’ve rehearsed for and that I still have more to learn.

Lord, Anne, dearie, that man was eighty, and everybody who knew him had been wishing him dead these thirty years. Read obituaries when you're blue, Anne, dearie--especially the ones of folks you know. If you've any sense of humor at all they'll cheer you up, believe ME. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had the writing of the obituaries of some people. Isn't 'obituary' an awful ugly word? This very Peter I've been speaking of had a face exactly like one. I never saw it but I thought of the word OBITUARY then and there. There's only one uglier word that I know of, and that's RELICT.

5000|$|Wallace {{was heavily}} criticized for trading away the Grizzlies' 27-year-old {{franchise}} player, Pau Gasol, to the Los Angeles Lakers on February 1, 2008.
