50|$|The {{identification}} and <b>health</b> <b>marks</b> {{are not an}} indication for the specific origin of a particular piece of food by themselves, as they do not encode {{the location of the}} farm that provided the initial raw product or livestock.

Maternal obesity {{is associated with}} many pregnancy complications, especially gestational diabetes and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Delivery in obese women {{is characterized by a}} high caesarean-section rate and an increased risk of anaesthetic and postoperative complications. Weight retention after birth may increase the risk of type 2 diabetes in the long term. Foetal risks include macrosomia, malformations and increased perinatal mortality, with the long-term infant <b>health</b> <b>marked</b> by a higher risk of obesity and metabolic disorders. Optimal management includes preconception counselling, pregravid weight-loss programmes, monitoring of gestational weight gain, repeated screening for pregnancy complications and long-term follow-up to minimize the social and economic consequences of pregnancy in overweight women...|$|R

This research work intended to study the effect of different absorption cycles of two saturated solutions of sodium sulphate and potassium chloride in the capillary absorption curves obtained through the partial immersion of red brick samples without and with different joints. The results revealed {{significant differences in the}} capillary coefficients obtained when samples were tested with salt solutions. In the end of this paper an evaluation of the drying kinetics was presented for all the tested samples. Four different first-order kinetics models, available in the literature, were adjusted to describe the drying process and the results point that the Page and Logarithmic models allow the best fit. The apparent molecular diffusion coefficient for solid red brick samples saturated with different solutions and joints was also estimated...|$|R
