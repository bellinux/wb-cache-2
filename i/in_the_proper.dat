The goal of the book was to aid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> handling, selling and profiting from the business of selling pork. Furthermore, Nicholls noted that this book would come to fill a need for the students who would be taking the Institute of Certificated Grocer exams.|$|E

5|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{difference in}} the storyline takes place when Zhou travels with his teenage disciples to visit his friend the Abbot. Instead of Yue wandering behind the temple to battle the magical snake, he stays with Zhou and the Abbot, while the other disciples go off to explore. Zhou watches as the Abbot tests Yue's strength by asking him to move an ornate three-hundred pound copper stove dating from the Han Dynasty. The abbot then lifts a stone floor tile and presents the boy with a large book on military strategy. He goes on to tell Yue how he was once a great soldier who fought in campaigns against the Liao and Western Xia empires, but became a monk after the Song agreed to become a vassal of each state. He later {{made a name for}} himself by teaching military skills to youths from the surrounding area. Since he has no heir of his own, the Abbot presents Yue with his own personal spear and instructs him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> use of the weapon. Zhou kindly protests the gift at first, but allows Yue to keep it out of friendship.|$|E
5|$|The first direct {{measurement}} of the distance to a star (61 Cygni at 11.4 light-years) was made in 1838 by Friedrich Bessel using the parallax technique. Parallax measurements demonstrated the vast separation of {{the stars in the}} heavens. Observation of double stars gained increasing importance during the 19th century. In 1834, Friedrich Bessel observed changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>proper</b> motion of the star Sirius and inferred a hidden companion. Edward Pickering discovered the first spectroscopic binary in 1899 when he observed the periodic splitting of the spectral lines of the star Mizar in a 104-day period. Detailed observations of many binary star systems were collected by astronomers such as Friedrich Georg Wilhelm von Struve and S. W. Burnham, allowing the masses of stars to be determined from computation of orbital elements. The first {{solution to the problem of}} deriving an orbit of binary stars from telescope observations was made by Felix Savary in 1827.|$|E
