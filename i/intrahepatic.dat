5|$|Other liver-related {{complications}} (portal hypertension, esophageal varices, ascites, hepatic encephalopathy) {{are treated}} with the same modalities as used in cirrhosis, although the use of transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt treatment is discouraged {{due to the lack}} of documented benefit.|$|E
5|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} {{may also}} occur after {{the creation of}} a transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt (TIPS). This is used in the treatment of refractory ascites, bleeding from oesophageal varices and hepatorenal syndrome. TIPS-related encephalopathy occurs in about 30% of cases, with the risk being higher in those with previous episodes of encephalopathy, higher age, female sex and liver disease due to causes other than alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Cholangiocarcinoma {{can affect}} any {{area of the}} bile ducts, either within or outside the liver. Tumors {{occurring}} in the bile ducts within the liver {{are referred to as}} <b>intrahepatic,</b> those occurring in the ducts outside the liver are extrahepatic, and tumors occurring at the site where the bile ducts exit the liver may be referred to as perihilar. A cholangiocarcinoma occurring at the junction where the left and right hepatic ducts meet to form the common hepatic duct may be referred to eponymously as a Klatskin tumor.|$|E
5|$|Surgical {{resection}} {{offers the}} only potential chance of cure in cholangiocarcinoma. For non-resectable cases, the 5-year survival rate is 0% where {{the disease is}} inoperable because distal lymph nodes show metastases, and less than 5% in general. Overall median duration of survival is less than 6 months in inoperable, untreated, otherwise healthy patients with tumors involving the liver {{by way of the}} <b>intrahepatic</b> bile ducts and hepatic portal vein.|$|E
5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is not clearly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, <b>intrahepatic</b> stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E
5|$|For {{surgical}} cases, {{the odds}} of cure {{vary depending on the}} tumor location and whether the tumor can be completely, or only partially, removed. Distal cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the common bile duct) are generally treated surgically with a Whipple procedure; long-term survival rates range from 15%–25%, although one series reported a five-year survival of 54% for patients with no involvement of the lymph nodes. <b>Intrahepatic</b> cholangiocarcinomas (those arising from the bile ducts within the liver) are usually treated with partial hepatectomy. Various series have reported survival estimates after surgery ranging from 22%–66%; the outcome may depend on involvement of lymph nodes and completeness of the surgery. Perihilar cholangiocarcinomas (those occurring near where the bile ducts exit the liver) are least likely to be operable. When surgery is possible, they are generally treated with an aggressive approach often including removal of the gallbladder and potentially part of the liver. In patients with operable perihilar tumors, reported 5-year survival rates range from 20%–50%.|$|E
25|$|The <b>intrahepatic</b> shunts {{found in}} large dog breeds are passed on {{in a simple}} {{autosomal}} recessive way, while the extrahepatic shunts of the small breeds are inherited on a polygenic basis.|$|E
25|$|In a {{minority}} of people with advanced cirrhosis that have recurrent ascites, shunts may be used. Typical shunts used are portacaval shunt, peritoneovenous shunt, and the transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt (TIPS). However, none of these shunts {{has been shown to}} extend life expectancy, and are considered to be bridges to liver transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Like {{many large}} dog breeds, Irish Wolfhounds have a {{relatively}} short lifespan. Published lifespan estimations vary between 6 and 10 years with 7 years being the average. Dilated cardiomyopathy and bone cancer are {{the leading cause of}} death and like all deep-chested dogs, gastric torsion (bloat) is common; the breed is affected by hereditary <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt.|$|E
25|$|Congenital PSS is a {{hereditary}} {{condition in}} dogs and cats, its frequency varying {{depending on the}} breed. The shunts found mainly in small dog breeds such as Shih Tzus, Tibetan Spaniels, Miniature Schnauzers and Yorkshire Terriers, and in cats such as Persians, British Shorthairs, Himalayans, and mixed breeds are usually extrahepatic (outside the liver), while the shunts found in large dog breeds such as Irish Wolfhounds and Labrador Retrievers tend to be <b>intrahepatic</b> (inside the liver).|$|E
25|$|For portal hypertension, nonselective beta {{blockers}} such as propranolol or nadolol {{are commonly used}} to lower blood pressure over the portal system. In severe complications from portal hypertension, transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunting (TIPS) is occasionally indicated to relieve pressure on the portal vein. As this shunting can worsen hepatic encephalopathy, it is reserved for those patients at low risk of encephalopathy. TIPS is generally regarded only as a bridge to liver transplantation or as a palliative measure.|$|E
25|$|Colonoscopy {{is useful}} for the {{diagnosis}} and treatment of lower GI bleeding. A number of techniques may be employed including: clipping, cauterizing, and sclerotherapy. Preparation for colonoscopy takes a minimum of six hours which in those bleeding briskly may limit its applicability. Surgery, while rarely used to treat upper GI bleeds, is still commonly used to manage lower GI bleeds by cutting out the part of the intestines that is causing the problem. Angiographic embolization may be used for both upper and lower GI bleeds. Transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may also be considered.|$|E
25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically includes octreotide or if not available vasopression and nitroglycerin to reduce portal pressures. This is typically in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varicies. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates {{may be used for}} the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues then balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varicies. This may then be followed by a transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt.|$|E
25|$|In {{those with}} {{significant}} varices or cirrhosis nonselective β-blockers {{reduce the risk}} of future bleeding. With a target heart rate of 55beats per minute they reduce the absolute risk of bleeding by 10%. Endoscopic band ligation (EBL) is also effective at improving outcomes. Either B-blockers or EBL are recommended as initial preventative measures. In those who have had a previous varcial bleed both treatments are recommended. With some evidence supporting the addition of isosorbide mononitrate. Testing for and treating those who are positive for H. pylori is recommended. Transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunting (TIPS) may be used to prevent bleeding in people who re-bleed despite other measures.|$|E
25|$|Discrete {{localized}} enlargements {{of normal}} structures (ureters, blood vessels, <b>intrahepatic</b> or extrahepatic biliary ducts, pulmonary inclusions, or gastrointestinal duplications) due to outflow obstructions or narrowings, or abnormal connections, may also present as a tumor. Examples are arteriovenous fistulae or aneurysms (with or without thrombosis), biliary fistulae or aneurysms, sclerosing cholangitis, cysticercosis or hydatid cysts, intestinal duplications, and pulmonary inclusions as seen with cystic fibrosis. It {{can be dangerous}} to biopsy a number of types of tumor in which the leakage of their contents would potentially be catastrophic. When such types of tumors are encountered, diagnostic modalities such as ultrasound, CT scans, MRI, angiograms, and nuclear medicine scans are employed prior to (or during) biopsy or surgical exploration/excision {{in an attempt to}} avoid such severe complications.|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of ABC {{transporters}} {{have been}} characterized from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ABC genes {{are essential for}} many processes in the cell, and mutations in human genes cause or contribute to several human genetic diseases. Forty eight ABC genes {{have been reported in}} humans. Among these, many have been characterized and shown to be causally related to diseases present in humans such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, drug-resistant tumors, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Byler’s disease, progressive familiar <b>intrahepatic</b> cholestasis, X-linked sideroblastic anemia, ataxia, and persistent and hyperinsulimenic hypoglycemia. ABC transporters are also involved in multiple drug resistance, and this is how some of them were first identified. When the ABC transport proteins are overexpressed in cancer cells, they can export anticancer drugs and render tumors resistant.|$|E
25|$|For initial fluid {{replacement}} colloids or albumin {{is preferred}} {{in people with}} cirrhosis. Medications typically include octreotide or, if not available, vasopressin and nitroglycerin to reduce portal venous pressures. Terlipressin {{appears to be more}} effective than octreotide, but it is not available {{in many areas of the}} world. It is the only medication that has been shown to reduce mortality in acute variceal bleeding. This is in addition to endoscopic banding or sclerotherapy for the varices. If this is sufficient then beta blockers and nitrates may be used for the prevention of re-bleeding. If bleeding continues, balloon tamponade with a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or Minnesota tube may be used in an attempt to mechanically compress the varices. This may then be followed by a transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt. In those with cirrhosis, antibiotics decrease the chance of bleeding again, shorten the length of time spent in hospital, and decrease mortality. Octreotide reduces the need for blood transfusions and may decrease mortality. No trials of vitamin K have been conducted.|$|E

500|$|A transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt (TIPS) {{involves}} the decompression {{of the high}} pressures in the portal circulation by placing a small stent between a portal and hepatic vein. This is done through radiologically guided catheters which are passed into the hepatic vein either through the internal jugular vein or the femoral vein. [...] Theoretically, a decrease in portal pressures is thought to reverse the hemodynamic phenomena that ultimately {{lead to the development}} of hepatorenal syndrome. [...] TIPS has been shown to improve kidney function in patients with hepatorenal syndrome. [...] Complications of TIPS for treatment of HRS include the worsening of hepatic encephalopathy (as the procedure {{involves the}} forced creation of a porto-systemic shunt, effectively bypassing the ability of the liver to clear toxins), inability to achieve adequate reduction in portal pressure, and bleeding.|$|E
500|$|The risk {{of death}} in hepatorenal {{syndrome}} is very high; the mortality of individuals with type 1 HRS is over 50% over the short term, as determined by historical case series. The only long-term treatment option for the condition is liver transplantation. [...] While awaiting transplantation, people with HRS often receive other treatments that improve the abnormalities in blood vessel tone, including supportive care with medications, or the insertion of a transjugular <b>intrahepatic</b> portosystemic shunt (TIPS), which is a small shunt placed to reduce blood pressure in the portal vein. [...] Some patients may require hemodialysis to support kidney function, or a newer technique called liver dialysis which uses a dialysis circuit with albumin-bound membranes to bind and remove toxins normally cleared by the liver, providing a means of extracorporeal liver support until transplantation can be performed.|$|E

2500|$|Congenital PSS {{is caused}} by the failure of the fetal circulatory system of the liver to change. [...] Normally, the blood from the {{placenta}} bypasses the liver and goes into circulation via the ductus venosus, a blood vessel found in the fetus. [...] A failure of the ductus venosus to close causes an <b>intrahepatic</b> shunt, while extrahepatic shunts are usually a developmental abnormality of the vitelline veins, which connect the portal vein to the caudal vena cava. [...] Thus in the juvenile and adult animal with PSS, blood from the intestines only partly goes through the liver, and the rest mixes into general circulation. [...] Toxins such as ammonia are not cleared by the liver. [...] Most commonly, extrahepatic shunts are found connecting the portal vein or left gastric vein to the caudal vena cava.|$|E
2500|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is best, {{when it can}} be performed. [...] Pressure within the portal vein is measured as the shunt is closed, {{and it must be}} kept below 20cm H2O or else portal hypertension will ensue. [...] Methods of shunt attenuation should aim to slowly occlude the vessel over several weeks to months in order to avoid complications associated with portal hypertension. These methods include ameroid ring constrictors, cellophane banding, intravascular or percutaneous silicone hydraulic occluders. The most common methods of attenuation used by veterinarians are ameroid ring constrictors and cellophane banding. Both methods have reportedly good outcomes in both cats and dogs, although the true composition of readily sourced cellophane {{has been found to be}} made from plastics (inert) and not cellulose (stimulates a fibrous reaction). Recently, a commercial supplier of regenerated cellulose based cellophane for veterinarians has been established for use of [...] Complete closure of extrahepatic shunts results in a very low recurrence rate, while incomplete closure results in a recurrence rate of about 50 percent. [...] However, not all dogs with extrahepatic shunts tolerate complete closure (16 to 68 percent). [...] <b>Intrahepatic</b> shunts are much more difficult to surgically correct than extrahepatic shunts due to their hidden nature, large vessel size, and greater tendency toward portal hypertension when completely closed. [...] When surgery is not an option, PSS is treated as are other forms of liver failure. [...] Dietary protein restriction is helpful to lessen signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and antibiotics such as neomycin or metronidazole and other medicines such as lactulose can reduce ammonia production and absorption in the intestines. [...] The prognosis is guarded for any form of PSS.|$|E
