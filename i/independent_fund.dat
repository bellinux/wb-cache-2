500|$|Internet {{reviewer}} MaryAnn Johanson {{acknowledged that}} American Graffiti rekindled public and entertainment {{interest in the}} 1950s and 1960s, and influenced other films such as The Lords of Flatbush (1974) and Cooley High (1975) and the TV series Happy Days. Alongside other films from the New Hollywood era, American Graffiti is often cited for helping give birth to the summer blockbuster. The film's box office success made George Lucas an instant millionaire. He gave an amount of the film's profits to Haskell Wexler for his visual consulting help during filming, and to Wolfman Jack for [...] "inspiration". Lucas's net worth was now $4 million, and he set aside a $300,000 <b>independent</b> <b>fund</b> for his long cherished space opera project, which would eventually become the basis for Star Wars (1977).|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{understand}} {{the factors that}} facilitate career success for career development awardees in clinical and translational science and reconceptualize understand ing of career success for this population. METHOD: In 2013 - 2014, the authors conducted semistructured interviews with former NIH KL 2 or K 12 scholars from nine Clinical and Translational Science Award-funded institutions. Participants either had or had not secured <b>independent</b> <b>funding</b> {{at least two years}} after the end of their last K award. Questions covered the factors that facilitate or hinder junior investigators' transition to <b>independent</b> <b>funding.</b> Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the transcripts were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: Forty individuals participated, with equal representation by men and women and by independently and not independently funded investigators. Personal factors that facilitated success included networks, persistence and resilience, initiative, autonomy, and personal and professional balance. Organizational factors included appropriate mentorship, protected research time, and institutional resources and support. Even independently funded participants described challenges regarding career direction. Five participants without <b>independent</b> <b>funding</b> modeled a broad spectrum of successful career paths, having assumed leadership positions not reliant on grant funding. Alternative definitions of career success included improving public health, enjoying work, seeing mentees succeed, and receiving external acknowledgment of successes. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of the factors that facilitate or hinder career success can help junior faculty, mentors, and institutional leaders support career development in clinical and translational science. New definitions of career success are needed, as are career paths for faculty who want to engage in research in roles other than principal investigator...|$|R
