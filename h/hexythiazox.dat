Sendo assim, o presente trabalho foi realizado com o objetivo de subsidiar a recomendação de mistura de acaricidas no manejo da resistência de B. phoenicis a <b>hexythiazox.</b> Para esse propósito, foram realizados estudos para 1) avaliar a relação de resistência cruzada entre <b>hexythiazox</b> e {{cyhexatin}} em B. phoenicis; 2) 2) entender a estabilidade da resistência de B. phoenicis a <b>hexythiazox</b> mediante a comparação da biologia das linhagens suscetível (S) e resistente (R) ao <b>hexythiazox</b> em condições de laboratório e a avaliação da dinâmica da resistência em condições de campo, por um período de dois anos; e 3) avaliar a estratégia da mistura de <b>hexythiazox</b> com os acaricidas cyhexatin ou dicofol mediante a condução de estudos de persistência da atividade biológica de acaricidas sobre as linhagens S e R, além de experimentos de campo para validar essa estratégia. A estimativa da freqüência de resistência a <b>hexythiazox</b> foi realizada com bioensaio de contato direto sobre ovos, utilizando-se a concentração discriminatória de 18 mg de hexythiazox/L de água. A resistência cruzada entre <b>hexythiazox</b> e cyhexatin foi ausente. Não foram verificadas diferenças significativas entre as linhagens S e R, com relação aos parâmetros biológicos avaliados para a confecção das tabelas de vida e fertilidade em condições de laboratório. No entanto, a resistência de B. phoenicis a <b>hexythiazox</b> foi instável em condições de campo; isto é, foram verificadas reduções significativas na freqüência de resistência na ausência de pressão de seleção, tanto em talhões com baixa (60 %) freqüência de resistência. Estudos de persistência da atividade biológica de <b>hexythiazox,</b> utilizada na forma isolada ou em mistura com cyhexatin ou dicofol, evidenciaram que há discriminação na taxa instantânea de crescimento (ri) das linhagens S e R. Dicofol apresentou menor persistência do que <b>hexythiazox</b> e cyhexatin. As freqüências de resistência a <b>hexythiazox</b> estimadas após a utilização da mistura de <b>hexythiazox</b> com cyhexatin ou dicofol foram significativamente menores do que a freqüência estimada após a utilização de <b>hexythiazox</b> isoladamente; porém maiores do que as freqüências estimadas após a utilização de cyhexatin ou dicofol isoladamente. Apesar do controle satisfatório de B. phoenicis com a utilização da mistura em pomares com baixa freqüência de resistência a <b>hexythiazox,</b> essa estratégia deve ser recomendada com cautela para o manejo da resistência de B. phoenicis a <b>hexythiazox.</b> The {{mixture of}} <b>hexythiazox</b> with acaricides with adulticidal activity {{has been exploited}} for controlling Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes, 1939) in citrus groves. Therefore, this research was conducted to subsidize the recommendation of mixture of acaricides {{in the management of}} B. phoenicis resistance to <b>hexythiazox.</b> For this purpose, studies were undertaken 1) to evaluate cross-resistance relationship between <b>hexythiazox</b> and cyhexatin; 2) to understand the stability of B. phoenicis resistance to <b>hexythiazox</b> by comparing the life-history of susceptible (S) and resistant (R) strains of B. phoenicis to <b>hexythiazox</b> under laboratory conditions and by evaluating the dynamics of the resistance under field conditions, during a 2 -year period; and 3) to evaluate the strategy of the mixture of <b>hexythiazox</b> with cyhexatin or dicofol acaricides by evaluating the persistence of biological activity of the acaricides on S and R strains and conducting field experiments to validate this strategy. The frequency of resistance to <b>hexythiazox</b> was estimated with direct contact bioassays on eggs with the use of discriminating concentration of 18 mg of hexythiazox/L of water. There is no cross-resistance between <b>hexythiazox</b> and cyhexatin. No significant differences were observed between S and R strains in relation to biological parameters evaluated to built life and fertility tables under laboratory conditions. However, the resistance of B. phoenicis to <b>hexythiazox</b> was unstable under field conditions; that is, significant reductions in the frequency of resistance were observed in the absence of selection pressure, either in fields with low (60 %) frequency of resistance. Studies on persistence of biological activities of <b>hexythiazox,</b> used by itself or in mixture with cyhexatin or dicofol, showed that there is clear discrimination between S and R strains based on the instantaneous rate of increase (ri). Dicofol was less persistent than <b>hexythiazox</b> and cyhexatin. Frequencies of resistance to <b>hexythiazox</b> estimated following the use of mixture of <b>hexythiazox</b> with cyhexatin or dicofol were significantly lower than that with the use of <b>hexythiazox</b> alone; but higher than the frequencies estimated following the use of cyhexatin or dicofol alone. Despite of good control of B. phoenicis in citrus groves with low frequencies of resistance to <b>hexythiazox,</b> the mixture of acaricides must be recommended with cautious for managing the resistance of B. phoenicis to <b>hexythiazox...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} of <b>hexythiazox</b> (tradename Nissorun) to adult female twospotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch) and their eggs {{was investigated in}} laboratory studies. <b>Hexythiazox</b> {{was found to be}} relatively non-toxic to adult female T. urticae. The calculated LC₅₀ value was 59 times that of the suggested field application rate (2. 5 x 10 ⁻³ % a. i.). Exposure of adult female T. urticae to direct sprays and resuidues on leaf surfaces both caused chemosterilisation of the mites. Eggs produced following treatment failed to hatch. However, this effect was temporary and following removal of the adult female mites from <b>hexythiazox</b> residues, percentage hatch rose to levels equivalent to that of the controls. A leaf disc method was used to examine the ovicidal activity of <b>hexythiazox.</b> Baseline toxicity data for <b>hexythiazox</b> on T. urticae eggs were determined. LC₅₀’s of 1. 6 x 10 ⁻⁴ % a. i. for direct spray and 3. 2 x 10 ⁻⁴ % a. i. for residue exposure were calculated. The effect of post-treatment temperature on {{toxicity of}} <b>hexythiazox</b> to eggs was investigated. An inverse relationship was found to occur over the temperature range of 15 to 30 °C. Eggs maintained at 15 °C were 8. 7 times more susceptible than eggs maintained at 30 °C. The effect of egg age, at the time of treatment, on toxicity of <b>hexythiazox</b> to eggs was investigated. An inverse relationship was observed. Eggs treated at 48 – 72 hours were four times more tolerant than eggs treated at 0 – 6 hours. However, a greater than 100 fold increase in tolerance in eggs treated at 72 – 96 hours over the previous age group (49 – 72 hours) occurred. The effect of leaf type on the toxicity of <b>hexythiazox</b> to T. urticae eggs was examined. Five leaf types were used: broad bean (Vicia faba, cv. ‘Exhibition Long Pod’), strawberry (Fragaria X ananassa, cv. ‘Red Gauntlet’), raspberry (Rubus idaeus, cv. ‘Glen Prosen’) and two apple cultivars (Malus sp. Cv. ‘Red Delicious’ and ‘Granny Smith’). Significant differences in toxicity between the leaf types occurred. <b>Hexythiazox</b> was most toxic to eggs laid on broad bean leaves, least toxic to eggs laid on the apple cultivars, and of intermediate toxicity to eggs laid on strawberry and raspberry. Microscopic examination of eggs treated with a lethal dose of <b>hexythiazox,</b> showed that embryos reach an advanced stage of development before dying.

There was no egg hatching when eggs were sprayed with one third of the recommended concentration of spiromesifen. This was statistically significantly different from all other treatments (fenpyroximate, chlorfenapyr, propargite, dicofol and <b>hexythiazox)</b> which were, however, at par with each other. Based on the 10 th day observations, the ovicidal activity of spiromesifen (100 %) was followed by dicofol (7. 78 % egg mortality) and <b>hexythiazox</b> (6. 67 %).

40|$|The acaricides clofentezine, <b>hexythiazox</b> and {{etoxazole}} {{are commonly}} referred to as ‘mite growth inhibitors’, and clofentezine and <b>hexythiazox</b> have been used successfully for the integrated control of plant mite pests for decades. Although they are still important today, their mode of action has remained elusive. Recently, a mutation in chitin synthase 1 (CHS 1) was linked to etoxazole resistance. In this study, we identified and investigated a Tetranychus urticae strain (HexR) harboring recessive, monogenic resistance to each of <b>hexythiazox,</b> clofentezine, and etoxazole. To elucidate if there is a common genetic basis for the observed cross-resistance, we adapted a previously developed bulk segregant analysis method to map with high resolution a single, shared resistance locus for all three compounds. This finding indicates that the underlying molecular basis for resistance to all three compounds is identical. This locus is centered on the CHS 1 gene, and as supported by additional genetic and biochemical studies, a non-synonymous variant (I 1017 F) in CHS 1 associates with resistance to each of the tested acaricides in HexR. Our findings thus demonstrate a shared molecular mode of action for the chemically diverse mite growth inhibitors clofentezine, <b>hexythiazox</b> and etoxazole as inhibitors of an essential, non-catalytic activity of CHS 1. Given the previously documented cross-resistance between clofentezine, <b>hexythiazox</b> and the benzyolphenylurea (BPU) compounds flufenoxuron and cycloxuron, CHS 1 should be also considered as a potential target-site of insecticidal BPUs...|$|E

When dried, the fruits were collected (eight/plants) and half of them were washed in laboratory with artificial rainfall on the basis of 30 mm/h during 15 minutes establishing the following treatments: T 1 - <b>hexythiazox</b> + washing; T 2 - <b>hexythiazox</b> + agral + washing; T 3 - quinometionato + washing; T 4 - quinometionato + agral + washing; T 5 - control + agral + washing; T 6 - hexythiazox; T 7 - <b>hexythiazox</b> + agral; T 8 - quinometionato; T 9 - quinometionato + agral; T 10 - control + agral. Thus, all the fruits were inoculated with ten females of B. phoenicis and five days later the mites alive were counted and eliminated. Approximately 15 days later the number of larvae alive were also counted.

40|$|The predatory mite, Galendromus flumenis (Chant) (Acari: Phytoseiidae), is {{the most}} {{abundant}} predator and the only phytoseiid species on date bunches infested with Banks grass mite, Oligonychus pratensis (Banks) (Acari: Tetranychidae). Biological studies were conducted on this predatory mite {{in order to develop}} and optimize biological control strategies against the Banks grass mite. In the first chapter, studies showed that G. flumenis feeds on all immature stages of Banks grass mite, but it prefers eggs over the other stages. Functional response studies indicated that the predator displays a type II response on all immature stages of the prey. The mutual interference study in Chapter 2 revealed that total predation increased with increasing G. flumenis density in two arena sizes. However, there was not a proportional increase in per capita predation due to mutual interference. The interference effect was high in small arenas due to higher encounter rates between predators. Also, higher predator density and smaller arena size caused significantly higher dispersal rate of predators. In Chapter 3 data show that G. flumenis develops under a wide range of temperatures from 18 °C to 42 °C, but survival rates were highest between 26 °C and 38 °C. The optimal temperature for development (Topt) was calculated to be 37. 6 °C. Further work on the population growth and reproduction of G. flumenis (Chapter 4) showed that predators cannot oviposit at 38 °C (Topt). At 34 °C, the next temperature with the shortest developmental time for the predator, G. flumenis showed medium reproductive capacity (1. 6 eggs/ day and 19. 9 eggs/ ovipositional period), which is inferior to its prey. The net reproductive rate of prey can reach three times the maximum potential of G. flumenis, contributing to an intrinsic rate of natural increase of the prey that is more than double that of the predator. In the final chapter, treatment with the miticide <b>hexythiazox</b> had little or no effect on immature development and reproduction of emerging adult predators. <b>Hexythiazox</b> did not have any adverse effect on the fecundity of treated females, hatch rate of eggs, progeny development, or sex ratio...|$|E

40|$|Acaricides {{are one of}} the {{cornerstones}} of {{an efficient}} control program for phytophagous mites. An analysis of the global acaricide market reveals that spider mites such as Tetranychus urticae, Panonychus citri and Panonychus ulmi are by far the most economically important species, representing more than 80 % of the market. Other relevant mite groups are false spider mites (mainly Brevipalpus), rust and gall mites and tarsonemid mites. Acaricides are most frequently used in vegetables and fruits (74 % of the market), including grape vines and citrus. However, their use is increasing in major crops where spider mites are becoming more important, such as soybean, cotton and corn. As revealed by a detailed case study of the Japanese market, major shifts in acaricide use are partially driven by resistance development and the commercial availability of compounds with novel mode of action. The importance of the latter cannot be underestimated, although some compounds are successfully used for more than 30 years.

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} (Tetranychus urticae) is a global and {{important}} crop pest that is mainly controlled by acaricides. Its rapid development, high fecundity and haplo-diploid reproduction all contribute to the fast development of resistance. Resistance to acaricides can arise due to modification of the target site or by an increased detoxification. Recently, the complete genome of T. urticae was sequenced and used in this work to develop innovative techniques to study resistance in spider mites. First, using high-throughput sequencing, we developed a bulk segregant mapping method which allowed us to map resistance genes in high resolution. We uncovered that the resistance locus for the mite growth inhibitors etoxazole, <b>hexythiazox</b> and clofentezine maps to a small genomic region coinciding with the chitin synthase- 1 (CHS- 1) gene. Based on additional genetic and biochemical investigations, we reveal that a point mutation in CHS- 1 confers strong resistance, hereby also elucidating the mode of action of an important class of acaricides. Second, we used a gene expression microarray to compare gene expression levels of susceptible and resistant mites on a genome-wide basis. We investigated resistance to the tetronic acid derivate spirodiclofen, a recently commercialized acaricide. Gene expression data of genetically distinct resistant strains revealed that {{the expression of a}} number of detoxification genes was greatly increased.

Orius laevigatuswas used as test species. A `worst case' laboratory method wasdeveloped for evaluating the effect on mortality of the nymphsand the reproduction of the adults. An extended laboratory methodgives information {{on the effect of}} pesticides on adults undermore natural conditions. A semi-field test is executed in smallplots under field (glasshouse) conditions. Finally a field testsimulates the conditions in a commercial crop. For harmfulchemicals, both a laboratory and a semi-field persistence testwas developed to determine the safety period after which thepredatory bugs can be re-introduced in the greenhouse withoutbeing adversely affected. The total result of this sequentialscheme should indicate whether, and with what restrictions, aparticular pesticide can be implemented in IPM programs in whichO. laevigatus is used for control of western flower thrips(Frankliniella occidentalis). Twenty-two pesticides were testedincluding five fungicides, twelve insecticides and fiveacaricides. The fungicides captan, carbendazim, sulphur, thiram,tolylfluanid and the insecticides or acaricides pymetrozine,pyriproxyfen, tebufenozide and <b>hexythiazox</b> were harmless in the`worst case' laboratory test and thus did not need furthertesting.

40|$|Abamectin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} insecticides worldwide. It is used against major agricultural pests and insects of public health importance, as well as against endoparasites in animal health. Abamectin has been used successfully for the control of the spider mite Tetranychus urticae, a major agricultural pest with global distribution, an extremely diverse host range, and a remarkable ability to develop resistance against insecticides including abamectin. Target site resistance mutations may explain a large part of resistance, although genetic evidence and transcriptomic data indicated that additional mechanisms may also be implicated in the abamectin resistant phenotype. To investigate a functional link between cytochrome P 450 -mediated metabolism and abamectin resistance, we recombinantly expressed three cytochrome P 450 s (CYP 392 A 16, CYP 392 D 8 and CYP 392 D 10) that have been associated with high levels of abamectin resistance in a resistant T. urticae strain isolated from Greece. CYP 392 A 16 was expressed predominately in its P 450 form however, both CYP 392 D 8 and CYP 392 D 10 were expressed predominately as P 420, despite optimization efforts on expression conditions. CYP 392 A 16 catalyses the hydroxylation of abamectin (Kcat = 0. 54 pmol/min/pmol P 450; Km = 45. 9 μM), resulting in a substantially less toxic compound as confirmed by bioassays with the partially purified metabolite. However, CYP 392 A 16 did not metabolize <b>hexythiazox,</b> clofentezine and bifenthrin, active ingredients that also showed reduced toxicity in the abamectin resistant strain. Among a number of fluorescent and luminescent substrates screened, Luciferin-ME EGE was preferentially metabolized by CYP 392 A 16, and it may be a potential diagnostic probe for metabolic resistance detection and monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Problems with Tetranychus urticae are {{frequently}} reported in protected crops in Italy, particularly in roses where many introduced acaricides show a progressive loss of effectiveness. We have conducted bioassays {{to assess the}} response of some Italian strains of T. urticae {{to a number of}} acaricides. These include compounds that were widespread and frequently used in the past, but also some recently registered compounds. We investigated two T. urticae strains collected from rose growers where control failures were reported (SAN and PSE), together with a strain collected from unsprayed vegetables (BOSA). Adult females of the rose strains (SAN and PSE) were resistant to tebufenpyrad (Resistant Ratio—RR, RR 50 = 48. 4 and 163. 6) and fenpyroximate (RR 50 = 74. 1 and 25. 9) when compared to the susceptible BOSA strain. Lethal concentrations for these products were higher than the registered field rate. The PSE strain proved to be highly resistant to abamectin (RR 50 = 1, 294. 1). Variation in bifenazate susceptibility was detected amongst strains, but LC 90 values of SAN and PSE were still in the range of the registered field rate. In egg bioassays, the SAN and PSE strains exhibited high resistance levels to clofentezine (RR 50 = 66, 473 and 170, 714), <b>hexythiazox</b> (RR 50 = 70, 244 and 159, 493) and flufenoxuron (RR 50 = 61. 9 and 117. 9). But the recently introduced ovi/larvicides etoxazole and spirodiclofen exhibited high activity on all strains. The activity of detoxifying enzymes such as esterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases (MFOs) was determined in these strains as a preliminary attempt to identify potential resistance mechanisms. Enzymatic assays showed that the rose strains exhibited 2. 66 and 1. 95 -fold increased MFOs activity compared to the susceptible strain. Assays for GSTs revealed that only the SAN strain exhibited a significantly higher activity. In contrast, only the PSE strain showed a significant higher hydrolysis of 1 -naphthyl acetate...|$|E

40|$|Ponencia presentada en el 28 th International Symposium on Chromatography celebrado en Valencia del 12 al 16 de septiembre de 2010 Pesticides are an {{important}} group of agrochemicals used for food crop protection. Unfortunately, these compounds are easily accumulable in soils becoming a real environmental pollution risk and can contaminate surface water directly as spray drift or run-off, and also via drainage through the soils of treated farmland [1, 2]. For these reasons, there is increasing need {{for the development of}} well validated, accurate, time-saving, low cost, modern, multicomponents methods. In the light of the aforementioned, the aim {{of this study was to}} validate a sensitive multi-residue method for the target analysis of sixteen pesticides in soils and waters. The selected pesticides were: alachlor, atrazine, buprofezin, chlorfenvinphos, chlorpyriphos, diazinon, diuron, fenitrothion, fenthion, <b>hexythiazox,</b> imazalil, isoproturon, malathion, prochloraz, tolclophos-methyl and trifluralin. Pesticides from soil were extracted by pressurized liquid extraction (PLE), using an ASE 200 system from Dionex. Soil samples (10 g) were introduced into 11 mL cell and heated to 100 ºC for 7 min and extracted by ethyl acetate with a flush volume of 100 % in one cycle. Water was extracted by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Water samples (500 mL) were acidified and then extracted using Oasis HLB cartridges previously conditioned with methanol and water. Analytes were eluted with 4 mL. The residue analyses were performed by liquid chromatography-tandem quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) multi-residue method. Separation was made with a Luna 3 μm C 18 (Phenomenex®) analytical column. The mobile phase was MeOH and H 2 O 5 mM ammonium formate gradient composition, used in conjunction with positive mode electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Performance characteristics of the proposed method were established. Selectivity, linearity, precision, recoveries and limits of detection (LODs) and quantification (LOQs) were studied. The method allowed LOQ from 0. 03 μg/kg to 0. 05 μg/kg. Recoveries ranged from 75 to 95 % with relative standard desviation < 18 %. The results of the validation procedure confirmed that the method is suitable for the planned purpose. This method has been applied successfully to the analysis of incurred water and soil samples from Natural Park of L ́ Albufera. The results revealed the presence of some pesticides at several concentration levels both in the soil and water samples.

40|$|The two-spotted {{spider mite}} Tetranychus urticae is an {{economically}} important pest in many agricultural crops worldwide. Its high reproductive potential and extremely short life cycle, combined with the frequent acaricide applications usually required to maintain the population below economic threshold, facilitates rapid resistance build-up. This {{has led to the}} development of resistance against almost all commercially used compounds. In this study we tried to unravel the mechanisms behind the resistance against a number of acaricides with different mode of action at the toxicological, biochemical, genetic and molecular level. In a first series of experiments, we investigated pyrethroid resistance in Greek T. urticae strains. Combined data from toxicological bioassays and biochemical and synergistic studies indicated that although enhanced P 450 mono-oxygenase activities were associated with resistance, target site insensitivity proved to be the major resistance component. In order to get a better insight in the latter, a 3. 3 kb cDNA fragment of the T. urticae para sodium channel gene encompassing segment 4 of domain II to segment 6 of domain IV was obtained by a degenerate PCR strategy. The T. urticae sequence showed highest identity (56 %) to the scabies mite, Sarcoptes scabiei, and was phylogenetically classified within the divergent group of Arachnida. Comparison of resistant and susceptible strains identified the point mutation F 1538 I in segment 6 of domain III, which is known to confer strong resistance to pyrethroids, along with a second mutation (A 1215 D) in the intracellular linker connecting domains II and III, which still has an unknown role. Also, three alternative splicing variants were identified, of which two correspond to the mutually exclusive k/l exon pair already identified in insects. The mode of inheritance of resistance was confirmed to be almost completely recessive, which is consistent with studies on the target site mechanism for pyrethroids in other organisms. In T. urticae, organophosphate and carbamate resistance is often caused by acetylcholinesterase insensitivity. By combining toxicological, biochemical and molecular data from three reference laboratory and three organophosphate resistant (OP) strains, the AChE 1 mutations associated with resistance in T. urticae were characterised. The resistance ratios of the OP strains varied from 9 to 43 for pirimiphos-methyl, from 78 to 586 for chlorpyrifos, from 8 to 333 for methomyl and from 137 to 4164 for dimethoate. Compared to the reference strains, the insecticide concentration needed to inhibit 50 % of the AChE 1 activity in the OP strains was at least 2. 7, 55, 58 and 31 times higher for the OP pirimiphos-methyl, chlorpyrifos oxon, paraoxon and omethoate respectively, and 87 times higher for the carbamate carbaryl. By comparing the AChE 1 sequence between laboratory and OP strains, four amino acid substitutions were detected: (1) F 331 W which was present in all three OP strains; (2) T 280 A found in the three OP strains but not in all clones; (3) G 328 A, found in two OP strains; (4) A 201 S found in only one OP strain. F 331 W, G 328 A and A 201 S are possibly involved in resistance to organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. These findings were also confirmed by means of a structural model. F 331 W is probably the most important and the most common in T. urticae. It can be easily detected by a diagnostic PCR-RFLP assay developed in this study. We also evaluated the possible antagonism of organophosphate and carbamate insecticides on the toxicity of bifenazate in T. urticae when applied in mixtures. Bifenazate, a new and frequently used carbazate, is a pro-acaricide which needs to be activated by carboxylesterases. Two OP strains were used and several organophosphate (chlorpyrifos, azinphos methyl and phosmet) and carbamate (carbaryl and methomyl) insecticides were evaluated. Mixing chlorpyrifos with bifenazate strongly decreased bifenazate toxicity in both tested strains. However, in the strain with a higher esterase activity, antagonism decreased after 2 days. Of all other tested chemicals, only methomyl displayed an antagonistic effect 1 day after treatment. These findings indicate that mixing organophosphate and carbamate insecticides with bifenazate may inhibit bifenazate efficacy under field conditions, especially when resistant strains are present. Spirodiclofen, a recently developed and commercialized acaricide, is a selective, non-systemic tetronic acid derivative. In order to develop strategies to minimise resistance in the field to spirodiclofen, we selected a T. urticae population for spirodiclofen resistance in the laboratory. This selection yielded a strain with a resistance ratio of 274, determined on the larval stage. This strain was used to determine genetic, toxicological, biochemical and cross-resistance data. The egg stage of the resistant strain remained far more susceptible than the mobile stages. No cross-resistance was found against other acaricides, except for spiromesifen, another tetronic acid derivative. Based on synergist experiments and enzyme assays, it appeared that especially P 450 mono-oxygenases, but also esterases and glutathione-S-transferases, could be involved in the metabolic detoxification of spirodiclofen. Pre-treatment of the resistant females with the synergists PBO or DEF could increase the inhibitory effect of spirodiclofen on reproduction, again demonstrating the possible involvement of mono-oxygenases and esterases. Among the esterases of T. urticae, probably only a few are more expressed in spirodiclofen resistant strains, and these apparently prefer the purpose-designed substrate 1 -naphthyl 2, 2 -dimethylbutyrate. This was also confirmed by separating esterase isozymes by native isoelectric focusing. Because spirodiclofen interferes with lipid biosynthesis, total lipid content was measured in female adults. No significant differences between treated and non-treated female adults were found, both in the susceptible and resistant strain. However, the total lipid content in the resistant females was significantly higher than in susceptible females. The genetic analysis using crossing experiments showed that the resistance is inherited as an intermediate trait under control of more than one gene. Resistance to spirodiclofen in the laboratory selected strain exceeded by far the recommended field rate, showing the capacity for quick resistance development in the field. A good acaricide resistance management programme is necessary to prevent fast resistance build-up in the field. However, without selection pressure, resistance tends to be unstable and can decrease in the presence of susceptible individuals owing to the intermediate, polygenic inheritance mode. No evidence was found to support the existence of other resistance mechanisms, like mutations in the target site (ACCase) or overproduction of the target enzyme. In order to facilitate designing new ACCase inhibitor insecticides and understanding mechanism of resistance to currently used ACCase inhibitors, we tried to clone and express T. urticae ACCase using different expression systems. The most promising results were achieved by a baculovirus expression system and also by heat-shocking Codon Rare E. coli cells with the pET-ACC vector. More efforts should be done to overcome several problems in expressing this enzyme e. g. by optimizing conditions to get higher levels of expression, protein solubility, activity and stability. We also performed a practical screening in Dutch cut rose glasshouses due the fact that growers complained on failing spider mite control. In order to check whether control failure was caused by resistance, the susceptibility of 15 strains, sampled from infested roses, was tested to 11 acaricides: tebufenpyrad, milbemectin, abamectin, cyflumetofen, bifenthrin, spiromesifen, <b>hexythiazox,</b> etoxazole, bifenazate, acequinocyl and chlorpyrifos. Three doses were used to discern between resistance and susceptibility: the recommended field dose (FD), FD/ 5 and FD x 5. Ten of these strains were screened for known resistance mechanism such as elevated detoxifying enzyme activities and previously reported resistance mutations using biochemical and molecular diagnostics. Potential cross-resistance between acaricides was estimated by correlation analysis. The strains showed different levels of resistance to tested acaricides. Twelve out of 15 strains showed resistance against <b>hexythiazox,</b> and 9 out of 15 against bifenthrin and tebufenpyrad. Two strains were found which showed high levels of resistance to most tested insecticides, even against one which has not been registered in Europe. A high correlation was found between some acaricides, e. g. between abamectin and milbemectin. Without selection pressure, resistance seemed to be unstable in most cases, after one year. All field strains had an increased metabolic activity, compared to the susceptible strains. A number of amino acid substitutions known to be involved in resistance to different groups were present in different strains. The best example was the presence of the F 331 W substitution in the acetylcholine esterase, which was present in all field strains tested. The results obtained in this research may all together lead to a better understanding of acaricide resistance in T. urticae, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient resistance management programs...|$|E
