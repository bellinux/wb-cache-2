5|$|A helical {{resonator}} {{is similar}} to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper VHF and lower UHF bands whereas stubs are more often applied <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> UHF and SHF bands.|$|E

The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American wigeon are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E

This environment also produces the ant's food, which includes nectar and invertebrate prey. In suburban areas, this ant {{is found in}} native vegetation, and use rockeries, cracks in concrete walls, dry dirt and grass to build nests.

5|$|Additionally, the {{geographic}} {{location of the}} city, {{with respect to the}} principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, McNallen befriended the {{prominent}} Heathen Michael Moynihan, later recommending and selling Moynihan's journal Tyr on the AFA's website. McNallen and the AFA {{also appear to}} have cordial relations with the racial extremist Ron McVan, co-founder of Wotansvolk, publishing some of McVan's writings in Runestone. When in the 1990s, Christensen was arrested for drug smuggling, McNallen teamed up with Murray to form a defense fund for her. In September 1997 he was a signatory to {{the foundation of the}} International Asatru/Odinist Alliance (IAOA), a global union of folkish Heathen groups, alongside Murray of the AA and Heimgest of the British Odinic Rite; they were later joined by representatives of the French and German branches of the Odinic Rite, before the union terminated several years later. The alliance convened an international meeting, or Althing, every three years. In 1997, McNallen married Sheila Edlund at the seventeenth Althing, held in Utah; the ceremony was officiated by Murray. In 1999, the AFA purchased land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> Sierra of Northern California, there establishing a space where Heathen kindreds could meet together to practice their religion.|$|E
5|$|High winds caused damage across Guam, {{mostly to}} roofs and to poorly built or wooden structures. A total of 1,996houses were {{severely}} damaged or destroyed. Better constructed homes fared well during the storm, {{and there was}} little window damage. The winds also downed power lines, leaving an island-wide power outage. John F. Kennedy High School sustained damage to its football field and library. The most significant effects were from the heavy rainfall, resulting in landslides in some areas and causing rivers to flow at above-normal rates; 14stations reported either record flow rates or peak crests, including an island-wide peak crest of 8.55m (28.06ft) {{at the mouth of}} the Tolaeyuus River. Two water gauges were destroyed during the storm. Swollen rivers damaged roads, washed away trees, and caused erosion. The storm flooding contaminated Fena Lake, which provides water to the military base, for a few days. In addition, 34 of the island's 110water wells failed due to the storm. Flooding also destroyed a building and damaged the runway at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport, and damaged a bridge near Inarajan. A few palm trees fell due to the soil being loosened, either from heavy rains or high waves. Some of the downed trees struck cars, but the winds were not strong enough to overturn any vehicles. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> elevations of Guam, some areas experienced heavy crop damage due to strong winds; however, crop damage in general was less than expected, estimated at around $500,000. In Apra Harbor, high seas washed ashore or sank five boats, and a Navy barge spilled 397,000litres (105,000gallons) of oil. Overall, Chataan caused about $60million in property damage on Guam, and there were 23injuries, none of them serious.|$|E
