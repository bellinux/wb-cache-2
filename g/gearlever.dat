2500|$|... 2008 saw Land Rover's 60th anniversary, {{for which}} {{a new series of}} special edition Defenders were produced. Branded the [...] "SVX", three models were built. All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy <b>gearlever</b> knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed folding frame, unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E

50|$|Later {{cars had}} {{shallower}} doors. In 1950, the Vanguard and the Triumph Renown {{were the first}} cars to be fitted with a Laycock de Normanville clutchless overdrive controlled from the <b>gearlever.</b> The Phase 2 car was available with the Laycock overdrive that operated on {{the second and third}} gears of the three-speed transmission, creating, in effect, a five-speed gearbox.|$|E
50|$|A special Exclusive {{grade was}} {{introduced}} for 2016 which {{comes with a}} new bodykit integrated with LED daytime running lights, black leather seats, grey dashboard and door trim, piano black steering wheel and <b>gearlever</b> trim {{as well as a}} T-Connect infotainment system with a seven-inch touchscreen and Bluetooth connectivity. An option of White Crystal Pearl or Attitude Black Mica is only available for the Vios Exclusive.|$|E
50|$|From May 1975 {{overdrive}} and {{tinted glass}} were standard. In addition, all Sprints were fitted with body side trims, a plastic surround for the <b>gearlever,</b> and a driver's door mirror. Headrests were now available as an optional extra. From March 1976 headrests, a radio, and laminated windscreen were standard. In 1978, laminated windscreens became a standard fitment and in 1980, {{to comply with}} UK legislation, twin rear fog lamps were also standard.|$|E
50|$|In the Mugello race, Facetti and John Fitzpatrick diced {{the lead}} {{in the early stages of}} the race, only for the Englishman to dropped away when his <b>gearlever</b> came loose. Facetti {{continued}} in the lead until Fitzpatrick retook it during a tyre stop. Soon afterwards, the car began to overheat with Finotto at the controls and would eventually record a DNF. Facetti/Finotto soon returned to their winning ways when they took victory in the Austria-Trophäe.|$|E
5000|$|... "This body {{provides}} full {{room for}} four persons {{with a level}} floor. There are two cupboards, four pockets, a sliding roof, safety glass and other usual fittings but no ash trays. There are louvres over the four door glasses. The windscreen opens. The spare wheel is behind the folding luggage grid at the back. The generous wheelbase {{and the absence of}} a <b>gearlever</b> in the floor gives excellent entrance and exit through all four doorways." [...] motoring correspondent The Times ...|$|E
50|$|By half {{distance}} (lap 23), {{only ten}} cars {{remained on the}} lead lap. Rindt’s excellent drive came to an end, when his gearbox failed, while the Brabham pairing steamed on relentlessly. Then Rees held third, and immediately set about closing the gap to Hulme, halving the gap from 45s to 23s. Hulme’s car began sounding rough, and just six laps {{from the end of}} the race, Brabham stopped on the circuit with a broken <b>gearlever,</b> robbing him of a comfortable third straight Trophées de France win.|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the {{advanced}} nature of its design the engine gives little of the harsh racing car impression. Again, in {{spite of the}} size of that engine it does not give the impression of a big car and {{in spite of the}} tall radiator the short wheelbase lends it the appearance of a small sports car. On the road that impression is reinforced, the delicacy of control makes it a joy to drive and one can still flick the <b>gearlever</b> about as you may do only in an early Bugatti.|$|E
5000|$|... 1981 - Introduction of the TX and GTX with 1,995 cc engine (rated at [...] ) and {{five-speed}} manual gearbox. TX has same specification as GTS. GTX as GTS and TX, plus rear wash/wipe, {{front fog}} lights, headlamp wash/wipe, 14-inch alloy wheels (185/65 HR14), leather {{on the steering}} wheel rim, <b>gearlever</b> gaiter, and handbrake lever gaiter, as well as digital clock, passenger side door mirror, bronze tinted windows, luggage cover, and airhorn. The optional three-speed automatic transmission now available on the 2-litre TX rather than in the 1.6-litre, beginning in September 1981.|$|E

Facetti/Finotto soon returned to their winning ways when they took victory in the Austria-Trophäe, held at the Salzburgring. Facetti's pole lap was over a second faster by Gunnar Nilsson's time set the previous season set in the same car, albeit with an engine revised by Facetti with some 'Italian parts'.|$|E
5000|$|The Valiant's {{suspension}} {{was tested}} by the Fighting Vehicle Proving Establishment at Chertsey in May 1945. The first day gave minor problems and was abandoned after only 13 mi of easy on-road driving. However, the driver was already exhausted by this time, finding that the steering levers needed his full weight to operate and that the seat, footbrake and <b>gearlever</b> all carried risk of physical injury in using them. The Officer in Charge decided to abandon the trials there and then as it was impossible and unsafe to continue, reporting that [...] "in his view the entire project should be closed" [...] There were also issues with weight distribution and the ground clearance of only 9 inches, and by that point of the war {{there was no longer}} a need for the tank. The Valiant project was terminated.|$|E
5000|$|The Vincent Rapide is a {{motorcycle}} {{designed and built}} at the Vincent works in Great North Road, Stevenage, Hertfordshire, England, during the Second World War and released to the press before end of hostilities. The prototype was the Series A 47.5° V-twin launched in 1936. [...] With 6.8:1 compression, it produced [...] It is often purported that Phil Irving {{was trying to find}} a replacement for the 500 cc Vincent Comet engine. There were two blueprints on his desk, and one had fallen on top of the other, to demonstrate a [...] "V" [...] formation. There is no evidence to prove this, however. Its frame incorporated the first cantilever rear suspension, used on all subsequent Vincents. Other innovations included a foot gearchange instead of a hand-operated <b>gearlever,</b> a four-speed gearbox instead of two or three and a side stand.|$|E
50|$|MacDowall's 2009 Clio Cup {{performances}} impressed top British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) teams Motorbase Performance, RML and West Surrey Racing, {{who gave}} him tests over the winter break ahead of the 2010 season. In March 2010 {{it was announced that}} MacDowall would race a Chevrolet Cruze for the RML-run Silverline Chevrolet factory-supported team, as teammate to Jason Plato. In a wet qualifying session at Snetterton he became the youngest polesitter in the championship's history but the car's <b>gearlever</b> broke as he changed up into second gear {{at the start of the}} first race. He failed to finish in the points in either of the other two races. His rookie year was a success though, with two podiums, two pole positions and a fastest lap en route to 10th overall in the championship. Macdowall continued with Chevrolet in the British Touring Car Championship for 2011, ending the season 9th in the standings with 100 points and 3 podium finishes.|$|E

50|$|When in 1977 DTV and Vauxhall {{decided to}} go {{rallying}} everyone thought Gerry would be okay and there were rumours flying around of offers and deals involving Ford and Leyland products. The truth for '78 was somewhat different and he managed to scrape a deal together to race Colin Vandervell's '77 spec Ford Capri for the national Tricentrol championship and a Triumph Dolomite Sprint for the two production car championships, the Derwent TV/Shellsport and the Britax championships, with both cars being sponsored by Triplex, who were Colin's sponsor but due to work commitments he wouldn't be competing in '78. Gerry asked if Triplex {{would be prepared to}} throw in a few extra bob for the Dolomite. The Dolomite was prepared by Roger Dowson and Alistair Barrie under the Downie racing banner and the Capri was prepared by John Westwood.The Dolomite {{turned out to be the}} far more successful of the two cars with 21class wins and three second places from 25 starts, with Gerry winning both the Derwent TV/Shellsport and the Britax championships in the Dolomite. The Capri driving was not the success that Gerry had hope, with the Tricentrol Championship costing more than anticipated and the only result of note was the start of the season, in the wet at the International Trophy at Silverstone, when he finished first in class and second overall. There were other flashes of brilliance but bad luck always seemed to prevail, like when leading at Donington when the <b>gearlever</b> broke off.|$|E
5000|$|With its red bodywork, {{inspired}} by the typical Alfa Romeo paintwork, the 2uettottanta is 1797 mm wide, 4212.6 mm long, 1280 mm high and has a wheelbase of 2500 mm. [...] Clean, elegantly lined, simple 2-seater, all-Italian, the car features design cues from the Alfa Romeo Duetto and it has front end that underlines Alfa Romeo character, triangle with Alfa Romeo emblem. The bodywork’s soft curves are set off perfectly by the bold metallic paint. The volumes of the Alfa Romeo 2uettottanta by Pininfarina are light, slender, refined, with shapes that seem to cross the air with ease: the car seems to raise itself from earth and [...] "to go beyond". This {{is the result of}} an optical effect obtained thanks to the line that crosses the car horizontally. The front-end of the 2uettottanta features a central line. To the sides of the Alfa Romeo emblem, there are two air inlets, in a triangular shape. The headlights, based on the last LED technologies, are set under the line that characterizes the entire car. A carbon band in {{the lower part of the}} front end acts as a splitter and conveys the air towards the back. The horizontal line that starts from the front wheel and extends to the posterior wheel drives great dynamism. The back too is characterized by smooth and essential surfaces. The two bumps seem to be born from the volume. They look like floating wings and create the roll-bars at the back of the seats. The inside is spacious and comfortable. The form-fitting sports seats give outstanding support, and our arms are held at a perfect distance for us to clutch the small 14.2-inch-diameter retro-styled three-spoke steering wheel. The driving position is low to the ground and the seatback steeply raked. The major controls are placed logically around the steering column and on the central tunnel, as well as across the upper dash. The detailing includes glowing white Alfa Romeo badges on the centre of the speedometer and rev counter needles. The <b>gearlever</b> is finished in machined aluminum billet. Beautifully integrated into its design is the bright red start button.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation of}} the ability of humans to distinguish different levels of <b>gearlever</b> load. A test rig with a forward-backward moving gearshift lever was constructed using the typical interior dimensions of European B segment automobiles. The rig used a system of weights and pulleys to provide a load which could be varied in steps of 1 %. Four reference loads were chosen which were considered representative of automotive gearshift operation: 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 5. 0 kg. Twenty subjects took part in the study. Using a variation on the psychophysical method of limits, the subjects were asked to respond whether a test load was heavier or lighter than a reference load. The Weber Fraction was found to decrease monotonically from a value of 0. 036 for the 0. 5 kg reference load to a value of 0. 029 at the 5. 0 kg reference load. The average value across all reference loads was 0. 032. Measurements of the gearshift force made by means of a knob containing a load cell suggested that the variation in the measured Weber Fraction might be attributable to the time behaviour of the force exchanged between the human subject and the control surface. Relevance to Industry The Weber Fraction for gearshift load discrimination is useful to the gearbox designer because it establishes a threshold for measurement accuracy, and sets a precision limit for quality rating criteri...|$|E
