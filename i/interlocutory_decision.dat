THE ARGUMENTATION OF HIGH COURT’S JUDGE IN ACCEPTING THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR’S RESISTANCE SUBMISSION AGAINST INDICTMENT UNACCEPTABLE TO THE JUDGE IN CORRUPTION CASE (A Study on Verdict Number: 12 /Pid. Sus/ 2012 /PT. TPK. Smg). Thesis. Faculty of Law of Surakarta Sebelas Maret University. This study {{aimed to}} find out the {{rationale}} of Public Prosecutor of Semarang District Attorney’s Resistance Submission against the Indictment Unacceptable to the Judge in Corruption Case, whether or not it had been consistent with the provision of KUHAP and {{to find out}} the argumentation of High Court’s Judge in Accepting the Public Prosecutor’s Resistance Submission against Indictment Unacceptable to the Judge in Corruption Case, whether or not it had been consistent with the provision of KUHAP. This study was a normative law research that was prescriptive and applied in nature with case approach. The law material source employed included primary and secondary ones with library study as the technique of collecting law material. Technique of analyzing law material used in this research was syllogism method with deductive thinking pattern. Considering the result of research, it could be concluded that the Public Prosecutor’s resistance submission based on Verdict stating that the indictment was unacceptable to the first level-Chamber of Judge should be decided with final judgement rather than <b>interlocutory</b> <b>decision</b> of judgement. The first level-Chamber of Judge had misapplied the procedural law by accepting the indictment’s exception in the second session with the agenda of examining the witness from Public Prosecutor. Thus, the argumentation of the Public Prosecutor’s Resistance Submission had been consistent with Article 156 of KUHAP, particularly clause (3). The argumentation of Provincial Court’s Judge had been consistent with the provision of Article 156 jo Article 241 of KUHAP. The Judges of High Court’s accepted the Public Prosecutor of Semarang District Attorney’s Resistance Submission because it had legal rationale.

40|$|The {{distinction}} between common articles 2 and 3 of the Geneva Conventions of 1949 is unsupportable {{in the context}} of contemporary armed conflict. This article argues that the distinction should be eliminated for policy and legal reasons. The differing protection offered by common article 2, which applies in international armed conflicts, compared to common article 3, which applies in non-international armed conflicts, is outlined in Parts I and II. Part III addresses the landmark Tadić <b>Interlocutory</b> <b>Decision</b> of the International Criminal Tribunal of the Former Yugoslavia (‘ICTY’), which acknowledged that there is a trend in international practice to diminish the {{distinction between}} common articles 2 and 3. Although the ICTY reasoned on the correctness of the distinction, it did not criticise its legality. Similarly, Sub-Part A of Part III reasons that the distinction between common articles 2 and 3 is wrong in policy as opposed to it being wrong in law. After analysing the International Court of Justice’s (‘ICJ’) reasoning in the Genocide Case (2007), Sub-Part B goes a step further than the Appeals Chamber did in Tadić (1999). It argues that, while the distinction is right in law, it gives rise to an incorrect application of the overall control test. Moreover, in order to apply the Geneva Conventions of 1949 to any type of armed conflict, the distinction between common articles 2 and 3 should be eliminated...|$|E

40|$|Henry v. British Columbia (Attorney General) was {{the first}} {{case in which a}} {{claimant}} sought damages under section 24 (1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms for breaches of rights that led to a wrongful conviction and imprisonment. In its 2015 decision, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified the criteria for the award and quantum of such damages. In June 2016, Hinkson C. J. S. C. awarded $ 8, 086, 691. 80 in damages to Ivan Henry in compensation, special damages and “to serve both the vindication and deterrence functions of s. 24 (1) of the Charter”. In this article, I describe the events that led to Ivan Henry’s civil case against British Columbia, and explain the <b>interlocutory</b> <b>decisions</b> that shaped the passage of that civil case. I attend particularly to two difficult issues: the role of demonstrable factual innocence in a trial for Charter damages; and the challenges of affording constitutional rights to sexual assault complainants in a civil case that arises from wrongful conviction. Ultimately, I suggest that the Henry case illustrates the inadequacies in the Canadian approach to post-conviction review and compensation for wrongful convictions...|$|R
40|$|The {{public inquiry}} {{has long been}} used to gather {{information}} of concern to the State in order that the best decisions may be made according to the information thereby obtained. The Quebec legislator has, therefore, foreseen the need for different laws or particular provisions that would enable the government {{to make use of}} this procedure. Among these we find the laws governing commissions of inquiry, police, municipal commissions, coroners and arson investigations. The public often follows closely the proceedings of such inquiries, which, consequently, become a means of informing, educating, and establishing a dialogue with, the public. However, certain public inquiries, such as the Quebec Commission of Inquiry on Organized Crime, the commission of inquiry on freedom of unionization and the Keable Commission, run the risk of affecting the rights of citizens, namely those summoned to appear during such hearings as well as those whose names appear in the testimony given. Hence, some individuals may see their reputations tarnished because of facts brought to light during the inquiry, lose their jobs as a result of commission recommendations or many later have to face either civil or criminal prosecution. It is, therefore, important that such persons be given access to the courts, in order to either challenge the jurisdiction of the commission or demand that the inquiry respect the rules of natural justice. In this area, judicial review depends on the characterization of the method of operation of the public inquiry as a whole, i. e. as the exercise by the commissioners of a recommendatory power, or of <b>interlocutory</b> <b>decisions</b> taken {{during the course of the}} inquiry. Depending on the judicial or administrative nature of the activity concerned, the courts will decide whether or not to exercise their superintending and reforming powers. Thus, the courts will intervene only if the function exercised is of a judicial nature. In this regard, the courts deem that an administrative body exercises a judicial function, on the one hand when it determines the rights of individuals and, on the other, when such a body has a duty to act judicially. Apart from some rare exceptions, the courts have ruled that the exercise of the power of inquiry generally does not trench on the rights of citizens and that such a power is therefore administrative in nature. At present, the issue as to whether the inquiry determines the rights of individuals is considered by the courts in the light of either one of two theories, which can be labelled the binary and global theories. Supporters of the binary theory feel that the inquiry and the decisions which may proceed therefrom represent two quite distinct stages and the interference with the rights of individuals can only occur when a decision is made. We find an illustration of this reasoning in, among others cases, Guay v. Lafleur and St-John v. Fraser. Proponents of the second theory are agreed that the decision is an integral part of the inquiry process and that interference with rights occurs at the inquiry level itself. This argument is exemplified adequately by the judgement in Saulnier v. Quebec Police Commission. This paper also examines the characterization of <b>interlocutory</b> <b>decisions</b> made by a commission in the course of its proceedings. In this respect, the courts feel that coercive powers are of a judicial nature, while decisions concerning the administration of evidence are seen as administrative. A study of the abundant jurisprudence in this area leads us to conclude that the Quebec legislator should provide for a specific recourse, similar to that existing presently in Ontario, which would allow citizens access to the courts to challenge decisions made by commissions of inquiry...|$|R
40|$|Judge Posner once {{stated that}} the federal courts {{do not have the}} ability to conduct {{judicial}} review every time the arbitrator 2 ̆ 2 sneezes. 2 ̆ 22 ̆ 7 Judge Posner further opined, however, that although the courts do not have jurisdiction to review every ruling made by an arbitrator, he could not articulate any more specific rule as to when the federal courts do have jurisdiction. Of course, this concept has caused some great difficulties for parties who would like {{to have the ability to}} have additional review, particularly as class action arbitration procedures have explicitly contemplated judicial review at times other than after the final resolution of the merits of the dispute. Because the contemplated review occurs at times during the middle of the arbitration procedure, this Article refers to such appeals as 2 ̆ 2 interlocutory 2 ̆ 2 appeals. The use of the class action procedure in arbitration, particularly in the consumer context, has gained significant acceptance since the United States Supreme Court, in its 2003 decision in Green Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, did not specifically prohibit the use of the procedure. Immediately following Bazzle, the dispute resolution provider American Arbitration Association (AAA) 4 created a complex set of rules governing class action arbitrations, drawing from the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The American Arbitration Association Rules (AAA Rules) break the arbitration process into distinct phases, not unlike the phases in class action litigation, including phases in which the arbitrator assigned determines whether a class procedure is possible and whether a class should be certified. After both of these determinations, the AAA Rules allow the parties to seek judicial review or other relief prior to continuing the arbitration process Although the AAA Rules contemplate judicial review of 2 ̆ 2 interlocutory 2 ̆ 2 rulings by the arbitrator, questions remain as to whether the federal courts have any jurisdiction to hear these less-than-final 2 ̆ 2 awards. 2 ̆ 2 These cases are now starting to work through the judicial system, and many courts are simply reviewing the 2 ̆ 2 awards 2 ̆ 2 without any reference to the jurisdiction of the reviewing court. Other courts have addressed the jurisdictional issue, focusing on constitutional ripeness doctrines-and these decisions across the nation are somewhat contradictory. Historically, cases dealing with the federal courts 2 ̆ 7 jurisdiction over interlocutory appeals held that only the final awards can be reviewed by courts. More recent opinions, however, have allowed judicial review of interlocutory appeals under a variety of theories. With respect to interlocutory appeals in class action arbitrations, some courts examine their jurisdiction under the 2 ̆ 2 ripeness 2 ̆ 2 doctrine, while most courts take jurisdiction for granted and simply hear the appeal. This Article suggests that the federal district courts do not actually have jurisdiction to hear such interlocutory appeals because they do not constitute 2 ̆ 2 awards 2 ̆ 2 as that term was intended under the Federal Arbitration Act. Part I of this Article describes the Bazzle decision and its impact on the class action arbitration industry, including the formulation of the class action arbitration rules. Part II of this Article describes how courts have dealt with interlocutory appeals-both in general and in the class action context in specific. Ultimately, this Article argues that such 2 ̆ 2 awards 2 ̆ 2 are not the type of 2 ̆ 2 awards 2 ̆ 2 contemplated by the Act and that federal jurisdiction does not lie until the entire class action procedure has been resolved on the merits. Although this position appears harsh, there may be an opportunity for parties to use appellate arbitrators to review these <b>interlocutory</b> <b>decisions</b> (under a contracted standard of review) in the absence of federal court jurisdiction. The use of appellate arbitration as an alternative form of judicial review is discussed in Part III...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the preclusive effects generated in subsequent proceedings in England {{by a foreign}} civil and commercial judgment, once recognised as a res judicata according to either the common law rules of recognition (including the related statutory registration schemes), or the rules supplied by the Brussels and Lugano Conventions. In particular, this thesis examines four preclusive pleas which a foreign judgment might support: cause of action estoppel; the plea of former recovery under section 34 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982; issue estoppel; and, the abuse of process plea associated with the rule in Henderson v Henderson (1843) 3 Hare 100. Chapter One introduces the four preclusive pleas and the schemes for the recognition (or registration) of foreign judgments. Chapter Two {{considers the}} pleas that preclude the contradiction or reassertion of a cause of action where the foreign judgment has been recognised at common law, and then examines the common law recognition process {{to ensure that it}} verifies the res judicata status of the judgment (including that process as reflected in the common-law-related statutory registration schemes). Chapter Two also examines the generic requirements for the res judicata preclusive pleas, namely: that the subject matter in the foreign and subsequent English proceedings must be identical, and that the parties (or their privies) must be the same. Much of the analysis of these requirements is useful for the discussion in Chapter Three of the issue preclusive effects of foreign judgments recognised at common law. Only relatively recently has the common law accepted that foreign judgments can support a plea of issue estoppel, and even more recently has issue preclusion by a final <b>interlocutory</b> issue <b>decision</b> of a foreign court been acknowledged. Thus, in light of these developments, adjustments in the recognition/ res judicata requirements necessary to found the plea in subsequent English proceedings, are considered. In Chapter Four the traditional res judicata pleas so far discussed are contrasted with the Henderson abuse of process plea. If it applies at all in respect of earlier foreign proceedings, the Henderson rule precludes subsequent proceedings in England which seek to litigate subject matter that could and should have been litigated in the foreign proceedings, but which was not. Chapter Five examines the preclusive effects of judgments recognised in England according to the rules of the Brussels and Lugano Conventions. The underlying nature of the Conventions ensures that these judgments are effective as regards cause of action preclusion, since automatic recognition (which suggests full faith and credit) enables claim preclusive effects to result - the English court extending the law of the foreign rendering state in such cases. But it is argued that a different approach should be taken where issue preclusion and abuse of process preclusion are concerned. Finally, Chapter Six summarises the preclusive effect of a foreign judgment in subsequent proceedings in England, and conclusions are drawn. </p...|$|R
