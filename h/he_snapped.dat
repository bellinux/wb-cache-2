25|$|At Loudon, Johnson {{finished}} 6th after {{blowing a}} tire in the 3rd position. At Dover, his Chase hopes {{came to an}} end when his car broke a drive line, leading him to finish 36 laps down in 41st place. At the fall race at Texas Johnson won, passing Brad Keselowski with 4 laps to go. This marked his fourth consecutive win in the fall race, and third consecutive win on that track, having also won the spring race. That victory also marked the 75th of his NASCAR Cup Series career, putting him one race win short of tying Dale Earnhardt's career wins. Also in the process, <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> a 20-race-winless-streak.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Is Blindness" [...] {{is a song}} by {{rock band}} U2, and the twelfth and final track on their 1991 album Achtung Baby. The song was written on piano by lead singer Bono during the {{recording}} sessions for U2's 1988 album Rattle and Hum. Originally intending to give the song to singer Nina Simone, the band decided to keep it for Achtung Baby after playing it together. Thematically, the song describes a failing romance, mixing personal themes with imagery of metaphorical acts of terrorism. During the recording sessions for Achtung Baby, guitarist the Edge separated from his wife, Aislinn O'Sullivan. The separation had a major effect {{on the development of}} the song; Bono said that the ending guitar solo was a cathartic experience for the Edge, as <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> several guitar strings during the recording.|$|E
500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as anything {{you would want to}} see." ...|$|E

500|$|The tornado {{killed four}} storm chasers, {{the first known}} deaths {{in the history of}} storm chasing. Although the tornado {{remained}} over mostly open terrain, dozens of storm chasers unaware of its immense size and erratic movement were caught off-guard. Near Highway 81, TWISTEX scientist and engineer Tim Samaras, along with his son Paul and research partner Carl Young died in the tornado. Paul and Young were ejected from their Chevrolet Cobalt by the storm's sub-vortex, while Tim was still buckled in the passenger's seat. Local resident Richard Henderson, who decided to follow the storm, lost his life in that same area. <b>He</b> <b>snapped</b> a picture of the tornado from his cellular phone before it struck him. Other chasers, including Mike Bettes of The Weather Channel and Reed Timmer, were either injured or had their vehicles damaged. A Doppler on Wheels-based analysis of how the tornado impacted these teams revealed that they were hit by an intense internal sub-vortex. Overall, the tornado was responsible for eight fatalities and 151 injuries. The National Weather Service referred to the tornado as [...] "the most dangerous tornado in storm observing history." ...|$|E
500|$|On January 28, 1970, a {{third and}} final Band of Gypsys {{appearance}} took place; they performed during a music festival at Madison Square Garden benefiting the anti-Vietnam War Moratorium Committee titled the [...] "Winter Festival for Peace". American blues guitarist Johnny Winter was backstage before the concert; he recalled: [...] " [...] came in with his head down, {{sat on the couch}} alone, and put his head in his hands... He didn't move until {{it was time for the}} show." [...] Minutes after taking the stage <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> a vulgar response at a woman who had shouted a request for [...] "Foxy Lady". He then began playing [...] "Earth Blues" [...] before telling the audience: [...] "That's what happens when earth fucks with space". Moments later, he briefly sat down on the drum riser before leaving the stage. Both Miles and Redding later stated that Jeffery had given Hendrix LSD before the performance. Miles believed that Jeffery gave Hendrix the drugs in an effort to sabotage the current band and bring about the return of the original Experience lineup. Jeffery fired Miles after the show and Cox quit, ending the Band of Gypsys.|$|E
500|$|According to McGuire, {{the game}} {{did not start}} with any game plan to get Chamberlain 100 points. After a few minutes, the Warriors led 19–3, and their star center had already scored 13 points and made his first five shots. At {{the end of the}} first quarter, the Knicks trailed 42–26, and in his typical style, Chamberlain had already scored 23 points, making all nine of his free throws. Free throws were the weakest part of his game, making barely more than half in his first seasons. He had started {{shooting}} free throws underhanded that season per McGuire's suggestion. Chamberlain at that point was thinking more about a free throw shooting record than scoring a lot of points; the NBA record was 24 free throws made in a game. Imhoff was soon benched because of foul trouble. After one foul, <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> at the referee, [...] "Well, why don't you just give the guy a hundred now and we'll all go home!" [...] Neither referee had ever been a lead official before, and Imhoff privately wished a stronger lead was working the game. By halftime, the Warriors had lost some of their edge, but still led 79–68. Chamberlain's point total stood at 41. The Warriors felt little excitement, as he had scored 60 or more points on 15 previous occasions. [...] "I often came into the locker room with 30 or 35 points, therefore, 41 points was not a big deal", Chamberlain later explained. During halftime, the Warriors' Guy Rodgers said, [...] "Let's get the ball to Dip. Let's see how many he can get." [...] McGuire agreed.|$|E

500|$|Ishikawa {{retained}} {{the position of}} starting first baseman in 2009. In {{the first game of}} the season, Ishikawa had two hits, including a three-RBI triple in the first inning against Milwaukee Brewers' starting pitcher Jeff Suppan as the Giants won 106. From May 25 through July 11, Ishikawa had his best stretch of the year, batting [...]326 while hitting seven home runs and driving in 17 runs. He set a career high with four hits on May 25 and hit his first home run of the year, a three-run shot against Buddy Carlyle, in an 82 victory over Atlanta. On July 3, he hit a ball that was originally ruled a double against Felipe Paulino, but the umpires changed it to a three-run home run after watching the replay as the Giants won 130 over the Houston Astros. Ishikawa and Juan Uribe hit the Giants' first set of back-to-back home runs in 2009 against Josh Geer on July 9 in a 93 victory over the Padres. Through July 26, he batted [...]269 with seven home runs and 30 RBI. On July 27, the Giants traded for Ryan Garko from the Cleveland Indians, intending for him to replace Ishikawa at first base and provide more offense than Ishikawa had. However, Garko struggled to produce offensively, and at the end of August Ishikawa began making most of the starts at first for the rest of the year. On August 25, <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> a 22 tie with a game-winning three-run eighth-inning home run against Jon Rauch as the Giants defeated Arizona 54. In 120 games (326 at-bats), Ishikawa batted [...]261 with 49 runs scored, 85 hits, 10 doubles, nine home runs, and 39 RBI. His batting average at AT Park was fifth in the National League (NL) for home stadiums at [...]349, but he batted [...]162 in away games. Defensively, his [...]996 fielding percentage was third in the NL behind Adam LaRoche's [...]999 and Todd Helton's [...]998.|$|E
500|$|As a 2008–09 {{first team}} {{pre-season}} All-Big Ten player, {{he was the}} first Wolverine to earn the honor since Daniel Horton in 2004. [...] Although he was the leading returning scorer and top draft prospect, Purdue's Robbie Hummel was named Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year. [...] Preseason All-Big Ten status has not always led to regular season honors. [...] In both 2005 and 2007, only two preseason selections made the regular season team.

[...] The following night in the second game of the Coaches vs. cancer classic, Harris nearly posted a triple double when he posted 26 points, and career-highs with 10 rebounds and 8 assists in a 76–56 win against Northeastern University. [...] This quick start earned Harris the November 17, 2008 Big Ten Player of the Week Award. [...] Harris led the Big Ten Conference in scoring until the second to last game of the preconference schedule when <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> a ten-game double digit scoring streak. [...] Throughout the season, he continued to battle with fellow sophomores Evan Turner and Talor Battle for the Big Ten scoring leadership. [...] On February 5, Harris was selected along with Kalin Lucas as one of only two Big Ten John R. Wooden Award 2008–09 Midseason Top 30 Candidates. [...] On March 5, the National Association of Basketball Coaches honored Harris as a District 7 (Big Ten) first-team selection along with four other sophomores (Lucas, Turner, Battle, and JaJuan Johnson). On March 9 after the conclusion of the 2008–09 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season, he was named to the first team All-Big Ten by both the Big Ten coaches and the Big Ten media along with the same four sophomores. He was also chosen on March 10 by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association for its 2008–09 Men's Division I District V (OH, IN, IL, MI, MN, WI) Team, based on voting from its national membership. On March 26 Harris was honored as one of four Michigan men's basketball Winter Sports Big Ten Academic All-Conference selections.|$|E

During the dispatch call to 911 shortly following the murder, Crooks revealed that Gretchen Crooks had taken away his Call of Duty video game because his grades had turned poor {{and that this was}} the reason why <b>he</b> <b>snapped.</b> According to dispatch, Noah Crooks did not seem emotional even though he had murdered his mother a couple of hours earlier. On the night of April 14, 2012, in Clydebank, Scotland, a 13-year-old boy slashed his friend's throat after a session of Gears of War 3. The wound was deep enough to expose his trachea and required 20 staples after his surgery.

[...] "I really didn't agree with what went on over there", Roddick said. Roddick played both of the spring ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events in the U.S. He was seeded seventh at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells.

2500|$|The England captain Wally Hammond {{ordered his}} batsmen {{to stay within}} their crease when facing the Australian spinners, whose figures were flattered as a result. In the Second Test Ian Johnson took 6/42 off 241 balls with his off-spin, {{including}} one spell of 1/3 off 88 balls, of which 85 were not scored from. Johnson's off spin was a rarity in Australia, where the pitches work better to leg-spin, and was not a big spinner of the ball, but he used flight to deceive the batsmen and could tie down one end. Colin McCool was [...] "a better fieldsman than a batsman, and a better batsman than he was a bowler" [...] But before the MCC team had even landed in Australia <b>he</b> <b>snapped</b> up 35 wickets (28.82) with his flighty leg-spin for Queensland with help from Don Tallon behind the stumps. He dismissed Hammond, Hutton, Washbrook, Compton, Yardley, Edrich and Voce in his 7/106 for an Australian XI against the MCC, 5/109 in the Third Test and 5/44 in the Fifth and [...] "the English batsmen seemed like rabbits fascinated {{in the presence of}} a snake". Bruce Dooland was another leg-spinner who was brought into the South Australia side after one club match in 1945. He was not overawed and soon earned a place on the tour of New Zealand. He was not as deadly as McCool and by the end of the tour he suffered as the England batsman became used to his flighted leg-breaks. George Tribe was a rare specialist Chinaman bowler who took more first class wickets than any other Australian bowler in 1945–46 and 1946–47. He suffered from uneven form, taking 6/49 for Victoria vs the MCC, but costly in the Tests.|$|E
