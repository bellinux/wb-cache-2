5|$|Following the {{acceptance}} of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the Renaissance, when they were built in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinction}} between the king's personal household department of the Wardrobe and the governmental department of the Chancery, which was headed by the chancellor, disappeared almost entirely during Burnell's period of office. The Wardrobe had developed as a less formal department for the collection and distribution of money, but under Edward had effectively become a treasury for warfare. There was no rivalry between the holders of the Great Seal, the official seal of government and used for formal documents, and the Privy Seal, used to authenticate the king's less formal letters. During Burnell's time in office the king only used a Privy Seal warrant, or an informal set of <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> chancellor to issue {{a letter from the}} Chancery under the Great Seal, when the king and Burnell were apart; after Burnell's death the number of Privy Seal warrants increased greatly.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{total of}} 347 {{military}} treatises written during the Song period, as listed by the history text of the Song Shi (compiled in 1345). However, {{only a handful of}} these military treatises have survived, which includes the Wujing Zongyao written in 1044. It was the first known book to have listed formulas for gunpowder; it gave appropriate formulas for use in several different kinds of gunpowder bombs.

5|$|To {{mitigate}} this disaffection, Sercey ordered {{two of his}} frigates, Prudente and Forte {{to cruise}} in the Bay of Bengal against British trade during the autumn of 1798. When these ships returned, Sercey had already sailed for the east, leaving <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> frigates to follow. These orders were however countermanded by the Governor of Île de France, Malartic, who ordered the frigates seized {{while they were in}} harbour. Although Sercey protested Malartic's actions, the governor issued new orders to the ships: Forte was sent northeast to operate in the Bay of Bengal off Calcutta while Prudente was partially disarmed and sold to a privateering concern to operate against trade as a commercial investment.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from a summer visit to Los Altos, California, Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium, but no details of an assignment. When Rona responded {{that she would be}} interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues, a man identifying himself as Brian O'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project. They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> type of assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics. Her non-citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), to which she gave her methods without compensation. Before the Manhattan Project, polonium had been used only in small samples, but the project proposed to use both polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb. Plutonium plants, based on her specifications for what was needed to process element, were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory, but Rona was given no details.|$|E
5|$|General (Polish: generalny, Latin conventiones generales), held {{in western}} Poland (Greater Poland) at Koło, in {{southern}} Poland (Little Poland) at Nowe Miasto Korczyn, in Masovia at Warsaw, in Red Ruthenia at Sądowa Wisznia (Sudova Vyshnia), and in Lithuania at Wołkowysk (Vawkavysk). The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their {{goal was to}} agree on a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent and custom rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.|$|E

Mathematical treatises included the Book on Numbers and Computation (Suan shu shu) The Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven (Zhoubi Suanjing), and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art (Jiuzhang Suanshu). There were also works on astronomy, such as the Miscellaneous Readings of Cosmic Patterns and Pneuma Images (Tianwen qixiang zazhan 天文氣象雜占) from the 2nd-century-BCE Mawangdui Silk Texts and Zhang Heng's (78139 CE) Spiritual Constitution of the Universe (Lingxian 靈憲) published in 120 CE.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, the British General Staff {{released}} a training pamphlet titled SS 143 <b>Instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, espousing {{the return to}} the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics {{and the use of}} the platoon as a self-contained tactical unit. The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated hand grenade, rifle grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps instilled the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale model representations of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{instructed}} Agnew {{to avoid}} personal {{attacks on the}} press and the Democratic presidential nominee, South Dakota Senator George McGovern, to stress the positives of the Nixon administration, and not to comment on what might happen in 1976. At the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Agnew was greeted as a hero by delegates who saw him as the party's future. After being nominated for a second term, Agnew delivered an acceptance speech focused on the administration's accomplishments, and avoided his usual slashing invective, but he condemned McGovern for supporting busing, and alleged that McGovern, if elected, would beg the North Vietnamese for the return of American prisoners of war. The Watergate break-in was a minor issue in the campaign; for once, Agnew's exclusion from Nixon's inner circle worked in his favor, as he knew nothing of the matter until reading of it in the press, and upon learning from Jeb Magruder that administration officials were responsible for the break-in, cut off discussion of the matter. He viewed the break-in as foolish, and felt that both major parties routinely spied on each other. Nixon had instructed Agnew not to attack McGovern's initial running mate, Missouri Senator Thomas Eagleton, and after Eagleton withdrew amid revelations concerning past mental health treatment, the president renewed those <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> new candidate, Sargent Shriver.|$|E

5|$|Sailing from Malacca on 20 November, Pellew's {{squadron}} {{passed along}} the Javan coast for 15 days, reaching Panka Point on 5 December and sending a boat under a {{flag of truce}} into Griessie with <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Dutch commander to surrender his ships. Captain Cowell refused, and ordered the boat party to be arrested. He then sent a Dutch officer aboard Culloden to inform Pellew of his actions. In response, Pellew determined to attack the port and ordered that Culloden and Powerful be lightened by the removal of unnecessary stores {{to enable them to}} sail into the shallow straits. On 6 December, the British squadron moved steadily towards Griessie through the Madura Strait, coming under fire from heated cannonballs from a battery of nine cannon situated at Sambelangan on Madura Island. Returning fire with his full squadron, Pellew rapidly silenced the battery without loss or significant damage to his ships and as the squadron approached Griessie, a message from the civilian governor in Sourabaya reached Pellew, reversing Cowell's orders, releasing the captured boat party and unconditionally surrendering the ships in the harbour.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Pierre Frugoli and Lucien Mattei opened on 30 November 1987 in Pau, France. Mattei, {{who had been}} {{previously}} been released after serving one year of a 20-year sentence for armed assault, retracted his previous confession. Frugoli, however, acknowledged that he had set out to kill ETA members. He stated {{that he had been}} recruited by members of the Spanish secret services, codenamed Francis and Miguel, in La Samaritaine bar in Marseilles port. With Mattei, he made several trips to San Sebastián to receive <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> attack, the last in the city's Orly Hotel three days before the attack. He claimed that Francis had offered him 100,000 francs for carrying out the attack and 50,000 more for each person killed. Francis then met them in Bayonne, supplying them with the weapons used in the attack and the identities of the desired targets.|$|E
5|$|Walter's chief {{administrative}} measures were his {{instructions to the}} itinerant justices of 1194 and 1198, his ordinance of 1195, an attempt to increase order in the kingdom, and his plan of 1198 {{for the assessment of}} a land tax. In 1194 the justices were ordered to secure the election of four coroners by each county court. The coroners were to keep, or register, royal pleas, which had previously been a duty of the sheriff. The juries were to be chosen by a committee of four knights, also elected by the county court. This introduction of coroners and constables eventually led to a change in the role of sheriffs, and a lessening of their importance in royal administration. Although he probably did not take part in the decision to set up a special exchequer for the collection of Richard's ransom, Walter did appoint the two escheators, or guardians of the amounts due, who were Hugh Bardulf in the north of England and William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise in the south. His <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eyre, or circuits of traveling justices, are the first that survive in English history. It was during his tenure of the justiciarship that the judicial role of the Exchequer became separated from the purely financial aspects.|$|E
