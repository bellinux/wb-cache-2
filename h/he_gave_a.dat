5|$|After {{retreating}} into Arcadia {{and receiving}} {{news of his}} wife's death, Cleomenes returned to Sparta. This left Antigonus free to advance through Arcadia and on the towns that Cleomenes had fortified, including Athenaeum—which he gave to Megalopolis. He continued to Aegium, where the Achaeans were holding their council. <b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> report on his operations and was made chief-in-command of all the allied forces.|$|E

5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and {{his decision to}} mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|Chabas first {{exhibited}} September Morn in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did {{not plan}} to sell it, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> price of 50,000 francs ($10,000)– more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight, Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as Town & Country and The International Studio.|$|E

5|$|Champollion's {{interest}} in Egyptian {{history and the}} hieroglyphic script developed at an early age. At the age of sixteen, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> lecture before the Grenoble Academy in which {{he argued that the}} language spoken by the ancient Egyptians, in which they wrote the Hieroglyphic texts, was closely related to Coptic. This view proved crucial in becoming able to read the texts, and the correctness of his proposed relation between Coptic and Ancient Egyptian has been confirmed by history. This enabled him to propose that the demotic script represented the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|Colt was {{the first}} American {{manufacturer}} to use art as a marketing tool when he hired Catlin to prominently display Colt firearms in his paintings. He was awarded numerous government contracts after making gifts of his highly embellished and engraved revolvers with exotic grips such as ivory or pearl to government officials. On a trip to Constantinople <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> custom-engraved and gold inlaid revolver to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdülmecid I, informing him that the Russians were buying his pistols, thus securing a Turkish order for 5,000 pistols; he neglected to tell the Sultan he had used the same tactic with the Russians to elicit an order.|$|E
5|$|He {{drew from}} his medical {{training}} to discredit popular ideas about {{differences among the}} races. In 1843 <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> lecture series, Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the Races, to demonstrate the failings of phrenology, which was a so-called scientific practice {{of the time that}} was applied in a way to draw racist conclusions and attribute negative characteristics to ethnic Africans. He rejected the practice of homeopathy, an alternative to the scientific medicine being taught in universities. Although he had a successful medical career, he was not admitted to the American Medical Association or local associations because of racial discrimination.|$|E

5|$|<b>He</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I {{have ever}} heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Rome in December, and {{was present in}} March 20 when Agrippina arrived with Germanicus' ashes. He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the crime of maiestas (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> eulogy the next meeting. It was decided that their eulogies would both be inscribed in bronze: that of Tiberius for future generations, but the libellus (eulogy) of Drusus to demonstrate the devotion of Drusus for his adoptive brother {{in a show of}} pietas (piety).|$|E
5|$|Herb Hunter {{arranged}} {{for a group of}} All-Stars, including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Earl Averill, Charlie Gehringer, Jimmie Foxx and Lefty Gomez, to tour Japan playing exhibitions against a Japanese all-star team. Despite the fact that Berg was a mediocre, third-string catcher, he was invited at the last minute to make the trip. Among the items Berg took with him to Japan were a 16-mm Bell & Howell movie camera and a letter from MovietoneNews, a New York City newsreel production company with which Berg had contracted to film the sights of his trip. When the team arrived in Japan, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> welcome speech in Japanese and also addressed the legislature.|$|E

5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on 6 August, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, in the Mariana Islands, about six hours' flight time from Japan, accompanied by two other B-29s, The Great Artiste, carrying instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, to take photographs. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted the event recorded for posterity, so the takeoff was illuminated by floodlights. When he wanted to taxi, Tibbets leaned {{out the window to}} direct the bystanders out of the way. On request, <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> friendly wave for the cameras.|$|E
5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access, {{not only to the}} convention grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with unauthorized members of the media.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, {{his travels}} {{took him to}} Asia and later to Palestine, {{as part of a}} six-month {{excursion}} and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where <b>he</b> <b>gave</b> <b>a</b> series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch.
