5|$|In the 18th century {{two members}} of the clan earned {{considerable}} regard for their Gaelic poetry. James, the poet-chief, (1727–1799) is best remembered for a biting satire he composed in Gaelic in response to Samuel Johnson, the English encyclopedist, who had made derogatory comments about the Scots <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>famous</b> trip to the Hebrides.|$|E
5|$|This naturalistic {{explanation}} fitted {{well with}} the recent account of evolution by Alfred Russel Wallace and Charles Darwin, as outlined <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>famous</b> 1859 book The Origin of Species. Because this Darwinian explanation required no supernatural forces, it met with considerable criticism from anti-evolutionists, both in academic circles and in the broader social realm.|$|E

5|$|In Sanskrit, a {{well-known}} poem (Mahakavya) in 18 cantos called Vikramankadeva Charita by Kashmiri poet Bilhana recounts in epic style {{the life and}} achievements of his patron king Vikramaditya VI. The work narrates the episode of Vikramaditya VI's accession to the Chalukya throne after overthrowing his elder brother Someshvara II. The great Indian mathematician Bhāskara II (born c.1114) flourished during this time. From his own account <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>famous</b> work Siddhanta Siromani (c. 1150, comprising the Lilavati, Bijaganita on algebra, Goladhaya on the celestial globe and Grahaganita on planets) Bijjada Bida (modern Bijapur) was his native place.|$|E
5|$|The name of Calafia {{was likely}} formed from the Arabic word khalifa (religious state leader) {{which is known}} as caliph in English and califa in Spanish. Similarly, the name of Calafia's monarchy, California, likely {{originated}} from the same root, fabricated by the author to remind the 16th-century Spanish reader of the reconquista, a centuries-long fight between Christians and Muslims which had recently concluded in Spain. The character of Calafia is used by Rodríguez de Montalvo to portray the superiority of chivalry in which the attractive virgin queen is conquered, converted to Christian beliefs and married off. The book was very popular for many decades—Hernán Cortés read it—and it was selected by author Miguel de Cervantes as {{the first of many}} popular and assumed harmful books to be burnt by characters <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>famous</b> novel Don Quixote.|$|E
