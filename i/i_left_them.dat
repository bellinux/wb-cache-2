25|$|Following the dynastic {{tradition}} the Habsburgs' hereditary territories {{were separated}} from this enormous empire at the Diet of Worms in 1521, when Charles <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> {{to the rule}} of his younger brother, Ferdinand I (1521–1564), although he then continued to add to the Habsburg territories. Charles added Tyrol to Ferdinand's possessions in 1522. Since Charles left his Spanish Empire to his son Philip II of Spain, the Spanish territories became permanently alienated from the northern Habsburg domains, although remained allies for several centuries.|$|E
500|$|The song's {{narrative}} is in first person, and depicts Swift apologizing {{to a young}} man whose heart she broke. Mandi Bierly from Entertainment Weekly describes the song as [...] "a melancholy mea culpa with the kind of driving chorus and age-appropriate yet universal honesty", adding that [...] "in the tune [...] she says she’s sorry for the last time he saw her ('You gave me roses, and <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> there to die') and that she wishes she realized what she had ('I’d go back to December, turn around, and change my own mind/I go back to December all the time').|$|E

6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> all in couples akissing on the decks. [...] <b>I</b> <b>left</b> {{the lovers}} loving {{and the parents}} signing checks. [...] In endless English comfort by county-folk caressed, [...] <b>I</b> <b>left</b> the old three-decker at the Islands of the Blest! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, who swiped {{one of my}} socks? I can't find but one, and <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> together." [...] He {{began to}} toss things left and right {{in search of the}} missing article.|$|R
500|$|There, Gutzlaff restated {{his request}} {{to allow people}} to come out and sell provisions. He {{repeatedly}} went {{back and forth between the}} two parties, repeating details of the conversations with Elliot. He also brought $200 and told the Chinese that they would not leave without supplies. Soon afterwards, the Chinese soldiers went off in a boat to consult with the officer in the adjacent fort and promised to relay his opinion; it appeared nothing could be done unless the matter was reported to the deputy of the commissioner, who resided in the neighourhood, and leave obtained from the plenipotentiary himself. After a Chinese request to know the items wanted, Gutzlaff wrote a list. He was told they could not be procured but items would be given to satisfy immediate necessities. According to Gutzlaff, this was [...] "a mere manoeuvre" [...] to gain time in manning the fort. He reported, [...] "After the most pathetic appeal to their feelings, and having described the disasters which certainly would ensue from their obstinacy, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them,</b> and returned on board the cutter".|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> {{her cousin}} {{gave me a}} great {{flourish}} with his picturesque hat.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them,</b> {{and passed}} on into our studio sitting-room, where Mabane was filling his pipe.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> {{standing}} side by side, {{looking at}} the skipper as if 'e was a waxworks, while I went to find a cab. When I came back they {{was in the same}} persition, and 'e was smoking with 'is eyes shut.|$|R
6000|$|... "That was no falsehood," [...] said Pomona; [...] "it {{was true}} as truth. If you're not your own friends, I don't know who is. And I wasn't a-goin' {{to tell the}} boarder where you was till I found out whether {{you wanted me to}} do it or not. And so <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> and run over to old John's, and then down here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll have to {{find them}} tools in the dark, that's all." [...] He groped around for several seconds, during which I held my breath. [...] "Ah, here they are, just as <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> last night. Reckon no one visits this shanty, and maybe {{it will be a}} good place to bring the booty, {{especially}} if I happen to be closely pushed." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> there. As I {{went out}} she was gently countermanding his order for more brandy.|$|E
6000|$|LESLIE. <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> talking deeply. The {{dear old}} Procurator has not much thought just now for {{anything}} but those mysterious burglaries---- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> alone! There {{was nothing}} else which I could do, and I waited in the hall below for Lady Dennisford.|$|E
60|$|When we returned, {{these three}} were {{in much the}} same {{position}} <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>them</b> in; <b>I</b> believe no word had passed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely. 'Trust {{their own}} wit,' you {{practically}} said, 'to save all appearances.' Well, I've trusted it. <b>I</b> HAVE <b>left</b> <b>them</b> to pull through." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{mean that}} <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>them</b> at home. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>them</b> there, perhaps, {{to a certain}} extent deliberately," [...] he went on. [...] "You see, the idea is still with me. I think that I shall rewrite them when I have settled down in America. I fancy that I shall find myself in an {{atmosphere}} more conducive to the sort of work I want to do. I would rather not be handicapped by the ghosts of my old failures." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> to talk together, {{and took}} a turn in the room, {{considering}} with myself what we were to do next.|$|E
60|$|But {{the poor}} creatures were aghast. So <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> to their fate, {{and went up}} to the nearest Salvation Army man.|$|E
60|$|Isaac. Ay, that he is, I'll be sworn; for <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> with a priest, and was to {{have given}} her away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Twelve hours, twelve bounteous {{hours are}} gone, while I [...] Have been a {{traveller}} under open sky, [...] Much witnessing {{of change and}} cheer, [...] Yet as <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>I</b> find <b>them</b> here!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Six o'clock.--The landlady's gossip is unendurable; the landlady's {{children}} distract me. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>them</b> to {{run back}} here before post time {{and write a}} line to Mrs. Oldershaw.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{recovered}} myself first, and led {{him back}} to the subject of Armadale, having my own reasons for wanting to know what they said to each other after <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>them</b> yesterday.|$|R
60|$|MILLIKEN.--My dear, darling boy! <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> at the office. What a silly papa I was {{to forget}} them! Parkins forgot them.|$|E
60|$|So they {{discussed}} it. After a while <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them,</b> {{and went on}} to the railway station to get as many morning papers as I could.|$|E
6000|$|I {{tried to}} frame some words of sympathy; {{but they seemed}} poor and cold, and <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> unspoken. [...] "Good night!" [...] was all I said.|$|E
60|$|Transcriber's note: There are {{numerous}} examples throughout this text of words appearing in alternate spellings: madame/madam, practise/ practice, Ladyship/ladyship, &c. We can only {{wonder what the}} publisher had in mind. <b>I</b> have <b>left</b> <b>them</b> unchanged.--D.L.|$|R
60|$|Const. Why, <b>I</b> <b>left</b> you to <b>'em,</b> {{that ever}} invite your own belly to the {{greatest}} part of all your feasts.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{train is}} due there in about fifteen minutes, and she won't stop more'n {{long enough to}} put my milk cans on board. <b>I</b> jest <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> there, and got these empty ones," [...] {{explained}} the farmer, pointing to the cans behind him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! the girls--what girls? Well, {{they must}} answer for themselves; <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> {{about half an}} hour ago, and now you hear their voices in the porch." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{leave our}} stupid old Trinities--as <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them</b> long ago," [...] said old Likeman, with his lean hand feeling and clawing at {{the arm of}} his chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{declared}} Black, thickly. [...] "Couldn't {{strike a}} job nohow when <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>them.</b> British Columbia played out--and I {{had no money}} {{to take me to}} California." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Klondike was breakin' up," [...] Shorty {{concluded}} his recital, [...] "an' we {{just had}} to wait for open water. Two polin' boats, six other men--you know 'em all, an' crackerjacks--an' all kinds of outfit. An' we've sure been a-comin'--polin', linin' up, and portagin'. But the falls'll stick 'em a solid week. That's where <b>I</b> <b>left</b> <b>'em</b> a-cuttin' a trail over the tops of the bluffs for the boats. I just had a sure natural hunch to keep a-comin'. So I fills a pack with grub an' starts. I knew I'd find you a-driftin' an' all in." ...|$|R
60|$|And with a {{flourish}} of my sodden beaver, <b>I</b> turned and <b>left</b> <b>them</b> before they had recovered from the vehemence of my words.|$|R
6000|$|... "The moment I {{looked at}} my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. <b>I</b> had <b>left</b> <b>them</b> all together.
