40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{machinability}} of BN (Boron Nitride) <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel</b> in turning. Tested work materials were plane carbon steel JIS S 45 C and BN <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel.</b> The JIS S 45 C used as the standard. The tool wear in turning BN <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel</b> was smaller than that in turning standard steel. BN <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel</b> showed slightly lower cutting temperature and smaller cutting force to compare with standard steel at the tested cutting speeds. At the tool wear region of P grade carbide tool after turning BN <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel</b> at high cutting speed, Al and N were detected as a layer. It is thought {{that one of the}} main reasons of outstanding machinability of BN <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel</b> is the deposited layer containing Al and N acts as diffusion barrier at the tool-chip interface. In turning larger Al content BN added steel with higher Ti content cutting tool, the influence of BN addition on the tool wear reduction was more remarkable. [議事録...|$|E

5|$|Bismuth {{is used to}} make <b>free-machining</b> <b>steels</b> and <b>free-machining</b> {{aluminium}} alloys for precision machining properties. It has similar effect to lead and improves the chip breaking during machining. The shrinking on solidification in lead {{and the expansion of}} bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities. Similarly, alloys containing comparable parts of bismuth and lead exhibit a very small change (on the order 0.01%) upon melting, solidification or aging. Such alloys are used in high-precision casting, e.g. in dentistry, to create models and molds. Bismuth is also used as an alloying agent in production of malleable irons and as a thermocouple material.|$|R

Not all alloys are suitable; e.g. the <b>free-machining</b> 303 <b>steel</b> contains sulfur, which tends to outgas. Alloys with good weldability under argon arc welding are usually chosen.|$|R

The tested work pieces were, standard steel AISI 1045 and BN added steel (AISI 1045 -BN) based AISI 1045 which has good mach inability at high cutting speed. Turning tests were performed by carbide tool P 30 and the power source for additional electrical current supply was a direct current source and the maximum electrical current in the circuit was 20 milliamperes (mA). To investigate the influence of electrical conditions of closed circuit system on the cutting mechanism of AISI 1045 -BN. The tool life, cutting force, and others were determined experimentally. The testing results show that when turning with carbide tool P 30 the maximum crater depth in the tool was reduced drastically when the value of supplied current reached 5 mA, regardless of its direction of flow, compared with depths at lower current values; the additional electrical current cutting showed smaller cutting force than those of conditions when turning AISI 1045 -BN...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to model}} the microstructure development of Si-containing bainitic <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel,</b> including allotriomorphic ferrite, idiomorphic ferrite, pearlite, Widmanstatten ferrite, bainite and martensite. The effect of recalescence has been included to give a better estimation of the cooling curve under natural cooling conditions. A model for estimating retained austenite size distribution in the carbide-free bainitic microstructure has been developed. Manganese sulphide particles {{are used in the}} <b>free-machining</b> <b>steel</b> to break chips during machining; its effect on the prior austenite grain size has been investigated, taking account of the sulphide shape. The theories of all the major solid state phase transformations involved in steel are reviewed in chapter 2. The theory of the simultaneous transformation model is presented in chapter 3. uu A recalescence model dealing with the heat of reaction has been developed in chapter 5 for bar-shaped products. The model is based on the integration of a heat transfer model, considering latent heat generation, into the simultaneous transformation framework. It has been found that latent heat can greatly affect the transformation, {{especially in the case of}} pearlite and Widmanstatten ferrite. Chapter 6 presents the model for estimating the size distribution of retained austenite regions. The model builds on the random division of an austenite grain by bainite sheaves, which means the sizes of the two new compartments generated by the division of an austenite grain by a bainite sheaf are allocated randomly. The next compartment to be divided is also chosen at random. Good agreement between prediction and experiment has been achieved for high carbon carbide-free bainitic microstructures. The transition temperature from upper to lower bainite is modelled in chapter 7. The model compares the time required for decarburising a supersaturated bainitic ferrite platelet and that for cementite precipitation within the ferrite platelet. Manganese, silicon and chromium are considered in the model. It is suggested that carbon and manganese favour lower bainite, whereas silicon promotes upper bainite. The effect of manganese sulphide particles on austenite grain boundary motion has been studied in chapter 8. These rod-shaped particles span many austenite grains; the result shows that the long rod-shaped particles are more effective in pinning the austenite grain boundary than spheres of the same volume, or even strings of identical spheres with the same total volume. Experimental work is presented in chapters 9 and 10. In situ synchrotron X-ray study of the bainite transformation reveals that the distribution of carbon in the residual austenite becomes heterogeneous as transformation progresses. Low carbon regions transform preferentially into martensite during cooling after isothermal bainite transformation. The partitioning of carbon was found to lag behind the bainite transformation; more time is needed as the transformation temperature is reduced. Tetragonality was not observed in either the bainitic ferrite or martensite, because the carbon content of the alloy is relatively low, and the Zener ordering temperature is below the bainite and martensite transformation temperature. No significant difference was observed in the kinetics of bainite transformation between the high sulphur and low sulphur steel. Swiss Steel A...|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} {{characteristic of a}} broach is the rise per tooth (RPT), which is how much material is removed by each tooth. The RPT varies for each section of the broach, which are the roughing section (tr), semi-finishing section (ts), and finishing section (tf). The roughing teeth remove most of the material so the number of roughing teeth required dictates how long the broach is. The semi-finishing teeth provide surface finish and the finishing teeth provide the final finishing. The finishing section's RPT (tf) is usually zero so that as the first finishing teeth wear the later ones continue the sizing function. For <b>free-machining</b> <b>steels</b> the RPT ranges from [...] For surface broaching the RPT is usually between [...] and for diameter broaching is usually between [...] The exact value depends on many factors. If the cut is too big it will impart too much stress into the teeth and the workpiece; if the cut is too small the teeth rub instead of cutting. One way to increase the RPT while keeping the stresses down is with chip breakers.
