500|$|Morrison has {{described}} his songwriting method by remarking that: [...] "I write {{from a different}} place. I do not {{even know what it}} is called or if it has a name. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> and I sculpt it, {{but it is also a}} lot of hard work doing the sculpting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Redux II" [...] {{was highly}} praised by Carter, saying that [...] "I think that Redux II {{is one of}} the best episodes we've ever done". Frank Spotnitz said [...] "Redux II is one of my {{favorite}} episodes. I think the story has a crystal purity and clarity, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> to a perfect point for me". Anderson said [...] "I thought it was a terrific episode, especially the scenes in the hearing room, and the whole progression of Scully praying. How it was written and shot and how it was edited. Fabulous".|$|E
500|$|Probably in {{many respects}} most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an {{unconscious}} way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes.</b> And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, [...] "Oh, that's what I wrote that song about." [...] But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that'. In 'Miles Away' I'm tapping into the global consciousness of people who have intimacy problems.|$|E

500|$|Nick is {{an awesome}} producer. He {{really helped me}} get the plan and have {{confidence}} in the decisions that we made. For me, I have a lot of ideas and sometimes <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> down to [...] "OK, everything that I'm doing I have two options!" [...] He's awesome, because as I'm doing these things I'm asking him from the vocal booth or the piano room or whatever, [...] "Which one of these should I do?" [...] He's good at helping me make a quick decision. I really trust his opinion because he makes great records.|$|E
500|$|... "I Like You So Much Better When You're Naked" [...] saw the {{departure}} of Stevens, following the breakdown of her marriage with Karev. Series' writer Joan Rater commented on this: [...] "Izzie getting the clean scan back gives Alex the freedom to leave. Because {{he never would have}} left her when she was sick, he's a good guy. And I'm not saying that Alex ever consciously thought, I can’t leave her while she's sick, but now that she's not, now that she seems like she's going to get better, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> to him. He deserves more. He's a good guy and he deserves more. But loving Izzie showed him that he can be good, is good. So it was a little gift. And when he tells Izzie he's done, he's not bitter or angry, he's just done." [...] The writing of the two-part season six finale, caused struggle to Rhimes. She elaborated on this: ...|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. <b>It</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes.</b> And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and they all go, 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

5000|$|Warren {{wrote the}} song {{after the death}} of her father. She is quoted as saying that [...] "the song wrote itself...I was {{thinking}} about my dad who had recently passed away, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> pouring out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well, no offence. Keep an easy mind, and if {{you should}} chance to change <b>it,</b> <b>just</b> <b>come</b> and see me, Captain Bounce, of the Swordfish. There she lies, in all her beauty, quite a picture. Good-day." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Soldier" [...] {{was written}} by Badu {{immediately}} after receiving Riggins' beat for the song. He said Badu wanted it to have a sound similar to J Dilla and his Detroit hip hop scene, which Riggins was inspired by: [...] "A lot of producers from Detroit have a certain sound, and I think <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> from being in the city." [...] Its sociopolitical lyrics have Badu expressing sympathy and solidarity for those facing oppression, with references to police corruption, black-on-black crime, and Hurricane Katrina. [...] "The Cell" [...] was produced by Husayn and features a lively, choral style and hard bop feel. Titled {{as a metaphor for}} both heredity and confinement, the song is a tableau of crime, drugs, and desperation in urban decay, streamlined by a stark story about Brenda, a character who falls victim to her environment. Cited by Chavarria as the album's most effects-heavy track, [...] "Twinkle" [...] features a futuristic sound, a convoluted beat, and abstract aural elements such as white noise bursts, high-pitched voices, abrasive instruments, and layers of twinkling keyboard bass. The lyrics lament the plight of the Black community and the cyclical effects on African Americans by the various failures of American social institutions such as the health care, education, and prison systems. Badu raps in the song's verse, [...] "Children of the matrix be hittin’ them car switches / Seen some virgin Virgos hanging out with Venus bitches", followed by her singing, [...] "They don’t know their language, they don’t know their God". Over humming keyboards, the closing minutes of the song feature a speech in the ancient African language of Mdw Ntchr, followed by a speaker's rant inspired by actor Peter Finch's own rant in the 1976 film Network. The speaker angrily laments the state {{of the world and the}} complacency of people. Philadelphia Weeklys Craig D. Linsey likened [...] "Twinkle" [...] to a denser version of Marvin Gaye's 1971 song [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)".|$|E
2500|$|Considered {{to be more}} {{emotional}} than the lead single, [...] "Still Breathing" [...] is characterized as a [...] "serious" [...] track. Armstrong intended to make others happy, {{and to make a}} difference, by getting people to recognize themselves in the song. He described the track as [...] "a very heavy song", and further explained, [...] "Sometimes I run away from being too heavy. But sometimes <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> out that way." [...] While commenting on the chorus, I'm still breathing on my own, he added, [...] "at some point, we're all {{going to have to be}} on life support. As time goes on, your thoughts get darker." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I hear {{everything}} at once – melody, lyrics, <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>comes</b> in. There's {{a feeling that}} comes over me and I know that there's a song trying to come through. It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because when I write a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E

5000|$|Speaking {{about the}} tour, Gahan praised it as [...] "probably the most enjoyable, {{rewarding}} live show we've ever done. The new material was {{just waiting to}} be played live.

2500|$|On October 3, 2006, Strait {{marked his}} 30th {{year in the}} music {{industry}} with the release of a new album titled <b>It</b> <b>Just</b> <b>Comes</b> Natural. The album was recorded in Key West, Fla. in Jimmy Buffett's Shrimp Boat Sound Studio (said to be a better recording location due to lack of allergy flare ups during recording process), which was also the recording location of [...] "Troubadour". [...] It featured fifteen new songs. Strait's long-time friend and songwriter, Dean Dillon co-wrote two of the songs on the album. It received generally positive reviews from critics. People, in their four-star review, remarked that [...] "If ever there was a natural in country music, it's Strait," [...] while USA Today raved that [...] "he continues to make such consistent quality look easy". The first single from the album, [...] "Give It Away" [...] reached No.1, making one of its co-writers, country legend [...] "Whispering Bill" [...] Anderson, the first songwriter to have a #1 hit in five different decades. The title track, [...] "It Just Comes Natural" [...] became his 42nd Billboard No.1.|$|E

6000|$|... "When? When? What's the use {{of trying}} to pin me down to When and Why and Where and How and When?

That's but a low motive after all. Is it worthy of an intelligent man? I get a slap in the face, and bear it patiently, because I can't help myself. I get the same slap in the face in circumstances where I can help myself, and I resent it fiercely. Humble when I must be so; fierce when I've got the power. Is not this unmanly--childish--humbug? There is no principle here. Principle! I do believe I never had any principle in me worthy of the name. I have been drifting, up to this time, before the winds of caprice and selfish inclination.
