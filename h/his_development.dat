5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was <b>his</b> <b>development</b> {{of a complex}} internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe.

5|$|As The World Ends with You {{focuses on}} the {{character}} of Neku Sakuraba, {{in order to create a}} believable story the developers put a lot of focus on <b>his</b> <b>development,</b> such as how he would feel, what thoughts lie behind his actions, how he interacted with other characters, and how the people around him feel about him. The developers included aspects and daily concerns, hoping that they could be things that players would have to deal with their personal lives and therefore would let them relate with Neku.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the paucity}} of {{surviving}} attributed works, {{it is difficult to}} detect any evolution in Lochner's style. Art historians are unsure if his style became progressively more or less influenced by Netherlandish art. Recent dendrochronological examination of attributed works indicate that <b>his</b> <b>development</b> was not linear, suggesting that the more advanced Presentation in the Temple is of 1445, predating the more Gothic Saints panels now divided between London and Cologne.|$|E
5|$|Berg's {{observation}} of {{local high school}} students while preparing to film the movie inspired <b>his</b> <b>development</b> {{of some of the}} characters.

David Edwards, a football player from San Antonio’s Madison High, was paralyzed during a November 2003 game.

5|$|Branham {{became more}} {{controversial}} {{in his later}} years and this was particularly evident in <b>his</b> <b>development</b> of a theology that emphasized a few select doctrines. His theology seemed complicated and bizarre to many people who admired him personally.
