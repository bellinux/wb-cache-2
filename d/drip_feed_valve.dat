The mid-1950s saw the hasty introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock to replace steam in a modernisation plan costing many millions of pounds but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount.

50|$|Ring oilers {{were used}} for speeds up to around 1,000 rpm. Above this, the oil tended to be thrown {{centrifugally}} from the ring, rather than carried by it (although it is still currently applied on steam turbines with speeds around 3200 rpm). The bearing must also remain horizontal and stable, so although suitable for crankshaft main bearings, {{they could not be}} used on connecting rod big end bearings. They were not used on vehicles for similar reasons, although the engines concerned at this time were anyway too large and heavy for practical mobile use. Automatic ring oilers were particularly useful for large engines with multiple horizontally opposed cylinders, where it was otherwise difficult to access the central main bearings. Ring oilers were most suited where bearing side-loads were relatively light, but the bearing capacity required more lubrication than could be supplied by a <b>drip</b> <b>feed</b> oiler. For this reason they were widely used on larger electric motors and generators.|$|R

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the issue {{regarding}} the survival, preservation of life, health and neuropsychic development of infants with extremely low birth weight. 25 preterm infants aged 0 to 4 weeks were studied. The inclusion criteria were infants aged 28 – 34 weeks of gestation, with weights ranging from 1, 000 to 1, 850 g. Enteral feeding consisted of specialized formula with prebiotics (6 hours after birth through a <b>drip</b> <b>feeding</b> tube), increasing to 150 ml/kg a day {{by the age of}} 10 – 12 days. The study results demonstrated that the maximum weight loss was recorded on day 4, 0 ± 1, 5. The original body weight was restored, on average, on day 13. The average daily weight gain was 14, 0 g/kg a day which evidenced good digestion of nutrients and high energy value of the formula. The results of lab tests showed a reduced level of nonesterified fatty acides, a slow waning of _-fetoprotein synthesis. Using a special formula with prebiotics on this category of infants, therefore, provides optimal rate of body weight growth and models protein lipid metabolism in blood serum after the anabolic pattern.
