5|$|In the {{mathematics}} of graph drawing, Turán's brick factory problem asks for the {{minimum number of}} crossings in a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> complete bipartite graph. The problem is named after Pál Turán, who formulated it while being forced {{to work in a}} brick factory during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Mathematically, {{this problem}} can be formalized as asking for a graph <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} bipartite graph, whose vertices represent kilns and storage sites, and whose edges represent the tracks from each kiln to each storage site.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, {{treasure}} hunter Brock Lovett and {{his team}} aboard the research vessel Akademik Mstislav Keldysh search the wreck of RMS Titanic for a necklace with a rare diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. They recover a safe containing a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg. Rose Dawson Calvert, {{the woman in the}} drawing, is brought aboard Keldysh and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard Titanic.|$|E
5|$|In the present, {{the events}} of the episode never occurred, and Walter, having time to {{contemplate}} the letter to Peter instead of being called to the case, tosses it into the fireplace. Later, he receives an envelope in the mail—the one Alistair had prepared and instructed to be delivered to Walter on this specific date. Inside, Walter finds a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> white tulip.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, {{but it became}} more of a museum from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing dislodged pieces of plaster in the castle's south tower and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ship dated to around 1700.|$|E

5|$|The title Leave Home {{refers to}} the Ramones leaving New York City to go on tour around the world. The album cover was {{designed}} by Moshe Brakha, {{who had worked with}} the Rolling Stones to yield the Black and Blue (1976) cover art, and would later work with artists like Devo and Iron Maiden. The back cover of the album was a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bald eagle by graphic designer Arturo Vega. The image would soon become the band's logo.|$|E
5|$|The watercolourist Moses Harris (1731–1785), {{known for}} his The Aurelian or natural history of English insects (1766), {{published}} in 1780, the first scientific descriptions of several Odonata including the banded demoiselle, Calopteryx splendens. He was the first English artist to make illustrations of dragonflies accurate enough to be identified to species (Aeshna grandis at top left of plate illustrated), though his rough <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> larva (at lower left) with the mask extended appears to be plagiarised.|$|E
5|$|Back {{in present-day}} Washington D.C., Scully brings to Mulder's {{attention}} news about a body found in New Jersey with its arm and shoulder missing. Upon {{arriving at the}} Atlantic City morgue, Scully and Mulder discover that the body was eaten by a human. However, the local detective, Thompson, denies the agents access to the investigation. Scully returns to Washington to attend her godson's birthday party, while Mulder stays in New Jersey. At the party, Scully meets Rob, the divorced father {{of one of the}} guests. Meanwhile, Mulder questions homeless people about the case. A man shows him a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> humanoid and tells him that he saw it and that the other homeless people and cops know about it. Mulder gives his hotel room key to the man and sleeps in the alley, where he sees a shadowy, human-like creature. He chases the creature, but is arrested before he can catch it.|$|E

5|$|Intuition's first game, Dinowaurs, is a Flash-based {{strategy}} and action game where two players compete as dinosaurs {{to seize the}} most cavemen settlements so as to upgrade their own capacity and eventually kill the other dinosaur. It features online matchmaking. The concept came from one of Boxleiter's unfinished projects and another Intuition member's <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stegosaurus with a jetpack. The team was funded then-new Flash site Kongregate by November 2007 {{as one of the}} first five games for Kongregate platform. It was finished in two years for a 2009 release. IndieGames.com reported mixed reviews from players.|$|E
5|$|On Dell and Toshiba laptops, {{the port}} is {{marked with the}} {{standard}} USB symbol with an added lightning bolt icon on the right side. Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over a <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (putting it into sleep mode) and have the device continue to charge.|$|E
5|$|The Zelda team, however, had {{exhausted}} its {{ideas for}} this style and format. Aonuma hated the demo, finding it derivative of past Zelda games. The team explored other directions until designer Yoshiki Haruhana created a cartoonish <b>drawing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young Link that caught their eye. Design manager Satoru Takizawa drew up an enemy Moblin {{in a similar}} style, and the team seized on the new gameplay and combat possibilities afforded by the stylized cartoon aesthetic. To achieve this look, they used cel shading on 3D models, giving the look of an interactive cartoon. The developers built the game with Alias/Wavefront's Maya 3D tool and a custom game engine.|$|E
