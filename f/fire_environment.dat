The tests varied in that Test One allowed the fire to develop freely to post-flashover conditions, while Test Two incorporated sensor-informed ventilation management and was extinguished before post-flashover conditions were attained. Both tests had approximately 300 sensors monitoring several different characteristics of the <b>fire</b> <b>environment,</b> but Test One had about 160 additional sensors monitoring the structural response.|$|E
50|$|The {{detection}} range for large caliber artillery rounds {{is up to}} 30 km, and increases to 40 km for unguided rockets. The robust design of the radar array and algorithms allows the WLR to effectively operate even in a high density <b>fire</b> <b>environment,</b> in severe clutter and interference (jamming) conditions. Up to 7 targets can be tracked simultaneously. The radar can track rounds fired at both low and high angles, and at all aspect angles - from behind or towards the radar, or at an oblique angle to the array.

40|$|Skin {{pain and}} burns at an {{elevated}} skin layer temperature due to incident heat flux {{could be used}} to evaluate thermal hazards for some enclosed <b>fire</b> <b>environments</b> and mathematical expressions were proposed in literature for fire safety evaluations. In this work, a mathematical model for determining the skin layer temperature due to incident radiant heat flux is examined with experimental verification. Heat balance on the skin layer due to the heat flux and conductive heat transfer through it is considered. Specifically, the skin layer temperature at the head portion of an artificial thermal manikin was measured at certain incident radiant heat flux and compared with that calculated from the mathematical model. The results showed that the predictions were slightly higher than the measured values and the mathematical model would be useful in hazard assessment for some <b>fire</b> <b>environments</b> involving exposure of humans to a thermal radiation. Practical application: This paper presents the temperature measurement at a depth of 0. 1 mm under the skin of an artificial thermal manikin's head portion exposed to a vertical heated surface of 699 K in two orientations: facing and sideways to the surface. The result could be a useful source of information for the verification of any classical radiation model application to fire safety designs regarding heat exposure of the head portion of a person to heated surfaces. A mathematical model for determining the skin layer temperature due to incident radiant heat flux was examined. The study showed that the calculations reasonably estimated the skin layer temperature and thus would be useful in hazard assessment for some <b>fire</b> <b>environments</b> and building designs involving exposure of human objects to thermal radiation. Typical examples used in the study, where an evacuee would not experience any skin pain during evacuation, were: an escape corridor with a hot smoke layer in the upper part, and certain evacuation routes close to the hot surfaces.

In January 2005, the Clean Energy Future Group together with Environment Victoria released the report [...] "Toward Victoria's Clean Energy Future", a plan to cut Victoria's Greenhouse gas emissions from electricity by 2010. It largely focused on cleaner alternatives to Hazelwood, and warned that continued support of coal-fired power development would lock the State into CO2 emissions that would dwarf any current proposed measures for reducing emissions. Following the 2014 Hazelwood mine <b>fire,</b> <b>Environment</b> Victoria worked with locals in the Latrobe Valley to ensure national attention to the pollution disaster by generating media coverage and urging an inquiry into the fire; releasing a report by Harvard University researchers about the hidden health costs of Hazelwood; appearing at both inquiries, cross-examining both government regulators and ENGIE executives and ensuring mine rehabilitation was on the agenda; and petitioning the mine owner to pay its firefighting bill to the Country Fire Authority. It afterwards entered into a campaign to improve coal mine rehabilitation efforts in Victoria {{and to ensure that}} mine rehabilitation bonds cover the actual costs of rehabilitation. in 2015, it started a petition signed by thousands of Victorians to call on the French government to phase out Hazelwood. In May 2016 the petition postcards were handed to French Environment Minister Segolene Royale on tv, which led to her response announcement that ENGIE would disengage from Hazelwood. Environment Victoria currently closely follows the Hazelwood closure process, engaging with LaTrobe Valley communities and campaigning for a just transition for the Valley.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wildfire {{has been}} for millennia a natural {{component}} of our western forested wildlands. Its frequency, severity, and effects have varied depending on the specific environment, the type of fire, and the adaptations of the forest biota to <b>fire.</b> The socio-political <b>environment</b> in which these forests exist has had a much more significant impact on public and private policy towards fire than the physical-biological environment. Although ecological criteria are important in technical planning, they will be overshadowed by socio-political criteria in problem definition and solution for the future. The Pacific coastal states (California, Oregon, and Washington) are <b>fire</b> <b>environments,</b> historically subjected to fires of myriad frequencies, intensities, and extents. These natural forest fire regimes have been significantly altered over the past 150 years, primarily in response to socio-political pressures that resulted in more or less fire than projected under a natural fire regime. This paper summarizes these natural fire regimes, the evolution of fire policy in these areas, and fire management implications for the near future...|$|R

In addition, the smoke contains large amount of noxious gasses, such as CO, HCN etc. These noxious gasses will hurt miners’ eyes and central nervous systems, decline their visual acuity and thinking ability, and make them unconscious, which potentially increase the RSET. Danger limit states in coal mine fire are the cases that <b>fire</b> <b>environments</b> could cause the miners severity damage. So the miners should keep away from the dangerous lanes caused by smoke movement, or evacuate to a safe place before the dangerous states start.|$|R

40|$|Modeling {{wildfire}} spread patterns is {{a complex}} problem involving long-term fuel accumulation (site history) with short-term thermodynamics. The two dominant approaches to modeling wildfire spread patterns are fine-scale and mechanistic or broad-scale and probabilistic. Mechanistic approaches scale locally (micro-theory) to what keeps a fire burning while fire spread in probabilistic models is constrained by the rate of percolation across the fuel landscape (macro-theory). Changing spatial and temporal scales of <b>fire</b> <b>environment</b> variables lead to the inherent unpredictability found in middle number systems. Extant fire models lose predictive power when subtle shifts in environmental variables cause a qualitative change in fire behavior.

40|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>environments</b> {{that occur}} on cargo ships differ {{significantly}} from the <b>fire</b> <b>environments</b> found in land transport. Cargo ships typically carry {{a large amount of}} flammable fuel for propulsion and shipboard power, and may transport large quantities of flammable cargo. As a result, sea mode transport accident records contain instances of long lasting and intense fires. Since Irradiated Nuclear Fuel (INF) casks are not carried on tankers with large flammable cargoes, most of these dramatic, long burning fires are not relevant threats, and transport studies must concentrate on those fires that are most likely to occur. By regulation, INF casks must be separated from flammable cargoes by a fire-resistant, liquid-tight partition. This makes a fire in an adjacent ship hold the most likely fire threat. The large size of a cargo ship relative to any spent nuclear fuel casks on board, however, may permit a severe, long lasting fire to occur with little or no thermal impact on the casks. Although some flammable materials such as shipping boxes or container floors may exist in the same hold with the cask, the amount of fuel available may not provide a significant threat to the massive transport casks used for radioactive materials. This shipboard fire situation differs significantly from the regulatory conditions specified in 10 CFR 71 for a fully engulfing pool fire. To learn more about the differences, a series of simple thermal analyses has been completed to estimate cask behavior in likely marine and land thermal accident situations. While the calculations are based on several conservative assumptions, and are only preliminary, they illustrate that casks are likely to heat much more slowly in shipboard hold fires than in an open pool fire. The calculations also reinforce the basic regulatory concept that for radioactive materials, the shipping cask, not the ship, is the primary protection barrier to consider...|$|R
