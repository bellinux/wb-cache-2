They never stopped courting." [...] He often called her [...] "Mommy" [...] and she called him [...] "Ronnie." [...] He once wrote to her, [...] "Whatever I treasure and enjoy... all would be without meaning if I didn't have you." [...] When {{he was in the}} hospital in 1981 after an assassination attempt, she slept with one of his shirts to be comforted by his scent. In a letter to the American people in 1994, Reagan wrote [...] "I have recently been told that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> millions of Americans who will be afflicted with Alzheimer's disease... I only wish there was some way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience," [...] and in 1998, while he was stricken by Alzheimer's, Nancy told Vanity Fair, [...] "Our relationship is very special. We were very much in love and still are. When I say my life began with Ronnie, well, it's true. It did. I can't imagine life without him." [...] Nancy Reagan died on March 6, 2016 at the age of 94.|$|E

That focus lies in London and {{at the door of the}} then inhabitant of Number 10 Downing Street. I look forward to hearing your comments both to our group's letter and to the contents of this one." ...|$|E
