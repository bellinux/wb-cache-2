5000|$|For instance, in vehicle {{insurance}} {{a typical}} Personal Auto Policy will cover {{not only the}} original named insured that purchased the auto policy, but will also cover additional persons while they are driving the auto with permission of the named insured. This is a simple type of blanket additional insurance arrangement, {{because it does not}} identify the additional insured by name, but by a [...] "blanket" [...] general description that will automatically apply to many persons. Similarly, in liability insurance, all directors, officers, and employees of a named insured company will also enjoy the status of being an insured, so long as they are acting in their capacity of carrying out the business of the named insured company. These persons enjoy insured status only while they pursue the business of the named insured. If they deviate to pursue their own affairs, they lose this <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage.</b> This <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> to people with a constant and close relationship to the named insured company is accomplished via the [...] "Who Is An Insured" [...] section of the liability policy. In other cases, the original named insured wishes to extend coverage to others who would not come within these standard categories. To extend coverage further, Additional Insured Endorsements are added to the policy.|$|E

40|$|The First Amendment may protect {{speech by}} strong Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this Article, we support this provocative claim by {{expanding}} on earlier work, addressing significant concerns and challenges, and suggesting potential paths forward. This {{is not a}} claim {{about the state of}} technology. Whether strong AI — as-yet-hypothetical machines that can actually think — will ever come to exist remains far from clear. It is instead a claim that discussing AI speech sheds light on key features of prevailing First Amendment doctrine and theory, including the surprising lack of humanness at its core. Courts and commentators wrestling with free speech problems increasingly focus not on protecting speakers as speakers but instead on providing value to listeners and constraining the government’s power. These approaches to free speech law support the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> First Amendment <b>coverage</b> to expression regardless of its nontraditional source or form. First Amendment thinking and practice thus have developed in a manner that permits <b>extensions</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> in ways that may seem exceedingly odd, counterintuitive, and perhaps even dangerous. This is not a feature of the new technologies, but of free speech law. The possibility that the First Amendment covers speech by strong AI need not, however, rob the First Amendment of a human focus. Instead, it might encourage greater clarification of and emphasis on expression 2 ̆ 7 s value to human listeners — and its potential harms — in First Amendment theory and doctrine. To contemplate — Siri-ously — the relationship between the First Amendment and AI speech invites critical analysis of the contours of current free speech law, as well as sharp thinking about free speech problems posed by the rise of AI...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, little of the world outside of Europe, India, and parts of North America had been covered by topographic mapping. By the end of the century there were few areas that were not covered by topographic mapping, if only at small scales. Most of the technological changes that made this <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> map <b>coverage</b> possible were pioneered during the period 1900 - 1939. This paper reviews the technological developments in land and air survey that took place during that period and relates them to the drive to produce cost-effective mapping for civil and military purposes...|$|R

40|$|Conventional FPGA design {{assumes a}} {{one-to-one}} mapping between circuits and device resources. In contrast, dynamically reconfigurable designs map many circuits to shared device resources. Each many-to-one mapping can be decomposed into sequences of temporal, one-to-one mappings. The verification of dynamically reconfigurable logic {{is complicated by}} the need to verify that each constituent mapping is correct and that its sequencing with respect to time and other circuits is also correct. In this paper, we introduce new design tools for verifying dynamically reconfigurable logic. The tools extend the capabilities of the Dynamic Circuit Switching (DCS) CAD framework for dynamically reconfigurable logic. The verification capabilities include new design rule checks, design violation monitoring, and the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> analysis and performance profiling techniques to dynamically reconfigurable designs...|$|E
40|$|Some recent {{proposals}} to address Social Securityís financing shortfall have included an <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> to the 5 million uncovered {{state and local}} workers. These proposals spark a predictable outcry from Massachusetts public employees and those in other affected states. This Issue in Brief analyzes the arguments for and against mandating Social Security coverage for newly hired state and local workers.

The case for coverage rests on issues of equity and better protection for state and local workers. That is, mandatory coverage would better distribute the burden of paying for the systemís legacy debt and would improve benefits; it also would raise costs by about 6 percent of payrolls [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of optimal relay {{placement}} in cellular networks for maximum <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> the <b>coverage</b> area. We present a novel definition of the effective cell radius after introduction of relays in a cell. Using this we determine the optimal relay positions to maximize the cell radius, and estimate the number of relays required per cell. We also analyze relay placement in the multi-cell scenario, which takes into account inter-cell interference, a dominant factor in the next generation cellular Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems. Considering inter-cell interference from neighboring cells in the multicell scenario, leads to an interesting iterative algorithm which is used to determine the optimal RS positions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{emerging}} wireless relay networks (WRNs) {{are expected}} to provide significant improvement on throughput and <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> <b>coverage</b> area for next-generation wireless systems. We study an optimization problem for multi-hop link scheduling with bandwidth and delay guarantee over WRNs. Our optimization problem is investigated under a general interference model with a generic objective. The objective can be based on various kinds of performance indexes (e. g., throughput, fairness and capacity) determined by service providers. Through the theoretical analysis, the intractability and in-approximability of the optimization problem are shown. Due to the intractable computational complexity, we present efficient algorithms to practically provide a small approximation factor against any optimal solution even for a worst-case input. Furthermore, the experimental results indicate that our presented algorithms yield near-optimal performance in the average case. I...|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} source of conflict surrounding nuclear energy is that with a very small probability, a large-scale nuclear accident may occur. One way to internalize the associated financial risks is through mandating nuclear operators to have liability insurance.

Network effects are said to exist when an existing user of a network benefits from any new user to the network.

After the identification of network characteristics in telecommunications, the incentive to invite entry to an incumbent telecommunications firm is discussed. For the case of mobile tele-communications, the <b>extension</b> <b>of</b> network <b>coverage</b> is introduced as a potential means to commit to a large network size, influencing consumers' expectations. It turns out that with mobile telecommunications, increasing network coverage might even reinforce the incentive to welcome entrants. Telecommunications, network effects, market entry...|$|R
