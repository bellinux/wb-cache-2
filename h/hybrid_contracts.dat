40|$|There are {{two types}} of contracts. A {{different}} set of laws applies to each. The common law of contracts governs a contract for services. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) applies to the sale of goods. However, many construction contracts are a mix of both goods and services. This type of <b>contract</b> is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract.</b> When a claim is in litigation, the court applies either common law or the UCC to a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract.</b> The outcome of the case depends on whether the court interprets the contract as either predominately for services or for goods. This paper will highlight the major disparate rules applicable for each type of contract. It will also explain the different tests the court system uses to determine the contract type in dispute [...] a services contract or a goods contract.

40|$|We {{follow the}} recent {{literature}} on ex post adaptations in procurement {{and argue that}} highly volatile specifications result in multiple variations of fixed price (FP) and time and materials (T&M) contracts.

We argue that these hybrid mechanisms are particularly important in software development contracting, a new critical business capability involving frequent and costly ex post adaptations to specification change. The level of completeness in these contractual archetypes is hypothesized to be determined by contracting costs and benefits, where costs are related to project uncertainty and benefits are related to the likelihood of vendor opportunism. We test this hypothesis with a unique data set of 270 software development contracts entered into by a leading international bank. The analysis confirms the existence of multiple <b>hybrid</b> <b>contracts</b> that mitigate both price escalation and specification volatility.

40|$|We {{consider}} the coordination challenge with a risk-neutral manufacturer which supplies to multiple heterogeneou retailers. We {{find that the}} manufacturer can maximize its expected profit only if the expected profit of the supply chain is maximized, or equivalently supply chain coordination (SCC) is achieved. The target sales rebate (TSR) contract is commonly used in practice to achieve SCC. However, as we found in this paper, the presence of heterogeneity in retailers' minimum expected profit requirements is the major cause that a single TSR contract and the related single <b>hybrid</b> <b>contracts</b> all fail to achieve SCC and maximize the manufacturer's expected profit simultaneously. Thus, we develop an innovative menu of TSR contracts with fixed order quantity (TSR-FOQ). Although there are multiple contracts in a menu, {{we find that the}} manufacturer only needs to decide one basic TSR contract and two newly developed parameters termed as the risk-level indicator and the separation indicator, in applying the sophisticated menu of TSR-FOQ. By adjusting the two indicators, the manufacturer can control the profit variance of the retailers and the separations of the component contracts of the menu. We further propose another sophisticated menu of TSR with minimum order quantity and quantity discount contracts which can give each retailer a higher degree of freedom in the selection of order quantity.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a synthetic {{overview of the}} regulation of services under the law of contract in the United States and attempts {{to answer the question}} as to whether (and, if so, should) the rules of US contract law be utilized as part of the ongoing process of regulating specific parts of the Polish law of obligations. However, the analysis undertaken in this paper requires the author to make a few preliminary remarks. Firstly, there is no uniform law of contract in the United States. Private law in the US is governed in principle by state law, not federal law, which results in jurisdictional diversity between states. For this reason, the paper attempts to discuss only the major trends and solutions relating to service contracts, with the stipulation that the model examined in this article might be subject to significant exceptions in particular states or in other US jurisdictions. Secondly, contract for services, as opposed to contract for the sales of goods, is governed neither by the Uniform Commercial Code nor by any other separate regulation. Basically, under US contract law, a contract for services is covered by the common law of contracts. Therefore, the rules and principles applying to parties to service contracts, as described in this paper, are to be found by searching for them in uncodified sources of law. The first part of the paper examines the structure of the law of obligations with particular emphasis on the regulated types of contracts under US contract law. In this regard, the analysis is primarily based on the regulation of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). The second part of the paper addresses the scope of the application of Article 2 of UCC and deals with the question as to whether and to what extent “hybrid contracts” might be covered by Article 2. According to § 2 - 102 of Article 2 of UCC, the provisions of this Article apply to transactions in goods. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>contracts,</b> however, involve the obligation of the party both to sell the goods and to render the services. The dual nature of these transactions raises doubts as to which set of rules should apply to the rights and obligations of the parties (the choice being basically between the UCC rules and variety of common law rules). The author discusses the criteria, as developed by the courts, under which the courts determine the source of law for <b>hybrid</b> <b>contracts</b> in cases where a dispute between the parties arises. The third part of the paper is devoted to an analysis of various types of contracts under which the party is obliged to perform services. Within the analysis of the case law, the fundamental rules applicable to service contracts are outlined, in particular those that impose a standard on the performance of a contract and those rules that provide for the scope of the liability of the provider of services. The final part of the paper addresses a number of select issues referring to construction contracts.

40|$|Knowledge {{generation}} {{is considered to}} be a collective process which requires mobilisation of number of knowledge agents. There is open debate in the literature about the role of spatial proximity for the knowledge interactions. Are proximity or distance interactions crucial for the knowledge generation? At the same time the question of the modes of knowledge governance gains on importance. If the market based knowledge interactions among firms are risky, they will require high level of investments to secure them, transaction costs will be high. In this case, such exchanges take place outside the market in other non-market structures, in principle as hierarchies (e. g. within a firm) or as <b>hybrid</b> <b>contracts</b> (e. g. long-term contracts). Turbulent and uncertain technological, business and regulatory environment in post socialist economies sharply increases the knowledge transaction costs. Due to the discontinuity in the knowledge generation processes, the economic system is characterized by high transaction and interaction costs associated with searching for economically useful knowledge in the region. Collective generation of new technological knowledge based on local intensive network interactions in post-socialist countries is a risky business from this perspective. The lack of trust among people hampers the cooperation activities and indicates potential costs emerging with opportunistic behaviour. According the main principles of transaction cost theory hierarchical organisation dominate in the governance of the knowledge processes as they are more effective to solve potential conflicts. At the same, time closed communities with a certain level of trust engaged in collective knowledge processes, may be expected as well. The empirical part of the paper is based on the case study of territorial knowledge dynamics undertaken in the framework of FP 6 EURODITE research project. We are highlighting specific routes of knowledge processes in the IT sector in Bratislava region Slovakia.

The first several papers represent the digital economy and IT value themes by addressing issues that arise through the outsourcing and systems design for flexibility and integration in manufacturing plant and financial services business processes. They examine how IT-driven supply-chain integration affects organizational abilities to achieve manufacturing process flexibility and competitive cost control, why IT investments make it possible for manufacturing plants to effectively outsource processes, and the role that IT integration plays in supporting high-performance import–export trade services in international banking. The next three papers examine interesting new theoretical perspectives. One is how network effects should influence firm-level business strategy for offering different kinds of value-maximizing licensing arrangements for software products. Another tackles the role of software stacks and technological complementarities when technology firms acquire other technology firms, and what our expectations should be for the consequent creation of market value. A third assesses the strategic opportunities that exist for firms to hyperdifferentiate their products when it is possible for online reviews to enable the identification of uniquely valuable product characteristics among interested high-end consumers. The Special Section opens with a contribution to our knowledge of IT strategy in the manufacturing setting. The paper is entitled 2 ̆ 2 Information Technology, Production Process Outsourcing, and Manufacturing Plant Performance, 2 ̆ 2 by Indranil Bardhan, Jonathan Whitaker, and Sunil Mithas. In a cross-sectional survey study of manufacturing plants, their IT capabilities, and the choices they make with respect to production process outsourcing, the authors examine the role that IT and process outsourcing play in achieving high performance in terms of plant costs and quality. They report that higher levels of IT investments are associated with a greater propensity to outsource production processes, and suggest that the systems integration capabilities are critical for this to work well for the firms. Such outsourcing also appears to be associated with some benefits; the authors report that better cost controls for plant overhead and labor expenses also result, and that higher quality results at the plant level. They also note that when a plant’s strategy is quality focused, there is a greater likelihood that process outsourcing will be observed. The authors speculate that this approach can take advantage of the core competencies of their outsourcing vendors, whose own technology investments may do more to support high quality than would otherwise be possible for the manufacturing plant. Interestingly, there is no evidence in this research that plants outsource processes simply to reduce costs. This is consistent with what is known in other research about the high costs and significant risks associated with interfirm collaboration. Overall, this research challenges other authors to pick up where it leaves off, and to establish additional new knowledge for senior managers on the rationale for and the efficacy of process outsourcing. The second paper continues this emphasis on empirical research on IT value and manufacturing sector issues. Eric T. G. Wang, Jeffrey C. F. Tai, and Hsiao-Lan Wei present new research on 2 ̆ 2 A Virtual Integration Theory of Improved Supply-Chain Performance 2 ̆ 2 that also builds on our digital economy theme. The authors propose virtual integration as a governance mechanism for interorganizational interactions in supply-chain management, in lieu of other mechanisms. These include vertical integration, which is known to be inflexible in changing markets, and other forms of non-ownership-based collaboration, which may be more costly for the participants. They define virtual integration as the substitution of ownership with partnership by integrating a smaller set of suppliers through IT. They also argue that flexibility in supply-chain management is value-maximizing, and that virtual integration of buyer-supplier systems encourages the suppliers to be more responsive to the changing needs of the buyer. This study involves 149 responding firms in the automobile, chemical, computer and electronics, food, machine tool, metal, and textile industries. The authors find that although there was not a direct cost-reducing contribution for the manufacturer from virtual integration, the 2 ̆ 2 loose coupling 2 ̆ 2 with IT did yield benefits in terms of supplier responsiveness. The results were obtained through a structural equation model with path estimates that tested eight hypotheses. 	The third paper is on IT integration in trade services business processes in international banking. Prabu Davamanirajan, Robert J. Kauffman, Charles H. Kriebel, and Tridas Mukhopadhyay contributed 2 ̆ 2 Systems Design, Process Performance, and Economic Outcomes in International Banking. 2 ̆ 2 Their research uses the business process performance evaluation perspective for IT investments, and provides two different levels of analysis. One level is a process performance model that links system characteristics that impact business process outputs and performance quality. A second, more aggregate level of analysis is based on an economic performance model that enables senior managers to analyze the statistical connection between business process performance and the economic performance of the organization. The authors apply their modeling approach to the context of global trade services in international banking, where IT investments are made to effect systems integration to support letter of credit and lending management support. The authors’ data come from the American international banking community in New York City, during the 1990 s, where historically large investments in IT were made to support international financial services business processes. The primary findings of the research include evidence for increased labor productivity and decreased cycle time in the presence of increasing electronic initiation of letter of credit-related lending requests. The authors also report that integration between the trade services system and the general ledger system in global trade services had a beneficial impact by reducing cycle time. An additional contribution of this research is that it offers new ideas about how to analyze business process-level IT investments in the presence of sequentially independent and reciprocally independent processes, as well as processes that exhibit pooled interdependence and have many shared activities. 	The fourth paper in this Special Section examines technology value issues, and is by Lihui Lin and Nalin Kulatilaka. They study issues in the context of 2 ̆ 2 Network Effects and Technology Licensing with Fixed Fee, Royalty, and <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Contracts,</b> 2 ̆ 2 especially the appropriateness of fixed fees versus royalties, which the economics literature has suggested is value maximizing for firms that license their technologies. The authors show that the usual conclusion from economics may not hold when IT innovations lead to the creation of products and services that exhibit network externalities. This problem is complicated by concerns on the part of the innovator about whether it is appropriate to license technology to competitors (such as Microsoft making some of its operating systems innovations available to Apple Computer, so that it is possible for Apple to produce Microsoft-compatible computers). Lin and Kulatilaka offer answers about the key drivers that underlie effective decisions, including the strength of the network externalities, the potential size of the market in which licensing will occur, and the investment levels required to create a similar technological innovation. They also explore the implications of current practices that have increasingly focused on developing hybrid approaches relative to managerial decision making for network externality-driven technology licensing policy. 	The fifth paper in the Special Section is by Lucia Silva Gao and Bala Iyer. Their paper, 2 ̆ 2 Analyzing Comple­mentarities Using Software Stacks for Software Industry Acquisitions, 2 ̆ 2 offers a new theoretical perspective about why firms that are closer in distance across different layers of the software stack are likely to be perceived in the financial markets as more likely to produce value and profits due to the expected technological complementarities. Their perspective is based on the economic theory of complementarities, which emphasizes the value that complementary assets and processes can produce in proximity to one another. The authors examine a number of different empirical models that implement event study methods in order to determine whether cumulative abnormal returns on equity show up among software companies involved in mergers and acquisitions. Especially interesting in this research is that the authors are able to empirically tease out the relative strength that software stack proximity has between firms whose capabilities are brought together. Based on the authors’ findings, one might guess that there is an 2 ̆ 2 optimal 2 ̆ 2 software stack distance in mergers and acquisitions that will support the creation of maximum business value. The authors’ findings are especially relevant in network industries, including electronic products, computer and hardware technologies, and information and communication technologies, where the use of complementary components is necessary in the creation of their products. 	The closing paper of the Special Section focuses on a subject that will give good cheer to many readers of this journal: micro-brewery beer production. It also covers new theory in resonance marketing and the new possibilities for hyperdifferentiation in the digital economy. The authors, Eric K. Clemons, Guodong 2 ̆ 2 Gordon 2 ̆ 2 Gao, and Lorin M. Hitt, contributed 2 ̆ 2 When Online Reviews Meet Hyperdifferentiation: A Study of the Craft Beer Industry. 2 ̆ 2 The thrust of their research is to examine the capabilities that the Internet offers to support resonance marketing, which emphasizes the degree to which consumers are well informed so they can purchase the products and services that delight them. The role of online reviews in this context is to supply consumers with 2 ̆ 2 level-up 2 ̆ 2 knowledge of the products that interest them, so it becomes possible for producers to hyperdiffer­entiate and better monetize what they are selling. It turns out that the craft beer industry is a perfect setting to explore these firm strategy issues, because beer is hardly a necessity and the differences among beers only become discernible to consumers as they gain experience and knowledge of the characteristics of the different products that are available. The paper contributes new ideas for the measurement of product positioning using online ratings from RateBeer. com, a popular Internet-based consumer rating service. The authors’ empirical analysis shows the extent to which positive reviews drive the growth of demand for new craft beers, consistent with their views of how resonance marketing can make hyperdifferentiation an effective strategy.

Using data on 394 contracts from the information technology (IT) services industry, we show that T 2 ̆ 6 M contracts are preferred when the cost of measuring quality ex post is high and when it is difficult to estimate costs ex ante. We also find site-specific measures of relationship lead to a preference for tow-powered T 2 ̆ 6 M contracts...|$|R

40|$|An {{efficient}} agent-based flexible scheduling {{is built}} for real-world manufacturing systems in this paper. Considering the alternative processes and alternative machines, {{the allocation of}} manufacturing resources is achieved through negotiation among the job and machine agents in a multi-agent system (MAS). Ant Colony Intelligence (ACI) is proposed to be combined with Contract Net Protocol (CNP) {{so as to make}} agents adaptive to the changing circumstance. In the framework of CNP, the interactive bidding process is adopted. ACI is integrated into both machine agents and job agents to solve the task allocation and sequencing problem. CNP is introduced to allow the agents to cooperate and coordinate their local schedules in order to find globally near-optimal robust schedules. The negotiation protocol is an interactive bidding mechanism based on the <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract</b> net protocol. The implementation of the issues using CNP model is discussed. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm integrated with ant-inspired coordination...|$|R

The focus is on how KFHMB implement musharakah mutanaqisah concept for home financing product. This paper will discus on how this syariah concept run on Islamic home financing product, their advantages, issues and challenges that was face by KFHMB. This research also focuses on determining Musharakah Mutanaqisah itself. This research shows that home financing through musharakah mutanaqisah is a new product in Malaysia, offered from 2005 by KFHMB. Musharakah Mutanaqisah was a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract</b> and created by some element like ijarah, al-bay‘, musharakah. This research also shows that this respondent banks offer the product with their own style in certain part {{in the same time}} related with Malaysia buying and selling house tradition. This situation affected institutions from different background and how they run their product. This study also proposes how KFHMB solve the issues and challenges from product offering...|$|R

The impact of VC mechanisms (contracts and marketing cooperatives altogether in contrast to spot markets) in local food supply chains in developing countries especially in the Ethiopian context remains underexplored though the challenges in the traditional domestic markets in the African context are well studied (Dorward et al., 2006). Comparative studies on the impact of <b>hybrids,</b> <b>contracts</b> and marketing cooperatives viz. spot market transactions are scare. In this paper, we analyze the impact of participation of honey producers in the Northern highlands of Ethiopia in contracts and cooperatives on their performance and household income. We, thus contribute to {{the literature}} on VC by providing evidence from local food chains and provide insights that can inform governmental and development organizations on the realization of pro-poor growth through institutional innovations such as contracts and marketing cooperatives in supply chains in partnership with the private sector.|$|R
40|$|Banking {{institutions}} in Malaysia {{consists of two}} categories, the full-fledge Islamic banks and interest-free banking scheme. Banks offering Islamic products that are purely local and some from outside, such as Citibank (Malaysia). This research discuses the concept of Musharakah Mutanaqisah in Islamic transaction and its application in the home financing product at Citibank Malaysia Berhad. The research focuses on how does this syariah concept apply on Islamic home financing product, their advantages, issues and challenges that was faced by this institution. In order to achieve {{the objectives of the}} research, the researcher used the library and fields work methods to collect the data. The data collected was analyzed using the methods of inductive and deductive and comparative. This research shows that home financing through Musharakah Mutanaqisah is a new product, offered from 2005. Musharakah Mutanaqisah is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract</b> and created by some elements like ijarah, al-bay‘, Musharakah. Research finding also shows that the impact of the use of Musharakah Mutanaqisah instrument is better than previous contract like BBA. This indirectly explain to us how conventional banks like Citibank offers Islamic banking products through Windows Islamic Banking schemes. </p...|$|R

More precisely, we extend the stochastic contraction theorems (which were formulated for continuous systems) {{to the case}} of discrete and hybrid resetting systems. In particular, we show that the mean square distance between any two trajectories of a discrete (or <b>hybrid</b> resetting) <b>contracting</b> stochastic system is upper-bounded by a constant after exponential transients. Using these results, we study the synchronization of noisy nonlinear oscillators coupled by discrete noisy interactions. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} on the {{development}} of an agent-based approach for the dynamic integration of the process planning and scheduling functions. In consideration of the alternative processes and alternative machines for the production of each part, the actual selection of the schedule and allocation of manufacturing resources is achieved through negotiation among the part and machine agents which represent the parts and manufacturing resources, respectively. The agents are to negotiate on a fictitious cost with the adoption of a currency function. Two MAS architectures are evaluated in this paper. One is a simple MAS architecture comprises part agents and machine agents only; the other one involves the addition of a supervisor agent to establish a hybrid-based MAS architecture. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract</b> net protocol is developed in the paper to support both types of MAS architectures. This new negotiation protocol enables multi-task many-to-many negotiations, it also incorporates global control into the decentralized negotiation. Simulation runs are conducted to compare the performance of the proposed MAS-based IPPS approaches and that of an evolutionary algorithm. It also shows that the hybrid-based MAS, with the introduction of supervisory control, is able to provide integrated process plan and job shop scheduling solutions with a better global performance. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We {{examine a}} model of supply chain {{contracting}} with a purchaser that desires to acquire {{as much of a}} product as possible at as low a price as possible. The supplier in our model has private information about its limited capacity. We compare two models of information. In the first, the supplier observes capacity and reports the capacity to the purchaser in exchange for a purchase commitment. We designate this contract as the “Supply Chain ” contract. In the second, the purchaser is directly linked to the supplier’s ERP system using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). This linkage avoids information asymmetry. We refer to this contract as the “Full Information ” contract. While the Full Information contract is economically more efficient, the supplier would be reticent to agree to this contract. We propose a third contract, which we call the “Hybrid ” contract, that awards the purchaser the efficiency gains available in the Full Information contract, but which provides the supplier the same profits as in the Supply Chain contract. The purchaser, however, would still prefer the Full Information <b>contract</b> to the <b>Hybrid</b> <b>contract.</b> We then add an additional dimension to the problem by allowing the supplier to invest in capacity. We find that due to the increased investment under the Hybri...|$|R

The model implies that if population density is on an upward trajectory, rises in population and in incomes increasingly generate price response and diminishing rises in the stock of housing. This has implications for the optimal structure of housing finance. It makes equiy financing of home purchase more desirable. The properties of <b>hybrid</b> debt-equity <b>contracts</b> for financing house purchase are explored...|$|R
40|$|Islamic {{banking and}} finance {{movement}} {{has now become}} mainstream with participation and competition from the leading,conventional banks. In Indonesia, majority of Islamic banking products is dominated by murâbahah. As the green-contract, murâbahahalso has many shortcomings to be implemented in Islamic banking. It has potential deficiency for both customers and banks point of view. Alternatively, Musyaraka Mutanaqisa has several benefits that are not carried by murabaha. These advantages moreover can make Islamic banking productsto be competitive and attractive towards on-going dual banking system as being implemented in the most countries. This current modified contract can be an interesting alternative to murabahah especially for financing on real aset such as property. In other hand, there are some issues in musyaraka mutanaqisa that should be revealed and educated to customers and banks to make this late product properly practiced. Some issues on the other hand, in this paper, the authors emphasized to classify into property indent financing, buying debts on debts, take over financing, taxations, annuity on profit distribution and the rest normative laws regarding with this <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract.</b> Overall,in ter m of compliancy of this product,it must be in line with sharia rules and regulations. The paper concludes that Musyaraka Mutanaqisa can be practiced more widely as an alternative financing of murabahah which has been dominant applied to date by Islamic banking in Indonesia...|$|R
