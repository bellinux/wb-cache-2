5|$|In the skull, {{it has a}} {{significantly}} longer rostrum (the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the skull) and diastema (the gap between the incisors and the molars). Furthermore, it has shorter molar rows in both {{the upper and lower}} jaws. The back end of the incisive foramina (openings in the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the palate), which is located in front of the first molars, is rounded in eastern voalavo, but angular in northern voalavo. The sutures of the maxillary and palatine bones (the line where the two bones, part of the skull, join) are straight and parallel to each other, the toothrows, and the midline of the skull in eastern voalavo. Northern voalavo, in contrast, are more curved. Statistical analysis of measurements of the skull and teeth clearly separates the two species of Voalavo.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (<b>front</b> <b>part)</b> is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, {{but there is}} considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the horizontal plane) to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E

5|$|The rostrum (<b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the skull) {{is short}} and blunt in both M.macpheei and M.brevicaudata, {{contrasting}} with the condition in other Microgale, but the rostrum of M.brevicaudata is distinctly more tapered at the front, whereas that of M.macpheei is more blunt at the front. Unlike other Microgale, M.brevicaudata and M.macpheei lack gaps (diastemata) between the premolars. M.macpheei had larger, more robust teeth than M.brevicaudata. In both species, the mesiostyle and distostyle, two crests, on the fourth premolar (P4) and the molars are reduced relative to the condition in other Microgale. M.macpheei lacks {{an extension of the}} protocone cusp on the lingual (inner) side of the third upper premolar (P3) and P4, present in M.brevicaudata, and has the paracone cusp on P4 less well-developed. On the other hand, the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the ectostyle crest on P4 is larger. The relative lengths of some of the crests on the two last molars also differ between the two species.|$|E
5|$|The skull shows a short <b>front</b> <b>part</b> (rostrum) {{and a broad}} interorbital region (located {{between the}} eyes). The roof of the braincase is marked by supraorbital shelves. The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the palate, are very broad and extend between the first molars. The zygomatic plates, the flattened anterior portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are expansive and show well-developed notches at their front ends. The palate itself is flat and ends a little behind the third molars. The posterolateral palatal pits, located near the third molars, are well developed. The mesopterygoid fossa, the opening behind {{the end of the}} palate, is rounded at the frond and broad. An extension of the alisphenoid bone known as the alisphenoid strut is usually present, separating two foramina (openings), the foramen ovale accessorium and the masticatory-buccinator foramen. The roof of the tympanic cavity, the tegmen tympani, is small.|$|E

5|$|The skull, {{which is}} short at the front, shows some typical oryzomyine characters. The palate is long, {{extending}} past the molars and the maxillary bones. The alisphenoid strut, {{which in some}} sigmodontines separates two foramina (openings) in the skull, is absent. The squamosal bone lacks a suspensory process contacting the tegmen tympani, the roof the tympanic cavity. The <b>front</b> <b>part</b> is short.|$|E

5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they have been seen hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E

5|$|Gunshot wounds are the commonest form of {{penetrating}} {{trauma that}} cause TBI. Less commonly, knife wounds and shrapnel from motor vehicle accidents can also penetrate the airways. Most injuries to the trachea {{occur in the}} neck, because the airways within the chest are deep and therefore well protected; however, up to a quarter of TBI resulting from penetrating trauma occurs within the chest. Injury to the cervical trachea usually affects the anterior (<b>front)</b> <b>part</b> of the trachea.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism, {{also called}} underactive thyroid or low thyroid, {{is a common}} {{disorder}} of the endocrine {{system in which the}} thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the <b>front</b> <b>part</b> (rostrum) is large, {{but not as}} long as in A.budini. The skull is {{more robust}} than in the very similar Akodon boliviensis, but less so than in A.simulator. The hourglass-shaped interorbital region (between the eyes) is {{narrower}} than in A.caenosus and not as squared as in A.polopi. Members of the Akodon varius group, with which Akodon oenos was formerly associated, tend to have much broader interorbital regions. The braincase is somewhat inflated and bears well-developed temporal and lambdoid crests relative to the situation in A.caenosus; Akodon polopi has even better developed crests.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (<b>front</b> <b>part)</b> is {{relatively}} long and line-shaped. The central groove in the nasal depression {{is relatively}} narrow.

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (<b>front</b> <b>part)</b> is {{relatively}} long. The nasal and premaxillary bones extend {{in front of}} the incisors, forming a rostral tube, which is shared among oryzomyines only with Handleyomys. The zygomatic notch (a notch formed by a projection {{at the front of the}} zygomatic plate, a bony plate at the side of the skull) is shallow. The interorbital region (between the eyes) is narrow and long, with the narrowest part towards the front. The crests on the braincase and interorbital region are weakly developed. Eremoryzomys has larger crests on its interorbital region.|$|E
5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (<b>front</b> <b>part)</b> is rounded.

Further back on the braincase, the lambdoid crest (another such crest) is also prominent. The middle part of the palate is concave, as in M.brachytragos and M.mahafaliensis, but unlike in M.aelleni and M.manavi, which have a flat palate. At the palate's back margin is a long, robust posterior palatal spine.|$|E
