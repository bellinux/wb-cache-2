5|$|The {{media has}} {{historically}} come under {{varying degrees of}} pressure over time to censor their criticism of the government. Reporters are occasionally threatened or harassed and media outlets are periodically forced to close. Accusations of media censorship have increased since 2009 due to the alleged intensification of restrictions on political criticism. Access to the internet has grown <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the past decade, with an estimated 352,000 residents of Madagascar accessing the internet from home or {{in one of the}} nation's many internet cafés in December 2011.|$|E
5|$|Lara's backstory {{has changed}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> {{the course of}} the series. During the first era, game manuals {{describe}} the character as the Wimbledon, London-born daughter of Lord Henshingly Croft (Lord Richard Croft in Legend and its sequels). She was raised as an aristocrat and betrothed to the fictitious Earl of Farringdon. Lara attended the Scottish boarding school Gordonstoun and a Swiss finishing school. At the age of twenty-one, she survived a plane crash, which left her stranded in the Himalayas for two weeks; the experience spurred her to shun her former life and seek other adventures around the world. Croft published books and other written works based on her exploits as a mercenary, big-game hunter, and master thief.|$|E

5|$|Physiologists such as Claude Bernard {{explored}} (through vivisection {{and other}} experimental methods) {{the chemical and}} physical functions of living bodies to an unprecedented degree, {{laying the groundwork for}} endocrinology (a field that developed quickly after the discovery of the first hormone, secretin, in 1902), biomechanics, and the study of nutrition and digestion. The importance and diversity of experimental physiology methods, within both medicine and biology, grew <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> {{the second half of the}} 19th century. The control and manipulation of life processes became a central concern, and experiment was placed at the center of biological education.|$|E

25|$|While the {{offshore}} wind industry has grown <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> {{the last several}} decades, especially in Europe, {{there is still a}} great deal of uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment.|$|E
50|$|The {{delinquency}} rate on jumbo loans rose <b>dramatically,</b> tripling <b>over</b> {{the course}} of 2009, and by February 2010, almost one in ten jumbo mortgages were 'seriously delinquent' (i.e. in arrears by at least 60 days).|$|R
50|$|Agriculture in Dilhorne still plays a {{large part}} in the village, {{but the number of}} farms and workers has <b>dramatically</b> {{decreased}} <b>over</b> the years. The main concern of agriculture around the Dilhorne area is dairy farming.|$|R
40|$|China's urban {{geography}} has been <b>dramatically</b> altered <b>over</b> {{the past three}} decades.

25|$|Canada {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{agricultural}} producers and exporters in the world. As with other developed nations, the proportion of the population and GDP devoted to agriculture fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the 20th century but it remains an important element of the Canadian economy.|$|E
25|$|Aquaculture, an {{industry}} that has emerged only in recent decades, {{has become one of the}} fastest growing sectors of the world food economy. Aquaculture already supplies more than half of the world’s demand for fish. This percentage is predicted to increase <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the next few decades.|$|E
50|$|Some {{passenger}} trains, both {{long distance}} and short distance, may use bi-level (double-decker) cars to carry more passengers per train. Car {{design and the}} general safety of passenger trains have <b>dramatically</b> evolved <b>over</b> time, making travel by rail remarkably safe.|$|R
50|$|Ultra-long {{distance}} swimming {{is sometimes}} referred to as marathon swimming. The minimum distance that constitutes a marathon swim has <b>dramatically</b> shortened <b>over</b> time. Different organizations adopt various minimum distances. The swimming marathon events at the Olympic games have a distance of 10 km.|$|R
50|$|The landscapes vary greatly. In the George River valley, {{there are}} forests of spruce and larch, and even birch and balsam poplar, {{which are usually}} present at lower latitudes. The park protects the George River caribou herd, whose {{population}} has <b>dramatically</b> decreased <b>over</b> recent decades.|$|R
25|$|While {{the number}} of Non-governmental Organization have {{increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the past few decades, fragmentation in aid policy is an issue. Because of such fragmentation, health workers in several African countries, for example, say they are so busy meeting western delegates that they can only do their proper jobs in the evening.|$|E
25|$|War and {{colonisation}} {{during the}} 16th and 17th centuries brought Ireland securely under English control. However, {{this was at}} a cost of great resentment over land ownership and inequitable laws. This resulted in Gaelic ties between Scotland and Ireland withering <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the course of the 17th century, including a divergence in the Gaelic language into two distinct languages.|$|E
25|$|Eyemouth is not {{far from}} the small villages of Ayton, Reston, St. Abbs, Coldingham and Burnmouth. The coast offers {{opportunities}} for birdwatching, walking, fishing and diving. Accommodation includes several hotels, B and a holiday park.

25|$|The {{notion of}} how dances {{were to be}} {{executed}} changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the years. For instance, doing an early-20th-century-style Sword Dance in a competition today would get a dancer disqualified nearly immediately. There used to be terrible confusion as to what would be allowed (or prescribed) where, until the SOBHD {{came up with a}} standard that has become acceptable to the majority of competitive dancers.|$|E
25|$|Volkswagens {{were first}} {{exhibited}} {{and sold in}} the United States in 1949, but sold only two units in America that first year. On entry to the U.S. market, the VW was briefly sold as a Victory Wagon. Volkswagen of America was formed in April 1955 to standardise sales and service in the United States. Production of the Type 1 Volkswagen Beetle increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> the years, the total reaching one million in 1955.|$|E
25|$|Computational {{capacity}} {{has increased}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>over</b> {{the last decade}} making possible the use of more sophisticated and computationally intensive methods in computer-assisted drug design. However, dealing with receptor flexibility in docking methodologies is still a thorny issue. The main reason behind this difficulty is {{the large number of}} degrees of freedom that have to be considered in this kind of calculations. Neglecting it, however, leads to poor docking results in terms of binding pose prediction.|$|E
30|$|The {{number of}} new cases has <b>dramatically</b> {{increased}} <b>over</b> the past years because of the better recognition of this condition. The natural evolution is variable but the spontaneous prognosis is severe. A good knowledge of its specific imaging features seems to be crucial for early management and improved prognosis.|$|R
50|$|Human {{deaths from}} rabies have {{decreased}} <b>dramatically</b> from <b>over</b> 100 {{per year in}} the early 20th century to one or two annually in the 1990s. Many of the recent deaths that have occurred were due to exposure outside the United States. In 2013 three human rabies cases were reported.|$|R
50|$|R. smithii {{was widely}} {{distributed}} in small ponds, reservoirs, and creeks in Kyushu {{and the western}} part of Japan. However, since the rosy bitterling was introduced, their population has been increasing <b>dramatically</b> all <b>over</b> Japan. These two species coexist in many areas, and hybridization tends to occur easily.|$|R
