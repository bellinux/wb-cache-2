50|$|With her {{background}} as a goldsmith, we can imagine that Walker could easily engage with the values and aesthetics of “doing something well.” However, <b>deskilling</b> {{and the use of}} readymades shift the value of the work away from craftsmanship—even though that is important as well—toward an artistic sensibility.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deskilling</b> is {{the process}} by which skilled labor within an {{industry}} or economy is eliminated by the introduction of technologies operated by semiskilled or unskilled workers.

5000|$|In an {{application}} to the arts, Benjamin Buchloh defines <b>deskilling</b> as [...] "a concept of considerable importance in describing numerous artistic endeavors throughout the twentieth century with relative precision. All of these are linked in their persistent effort to eliminate artisanal competence {{and other forms of}} manual virtuosity from the horizon of both artist competence and aesthetic valuation."1 ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Deskilling</b> {{can also}} refer to {{individual}} workers specifically. The term {{refers to a}} person becoming less proficient over time. Examples of how this can occur include changes in one's job definition, moving to a completely different field, chronic underemployment (e.g. working as cashier instead of accountant), and being out of the workforce for {{extended periods of time}} (e.g. quitting a position in order to focus exclusively on child-rearing).|$|E
50|$|One {{branch of}} {{industrial}} sociology is Labor process theory (LPT). In 1974, Harry Braverman wrote Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century, which provided a {{critical analysis of}} scientific management. This book analyzed capitalist productive relations from a Marxist perspective. Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organisations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to <b>deskilling</b> and routinisation of the worker. The Taylorist work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue with}} {{temporary}} migrants is the limited mobility afforded to them {{within the confines}} of their stipulated contracts. What sets the LCP apart from other Temporary Foreign Worker Programs is that applicants are required to have Grade 12 education as well as domestic service training. Research has even found {{that a large number of}} those applying through the LCP program have had university-level education, and training as registered nurses from their origin countries. However, due to the live-in requirement and the length of the LCP contract, <b>deskilling</b> occurs, wherein educational qualifications and training once held by immigrants prior to entering the program are not utilized or developed. This leads to downward occupational mobility as re-entry into the labour market with a skilled position becomes difficult upon the end of the contract, and once permanent residency is achieved.|$|E
50|$|As {{capitalist}} {{industry has}} become more productive, with automation and other outcomes of the scientific-technical revolution, the need for productive laborers has decreased proportionally in comparison with that of unproductive laborers. Marx had said {{that to be a}} productive laborer was a misfortune while one was fortunate to be an unproductive worker. But since unproductive labor has now become subject to the same degree of <b>deskilling</b> and alienation as productive labor, Braverman makes the statement that simply “to be a wage-worker is a misfortune,” implying that it is a misfortune to be a productive or unproductive worker. The final conclusion of this chapter is that unproductive capitalist labor grows {{as a result of the}} increased productivity of productive labor; and the increased productivity is caused by a decrease in proportion of the amount of productive labor compared to the proportion of unproductive labor.|$|E

Half of the workers in the four Lawrence mills of the American Woolen Company, the leading employer in the industry and the town, were females between the ages of 14 and 18.By 1912, the Lawrence mills at maximum capacity employed about 32,000 men, women, and children. Conditions had grown even worse for workers in the decade before the strike. The introduction of the two-loom system in the woolen mills led to a dramatic speedup in the pace of work. The increase in production enabled the factory owners to lay off large numbers of workers. Those who kept their jobs earned, on average, $8.76 for 56 hours of work.|$|E
50|$|To Braverman, {{the proponents}} of {{capitalist}} methods of management have gradually realized the necessity to mask the degradation of skill in capitalist modes of production. During the initial implementations of Scientific Management, Taylor and others were more straightforward in their alienation and <b>deskilling</b> of workers, but recently have used more confusing methods to cover these mistreatments. One example is the addition to the already existing list of skill levels “unskilled” and “skilled,” the level “semi-skilled”. The criterion for a job that required a worker to be “semi-skilled” involved such operations as machine tending, machine feeding, machine operating - usually just operations with a connection to machinery. The scientific-technical revolution seemingly brought in an “upgrading” of skills. The 1968-1969 edition of the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Outlook Handbook described the requirements of a semi-skilled worker to include having normal physical characteristics of a person in fair health, being able to learn their duties {{in as little as}} a day and as long as a few months, being supervised closely, and repeating the same motions or jobs throughout a day of work. To Braverman this {{could just as easily have}} been a description of the requirements for an “unskilled” job.|$|E

50|$|A 2008 {{survey found}} that 86% of Nigerian {{respondents}} had been employed before migration to Ireland, while just 8% were full-time students. 27% had been self-employed, a much higher rate than other migrant groups surveyed. 25% had worked as managers and executives, 11% in business and commerce, 17% in local or central governments, 12% in health-related occupations, and 5% in personal services. Only 16% had a job offer in Ireland prior to arrival, about double the rate of Chinese respondents, but {{less than a third}} the rate of Indian or Lithuanian respondents. They are more likely than the other groups surveyed to find their employment through newspaper advertisements, rather than the internet or friends and family. About half of the survey respondents were employed {{at the time of the}} survey, with another 16% of men and 13% of women looking for work. Many work in personal services and childcare (positions such as care assistants, security guards, waiters, or hotel staff). This marked a significant shift from their previous pattern of employment in their home country, and has been interpreted as evidence of <b>deskilling.</b> About half of Nigerian men and two-thirds of Nigerian women feel that their qualifications are fully recognised in their main job. Compared to other groups they have an intermediate level of income (majority reporting between €14,401 and €31,720). Fewer than 2% are employed in predominantly Irish working environments.|$|E
50|$|Action {{research}} in the workplace took its initial inspiration from Lewin's work on organizational development (and Dewey's emphasis on learning from experience). Lewin's seminal contribution involves a flexible, scientific approach to planned change that proceeds through a spiral of steps, {{each of which is}} composed of 'a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action', towards an organizational 'climate' of democratic leadership and responsible participation that promotes critical self-inquiry and collaborative work. These steps inform Lewin's work with basic skill training groups, T-groups where community leaders and group facilitators use feedback, problem solving, role play and cognitive aids (lectures, handouts, film) to gain insights into themselves, others and groups with a view to 'unfreezing' and changing their mindsets, attitudes and behaviours.Lewin's understanding of action-research coincides with key ideas and practices developed at the influential Tavistock Institute (created in 1947)) in the UK and National Training Laboratories (NTL) in the US. An important offshoot of Tavistock thinking and practise is the sociotechnical systems perspective on workplace dynamics, guided by the idea that greater productivity or efficiency does not hinge on improved technology alone. Improvements in organizational life call instead for the interaction and 'joint optimization' of the social and technical components of workplace activity. In this perspective, the best match between the social and technical factors of organized work lies in principles of 'responsible group autonomy' and industrial democracy, as opposed to <b>deskilling</b> and top-down bureaucracy guided by Taylor's scientific management and linear chain of command.|$|E
5000|$|The British {{were selling}} very high cost cloths to the Indians. The Indian Mill owners wanted to monopolise the Indian market themselves. Ever since the American Civil War had caused a {{shortage}} of American cotton, Britain would buy cotton from India at cheap prices and use the cotton to manufacture cloth. The khadi movement by Gandhi aimed at boycotting foreign cloth [...] Mahatma Gandhi began promoting the spinning of khadi for rural self-employment and self-reliance (instead of using cloth manufactured industrially in Britain) in the 1920s in India, thus making khadi an integral part and an icon of the Swadeshi movement. The freedom struggle revolved around the use of khādī fabrics and the dumping of foreign-made clothes. When some people complained about the costliness of khadi to Mahatma Gandhi, he started wearing only dhoti though, of course, he used wool shawls when it got cold. Some {{were able to make}} a reasonable living by using high quality mill yarn and catering to the luxury market. Mahatma Gandhi tried {{to put an end to}} this practice. He even threatened to give up khadi altogether if he didn't get his way. However, since the weavers would have starved if they listened to Gandhi, nothing came of this threat.After Independence, the Government reserved some types of textile production- e.g. towel manufacture- for the handloom sector. This resulted in a <b>deskilling</b> of traditional weavers and a boost for the power-loom sector which was supposed to be a cottage industry. Private Sector enterprises have been able to make handloom weaving somewhat remunerative. Mahatma Gandhi's khadi program- despite huge subsidies- failed to do so. This does not prevent various state governments and the Government of India periodically appealing to citizens to promote the usage of Khadi.|$|E
5000|$|The term “Digital Taylorism” is multi-faceted and {{directly}} related to Taylorism. Therefore, due to some unfavorable perceptions of Taylorism, Digital Taylorism has some criticisms as well. For example, Taylorism is infamous for meaningless work because employees are simply treated as machines. This may be shown in the <b>deskilling</b> of workers, though {{this is not always}} the case. Also, standards may be enforced much more strictly due to the technological advancements. This may be found in more stringent adherence of relaxation and meal breaks, reduced systemic overtime, and an increase in direct supervision. In turn, these leads to much more work measurement. It is the opposite of what kinds of work environments that many organizations are currently adjusting to. Digital Taylorism is criticized for giving management an extreme form of domination, therefore leading to repression in some circumstances. Every motion can be potentially watched, studied, and controlled by the boss. Already, 80% of the corporations in America have their employees under regular surveillance and this number is growing. For instance, in fields such as education, teachers may feel that the methods determined by the administration to standardize classes is because they are not capable of doing so themselves. Students may be seen as the goods being produced, therefore losing the personal characteristics of classroom interactions and learning. This has the potential to disempower and/or deskill the teachers. Digital Taylorism can be seen in standardized testing, which is a common across America. [...] Digital Taylorism also has its limitations. Based on Taylorism, most research concerning Digital Taylorism is simply based on time and motion studies to reveal improvement, rather that employee satisfaction. The results measured only involve quantitative methodologies. Though quantitative research is essential, it is not sufficient for providing the answers to questions concerning usability for example. Additionally, Digital Taylorism may be seen as overstepping its place for management. These new technologies may be crossing the line by intervening before anything results in significant industrial disputation. Instead, organizations are disciplining workers who simply do not meet the quota or standards.|$|E
5000|$|On Sunday, June 27, 1993, A.E Staley {{officials}} {{decided to}} lock out A.E Staley employees who {{were members of}} the Allied Industrial Workers of America Union. [...] The lockout incident was the result of nearly a decade of labor disputes between management and Staley’s unionized workers. The decline in pay and wages began in 1985 when A.E. Staley merged with Continental Foods, forming Staley Continental. During the next three years, the union was forced to make concessions as management was concerned about the plant remaining viable. Base pay was frozen at $10.80 per hour and workers complained of long overtime hours and declining safety conditions. After London based Tate & Lyle bought A.E. Staley in 1988, conditions got worse for the factory workers. In 1989, contract negotiations began for a new three-year contract. While the bargaining committee was hoping to end the salary freeze and improving safety standards, the company was ushering in new practices, such as rotating shifts and <b>deskilling</b> of jobs as well as elimination of many safety procedures. In 1991, the company hired a new labor relations director who was known for promoting union busting practices. Workers with years and decades of experience at the plant were fired and new supervisors forced workers to ignore OSHA regulations. A new attendance policy was also instituted and workers were shocked to find out that anyone with over seven absences per year would be fired and the number of allowed absences would decrease every year. A few months later, company management announced a new set of offences that were grounds for immediate termination. This list included “smoking outside of designated areas; loafing; dishonesty; sleeping on duty; insubordination; refusal to work overtime as directed; unauthorized possession of a camera; and use of abusive or threatening language.” This was a gross violation of the union contract, which states that employers cannot fire employees without having the “just cause” to do so. Due to this new regulation, more workers were fired during the next year than had been fired in the previous twenty years combined.|$|E

40|$|National audienceIn {{this paper}} {{a case study}} of an open source, home-built 3 D printer called 'Rep-rap' serves as an entry point to the <b>deskilling</b> debate. This debate has centred on Harry Braverman's {{proposition}} that <b>deskilling</b> is a general trend, given the prevalence of capitalist relations of production, or, differently put, contractual employment relations. The origins of 3 D printing {{can be traced back to}} numerically controlled (NC) and computerised numerically-controlled (CNC) machinery and can even be seen to incorporate 'material traces' of these. Both technologies are based on the same principle: guiding a machine tool with the help of software.

40|$|Summary: This paper {{considers}} {{the experience of}} a small cohort of agency care managers 1 (N = 23) {{in the context of the}} ongoing debate about the <b>deskilling</b> of social work. Evidence is presented and discussed in relation to post-war studies of the labour process and asks whether Braverman’s proposition that <b>deskilling</b> is an inevitable outcome of capitalism’s labour process has any relevance in explaining whether agency social workers are ‘white-collar proletarians ’ or not. • Findings: The article identifies that there have been important changes to the social work labour process, including the regimes of care/case management and the subsequent intensification of employee workloads and <b>deskilling</b> (particularly for agency workers). However, for agency workers there are important processes that have stood to contain the full impact of proletarianization. • Applications: The evidence provided suggests that 1) social work is still experiencing significant forces of change which continue to extend the process of proletarianization; 2) the expansion of the private sector in social care and the continuing reliance upon agency care managers remain but two examples of such detrimental change for both social work and service users/carers; and 3) without resistance <b>deskilling</b> and marginalization are likely to continue.

40|$|Traditional {{immigration}} {{countries such}} as United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand give preference to migrants with higher education, skills, and professional training that they can transfer to their countries. However, {{it is not unusual}} for migrant professionals, especially those from less developed countries, to experience 'deskilling' or occupational downward mobility. Though admitted as professionals based on the immigration policies of the destination countries, many of them are relegated to lower status and lower paying jobs, owing to the nonrecognition of their foreign credentials and the bias for education acquired in the host country or in academic institutions in developed countries, local experience, cultural know-how, and English proficiency. Their foreign credentials and skills often fail to provide the expected occupational rewards and professional development gains which have been a significant part of their motivation to migrate overseas, especially to more developed countries. <b>Deskilling</b> may be viewed in several ways: as a host country's way of filling up labor scarcities in the secondary market by exploiting cheap enclave labor, as a transitional phase for migrants to adjust to the 'standards' of the host country, or as a form of institutionalized discrimination. This paper reviews the <b>deskilling</b> phenomenon to highlight its deleterious effects on migrants' welfare. Some theoretical explanations of <b>deskilling</b> are also examined.
