A hysterical soldier is carried out of the object, claiming to have seen a dwarf-like apparition walk through the wall of the artefact, a description that matches a 1927 newspaper account of a ghost.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{theme of}} the song puts me {{in the mind of}} a hit from R group Bell Biv Devoe circa 1990 that was also titled Poison, but doesn't fair the {{potential}} to be a number one song like it did close to 20 years ago. Even though the song doesn't seem like it would be a chart topper it does seem album worthy. It's something most can relate to if you've ever been in a relationship. Beyonce sings about a failed relationship that's no good, but yet <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to walk away from and ends up being just like Poison.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason it}} <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to have {{statistics}} for female-assigned cross-dressers {{is that the}} line where cross-dressing stops and cross-dressing begins has become blurred, whereas the same line for men is as well defined as ever. This {{is one of the}} many issues being addressed by third wave feminism as well as the modern-day masculist movement.|$|E

500|$|The Historian {{has been}} {{described}} as a combination of genres, including Gothic novel, adventure novel, detective fiction, travelogue, postmodern historical novel, epistolary epic, and historical thriller. Kostova was intent on writing a serious work of literature and saw herself as an inheritor of the Victorian style. Although based in part on Bram Stoker's Dracula, The Historian is not a horror novel, but rather an eerie tale. It is concerned with history's role in society and representation in books, as well as the nature of good and evil. As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is a metaphor for the evil that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to undo in history." [...] The evils brought about by religious conflict are a particular theme, and the novel explores the relationship between the Christian West and the Islamic East.|$|E
500|$|As Kostova explains, [...] "Dracula is {{a metaphor}} for the evil that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> to undo in history." [...] For example, he is shown {{influencing}} Eastern European tyrants and supporting national socialism in Transylvania. He is [...] "vainglorious, vindictive, [...] vicious". As Michael Dirda explains in The Washington Post, the novel conveys the idea that [...] "Most of history's worst nightmares result from an unthinking obedience to authority, high-minded zealotry seductively overriding our mere humanity." [...] It is in the figure of the vampire that Kostova reveals this, since [...] "our fear of Dracula lies in the fear of losing ourselves, of relinquishing our very identities as human beings". In fact, the narrator is never named in the novel, suggesting, as one critic explains, [...] "that the quest for the dark side of human nature is more universal than specific to a concrete character".|$|E

500|$|In {{the last}} years of her life, Vulović lived on a pension of €300 per month in her {{dilapidated}} Belgrade apartment. [...] "I don't know know what to say when people say I was lucky... life <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> today," [...] she remarked. Vulović said she was [...] "tired" [...] of discussing her fall. She only occasionally granted interviews and declined numerous requests, most notably from Oprah Winfrey and the BBC. Vulović's deteriorating health prevented her from taking part in annual commemorations at Srbská Kamenice, which she had previously attended for many years. In December 2016, Vulović's friends became concerned for her well-being after she abruptly stopped answering her telephone. On 23 December, locksmiths discovered Vulović's lifeless body in her apartment after forcing open the door. Vulović's friends said that she had struggled with heart ailments in the years leading up to her death. She was buried in Belgrade's New Cemetery on 27 December.|$|E
500|$|Davidson {{described}} the event as [...] "strange" [...] {{and stated that}} he had the pace to take the victory and had luck to his advantage while other competitors had problems: [...] "I had everything crossed but it wasn’t meant to be today. That’s racing I suppose but it sure does hurt sometimes.” After finishing in 26th, Webber said it had been an tough event for his team and revealed that they were confident that they could have battled for the victory had his car not sustained two punctured tyres: [...] "It just goes to show how hard endurance racing can be. We’re all right on the limit and as we’ve seen here that’s causing quite a high rate of attrition. Third time lucky at Le Mans is the plan." [...] Mücke stated that he felt okay after his heavy crash and thanked his team for constructing a safe vehicle. The {{chief executive officer of the}} World Endurance Championship Gerard Neveu {{described the}} event as [...] "a great day for motorsport" [...] but felt that it was slightly strange. He revealed that after the race, he had organised a meeting with several people and raised the question of why [...] "there was so much aggression and action in Spa. It's quite simple: the cars are all so close together, the competition <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> as never before. It can happen at any time - that is exciting...".|$|E
500|$|On game night, coach Taylor gives a {{pep talk}} where he warns the players against taking the opponents – Westerby High School – too lightly. They say their {{rallying}} cry, [...] "Clear Eyes, Full Hearts, Can't Lose!" [...] and enter the field. The first half is problematic for the Panthers, {{and at the end}} of the second half, the visitors make a potentially game-winning interception. Street is the only one left to make a tackle. He succeeds, but the tackle <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> that he remains prone on the ground. The crowd is left in silence as the starting quarterback does not move, and has to be taken off on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance. Coach Taylor now has to put in the highly unprepared Saracen, who initially makes several silly mistakes. The coach tells him to relax and focus, and Saracen manages to connect with Smash, who scores a touchdown. Riggins recovers the ensuing onside kick for the Panthers. In the final seconds of the game, Saracen throws a long pass to a receiver, who makes it to the end zone for another touchdown. As the Panthers win the game, both teams gather at mid-field to pray for Jason Street. Team members then head over to the hospital, where Street's condition is still unclear. Riggins and Smash reconcile, while Julie tries to comfort Lyla. In a voice-over, coach Taylor is heard saying that [...] "We are all vulnerable, and we will all at some point in our lives fall." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mishna (Shabbat 7:2) lists plowing after planting, {{although}} one must plow a field before planting. The Gemara asks why this order occurs and answers {{that the author}} of this Mishna was a Tanna living in Israel, where the ground is hard. Since the ground <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>hard</b> in Israel, it needed to be plowed both before planting and after planting. The Mishna lists plowing second, teaching that the second plowing (after planting) is [...] prohibited. (The plowing before the planting is also prohibited, if not by the Torah, certainly Rabbinically). The Rambam lists plowing first, and planting second.|$|E
