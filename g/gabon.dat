5|$|Despite a rivalry, Aubame and M'ba, now the President of <b>Gabon,</b> formed several {{political}} unions {{which were}} sufficiently politically balanced {{to appeal to}} the electorate. In appreciation for his help, M'ba appointed Aubame as foreign minister and later President of the Supreme Court. Tensions soon rose between the two due to Aubame's refusal to merge his party with M'ba's and create a one-party state. Aubame was installed as President of <b>Gabon</b> during a 1964 coup d'état against M'ba. However, the coup was toppled three days later, and although he did not participate in the coup's planning, Aubame was sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and 10 years of exile. He was beaten almost daily by his prison guards while serving out his sentence. M'ba's successor as President, Omar Bongo, allowed the return of Aubame to <b>Gabon</b> in 1972. The elder politician died in 1989 in Gabon's capital of Libreville.|$|E

5|$|Lefebvre's first {{assignment}} as a Holy Ghost Father was as {{a professor}} at St. John's Seminary in Libreville, <b>Gabon.</b> In 1934 he was made rector of the seminary. On 28 September 1935 he made his perpetual vows. He served as superior {{of a number of}} missions of the Holy Ghost Fathers in <b>Gabon.</b> In October 1945 Lefebvre was ordered by the superior general to return to France and take up new duties as rector of the Holy Ghost Fathers seminary in Mortain.|$|E

After three years with Bechtel, he was appointed governor of the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar, and took office on 6 December 2013.|$|E
5|$|After {{voting in}} favor of the Franco-African Community {{constitutional}} referendum of 28 September 1958, <b>Gabon</b> became pseudo-politically independent. Legislative elections were scheduled for 19 June 1960 through the Scrutin de Liste voting system, a form of bloc voting in which each party offers a list of candidates who the population vote for; the list that obtains a majority of votes is declared the winner and wins all the contested seats. Through the redistricting of district and constituency boundaries, the BDG arbitrarily received 244 seats, while the UDSG received 77. In the months that followed, the legislative majority was plagued by internal strife. M'ba, now President of <b>Gabon,</b> decided to dissolve the Assembly and looked to the opposition to strengthen his position.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gabon</b> gained its {{independence}} from France on 17 August 1960. The country had a relatively high standard of living and {{was considered one of}} the more stable countries in West Africa, both politically and economically. At the time of the coup, the country had an estimated US$200 average annual income {{and was one of the}} few countries in Africa with a positive trade balance, with exports exceeding imports by 30 percent. As of 1964, the country was among the largest producers of uranium and manganese in French Africa, which Time suggested was one of the reasons for France's response to the coup. It also had petroleum, iron, and logging interests stationed in <b>Gabon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gondjout {{served as}} Minister of State during the {{abortive}} 1964 <b>Gabon</b> coup d'état but {{was acquitted of}} all charges during his subsequent trial.

5|$|Ordained a diocesan {{priest in}} 1929, {{he joined the}} Holy Ghost Fathers for missionary work and was {{assigned}} to teach at a seminary in <b>Gabon</b> in 1932. In 1947, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Dakar, Senegal, {{and the next year}} as the Apostolic Delegate for West Africa.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after de Gaulle and Foccart's meeting, French commanders Haulin and Royer were {{released}} {{at the request}} of the French Embassy. Intervention could not commence without a formal petition to the Head of State of <b>Gabon.</b> Since M'ba was held hostage, the French contacted the Vice President of <b>Gabon,</b> Paul-Marie Yembit, who had not been arrested. At the time, Yembit was in a car with U.S. ambassador Charles Darlington travelling to N'Dende. This was to officially open a school built by the Peace Corps nearby, in Yembit's birthplace of Moussambou, and completing his electoral campaign. Therefore, they decided to compose a predated letter that Yembit would later sign, confirming their intervention. They sent this to him via a small airplane, since there were no road bridges in <b>Gabon</b> at the time and the only way to cross a river was on a ferry. Yembit did not come back to Libreville on the plane as would be expected, but rather at 8:00 WAT on 18 February to read a statement over Radio Libreville that was likely prepared by French officials. Yembit, however, claimed that he called for French intervention while the insurgent troops held M'ba hostage; this version of the story was quickly disputed by several diplomats on the scene, as several French troops had arrived before this alleged incident.|$|E
5|$|Aubame {{participated in}} the 1944 Brazzaville Conference and served in this post until 10 November 1946. After Éboué's sudden death in March 1944, Aubame worked {{as an adviser to}} Governor-General André Bayardelle and his {{secretary}} André Soucadoux. They encouraged Aubame to run for office, and he returned to <b>Gabon</b> to campaign with the support of both the administration and the missionaries.|$|E

5|$|It is {{unlikely}} that Aubame participated in the planning of the 1964 <b>Gabon</b> coup d'état. It appears that he joined the effort after being recruited by the new government. His nephew, Pierre Eyeguet, a former ambassador to the United Kingdom, may have known of the plot beforehand and notified his uncle, although it is unknown whether or not Aubame established contact with the plotters.|$|E
5|$|The Bantu influx began around 500 BC, {{and some}} {{continued}} their migrations inside the territory {{well into the}} 20th century. They established {{a number of major}} political units, of which the most important was the Kongo Empire whose centre was located in the northwest of what today is Angola, and which stretched northwards into the west of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the south and west of the contemporary Republic of Congo and even the southernmost part of <b>Gabon.</b>|$|E
5|$|The OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes {{has been}} an {{important}} benchmark for oil prices since 2000. It is calculated as a weighted average of prices for petroleum blends from the OPEC member countries: Saharan Blend (Algeria), Girassol (Angola), Oriente (Ecuador), Rabi Light (<b>Gabon),</b> Iran Heavy (Islamic Republic of Iran), Basra Light (Iraq), Kuwait Export (Kuwait), Es Sider (Libya), Bonny Light (Nigeria), Qatar Marine (Qatar), Arab Light (Saudi Arabia), Murban (UAE), and Merey (Venezuela).|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra occurs {{mainly in}} western and central Africa. It is found from Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, southeastern Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Togo, Benin, Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroon, and <b>Gabon</b> in western Africa to the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, and {{northern}} Angola in central Africa to western Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi in eastern Africa, and to fragmented parts of southern Africa, including the Natal.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} manganese ore is pyrolusite (MnO2). Other economically important manganese ores usually show a close spatial {{relation to the}} iron ores. Land-based resources are large but irregularly distributed. About 80% of the known world manganese resources are in South Africa; other important manganese deposits are in Ukraine, Australia, India, China, <b>Gabon</b> and Brazil. According to 1978 estimate, the ocean floor has 500 billion tons of manganese nodules. Attempts to find economically viable methods of harvesting manganese nodules were abandoned in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} {{size of the}} African river martin is unknown. In the late 1980s, {{it appeared to be}} common, if local, and large numbers were seen on migration in <b>Gabon.</b> However, it is particularly poorly known in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and it is unclear if there is any relationship between the birds breeding in the DRC and those breeding in coastal areas of <b>Gabon</b> and the Republic of Congo. A flock of 15,000 birds was seen in 1997, and a mixed flock with rosy bee-eater Merops malimbicus was estimated at 100,000 birds; nevertheless, {{due to the lack of}} detailed information, the species is classed by the IUCN as Data Deficient. In the 1950s, the species was caught and eaten in large quantities in the DRC by the local population, and this practice could be increasing. Breeding colonies in river sandbars are also liable to flooding, but thousands of birds were breeding on the grasslands east of Gamba as recently as 2005.|$|E
5|$|This is {{not always}} the case, however. In sexually dimorphic species, one sex may be more of a threat than the other, which could mimic the {{protected}} sex. Evidence for this possibility is provided by the behaviour of a monkey from <b>Gabon,</b> which regularly ate male moths of the genus Anaphe, but promptly stopped after it tasted a noxious female.|$|E
5|$|This rockfowl is {{protected}} {{in some of}} the areas in which it lives by national parks. Additionally, there seems to be little habitat destruction in <b>Gabon</b> and on Bioko as the locations in these places in which the rockfowl lives is believed to be too inaccessible for future human development. Recent surveys have also discovered new populations of the grey-necked rockfowl.|$|E
5|$|Bresslau became Albert's confidant but did {{not give}} up her own life for his. In fact, they {{spent a great deal}} of time away from each other and {{maintained}} a nontraditional relationship (together but not exclusive). They felt secure remaining undefined as a couple, relying on their friendship through documented letters. The turning point for their relationship occurred when they married on June 18, 1912 in Gunsbach. At this point in their lives, they both decided to marry and go to Africa to fulfill their desire to care for others in need. She quit her job at the orphanage and studied higher level nursing to advance her knowledge before leaving. On Good Friday of 1913, she travelled with Albert to Lambaréné, <b>Gabon,</b> beginning her medical missionary adventure.|$|E
5|$|During 1961–1975, {{the five}} {{founding}} nations {{were joined by}} Qatar (1961), Indonesia (1962–2008, rejoined 2014-2016), Libya (1962), United Arab Emirates (originally just the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, 1967), Algeria (1969), Nigeria (1971), Ecuador (1973–1992, rejoined 2007), and <b>Gabon</b> (1975–1994, rejoined 2016). By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership {{accounted for more than}} half of worldwide oil production. Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's Acting Secretary General in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join, and Angola did in 2007, followed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017. Since the 1980s, representatives from Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.|$|E
5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing white men was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only white men in <b>Gabon</b> were French.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, the French {{physicist}} Francis Perrin discovered fifteen {{ancient and}} no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the Oklo mine in <b>Gabon,</b> West Africa, collectively known as the Oklo Fossil Reactors. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the nuclear waste products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository.|$|E
5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in <b>Gabon</b> where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, OPEC {{lost its}} two newest members, {{who had joined}} in the mid-1970s. Ecuador withdrew in December 1992, because it was unwilling to pay the annual US$2million {{membership}} fee and felt that it needed to produce more oil than it was allowed under the OPEC quota, although it rejoined in October 2007. Similar concerns prompted <b>Gabon</b> to suspend membership in January 1995; it rejoined in July 2016. Iraq has remained a member of OPEC since the organization's founding, but Iraqi production was {{not a part of}} OPEC quota agreements from 1998 to 2016, due to the country's daunting political difficulties.|$|E
5|$|On 17 June 1951, Aubame was reelected {{a deputy}} with 17,329 votes {{out of a}} total of 29,203 and on 2 January 1956 with 26,712 votes {{out of a total}} of 57,031, with this term lasting until the end of the Fourth French Republic. Around this time, M'ba was {{establishing}} his political career after being exiled to Oubangui-Chari. Affiliating with the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO), Aubame later worked most closely with the Indépendants d'Outre-Mer, an African parliamentary group whose leaders were Senegalese Léopold Sédar Senghor and Cameroonian Louis-Paul Aujoulat. While a deputy he lived in Paris and toured <b>Gabon</b> regularly.|$|E
5|$|Predators on the {{breeding}} grounds include feral and domestic cats, introduced American mink, feral ferrets, otters and red foxes, and birds including the common buzzard and hooded crow. In Lithuania, the introduced raccoon dog {{has also been}} recorded as taking corn crakes. When chicks are exposed by rapid mowing, they may be taken by large birds including the white stork, harriers and other birds of prey, gulls and corvids. At undisturbed sites nests and broods are rarely attacked, as reflected in a high breeding success. There is a record of a corn crake on migration through <b>Gabon</b> being killed by a black sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|Some 3,951athletes from 146 NPCs {{participated in}} 472events in 20sports, with Burundi, <b>Gabon,</b> Georgia, Haiti and Montenegro making their Paralympic debuts. This set new records {{for both the}} number of NPCs {{competing}} {{and the number of}} athletes overall. The design of the medals was similar to those awarded in the 2008 Summer Olympics, featuring jade discs inserted into the medals themselves, with different color discs included for the three types of medals. A total of 21designs were submitted from designers from the China Central Academy of Fine Arts, Tsinghua University and the China Banknote Printing and Minting Corporation, with the final design approved in the autumn of 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the impala – spanning across southern and eastern Africa – has remained intact to a great extent, although it has disappeared from a few places, such as Burundi. The range extends from central and southern Kenya and northeastern Uganda in the east to northern KwaZulu-Natal in the south, and westward up to Namibia and southern Angola. The black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia; the status of this subspecies has not been monitored since the 2000s. The common impala has a wider distribution, and has been introduced in protected areas in <b>Gabon</b> and across southern Africa.|$|E
5|$|The impala {{occurs in}} {{woodlands}} and sometimes {{on the interface}} (ecotone) between woodlands and savannahs; it inhabits places close to water. While the black-faced impala is confined to southwestern Angola and Kaokoland in northwestern Namibia, the common impala is widespread across its range and has been reintroduced in <b>Gabon</b> and southern Africa. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifies the impala as a species of least concern; the black-faced subspecies has been classified as a vulnerable species, with less than 1,000 individuals remaining in the wild as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|The river martins form a {{distinctive}} subfamily Pseudochelidoninae within the swallow and martin bird family Hirundinidae. The two species are the African river martin Pseudochelidon eurystomina, {{found in the}} Congo and <b>Gabon,</b> and the white-eyed river martin Pseudochelidon sirintarae, known only from one site in Thailand. These are medium-sized, largely black swallows that have a light buoyant flight and feed on insects caught in the air. They {{appear to be more}} terrestrial than other swallows, frequently walking rather than perching, and the white-eyed may be crepuscular. The African species excavates nest holes in sandy ridges in rivers, while the breeding locations and habits of the Asian bird are unknown.|$|E
