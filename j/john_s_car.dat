40|$|Extensive LWP-HI spectra were {{obtained}} of the Mira <b>S</b> <b>Car</b> {{at a rapid}} time cadence {{as compared with the}} shock cycle time of <b>S</b> <b>Car.</b> These spectra {{were obtained}} in an attempt to understand the velocity structures in the shocked wind using the fluoresced iron lines. Data analysis of the IUE observations, which included the primary calibration of all of the IUE spectra obtained of <b>S</b> <b>Car,</b> was carried out. In addition, line identifications, flux calculations, background subtractions, and line profile analysis as a function of <b>S</b> <b>Car's</b> pulsational phase were performed. The database incorporated all line identifications as a function of pulsation phase for all IUE LWP-HI observations to date of <b>S</b> <b>Car.</b> At least 45 separate iron line features are identified in the <b>S</b> <b>Car</b> spectrum at one or more phases of the shock cycle, including those due to Fe II (UV 161) which is pumped by three different iron lines; Fe I(UV 44) which is pumped by the Mg II k line. Other strong multiplets that have been identified include UV(1), UV(2), UV(5), UV(32), UV(60), UV(63), UV(161), UV(207), and UV(399). Over 300 weaker lines have also been tentatively identified with Fe line transitions...|$|R
