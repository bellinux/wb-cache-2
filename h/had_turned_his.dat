5|$|Even {{before the}} French {{garrison}} on Île Bonaparte had surrendered, Rowley <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention eastwards to Isle de France. The British commander {{had decided that}} the best way to eliminate the threat of Hamelin's squadron was to blockade the island's principal ports by seizing the coral islands that marked the entrances to the harbours through the complicated coral reefs that surrounded Isle de France. These islands were fortified, and once in British hands could prevent French ships leaving or entering the harbours, effectively containing Hamelin's ships until Rowley was ready to launch an invasion. Detailed to lead this campaign was Captain Samuel Pym in Sirius and Willoughby in Nereide, with instructions to begin by seizing Île de la Passe at the entrance to the harbour of Grand Port on the south-eastern coast of Isle de France.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to focus}} on {{research}} problems, Feynman began tackling physics problems, not for utility, but for self-satisfaction. One of these involved analyzing the physics of a twirling, nutating disk as it is moving through the air, inspired by an incident in the cafeteria at Cornell when someone tossed a dinner plate in the air. He read the work of Sir William Rowan Hamilton on quaternions, and attempted unsuccessfully {{to use them to}} formulate a relativistic theory of electrons. His work during this period, which used equations of rotation to express various spinning speeds, ultimately proved important to his Nobel Prize–winning work, yet because he felt burned out and <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to less immediately practical problems, he was surprised by the offers of professorships from other renowned universities, including the Institute for Advanced Study, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the University of California, Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his {{lifetime}} the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744–1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalised and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Linnaeus felt his work was reflecting the harmony of nature and he said in 1754 'the earth is then nothing else but a museum of the all-wise creator's masterpieces, divided into three chambers'. He <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> own estate into a microcosm of that 'world museum'.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1896, Edison <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to promoting a projector technology, the Phantoscope, developed by young inventors Charles Francis Jenkins and Thomas Armat. The rights to the system had been acquired by Raff and Gammon, who redubbed it the Vitascope and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after {{little more than a}} year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.|$|E
5|$|While Lemage was {{boarding}} Maria Riggersbergen, Rainier <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> {{attention to}} the other ships in the bay. However the sea was shallow and crossed by shoals that prevented further advance without proper charts, which Caroline lacked. Although they had fired a number of shots at long range, the interference by the smaller Dutch vessels during the battle had been negligible. Following the surrender of Maria Riggersbergen, most of the shipping in the bay including all seven of the merchant vessels, the three small warships and Phoenix, had deliberately beached themselves to avoid capture. Abandoning the idea of further operations off Batavia as too risky, Rainier ordered his ships to sail, placing most of the Dutch prisoners, including the wounded and sick, into the first brig captured that morning and ordering the ship to return to Batavia as a cartel, with the officers placed under parole restrictions. With most of his prisoners removed, Rainier then ordered Maria Riggersbergen and Zeerop to return to Madras.|$|E

25|$|The psychotropic {{effects of}} DMT were first studied scientifically by the Hungarian chemist and {{psychologist}} Dr. Stephen Szára, who performed research with volunteers in the mid-1950s. Szára, who later {{worked for the}} US National Institutes of Health, <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to DMT after his order for LSD from the Swiss company Sandoz Laboratories was rejected {{on the grounds that}} the powerful psychotropic could be dangerous in the hands of a communist country.|$|E
25|$|A {{line from}} Shakespeare has {{sometimes}} been taken to mean that he was deaf in one ear: Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf. No classical source mentions hearing impairment in connection with Caesar. The playwright may have been making metaphorical use of a passage in Plutarch that does not refer to deafness at all, but rather to a gesture Alexander of Macedon customarily made. By covering his ear, Alexander indicated that he <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention from an accusation in order to hear the defence.|$|E
25|$|In 1818 he {{published}} {{the first part}} of his folio edition of his ' Peak Scenery, or the Derbyshire Tourist,' dedicated to the Duke of Devonshire and illustrated by F.L.Chantrey. This was followed by part one of Yorkshire Scenery which was the only part ever published. In 1837 Rhodes issued a small Derbyshire Tourist's Guide and Travelling Companion. All his books involved him in financial loss, although his Peak Scenery remains a standard work. Apart from these ventures, he <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to journalism, and {{for a number of years}} he was editor of the Sheffield Independent.|$|E

25|$|Alfred Richardson <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> {{attention}} to the Police Identity Parade. These had been held for many years by police forces, {{but there was no}} standard procedure or rules (such as a minimum number in a line up) that was followed. Halifax was the first Police Force whereby all those taking part had to be of similar likeness and build as the person arrested. The number of individuals in any Parade had to be the same wherever the Parade took place. This was adopted throughout the country and is still used today. At this time Richardson became the secretary of the Chief Constables Association of England and Wales and in 1917 he became Vice President and 1918, President.|$|E
25|$|Novello {{was educated}} privately in Cardiff {{and then in}} Gloucester, where he studied harmony and {{counterpoint}} with Herbert Brewer, the cathedral organist. From there he won a scholarship to Magdalen College School in Oxford, {{where he was a}} solo treble in the college choir. He later said that this prolonged youthful exposure to early sacred choral music <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> tastes, in reaction, to lush romantic music. Although Brewer had told him he would not have a career in music, Novello from his early youth showed a facility for writing songs, and when he was only 15, one of his songs was published. After leaving school, he gave piano lessons in Cardiff, and then moved to London in 1913 with his mother. They took a flat above the Strand Theatre, which became his London home {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
25|$|In {{a report}} {{presented}} on 30 June, OKW Chief of Staff Alfred Jodl reviewed options to increase pressure on Britain {{to agree to}} a negotiated peace. The first priority was to eliminate the Royal Air Force and gain air supremacy. Intensified air attacks against shipping and the economy could affect food supplies and civilian morale in the long term. Reprisal attacks of terror bombing had the potential to cause quicker capitulation but the effect on morale was uncertain. Once the Luftwaffe had control of the air, and the British economy had been weakened, an invasion would be a last resort or a final strike ("Todesstoss") after England had already been practically defeated, but could have a quick result. At a meeting that day, OKW Chief of Staff General Franz Halder heard from Secretary of State Ernst von Weizsäcker that Hitler <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to Russia. Halder met Admiral Otto Schniewind on 1 July, and they shared views without understanding each other's position. Both thought that air superiority was needed first, and could make the invasion unnecessary. They agreed that minefields and U-boats could limit the threat posed by the Royal Navy; Schniewind emphasised the significance of weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|Even {{after the}} dissolution, Leland did not abandon his hunt for books. For instance, he {{obtained}} official permission to avail {{himself of the}} library belonging to the defunct monastery of Bury St Edmunds. The descriptions of Britain which he encountered in the manuscripts, however, and his personal experiences of travel, also sparked off fresh interests. By about 1538, Leland <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> attention to English and Welsh topography and antiquities, embarking {{on a series of}} journeys which lasted six years. Probably over the summer of 1538 (though there may also have been earlier and/or later trips), he made an extended excursion through Wales. He subsequently made a number of journeys in England: the exact sequence and their dates are again uncertain, but there seem to have been five major English itineraries, taken over the summers of the years 1539 to 1543. His one firmly dated itinerary is that of 1542, which took him to the West Country. By that date he had been on a tour to the north-west, which went via the Welsh marches to Cheshire, Lancashire and Cumberland; while other itineraries took him to the west Midlands, the north-east (reaching Yorkshire and County Durham), and the Bristol region. He probably explored the south-east in shorter excursions. He is not known to have toured East Anglia, for which only a few fragmentary notes survive.|$|E
500|$|These three works made up Irving's [...] "western" [...] {{series of}} books and were written partly as a {{response}} to criticism that his time in England and Spain had made him more European than American. In the minds of some critics, especially James Fenimore Cooper and Philip Freneau, Irving <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> back on his American heritage in favor of English aristocracy. Irving's western books, particularly A Tour on the Prairies, were well received in the United States, though British critics accused Irving of [...] "book-making".|$|E

500|$|The {{creation}} of Jason Teague was something handed {{down by the}} network, who wanted Lana {{to have a new}} boyfriend—one who was [...] "different from Clark". Gough and Millar were apprehensive because they were already introducing Lois Lane into the series, and introducing two new characters would be difficult. The pair thought about where the relationship between Clark and Lana had left off at the end of season three, and they realized that Clark <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> back on Lana. Gough and Millar began to like the idea of bringing in a new character, one that would create a new love triangle; eventually they tied him into the larger storyline involving the three Kryptonian stones of knowledge.|$|E
500|$|This {{maneuver}} again put Scheer in {{a dangerous}} position; Jellicoe <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> <b>his</b> fleet south and again crossed Scheer's [...] "T." [...] A third 16-point turn followed, which was covered by a charge by Hipper's mauled battlecruisers. Scheer then ordered the fleet to adopt the night cruising formation, which was completed by 23:40. A series of ferocious engagements between Scheer's battleships and Jellicoe's destroyer screen ensued, though the Germans managed to punch {{their way through the}} destroyers and make for Horns Reef. The High Seas Fleet reached the Jade between 13:00 and 14:45 on 1 June; Scheer ordered the undamaged battleships of the I Battle Squadron to take up defensive positions in the Jade roadstead while the s were to maintain a state of readiness just outside Wilhelmshaven.|$|E

Poe became assistant editor of the periodical in August 1835, but was discharged within a few weeks for having been caught drunk by his boss. Returning to Baltimore, Poe obtained a license to marry his cousin Virginia on September 22, 1835, though it is unknown if they were married at that time. He was 26 and she was 13.|$|E
