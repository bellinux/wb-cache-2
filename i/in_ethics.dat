5|$|Weber {{continued}} his investigation into this matter in later works, notably in his studies on bureaucracy {{and on the}} classification of legitimate authority into three types– rational-legal, traditional and charismatic– of which the rational-legal (through bureaucracy) is the dominant one in the modern world. In these works Weber described {{what he saw as}} society's movement towards rationalisation. Similarly, rationalisation could be seen in the economy, with the development of highly rational and calculating capitalism. Weber also saw rationalisation as one of the main factors setting the European West apart {{from the rest of the}} world. Rationalisation relied on deep changes <b>in</b> <b>ethics,</b> religion, psychology and culture; changes that first took place in the Western civilisation.|$|E
5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force <b>in</b> <b>ethics.</b> He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, when it seems that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of medicine involves not only scientific and technical knowledge, but also value judgements. Such judgements should be properly analysed and assessed, just as scientific evidence should be properly evaluated. Assessment of value judgements may require several different approaches, including reasoning from fundamental moral theory or from general principles, clarification of key concepts, and comparison with specific cases to ensure consistency. Focusing on the logical structure of argument can help ensure that rhetorical devices {{are not used to}} make an invalid argument persuasive. Doctors must be prepared to justify their decisions and actions with regard to both the evidential scientific basis, and the ethical values and process of decision-making. It is sometimes helpful, when faced with an issue <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics,</b> to step back and consider fundamental approaches to ethics. Two contrasting approaches have been particularly influential <b>in</b> western <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> general, and <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics</b> <b>in</b> particular: consequentialist <b>ethics</b> (notably utilitarianism) and duty-based ethics. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|Many {{philosophers}} {{have criticized}} Objectivist ethics. The philosopher Robert Nozick argues that Rand's foundational argument <b>in</b> <b>ethics</b> is unsound {{because it does}} not explain why someone could not rationally prefer dying and having no values. He argues that her attempt to defend the morality of selfishness is, therefore, an instance of begging the question. Nozick also argues that Rand's solution to David Hume's famous is-ought problem is unsatisfactory. In response, the philosophers Douglas B. Rasmussen and Douglas Den Uyl have argued that Nozick misstated Rand's case.|$|E
25|$|Reichenbach {{suggests}} that the theories of karma are an ethical theory. This is so because the ancient scholars of India linked intent and actual action to the merit, reward, demerit and punishment. A theory without ethical premise would be a pure causal relation; the merit or reward or demerit or punishment would be same regardless of the actor's intent. <b>In</b> <b>ethics,</b> one's intentions, attitudes and desires matter {{in the evaluation of}} one's action. Where the outcome is unintended, the moral responsibility for it is less on the actor, even though causal responsibility may be the same regardless. A karma theory considers not only the action, but also actor's intentions, attitude, and desires before and during the action. The karma concept thus encourages each person to seek and live a moral life, as well as avoid an immoral life. The meaning and significance of karma is thus as a building block of an ethical theory.|$|E
25|$|The Faculty of Arts offers {{undergraduate}} major {{programs in}} immunology, international relations, and ethics, society, and law {{to students at}} the university. Associated with the latter two is an academic program called Trinity One. Admission to the Trinity One program is separate {{from that of the}} college itself, with enrollment limited to 25 students per stream. At least one prominent professor teaches in each stream; for example, Robert Bothwell in the International Relations stream Mark Kingwell <b>in</b> <b>Ethics,</b> Society, and Law. Noted author Margaret MacMillan taught in the International Relations stream for {{the first two years of}} the program, prior to her departure for Oxford. The International Relations program benefits from the presence of the Munk School of Global Affairs where Janice Stein, a prominent Canadian academic, is the current Director. The Munk School also houses notable research centres, like the Centre for South Asian Studies (a constitutive until of the Asian Institute, that hosts academic and public events focused on critical global questions of law and activism; histories and contemporary configurations of the sacred and secular; political economy and cultures of capitalism; media, technology and the public sphere.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{methodology}} of medical ethics {{during the last}} few decades has shifted from a predominant use of normative-philosophical analyses to an increasing involvement of empirical methods. The articles which have been published {{in the course of this}} so-called 'empirical turn' can be divided into conceptual accounts of empirical-normative collaboration and studies which use socio-empirical methods to investigate ethically relevant issues in concrete social contexts. Discussion A considered reference to normative research questions can be expected from good quality empirical research <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics.</b> However, a significant proportion of empirical studies currently published <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics</b> lacks such linkage between the empirical research and the normative analysis. In the first part of this paper, we will outline two typical shortcomings of empirical studies <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics</b> with regard to a link between normative questions and empirical data: (1) The complete lack of normative analysis, and (2) cryptonormativity and a missing account with regard to the relationship between 'is' and 'ought' statements. Subsequently, two selected concepts of empirical-normative collaboration will be presented and how these concepts may contribute to improve the linkage between normative and empirical aspects of empirical research <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics</b> will be demonstrated. Based on our analysis, as well as our own practical experience with empirical research <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics,</b> we conclude with a sketch of concrete suggestions for the conduct of empirical research <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics.</b> Summary High quality empirical research <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics</b> is <b>in</b> need of a considered reference to normative analysis. In this paper, we demonstrate how conceptual approaches of empirical-normative collaboration can enhance empirical research <b>in</b> medical <b>ethics</b> with regard to the link between empirical research and normative analysis. </p...|$|R
