5|$|The Venusian {{atmosphere}} {{has been}} found to be sufficiently out of equilibrium as to require further <b>investigation.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of data from the Venera, Pioneer, and Magellan missions has found the chemicals hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) together in the upper atmosphere, as well as carbonyl sulfide (OCS). The first two gases react with each other, implying that something must produce them. Carbonyl sulfide is difficult to produce inorganically, but it is present in the Venusian atmosphere. However, the planet's volcanism could explain the presence of carbonyl sulfide. In addition, one of the early Venera probes detected large amounts of toxic chlorine just below the Venusian cloud deck.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a formalized {{incident}} reporting, <b>investigation,</b> and <b>analysis</b> procedure for use at the Saint Croix National Scenic Riverway (SACN), and answer the five research questions created for this study. In order to develop these formalized procedures and answer the study's research questions, a review ofliterature was performed which presented the researcher with industry best practices and guidelines to follow in connection with incident reporting, <b>investigation,</b> and <b>analysis.</b> A questionnaire was then developed and given to SACN employees who are knowledgeable, involved, and have experience with incident reporting, <b>investigation,</b> and <b>analysis</b> and the safety management system employed at SACN. The questions generated for the questionnaire were aimed at answering the five research questions and allowing the participants to express their perspectives of SACN's current incident reporting, <b>investigation,</b> and <b>analysis</b> procedure. 3 After the reviewed literature and questionnaire responses were analyzed, the study found some concerning issues and deficiencies with the procedures for managing incidents currently employed at SACN. The major findings of the study include a number of issues concerning communication and reporting barriers that were identified at SACN which might inhibit employees to report incidents, and the lack of established, formalized incident <b>investigation</b> and incident <b>analysis</b> procedures. The recommendations made for this study can provide opportunities to address these deficiencies and help in developing these needed fOlmalized procedures. ...|$|R
