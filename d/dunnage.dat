5|$|Typically, ice traders hired {{vessels to}} ship ice as freight, {{although}} Frederic Tudor initially purchased his own vessel and the Tudor Company later bought three fast cargo ships {{of its own}} in 1877. Ice was first transported in ships {{at the end of}} the 18th century, when it was occasionally used as ballast. Shipping ice as ballast, however, required it to be cleanly cut in order to avoid it shifting around as it melted, which was not easily done until Wyeth's invention of the ice-cutter in 1825. The uniform blocks that Wyeth's process produced also made it possible to pack more ice into the limited space of a ship's hold, and significantly reduced the losses from melting. The ice was typically packed up tightly with sawdust, and the hold was then closed to prevent warmer air entering; other forms of protective <b>dunnage</b> used to protect ice included hay and pine tree cuttings. This requirement for large quantities of sawdust coincided with the growth in the New England lumber industry in the 1830s; sawdust had no other use at the time, and was in fact considered something of a problem, so its use in the ice trade proved very useful to the local timber industry.|$|E
25|$|The ship carried 24 stone anchors. The {{stone is}} {{of a type}} almost {{completely}} unknown in the Aegean, but is often built into the temples of Syria-Palestine and on Cyprus. Brushwood and sticks served as <b>dunnage</b> to help protect the ship’s planks from the metal ingots and other heavy cargo.|$|E
25|$|The Vulcanus sailed out {{one more}} time from September 6–8, 1977, to burn the diesel fuel which {{had been used to}} rinse any {{residual}} HO from its holding tanks and to discharge the sea water which had also been used to rinse the tanks. A total of 11,716 gallons of diesel was provided for this voyage. The cleanup of the storage area and disposal of the <b>dunnage</b> on which the drums had been stored was completed on September 12, 1977.|$|E
5000|$|The Emmy Award-nominated Marion Boyce was {{announced}} as the costume designer for the film. Maslin expressed excitement {{about working with}} Boyce on a film in which dressmaking plays an important role. Sophie Theallet was also asked to design two couture gowns for Winslet for the film [...] In October 2014, Margot Wilson came on board as the costume designer for Tilly <b>Dunnage's</b> wardrobe worn by Winslet in the film. Additional retro clothes and accessories were provided by a shop named Retropolitan, located in West Annapolis, United States.|$|R
50|$|Interior {{scenes were}} filmed at the Docklands Studios, where an {{artificial}} silo, {{and part of}} Dungatar town, including Molly <b>Dunnage's</b> house, were constructed on the sound stage. On 20 October 2014, filming took place in Docklands Studios with Winslet and Davis. On 5 November 2014, filming took place at Muckleford, Victoria railway station, which was transformed into Dungatar's railway station. In the middle of November 2014, scenes were shot at Mount Rothwell, {{just north of the}} You Yangs, near Geelong, and later that month, scenes were filmed with an emu named Elvis, courtesy of the Mount Rothwell Biodiversity Interpretation Centre.|$|R
5000|$|International Standards For Phytosanitary Measures No. 15 (ISPM 15) is an International Phytosanitary Measure {{developed}} by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) that directly addresses the need to treat wood materials of a thickness greater than 6mm, used to ship products between countries. Its main purpose is to prevent the international transport and spread of disease and insects that could negatively affect plants or ecosystems.ISPM 15 affects all wood packaging material (pallets, crates, <b>dunnages,</b> etc.) requiring that they be debarked and then heat treated or fumigated with methyl bromide and stamped or branded, with a mark of compliance. This mark of compliance is colloquially known as the [...] "wheat stamp". Products exempt from the ISPM 15 are made from an alternative material, like paper, plastic or wood panel products (i.e. OSB, hardboard, and plywood).|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} ways and materials available to stabilize and secure cargo in containers used in the various modes of transportation. Conventional Load Securing methods and materials such as steel banding and wood blocking & bracing {{have been around for}} decades and are still widely used. In the last few years the use of several, relatively new and unknown Load Securing methods have become available through innovation and technological advancement including polyester strapping and -lashing, synthetic webbings and <b>Dunnage</b> Bags, also known as air bags.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, Winslet reprised {{the role}} of Jeanine Matthews in the second {{instalment}} of the Divergent series, subtitled , which despite negative reviews earned US$297 million worldwide. Her next film, an adaptation of the Australian gothic novel The Dressmaker, was described by the director Jocelyn Moorhouse as [...] "Unforgiven with a sewing machine”. Winslet starred as the femme fatale Tilly <b>Dunnage,</b> a seamstress who returns to her hometown years after she was accused of murder. She learned to sew for the part and designed some of her own costumes. The production was filmed in the Australian desert and Winslet {{found it difficult to}} wear couture dresses in the harsh weather. Despite disliking the film, Robert Abele of Los Angeles Times commended Winslet for shrewdly underplaying her over-the-top part. The film {{emerged as one of the}} highest-grossing Australian films of all time, but earned little elsewhere. Winslet won an AACTA Award for Best Actress.|$|E
2500|$|Loaded {{displacement}} is {{the weight}} of the ship including cargo, passengers, fuel, water, stores, <b>dunnage</b> and such other items necessary for use on a voyage. [...] These bring the ship down to its [...] "load draft", colloquially known as the [...] "waterline".|$|E
2500|$|The tea {{arrived in}} {{lighters}} called [...] "chop boats" [...] (taking their {{name from the}} identifying marks on each batch of tea they carried). Lower value chests were loaded first as a layer across the ballast, with some shingle being packed between the chests and side of the hold. Then the main cargo was loaded in further layers, being carefully packed in with <b>dunnage</b> by the excellent Chinese stevedores.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{established}} methods and materials for stabilizing and securing intermodal containers loaded on ships, {{as well as}} the internal cargo inside the boxes. Conventional restraint methods and materials such as steel strapping and wood blocking and bracing have been around for decades and are still widely used. Polyester strapping and lashing, and synthetic webbings are also common today. <b>Dunnage</b> bags (also known as [...] "air bags") are used to keep unit loads in place.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 and 2006, {{the company}} {{undertook}} a significant restructuring, selling over [...] of forestland in the U.S., {{along with its}} coated paper, kraft paper, wood products, and beverage packaging businesses, as well as subsidiaries Arizona Chemical and New Zealand-based Carter Holt Harvey. The coated paper business (four mills in Maine, Michigan and Minnesota) were sold to Apollo Management and now operate as Verso Paper. The kraft paper business (composed of a kraft paper mill in Roanoke Rapids, North Carolina and a <b>dunnage</b> bag plant in Fordyce, Arkansas) was sold to Kapstone Paper and Packaging and operates as Kapstone Kraft Paper.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, no. They're so's to be ruther dead--an' flat--an' salt. There's {{a hundred}} {{hogshead}} o' {{salt in the}} bins; an' we hain't more'n covered our <b>dunnage</b> to now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Joe is overhaulin' this <b>dunnage,</b> {{to see if}} there's {{anything}} worth carryin' back to the States," [...] Bob replied carelessly, as {{the engineer}} continued his work in silence.|$|E
60|$|Shoving clear, they roughly stored the {{supplies}} and <b>dunnage</b> {{out of the}} way of the thwarts and took their places, Ah Moy pulling bow-oar, next in order Big John and Kwaque, with Daughtry (Cocky still perched on his shoulder) at stroke. On top of the <b>dunnage,</b> in the sternsheets, Michael gazed wistfully at the Mary Turner and continued to snarl crustily at Scraps who idiotically wanted to start a romp. The Ancient Mariner stood up at the steering sweep and gave the order, when all was ready, for the first dip of the oars.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, now--pass up the <b>dunnage</b> there! Move, yourself, hombre, or I'll have to {{get down}} again {{and give you a}} tap on those {{bandages}} of yours, you growling bear, you!" ...|$|E
60|$|And out of {{the snow}} flurries they saw appear a tall, gaunt form, with {{whiskers}} of flying white that blended with the storm, bending under a sixty-pound pack of camp <b>dunnage.</b>|$|E
60|$|Captain Doane's {{orders were}} swiftly obeyed. The {{starboard}} boat, fended off by sailors, {{rose and fell}} in the water alongside while {{the remainder of the}} <b>dunnage</b> and provisions showered into her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glory be!" [...] said Daughtry. [...] "I {{was just}} fearin' you'd be wantin' me along, sir.--Kwaque, you take 'm my fella <b>dunnage</b> belong me, put 'm in other fella boat along other side." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we {{have knocked}} a door {{through the end}} there, John," [...] Captain Dave said, [...] "it {{will give you a}} deal more room, and {{you will be able to}} get rid of all these cables and heavy <b>dunnage,</b> and to have matters more ship-shape here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon it is jest as {{well that}} I went after your <b>dunnage,</b> lad, for your mother was ready to have a cryin' fit, which she couldn't perlitely let come on while I was there; but I'll warrant the water would have run had you been alone with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Three feet, sir--I just sounded," [...] {{came the}} answer. [...] "I think, sir, {{it would be}} {{advisable}} to part-load the boat; then, right after {{the next time the}} whale hits us, lower away on the run, chuck the rest of the <b>dunnage</b> in, and ourselves, and get clear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I come {{somewhere near}} knowin' how it is, lad. At {{such a time}} as this the least home talk that's made, the better, for it kind'er unstrings a fellow. You wait here, an' I'll go after what <b>dunnage</b> your mother is gettin' together; she'll {{understand}} that a short partin' is the best." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Nishikanta, {{you can go}} to hell, sir, and all {{the rest}} as well," [...] was Daughtry's quiet response, {{although}} in the same breath he was saying, respectfully and assuringly, to the Ancient Mariner: [...] "You hold Killeny, sir. I'll take care of your <b>dunnage.</b> Is there anything special you want to save, sir?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Captain Jason Daggett," [...] showing {{himself more}} plainly, by {{moving out of}} the line of the main-rigging. [...] "I had the {{pleasure}} of seeing you when I was on the P'int, looking after my uncle's <b>dunnage,</b> you may remember, Captain Gar'ner. 'T was but the other day, and you are not likely to have forgotten my visit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he cried, [...] "this {{is rather}} a poorer outfit than Jack {{is apt to}} carry! infit, I suppose it should be called, as the poor fellow who owned it was inward bound, when he brought up on Oyster Pond. You'll hardly think it worth while, captain Daggett, to take this <b>dunnage</b> across to the Vineyard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be familiar," [...] {{said the}} nigger. Donkin started {{and sat down}} on a chest near by, out of sheer surprise. [...] "We haven't kept pigs together," [...] {{continued}} James Wait in a deep undertone. [...] "Here's your tobacco." [...] Then, after a pause, he inquired:--"What ship?"--"Golden State," [...] muttered Donkin indistinctly, biting the tobacco. The nigger whistled low.--"Ran?" [...] he said curtly. Donkin nodded: one of his cheeks bulged out. [...] "In course I ran," [...] he mumbled. [...] "They booted the life hout of one Dago chap on the passage 'ere, then started on me. I cleared hout 'ere.--" [...] "Left your <b>dunnage</b> behind?"--"Yes, <b>dunnage</b> and money," [...] answered Donkin, raising his voice a little; [...] "I got nothink. No clothes, no bed. A bandy-legged little Hirish chap 'ere 'as give me a blanket. Think I'll go an' sleep in the fore topmast staysail to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{no doubt}} now but that we'll be under way by sunset," [...] Joe said, {{as he stood}} on the quarter-deck where the boys had taken refuge from the heat, [...] "and {{it would be a good}} idea for me to be {{bringing}} my <b>dunnage</b> out of the tug, since it ain't likely I'll ever see the little craft again." ...|$|E
60|$|While the mother-whale expressing her {{bereavement}} {{in terms}} of violence and destruction, was withdrawing the necessary distance for another charge, all hands of the Mary Turner gathered about the starboard boat swung outboard ready for lowering. A respectable hill of case goods, water-kegs, and personal <b>dunnage</b> was piled on the deck alongside. A glance at this, and at the many men of fore and aft, demonstrated that {{it was to be}} a perilously overloaded boat.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was willin' {{to leave}} all my <b>dunnage,</b> providin' I could say good by to the bloomin' ship. When {{we put in}} here I counted on seein' friends 'most anywhere, for I hail from Baltimore way; but Darius Thorpe's was the first {{friendly}} face I came across. A good honest sailorman is Darius, an' I knew he wouldn't leave me in a hole if {{it was possible for}} him to lend a hand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is little}} here {{to pay a}} man for {{crossing}} from the Vineyard," [...] observed Roswell Gardiner, a little drily; for he did not half like the appearance of cupidity that shone through the nephew's tardy concern for {{the fate of the}} uncle. [...] "The last voyage has not been prosperous, I fear, or the owners failed before the vessel got in! What is to be done with all this <b>dunnage,</b> deacon?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then the big pipe sank {{with a soft}} splash, {{and shook}} out its loose half-coil, as if alive, while it swelled. It grew hard and rigid, and the dim, oily water swirled and seethed {{about the end of}} it. In another moment there was a rush of {{floating}} objects towards it from the shadows. Strips of bagging, handspikes, clots of oil, and <b>dunnage</b> wood, came thicker and thicker, and Jefferson raised his voice.|$|E
60|$|So {{no wonder}} the town went wild! All day in the street you could hear men talking of veins, and {{smelters}} and dips and deposits and faults,--the town hummed with it like a geology class on examination day. And there were men about the hotels with mining outfits and theodolites and <b>dunnage</b> bags, and at Smith's bar they would hand chunks of rock up and down, some of which would {{run as high as}} ten drinks to the pound.|$|E
60|$|The second sea {{filled the}} Petite Jeanne's decks {{flush with the}} rails; and, as her stern sank down and her bow tossed skyward, all the miserable <b>dunnage</b> of life and luggage poured aft. It was a human torrent. They came head first, feet first, sidewise, rolling over and over, twisting, squirming, writhing, and crumpling up. Now and again one caught a grip on a {{stanchion}} or a rope; but {{the weight of the}} bodies behind tore such grips loose.|$|E
6000|$|... "Our tug {{was already}} alongside. Two loafers were {{carrying}} his <b>dunnage</b> behind him. I told the dockman at our moorings {{to keep all}} fast for a minute. The gangway was down already; but he made nothing of it. Up he jumps, one leap, swings his long legs over the rail, {{and there he is}} on board. They pass up his swell <b>dunnage,</b> and he puts his hand in his trousers pocket and throws all his small change on the wharf for them chaps to pick up. They were still promenading that wharf on all fours when we cast off. It was only then that he looked at me--quietly, you know; in a slow way. He wasn't so thin then as he is now; but I noticed he wasn't so young as he looked--not by a long chalk. He seemed to touch me inside somewhere. I went away pretty quick from there; I was wanted forward anyhow. I wasn't frightened. What should I be frightened for? I only felt touched--on the very spot. But Jee-miny, if anybody had told me we should be partners before the year was out--well, I would have--" ...|$|E
