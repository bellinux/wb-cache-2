50|$|EPDM rubber (<b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> diene monomer (M-class) rubber), {{a type of}} {{synthetic}} rubber, is an elastomer characterized by {{a wide range of}} applications. The M refers to its classification in ASTM standard D-1418; the M class includes rubbers having a saturated chain of the polymethylene type. Dienes currently used in the manufacture of EPDM rubbers are dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), ethylidene norbornene (ENB), and vinyl norbornene (VNB). EPDM rubber is closely related to <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> rubber: <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> rubber is a copolymer of <b>ethylene</b> and <b>propylene,</b> whereas EPDM rubber is a terpolymer of <b>ethylene,</b> <b>propylene,</b> and a diene-component.|$|R

40|$|The {{aluminized}} Teflon fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> outer most {{layer of}} the multilayer insulation blankets on the Hubble Space Telescope has become embrittled resulting in severe on-orbit cracking. During the second servicing mission, a piece of aluminized fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> was retrieved that had curled, exposing the back-surface aluminum to space. This extremely embrittled piece reached 200 C on-orbit, 150 C higher than the nominal temperature extreme. Therefore, experiments have been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of heating on the degradation of fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> that has been irradiated in a ground laboratory facility or in space on Hubble Space Telescope. Samples of pristine, x-ray irradiated and Hubble Space Telescope retrieved fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> were heat treated from 50 to 200 C at 25 C intervals in a high vacuum facility and tensile tested. Density measurements were also obtained. Results indicate that heating does not embrittle non-irradiated Teflon. However, there is a significant dependence of the embrittlement of irradiated Teflon on heating temperature, with near complete loss of elongation at 100 C and higher. Rate of degradation changes, which were consistent with the glass transition temperature for fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene,</b> were present in the data. The results support chain scission as the primary mechanism of degradation of fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> on Hubble Space Telescope, and indicate the significance of the on-orbit temperature of fluorinated <b>ethylene</b> <b>propylene</b> with respect to its degradation in the space environment...|$|R
