40|$|<b>Geocoding</b> <b>data</b> {{are widely}} used in {{applications}} to support geographical locations and compute spatial relationships, such as distances. It is a common practice to capture geospatial data in relational database management systems (RDBMS), where most business data are stored and processed. However, RDBMS’s lack of ability in geocoding analysis and processing has prevented applications from handling spatial data effectively. Relational databases need to support <b>geocoding</b> <b>data</b> analysis and processing, such as <b>geocoding</b> <b>data</b> sorting, searching, geo-positioning, and distance computing. More advanced requirements may include the analysis of an area based on geo-location and area coverage of a geo-location. This paper provides analysis {{of some of the}} requirements on <b>geocoding</b> <b>data</b> processing in RDBMS from business application perspectives. The challenges in design and implementation will be discussed. The requirements will be further transformed to modeling, analysis, and processing on geocoding support in relational databases. When database volume increases, performance issues need to be addressed in order to provide efficient data queries and data processing. Database objects, such as auxiliary tables, views, and indexes, can be designed to provide performance improvement...|$|R

50|$|A {{very common}} error is {{to believe the}} {{accuracy}} ratings of a given map's geocodable attributes. Such accuracy currently touted by most vendors has no bearing on an address being attributed to the correct segment, being attributed to the correct side of the segment, nor resulting in an accurate position along that correct segment. With the geocoding process used for U.S. Census TIGER datasets, 5-7.5% of the addresses may be allocated to a different census tract, while a study of Australia's TIGER-like system found that 50% of the geocoded points were mapped to the wrong property parcel.The accuracy of <b>geocoded</b> <b>data</b> can also have a bearing {{on the quality of}} research that can be done using this data. One study by a group of Iowa researchers found that the common method of geocoding using TIGER datasets as described above, can cause a loss of as much as 40% of the power of a statistical analysis. An alternative is to use orthophoto or image coded data such as the Address Point data from Ordnance Survey in the UK, but such datasets are generally expensive.Because of this, it is quite important to avoid using interpolated results except for non-critical applications, such as pizza delivery. Interpolated geocoding is usually not appropriate for making authoritative decisions, for example if life safety will be affected by that decision. Emergency services, for example, do not make an authoritative decision based on their interpolations; an ambulance or fire truck will always be dispatched regardless of what the map says.|$|E

40|$|The {{very high}} {{geometric}} accuracy of <b>geocoded</b> <b>data</b> of the TerraSAR-X satellite {{has been shown}} in several investigations. It {{is due to the fact}} that it measures distances which are mainly dependent on the position of the satellite and the terrain height. If the used DEM is of high accuracy, the resulting <b>geocoded</b> <b>data</b> are very precise. This precision can be used to improve the exterior orientation and thereby the geometric accuracy of optical satellite data. The technique used is the measurement of identical points in the images, either by manual measurements or through local image matching using mutual information and to estimate improvements for the attitude data through this information. By adjustment calculations falsely matched points can be eliminated and an optimal improvement can be found. The optical data are orthorectified using these improvements and the available DEM.

40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{availability}} of big data in many fields, historical data on socioevironmental phenomena {{are often not}} available {{due to a lack}} of automated and scalable approaches for collecting, digitizing, and assembling them. We have developed a data-mining method for extracting tabulated, <b>geocoded</b> <b>data</b> from printed directories. While scanning and optical character recognition (OCR) can digitize printed text, these methods alone do not capture the structure of the underlying data. Our pipeline integrates both page layout analysis and OCR to extract tabular, <b>geocoded</b> <b>data</b> from structured text. We demonstrate the utility of this method by applying it to scanned manufacturing registries from Rhode Island that record 41 years of industrial land use. The resulting spatio-temporal data can be used for socioenvironmental analyses of industrialization at a resolution that was not previously possible. In particular, we find strong evidence for the dispersion of manufacturing from the urban core of Providence, the state's capital, along the Interstate 95 corridor to the north and south...|$|E

Previous studies have yielded mixed evidence but have used potentially inadequate measures to account for the simultaneity between drug consumption and labor supply.

Results indicate a substantial negative relationship between drug use and both employment and hours worked in both 1984 and 1988 that is always significant for males and sometimes significant for females. Hausman tests reveal that OLS estimates are biased down in magnitude, thus demonstrating the importance of controlling for simultaneity.
