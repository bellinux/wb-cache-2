I came across an uncanny-looking mongrel late one night. He was not lame, but he seemed pretty sick; and, feeling I was not robbing anybody of anything very valuable, I lured him home and nursed him. I fancy I must have over-nursed him. He got so healthy in the end, there was no doing anything with him. He was an ill-conditioned cur, and {{he was too old}} to be taught. He became the curse of the neighbourhood. His idea of sport was killing chickens and sneaking rabbits from outside poulterers' shops. For recreation he killed cats and frightened small children by yelping round their legs. There were times when I could have lamed him myself, if only I could have got hold of him. I made nothing by running that dog--nothing whatever. People, instead of admiring me for nursing him back to life, called me a fool, and said that if I didn't drown the brute they would. He spoilt my character utterly--I mean my character at this period. It is difficult to pose as {{a young man with a}} heart of gold, when discovered in the middle of the road throwing stones at your own dog.

However, participation in the workshop and discussion with others, has convinced me that the transfer of the concept of sustainability from the world of the ecologist to that of restoration is still far from mature, and requires further reflection before carrying my observations further. In this connection, in the discussion of the working group on Kilkenny city the meaning of the term ‘sustainability’ did not seem so clear when applied to the building heritage, {{and one of the first}} doubts shared by everyone was precisely: “What does ‘sustainability’ mean when we talk about the city?

40|$|From {{elementary}} school {{to high school}} we have been learning different types of geometry. Taxicab geometry {{is an example of}} non‐euclidean geometry. Although it has similar points with Euclidian geometry, it differs from Euclidian geometry in an area; in distance functions. <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> a new geometry. So, I have found taxicab geometry. When I researched about taxicab geometry, I have asked myself that “Could I turn this geometry into three dimensions?” My research subject is “Taxicab Geometry in Three Dimensions”. In {{the first part of the}} essay, my reasons of choosing this subject and an explanation of taxicab geometry are briefly given. After this quick information in the second part I will be proving Taxicab geometry is a metric*. Third part involves Euclidian geometry’s theorems for distance and theorems that are highly related to distance functions in three dimensions are given. Also formulas for distance in two dimensional taxicab geometry are given a. Furthermore, these theorems are taken as reference points for converting taxicab geometry to three dimensions. Distance function in two dimensions is converted to third dimension in this part. In the fourth part, sphere and cylinder which belongs to Euclidian geometry are recreated by me in taxicab geometry using the formulas that are found in the third part. The last part of the essay is about applications of taxicab geometry “Taxicab Geometry in Three Dimensions”. The taxicab space’s part in daily life, city planning and in buildings is explained by an example. To conclude, I will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> find answer to the question “Is it possible to convert sphere and cylinder from three dimensional Euclidian geometry to three dimensional taxicab geometry?...|$|R

When sending her first story to the editor of the literary magazine Slovenska Bčela she explained the choice of name by writing: [...] "Slavic sons are keen to show their strength and worth. Why should Slav daughters not have the same desire? This is why <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> write something in my own mild language and I dare send into daylight one story from my collection and ask you to include it in your publication. Let my name be Josipina Turnograjska, since Turn Castle is my home." [...] Her parents were Janez Urbančič and Josipina Tepinc, who belonged to the local Carniolan gentry. Her father died when she was eight. She was educated by private tutors at Turn Castle, particularly in music, religion, as well as in Latin and Italian. She taught herself French. After 1849 a new tutor expanded the subjects of her instruction to include Ancient Greek, natural sciences, and history, with a particular emphasis on Slovene and the history of Slavic peoples. This proved to be the catalyst for the awakening of a national enthusiasm in Josipina, which made her <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> become a writer. In 1850 she was engaged to Lovro Toman, a poet that would later become a successful lawyer and influential politician. Toman studied law in Graz and during their engagement the two maintained an extensive correspondence. More than a thousand letters survive, some up to twenty-five pages long. Their interest is not only in showing the relationship and feelings of two separated lovers, but also because they give an important insight into everyday life in the mid-19th century in the Slovene Lands. In 1853 they were married and due to Toman’s work moved permanently to Graz. Josipina died there a year later after a combination of complications at childbirth and measles. She was only 21.|$|R
