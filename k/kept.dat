5|$|Some {{species of}} beetle are <b>kept</b> as pets, for example diving beetles (Dytiscidae) may be <b>kept</b> in a {{domestic}} fresh water tank.|$|E
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually <b>kept</b> {{in a large}} pool, though occasionally they may be <b>kept</b> in pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E
5|$|Albino {{animals are}} often <b>kept</b> as pets, for example, African clawed frog, guinea pigs and peacocks.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is illegal}} in some states, capybaras are {{occasionally}} <b>kept</b> as pets in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Although not as {{significant}} as deforestation and hunting, some lemurs, such as crowned lemurs and other species that have successfully been <b>kept</b> in captivity, are occasionally <b>kept</b> as exotic pets by Malagasy people. Bamboo lemurs are also <b>kept</b> as pets, although they only survive {{for up to two}} months. Live capture for the exotic pet trade in wealthier countries is not normally considered a threat due to strict regulations controlling their export.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the Early Dynastic period III (earlier than 2500 BC), Mari was rebuilt and populated again. The new city <b>kept</b> many of the first city exterior features, including the internal rampart and gate. Also <b>kept</b> was the outer circular embankment measuring 1.9km in diameter, which was topped by a wall that is two meters thick, which is suitable for the protection of archers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be <b>kept</b> in zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be <b>kept</b> in high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and <b>kept</b> in cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|Before both battles, {{the uneven}} {{deployments}} were <b>kept</b> secret by controlling aerial reconnaissance through British air superiority.|$|E
5|$|Forster had a {{successful}} season with Celtic, winning a runner-up medal in the League Cup and Scottish Premier League. Between them, Forster and fellow goalkeeper Łukasz Załuska <b>kept</b> 23 clean sheets in the league, breaking Celtic's previous clean sheet record from the 2001–02 season. Forster <b>kept</b> 21 of the clean sheets. He capped off his season with a 3–0 victory over Motherwell to help Celtic win the Scottish Cup. In total, he <b>kept</b> 24 clean sheets in 44 matches for Celtic.|$|E

5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been <b>kept</b> in captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises <b>kept</b> worldwide, nearly 100 were <b>kept</b> in Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually <b>kept</b> in isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E
5|$|He {{found one}} Dries van Noten tie he wore during {{the film to}} his liking and <b>kept</b> it.|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} Premier League debut on 17 August in Southampton's first match of the season, a 2–1 defeat away at Liverpool. One week later, Forster <b>kept</b> his first clean sheet {{for the club}} in a goalless draw against West Bromwich Albion at home. By mid-October, and after eight Premier League matches, Forster had <b>kept</b> four clean sheets and conceded only five goals, {{at that time the}} best {{defensive}} record in the Premier League.|$|E
5|$|He was {{the last}} {{governor}} who <b>kept</b> up the maintenance of Kailua Fort.|$|E
5|$|Humans have <b>kept</b> {{honey bee}} colonies, {{commonly}} in hives, for millennia. Beekeepers collect honey, beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly from hives; bees are also <b>kept</b> to pollinate crops and to produce bees {{for sale to}} other beekeepers.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, no. 1976 was {{retired after}} it had lost braking power and crashed. After this, only {{selected}} trams were given overhauls, the last being no. 170 in 1980. Following the delivery of the articulated SL79, the Class B and E were gradually retired, with the last tram running into 1985. Oslo Tramway Museum has <b>kept</b> six trams, while Oslo Sporveier <b>kept</b> two, converted them to maintenance vehicles and painted them yellow with zebra stripes.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 Whitwell won {{the award}} for the best <b>kept</b> large village, in {{addition}} to {{the award for}} the overall island's best <b>kept</b> village, an award it has previously won in 2003. Judges from the competition were impressed by maintenance of bus stops, verges seats, commercial premises and gardens and the success of the new post office.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the Daily Telegraph {{reported}} that a prisoner serving a 27-year sentence was conducting a lone protest on the roof against conditions and was being cheered by other prisoners. The newspaper also referenced in its own report an interview with former lord chief justice Lord Woolf from {{earlier in the year}} where he described prisoners being <b>kept</b> in intolerable conditions–as bad as {{at the time of the}} riots. Woolf recommended prisons were <b>kept</b> out of politics.|$|E
5|$|In ancient times, Pugs were bred to be companions for ruling {{families}} in China. The pet Pugs were highly valued by Chinese Emperors, and the royal dogs were <b>kept</b> in luxury and guarded by soldiers. Pugs later {{spread to other}} parts of Asia. In Tibet, Buddhist monks <b>kept</b> Pugs as pets in their monasteries. The breed has retained its affectionate devotion to its owners since ancient times.|$|E
5|$|In the Middle Ages sheep were {{probably}} <b>kept</b> mainly for their milk and wool {{rather than their}} meat.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, {{the only}} other bridge across the Delaware River easily {{accessible}} for vehicular use was the covered bridge in Columbia, New Jersey and Portland, Pennsylvania. Drivers heading along the local roads (later designated as State Highway Route 5), often came to Darlington's Bridge first. The McCrackens collected tolls in large bushel baskets, which were often filled to the brim of quarters and half-dollars. Locals said that the McCrackens were sometimes spotted dropping these coins off the bridge and into the river below, although swimmers {{were never able to}} find anything of value to support the myth. Even though the bridge made a large sum of a money and the tollhouse was often filled with money, the place was never robbed for the money. This was because the McCrackens <b>kept</b> two Airedales in the tollhouse, named Duke and Totsey. They <b>kept</b> the place clear from thieves and to add insult to injury, <b>kept</b> people away from visiting the McCrackens at all. Duke and Totsey often <b>kept</b> people from getting money they may have dropped on the ground for people exiting their cars.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species are}} <b>kept</b> as pets, {{the most popular}} being mammals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. These are often anthropomorphised.|$|E

5|$|Maryland was <b>kept</b> {{out of the}} war {{following}} the kamikaze attacks.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be <b>kept</b> in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be <b>kept</b> in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were <b>kept</b> in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|No {{official}} {{records of}} the trial were <b>kept,</b> which led to considerable confusion in the future.|$|E
