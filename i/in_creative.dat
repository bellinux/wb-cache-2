40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{describe}} social relations, cooperation {{and the effect of}} membership for the perceived benefits of network membership <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> network, and to explain how strength of ties, trust, orientation to benefit, orientation to contribute and similarities affect knowledge enhancement and performance outcome <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> network. Creative networks are co-located firms of small-scale, self-employed creative workers with businesses <b>in</b> the <b>creative</b> industries like design, dance, music, media. The characteristic for businesses <b>in</b> the <b>creative</b> industries is that they produce products that have a symbolic value for the customer like image, ideas, emotions and experiences. Creativity is an individual trait and a social process. Social interactions with other <b>creative</b> workers <b>in</b> disparate <b>creative</b> fields is especially fruitful. A survey was carried out at a creative network, data was collected using a questionnaire and the results were analyzed through statistical methods. The findings suggest that there are strong ties and a norm of reciprocity <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> network. The findings also suggest that the membership firms benefit from network membership <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> network through valuable baby steps, but seem to be missing out of bigger leaps. The findings suggest that similarities and strong ties predict knowledge enhancement, and that similarities and orientation to benefit predict performance outcome, but that orientation to contribute does not predict knowledge enhancement or performance outcome <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> network. The findings also suggest that the membership firms <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> network wish for more cooperation. Validerat; 20141021 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R

Culture is one of the most challenging issues from creativity institutionalization aspect <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> organization due to its project based performance, high employee turnover and creative nature of employees. A qualitative research method, based on scientific analysis allowed to reveal what features of a culture influence creativity <b>in</b> a <b>creative</b> organization.

5|$|Having {{become the}} Goblin, he {{generally}} views other people as dim-witted pests, lacking <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> vision, unworthy to be graced by his presence.

When he first learned Spider-Man's identity, he claimed that, when Spider-Man had defeated him in their previous battles, none of those victories counted because Spider-Man had only beaten his lackeys, or been rescued by the intervention of other super powered beings such as the Human Torch, despite the fact that he always departed the battles after Spider-Man's victories rather than trying to defeat his foe himself.|$|E
5|$|Sjumandjaja {{was born}} in Batavia (modern day Jakarta), Dutch East Indies, and grew up there. During high school, he became {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> writing and acting, eventually joining the Senen Artists' Group. In 1956, {{when one of his}} short stories was adapted into a film, Sjumandjaja became active in the filmmaking industry, writing two films for the production company Persari. After receiving a government scholarship, he moved to Moscow and attended the All-Union State Institute of Cinematography. Upon returning to Indonesia in 1965, Sjumandjaja took a job at the Ministry of Information and continued writing screenplays. In 1971, after leaving the ministry, he directed his first feature film, Lewat Tengah Malam (Past Midnight). He continued to write and direct films until his death from a heart attack on 19 July 1985.|$|E
5|$|Students explore broad {{learning}} themes at {{each level}} {{that allow them to}} learn across subjects and engage them <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> and collaborative projects. The second group, for example, spends much of their year on the study of trees, using trees as a focus for biology, mathematics, art, and creative writing. Students adopt and study a personal space in the nearby forest preserve. The year culminates with the tapping of maple trees to make syrup, which they share {{with the rest of the}} school. Each group engages different themes and group projects. Lower school students simulate an airplane flight to Paris and host a Japanese luncheon. The fourth group holds a Native American Fair, the fifth group creates an original Egyptian style mastaba, the sixth group presents a World's Fair, and the eighth group organizes an Immigration and Ethnic Fair.|$|E

5|$|Students must {{audition}} for admission; fewer than 20percent {{of those who}} apply each year are accepted. SCPA is free to CPS students but also attracts tuition-paying students from outside the district and the state. The newly combined school will serve approximately 1,300 students in 2010, offering a curriculum designed {{to prepare students for}} professional careers <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> writing, dance, drama, music, technical theater, and visual art. The emphasis is on performance, and students in every field are required to perform or present their work in public regularly. Students compete successfully in arts competitions locally and internationally. On standardized tests, SCPA ranks second among Cincinnati public schools. Ninety percent of graduating seniors continue on to college, and those students receive one of the highest levels of scholarship funding in the city. A limited number of extracurricular activities are offered, as students are expected to commit significant after-school time to training and performance. SCPA has produced notable graduates {{in a wide range of}} artistic fields, including award-winning actors, singers, directors and technicians.|$|E
5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written in BASIC by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II in BASIC. Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year or so later, all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them <b>in</b> <b>Creative</b> Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games.|$|E
5|$|The UChicago Arts program joins {{academic}} {{departments and}} {{programs in the}} Division of the Humanities and the College, as well as professional organizations including the Court Theatre, the Oriental Institute, the Smart Museum of Art, the Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations. The university has an artist-in-residence program and scholars in performance studies, contemporary art criticism, and film history. It has offered a doctorate in music composition since 1933 and in cinema and media studies since 2000, a master {{of fine arts in}} visual arts (early 1970s), and a master of arts in the humanities with a creative writing track (2000). It has bachelor's degree programs in visual arts, music, and art history, and, more recently, cinema and media studies (1996) and theater and performance studies (2002). The College's general education core includes a “dramatic, musical, and visual arts” requirement, inviting students to study the history of the arts, stage desire, or begin working with sculpture. Several thousand major and non-major undergraduates enroll annually <b>in</b> <b>creative</b> and performing arts classes. UChicago is often considered the birthplace of improvisational comedy as the Compass Players student comedy troupe evolved into The Second City improv theater troupe in 1959. The Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts opened in October 2012, five years after a $35 million gift from alumnus David Logan and his wife Reva. The center includes spaces for exhibitions, performances, classes, and media production. The Logan Center was designed by Tod Williams and Billie Tsien. This building is actually entirely glass. The brick is a facade designed to keep the glass safe from the wind. The architects later removed sections of the bricks when pressure arose in the form of complaints that the views of the city were blocked.|$|E
