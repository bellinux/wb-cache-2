50|$|Round-trip {{engineering}} {{is closely related}} to traditional software engineering disciplines: <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> (creating software from specifications), reverse engineering (creating specifications from existing software), and reengineering (understanding existing software and modifying it). Round-trip {{engineering is}} often wrongly defined as simply supporting both forward and reverse engineering. In fact, the key characteristic of round-trip engineering that distinguishes it from forward and reverse engineering is the ability to synchronize existing artifacts that evolved concurrently by incrementally updating each artifact to reflect changes made to the other artifacts. Furthermore, <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> {{can be seen as a}} special instance of RTE in which only the specification is present and reverse engineering can be seen as a special instance of RTE in which only the software is present. Many reengineering activities can also be understood as RTE when the software is updated to reflect changes made to the previously reverse engineered specification.|$|E

50|$|OMG focuses Model-driven {{architecture}} on <b>forward</b> <b>engineering,</b> i.e. producing code from abstract, human-elaborated modelling diagrams (e.g. class diagrams). OMG's ADTF (Analysis and Design Task Force) group leads this effort. With some humour, {{the group}} chose ADM (MDA backwards) {{to name the}} study of reverse engineering. ADM decodes to Architecture-Driven Modernization. The objective of ADM is to produce standards for model-based reverse engineering of legacy systems. Knowledge Discovery Metamodel (KDM) is the furthest along of these efforts, and describes information systems in terms of various assets (programs, specifications, data, test files, database schemas, etc.).|$|E

5000|$|Idealistic: MDA is {{conceived}} as a <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> approach in which models that incorporate Action Language programming are transformed into implementation artifacts (e.g. executable code, database schema) in one direction via a fully or partially automated [...] "generation" [...] step. This aligns with OMG's vision that MDA should allow modelling of a problem domain's full complexity in UML (and related standards) with subsequent transformation to a complete (executable) application. This approach does, however, imply that changes to implementation artifacts (e.g. database schema tuning) are not supported [...] This constitutes a problem in situations where such post-transformation [...] "adapting" [...] of implementation artifacts is seen to be necessary. Evidence that the full MDA approach may be too idealistic for some real world deployments has {{been seen in the}} rise of so-called [...] "pragmatic MDA". Pragmatic MDA blends the literal standards from OMG's MDA with more traditional model driven mechanisms such as round-trip engineering that provides support for adapting implementation artifacts.|$|E
5000|$|The {{repaired}} car {{was then}} acquired by Nigel Dawes at a Sotheby's auction at Donington Park in April 1978. Dawes left {{the car as}} it was for several years, but hoped to get hold of the original engine which was sold on after the crash, but this had ended up being a spare for DP214 and converted to wet sump. Dawes then bought a 12 plug head, like the original and by luck obtained a 4.2-litre engine (engine no. 1293/420/2) taken from the Indianapolis Cooper-Aston in America. <b>Forward</b> <b>Engineering</b> then restored the engine remaking the dry sump system close to the original. Rubery Owen repaired the chassis based on the original drawings. Both the chassis and engine were then sent to Andy Chapman of Chapman Spooner who restored the engine to its former glory. With the engine producing [...] at 5,750 rpm (330 lbs/ft of torque) and three 50 DCO Weber carburettors were sourced and added at great expense. Also, a lighter version of a 5-speed gearbox was fitted in the place of the ZF gearbox. The body shell was restored by Dawes with help of the original designer of the Le Mans series of cars, Ted Cutting. With a new roll cage being incorporated and a new fuel tank made as a copy of the original.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Both {{transcriptional}} {{control and}} microRNA (miRNA) control are critical regulatory mechanisms for cells to direct their destinies. At present, the combinatorial regulatory network composed of transcriptional regulations and post-transcriptional regulations is often constructed through a <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> strategy {{that is based}} solely on searching of transcriptional factor binding sites or miRNA seed regions in the putative target sequences. If the reverse engineering strategy is integrated with the <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> strategy, a more accurate and more specific combinatorial regulatory network will be obtained. Results In this work, utilizing both sequence-matching information and parallel expression datasets of miRNAs and mRNAs, we integrated <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> with reverse engineering strategies {{and as a result}} built a hypothetical combinatorial gene regulatory network in human cancer. The credibility of the regulatory relationships in the network was validated by random permutation procedures and supported by authoritative experimental evidence-based databases. The global and local architecture properties of the combinatorial regulatory network were explored, and the most important tumor-regulating miRNAs and TFs were highlighted from a topological point of view. Conclusions By integrating the <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> and reverse engineering strategies, we manage to sketch a genome-scale combinatorial gene regulatory network in human cancer, which includes transcriptional regulations and miRNA regulations, allowing systematic study of cancer gene regulation. Our work establishes a pipeline that can be extended to reveal conditional combinatorial regulatory landscapes correlating to specific cellular contexts. </p...|$|E

40|$|The role {{of design}} {{patterns}} in <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> is well known, also if it’s {{not easy to}} use them, since large experience is needed. Different approaches and tools have been proposed in the literature to enhance and support the design process respect to design patterns exploitation. Also the role of design patterns in reverse engineering has been largely studied. In this paper, we describe a tool for design pattern recognition {{to be used in}} <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> as a kind of reuse advisor. As finding the right solution, or better finding the right pattern involves modeling some kind of similarity, we explore and propose some possible similarity-based techniques {{that could be used for}} design pattern recognition. 1...|$|E
40|$|Clear, {{comprehensive}} {{definition is}} essential in establishing an enactable, measurable, and repeatable reverse engineering process. Process definition represented using complementary, textual and graphic notations (integrated process definition) enhances clarity and helps to insure coverage of significant process issues. The benefits of integrated process definition apply to Reengineering and its component processes, Reverse Engineering and <b>Forward</b> <b>Engineering.</b> Reverse Engineering is generally performed in an ad-hoc manner, often lagging behind <b>Forward</b> <b>Engineering</b> in incorporating new technology such as integrated process definition.

40|$|An {{approach}} to system verification {{is described in}} which design artefacts produced during <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> are automatically compared to corresponding artefacts produced during reverse engineering. The goal is to automatically determine if an implementation {{is consistent with the}} original design. In the system described, XML Metadata Interchange (XMI) representations of Unified Modelling Language (UML) class diagrams are recovered from compiled Java class files. These are automatically compared with the corresponding diagrams produced during <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> by software engineers using CASE tools. Examples are provided in which reversed engineered UML class diagrams differ from those produced during <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> but are still faithful to the original design intent. Such differences are often due to more abstract system representations being captured in forward engineered design artefacts, the inclusion of design attributes and annotations that are not retained in the final implementation, and issues {{associated with the use of}} weakly typed containers. In other cases, differences indicate a deviation from the intended design. It is this latter type of difference that this paper is particularly interested in identifying. We advocate that an automated comparison of forward and reverse engineering artefacts should be performed during formal code inspection preparation and used to guide human review of the identified differences. ...|$|E

40|$|Re-engineering {{transforms}} a final {{user interface}} into a logical representation that is manipulable {{enough to allow}} <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> to port a UI from one computing platform to another with maximum flexibility and minimal effort. Re-engineering is used to adapt a UI to another context. This adaptation is governed by two main tasks: the adaptation of the code itself to the new computing platform and the redesign of the UI to better suit the new constraints of the target platform (interaction capabilities, screen size,…). To support this process, we have developed a reverse engineering tool that allows a flexible recovery of the presentation model from Web sites, adapting the reverse engineering to the target platforms, and a <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> tool that converts this model into any final executable UI, in particular expressed in VRML...|$|E
40|$|Reverse Engineering {{is focused}} on the {{challenging}} task of understanding legacy program code without having suitable documentation. Using a transformational <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> perspective, we gain the insight that much of this difficulty is caused by design decisions made during system development. Such decisions "hide" the program functionality and performance requirements in the final system by applying repeated refinements through layers of abstraction, and information-spreading optimizations, both of which change representations and force single program entities to serve multiple purposes. To be able to reverse engineer, we essentially have to reverse these design decisions. Following the transformational approach we can use the transformations of a <b>forward</b> <b>engineering</b> methodology and apply them "backwards" to reverse engineer code to a more abstract specification. Since most existing code was not generated by transformational synthesis, this produces a plausible formal [...] ...|$|E
