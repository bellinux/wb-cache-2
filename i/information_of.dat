Although, literature suggest that <b>information</b> sharing, quality <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> compatibility <b>of</b> <b>information</b> system have a positive impact on both cost reduction and service improvement in VMI program, this study shows that there is a limited effect on cost performance.

Telecommunication occurs when the exchange of information between communication participants includes the use of technology.

Since the Latin term communicatio is considered the social process of information exchange, the term, telecommunications, is often used in its plural form because it involves many different technologies.|$|E
