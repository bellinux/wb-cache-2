5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the}} fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> hit by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive to changes in the business cycle. The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E

5|$|The Byzantine <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> {{among the}} most {{advanced}} in Europe and the Mediterranean for many centuries. Europe, in particular, could not match Byzantine economic strength {{until late in the}} Middle Ages. Constantinople operated as a prime hub in a trading network that at various times extended across nearly all of Eurasia and North Africa, in particular as the primary western terminus of the famous Silk Road. Until {{the first half of the}} 6th century and in sharp contrast with the decaying West, the Byzantine <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> flourishing and resilient.|$|E

The <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> estimated to have returned to 8 percent growth in 2010. According to Eurostat data, Turkish GDP per capita adjusted by purchasing power standard stood at 52 percent of the EU average in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The second kingdom's <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} both {{agriculture}} and trade. The <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> centralized and directed through a communal organization, where grains were stored in communal granaries, and distributed amongst the population according to social statues. The organization also controlled the animal herds in the kingdom. Some people were {{directly connected to}} the palace instead of the communal organization, those included the metal and textile producers and the military officials. Ebla was an important trading partner and rival, Mari's position made it an important trading center as it controlled the road linking between the Levant and Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, the {{nationwide}} prohibition of alcohol in 1919 brought heavy losses to the St. Louis brewing industry.

50|$|An {{informal}} <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> {{economic activity}} that is neither taxed nor monitored by a government, contrasted with a formal economy.

5|$|By 1987, {{unemployment}} was falling, the <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> {{stable and}} strong and inflation was low. Opinion polls showed a comfortable Conservative lead, and local council election results had also been successful, prompting Thatcher to call a general election for 11 June that year, despite the deadline for an election still being 12 months away.

5000|$|Planned <b>economies</b> <b>are</b> held in {{contrast}} with command economies, where a planned <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> [...] "an economic {{system in which the}} government controls and regulates production, distribution, prices, etc." [...] but a command economy, while also having this type of regulation, necessarily has substantial public ownership of industry. Therefore, command <b>economies</b> <b>are</b> planned <b>economies,</b> but not necessarily the reverse.|$|R

5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from the crops grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish <b>economy</b> <b>was</b> the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E
