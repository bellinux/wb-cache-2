5|$|Agriculture {{remained}} by far {{the most}} important part of the English economy during the 12thand 13th centuries. There remained a wide variety in English agriculture, influenced by local geography; in areas where grain could not be grown, other resources were exploited instead. In the Weald, for example, agriculture centred on grazing animals on the woodland pastures, whilst in the Fens fishing and bird-hunting was supplemented by basket-making and peat-cutting. In some locations, such as Lincolnshire and Droitwich, salt manufacture was important, including production for the export market. Fishing became an important trade along the English coast, especially in Great Yarmouth and Scarborough, and the herring was a particularly popular catch; salted at the coast, it could then be shipped inland or exported to Europe. Piracy between competing English fishing fleets was not unknown during the period. Sheep were the most common <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> in England during the period, their numbers doubling by the 14th century. Sheep became increasingly widely used for wool, particularly in the Welsh borders, Lincolnshire and the Pennines. Pigs remained popular on holdings because of their ability to scavenge for food. Oxen remained the primary plough animal, with horses used more widely on farms in the south of England towards the end of the 12th century. Rabbits were introduced from France in the 13th century and farmed for their meat in special warrens.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} cloning a {{particular}} <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> using SCNT is relatively {{the same for}} all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use. The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm. This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current. This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.|$|E

Other debates range around {{the potential for a}} large dairy such as this to improve food security and opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint of milk production through better efficiency and the adoption of technology such as anaerobic digestion. More recently the Government has published its Foresight report on Food and Farming, and the dairy's developers have asserted that their plans would help address the report's conclusions that farming needs to produce more food using fewer resources while tackling climate change.|$|E
25|$|Due to high {{government}} production quotas, peasants received, as a rule, {{less for}} their labor {{than they did}} before collectivization, and some refused to work. Merle Fainsod estimated that, in 1952, collective farm earnings were only one fourth of the cash income from private plots on Soviet collective farms. In many cases, the immediate effect of collectivization was to reduce output and {{cut the number of}} livestock in half. The subsequent recovery of the agricultural production was also impeded by the losses suffered by the Soviet Union during World War II and the severe drought of 1946. However the largest loss of livestock was caused by collectivization for all animals except pigs. The numbers of cows in the USSR fell from 33.2 million in 1928 to 27.8 million in 1941 and to 24.6 million in 1950. The number of pigs fell from 27.7 million in 1928 to 27.5 million in 1941 and then to 22.2 million in 1950. The number of sheep fell from 114.6 million in 1928 to 91.6 million in 1941 and to 93.6 million in 1950. The number of horses fell from 36.1 million in 1928 to 21.0 million in 1941 and to 12.7 million in 1950. Only by the late 1950s did Soviet <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> stocks begin to approach 1928 levels.|$|E
500|$|The main <b>farm</b> <b>animal</b> in the {{lowlands}} remained cattle until the 18th century. In the uplands, sheep were kept, {{and if any}} cereal was grown, it was oats. Transhumance was practised, people moving with their animals from a low-lying [...] "hendre" [...] farm in winter, to an upland [...] "hafod" [...] farmhouse in summer. Transhumance declined through the 18th century and collapsed at its end as land was enclosed, both upland and lowland. Over 81,000 hectares of Welsh common land was rapidly enclosed and attached to existing landholdings between 1793 and 1815.|$|E

500|$|McClymont's work {{experiences}} {{caused him}} to feel disastified {{with the quality of}} education he had received in his degree program at Sydney. [...] He felt the veterinary science specialization was too narrow, especially in the area of animal husbandry and livestock production.

[...] For example, as an undergraduate, he received only three lectures on statistics, a skill he had to teach himself during his first few years as an animal nutritionist advisor. [...] As a result, he took an interest in education and curriculum development. [...] McClymont later said that he had [...] "seen the educational deficiencies of narrow specialization, whether of veterinary graduates as specialists in animal health and disease or of agricultural science graduates as specialists in aspects of soil and plants.

500|$|In June 1952, two lecturers in {{veterinary}} {{science at}} the University of Sydney, Doug Blood and Jim Steel, {{wrote a letter to}} the Australian Veterinary Journal complaining of their university's placement of animal husbandry as a subordinate topic within veterinary science.

[...] McClymont saw the letter and responded with his own missive to the journal in June 1953. [...] In his letter, McClymont opined that the field in question should instead be called [...] "animal production" [...] and that it should, [...] "be defined as the integration of animal husbandry and agronomy (the science of pasture and crop production), or in more general terms, manipulation of the soil-plant-animal complex, for the purpose of economic production of animal products." [...] He added that the university-level training in the field should include, [...] "extension work, research, and commercial applications."
