40|$|Abstract. Through {{analysis}} of the dynamics process of <b>hydraulic</b> rock <b>drill,</b> this paper builds {{a model of the}} impact mechanism of <b>hydraulic</b> rock <b>drill</b> with AMESim software, obtains curves of the displacements of the piston and valve core, and gets the pressure of the piston chamber. The dynamic {{analysis of}} the results indicates that the model of the impact mechanism of <b>hydraulic</b> rock <b>drill</b> agrees well with the principle of <b>hydraulic</b> rock <b>drill.</b> As a result, this research provides a new theoretical basis and method for the <b>hydraulic</b> rock <b>drill...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> perforator, which {{takes into account the}} effect of the reciprocating movement of the drill mounted on a flexible shaft, as well as the effect of the physical and mechanical properties of reservoirs, on the operation processes. The transition process during channel perforation by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> perforator is modeled. The calculation results for the mathematical model of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>drilling</b> perforator demonstrate that due to the concurrent use of both rotational and reciprocating movement of the drill mounted on a flexible shaft, it is possible to reduce the time spent for the perforation of a single channel in a productive formation by a drilling perforator by up to 90...|$|R
