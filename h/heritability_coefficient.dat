5000|$|One of {{the ways}} in which {{researchers}} attempt to dissect the relative influence of genetic and environmental factors on personality (and individual differences more generally) is a broad investigative technique loosely grouped under the heading of [...] "twin studies". For example, in one approach to twin studies, researchers compare the personality scores of monozygotic (MZ) or identical twins reared together to dizygotic (DZ) or fraternal twins reared together. Because both types of twins in this design are reared together, all twin pairs are regarded as having shared a 100% common environment. In contrast, the monozygotic twins share 100% of their genes whereas the dizygotic twins only share about 50% of their genes. Therefore, for any given personality trait, it is possible to parcel out genetic influences by first obtaining the MZ correlation (reflecting 100% common environment and 100% shared genes) and subtracting the DZ correlation (reflecting 100% common environment and 50% shared genes). This difference represents 50% of the genetic influence; doubled, this number is said to account for 100% of the genetic influence, and is one way to derive an index of heritability (sometimes called the <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficient</b> and represented as h2). Similarly, MZ - h2 may be regarded as an estimate of the influence of the common environment. Finally, because individual differences and the environment are supposed to account for the totality of behavior, it is said that subtracting the sum of h2 and the common environment influence from 1 is equal to the influence of unique or non-shared environments.|$|E

About 1933 farrows of 614 Czech Large White sows were included. The hypothesis that progeny of sows from hyperprolific subpopulation breed in multiplier herds have higher litter size traits was tested. Effects on the growth performance traits are reported so. Though the applied {{selection pressure}} {{on the number of}} functional nipples was low, these traits have remarkably increased in the HP subpopulation. Likewise, both studied growth performance traits reacted positively on the selection pressure and the differences between populations were highly significant. Surprisingly, no significant differences in litter size traits were found either in the first or in the first to fifth parity. The results outlined that the selection criteria applied in the breeding herds can efficiently increase the traits with middle or high <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficients</b> in multiplier herds.

Müell, Arg. ] halfsib progenies using the míxed-model methodology (Reml/Blup procedure). The rubber tree progenies were obtained from a second generation population produced from the recombination of 30 original parents, pertaining to the Instituto Agronômico de Campinas (IAC) in São Paulo state. At the age of eight months the variables were evaluated. Results demonstrated the existence of significant genetic variability among the progenies for the studied traits. The estimates of the <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficient</b> showed moderate values for both height and leaf-storey number, and low values for plant diameter {{at the base of}} the plant. There are good possibilities of genetic gain for these main traits in the context of the improvement program that was started in Mato Grosso do Sul state. 200...|$|E
40|$|The major {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to estimate heritability and genetic correlations between milk yield (MY) and calving interval (CI) and lactation length (LL) in Murrah buffaloes using Bayesian inference. The database used belongs to the genetic improvement program of four buffalo herds from Brazil. To obtain the estimates of variance and covariance, bivariate analyses were performed with the Gibbs sampler, using the program MTGSAM. The <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficient</b> estimates were 0. 28, 0. 03 and 0. 15 for MY, CI and LL, respectively. The genetic correlations between MY and LL was moderate (0. 48). However, the genetic correlation between MY and CI showed large HPD regions (highest posterior density interval). Milk yield was the only trait with clear potential for genetic improvement by direct mass selection. The genetic correlation between MY and LL indicates that indirect selection using milk yield is a potentially beneficial strategy. The interpretation of the estimated genetic correlation between MY and CI is difficult and could be spurious...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "mutualism" [...] {{model of}} g proposes that {{cognitive}} processes are initially uncorrelated, {{but that the}} positive manifold arises during individual development due to mutual beneficial relations between cognitive processes. Thus {{there is no single}} process or capacity underlying the positive correlations between tests. During the course of development, the theory holds, any one particularly efficient process will benefit other processes, with the result that the processes will end up being correlated with one another. Thus similarly high IQs in different persons may stem from quite different initial advantages that they had. Critics have argued that the observed correlations between the g loadings and the <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of subtests are problematic for the mutualism theory.|$|R
40|$|Five {{sunflower}} hybrids (Albena, Super Start, Zora, Santafe and San Luka) {{and their}} parental lines (2607, 1234, 1607, 147 R, RW- 666, RF- 673 and 19 R) were tested on a block design in four replication {{in the course}} of two years. The highest phenotypic and genotypic coefficients of variation were recorded for seed yield per plant followed by the number of seeds per plant and 1000 seed weight, while the lowest value was observed at 50 % flowering. The <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficients</b> in a broad sense were high in all characters and ranged from 69. 74 % to 96. 96 %. Correlation between the main quantitative characters found a positive correlation with the seed yield per plant. Oil content was lower but not significantly correlated concerning the head diameter, the 1000 -seed weight, the plant height, the stem diameter and the days to 50 % flowering...|$|R
25|$|Livesley et al. concluded, in {{agreement}} with other studies, that narcissism as measured by a standardized test was a common inherited trait. Additionally, in similar agreement with those other studies, {{it was found that}} there exists a continuum between normal and disordered personality. The study subjects were 175 volunteer twin pairs (ninety identical, eighty-five fraternal) drawn from the general population. Each twin completed a questionnaire that assessed eighteen dimensions of personality disorder. The authors estimated the heritability of each dimension of personality by standard methods, thus providing estimates of the relative contributions of genetic and environmental causation. Of the eighteen personality dimensions, narcissism was found to have the highest heritability (0.64), indicating that the concordance of this trait in the identical twins was significantly influenced by genetics. Of the other dimensions of personality, only four were found to have <b>heritability</b> <b>coefficients</b> of greater than 0.5: callousness, identity problems, oppositionality and social avoidance.|$|R
