40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this in vitro study was to {{evaluate}} and compare the fracture resistance and fracture mode of extensive indirect <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> composite resin restorations performed for endodontically treated premolars. Materials and methods: A total of 55 extracted maxillary premolars were randomly divided into four groups. The first group (n =  15) remained untreated {{to serve as a}} positive control; the second group (n =  15) was endodontically treated with <b>inlay</b> cavities prepared <b>and</b> restored with indirect composite inlay restorations; the third group (n =  15) was also endodontically treated with <b>onlay</b> cavities prepared <b>and</b> restored with indirect composite <b>onlay</b> restorations; <b>and</b> the fourth group (n =  10) was endodontically treated with mesio-occlusodistal (MOD) cavities prepared and left unrestored to serve as negative controls. Dual cure indirect composite resin was used to fabricate the <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> restorations performed for the second and third groups, respectively. All teeth were subjected to compressive axial loading test using a metal ball (6  mm in diameter) in a universal testing machine (Instron 1195) with a cross-head speed of 0. 5  mm/min until a fracture occurred. Statistical analysis of fracture resistance and fracture mode were performed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) (α =  0. 05) and Kruskal–Wallis (α =  0. 05) tests, respectively. Results: For the four treatment groups, the mean fracture resistance values were 1326. 9  N, 1500. 1  N, 1006. 1  N, and 702. 7  N, respectively. Statistical analyses showed {{no significant differences between the}} mean fracture resistance of the intact tooth group <b>and</b> the <b>inlay</b> restoration group (p >  0. 05), while significant differences were observed between the mean fracture resistance of all the other groups (p <  0. 05). The Kruskal–Wallis test showed statistically significant differences between the fracture modes of the four groups. Conclusion: Within the limitations of this study, endodontically treated teeth were successfully restored with indirect composite <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> restorations. However, the fractures that accompanied the inlay restorations were more severe and were unable to be restored...|$|R
40|$|The {{expanded}} endonasal approach provides {{access to}} the entire ventral skull base for resection of neoplasms involving the skull base and brain. The creation of large defects of the bone and dura endoscopically presents unique reconstructive challenges. A layered reconstruction of the dura with <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> fascial grafts covered with fat grafts is an effective technique for repair. An intranasal balloon catheter is used to provide counterpressure in the early phase of healing and a lumbar spinal drain is a useful adjunct in patients at increased risk of a cerebrospinal fluid leak.

50|$|The most coronal {{position}} of untouched tooth structure (that is, the continual line of original, undrilled tooth structure {{at or near}} the gum line) {{is referred to as the}} margin. This margin will be the future continual line of tooth-to-restoration contact, and should be a smooth, well-defined delineation so that the restoration, no matter how it is fabricated, can be properly adapted and not allow for any openings visible to the naked eye, however slight. An acceptable distance from tooth margin to restoration margin is anywhere from 40-100 μm. However, the R.V.

The benefits and drawbacks of intraperitoneal onlay mesh technique (IPOM) are given in detail. Standard tension-free procedures in surgery of inguinal hernias are described. The important steps in prosthetic repair of medial defects in abdominal wall are estimated. There are considered the features and results of applying sublay, <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> procedures. The possibilities of preperitoneal, intraabdominal, and retromuscular placement of synthetic endoprostheses are discussed. Adverse sequela of plasty, and its suspected pathogenetic mechanisms are considered. The ways in prophylaxis of complications are shown: mesh isolation, anti-adhesive covering, sutureless and glue fixation of endoprosthesis, development of new synthetic materials. Based on the analysis of literature reports we have concluded that the danger of intraabdominal complications after IPOM is exaggerated. Tension-free intraperitoneal plasty with synthetic endoprostheses in abdominal wall hernias is a simple and reliable surgical approach...|$|R
40|$|Background: The pedicled TRAM flap {{has been}} a {{workhorse}} of autologous breast reconstruction for decades. However, there {{has been a}} rising concern about the abdominal wall donor site morbidity with the use of conventional TRAM flap. This has generally been cited as {{one of the main reasons}} for resorting to "abdominal wall friendly" techniques. This study has been undertaken to assess the abdominal wall function in patients with pedicled TRAM flap breast reconstruction. The entire width of the muscle and the overlying wide disk of anterior rectus sheath were harvested with the TRAM flap in all our patients and the anterior rectus sheath defect was repaired by a Proline mesh. Materials and Methods: Abdominal wall function was studied in 21 patients who underwent simultaneous primary unipedicled TRAM flap reconstruction after mastectomy for cancer. In all the patients, the abdominal wall defect was repaired using wide sheet of Proline mesh both as <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay.</b> The assessment tools included straight and rotational curl ups and a subjective questionnaire. The abdominal wall was also examined for any asymmetry, bulge, or hernia. The minimal follow-up was 6 months postoperative. The objective results were compared with normal unoperated volunteers. Results and Conclusions: The harvesting the TRAM flap certainly results in changes to the anterior abdominal wall that can express themselves to a variable degree. A relatively high incidence of asymptomatic asymmetry of the abdomen was seen. There was total absence of hernia in our series even after a mean follow-up period of 15. 5 months. A few patients were only able to partially initiate the sit up movement and suffered an important loss of strength. In most patients, synergists took over the functional movement but as the load increased, flexion and rotation performances decreased. The lack of correlation between exercise tests and the results of the questionnaire suggests that this statistically significant impairment was functionally not important. The patients encountered little or no difficulty in theis day-to-day activities. Our modification of use of a wide mesh as <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> repair minimizes the donor site morbidity. This also avoids maneuvers meant for primary closure of the rectus sheath defects, which can result in distortion of umbilicus. Therefore, in conclusion, the unipedicled TRAM flap should be regarded as a valuable option in breast reconstruction provided careful repair of the abdominal wall defect is undertaken using Proline mesh...|$|R
40|$|Mesh has firmly supplanted {{primary use}} of suture closure for the repair of ventral / incisional hernias.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the occlusal {{morphology}} of partial crown reconstructions made by dental technicians with reconstructions made by a fully automatic software process (biogeneric tooth model) in relation to the original natural tooth shape. Material and methods: Stone replicas of natural teeth were measured three-dimensionally before preparing <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> cavities for ceramic restorations (n[*]=[*] 5). For each preparation, five reconstructions (in total n[*]=[*] 25) were made by five dental technicians. Additionally, reconstructions were calculated automatically by a software based on the biogeneric tooth model (Cerec 3 D). In order to compare the two different kinds of reconstruction, an objective metrical similarity measure (shape similarity value, SSV) based on calculated volumes between compared datasets was used. Results: In 22 of 25 cases, the reconstructions made by the CAD software were closer to the original situation than the reconstructions made by the technicians. Mean average SSV of reconstructions made by the technicians (310. 2 [*]±[*] 78. 8 μm) was significantly higher (p[*]<[*] 0. 05) than mean SSV of CAD reconstructions (biogeneric model) (222. 0 [*]±[*] 47. 7 μm). Conclusions: In the design of naturally shaped occlusal inlay/onlay surfaces, a fully automatic CAD system can be at least as good as conventional wax-ups by dental technicians. Clinical relevance: The adjustment of a dental restoration to fit the morphology of surrounding tooth structures, still presents challenges for the dentist...|$|R
40|$|This {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis aimed {{to evaluate the}} survival rate of ceramic <b>and</b> resin <b>inlays,</b> <b>onlays,</b> <b>and</b> overlays and to identify the complication types associated with the main clinical outcomes. Two reviewers searched PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for articles published between 1983 through April 2015, conforming to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for {{systematic review}}s. Clinical studies meeting the following criteria were included: 1) studies related to resin <b>and</b> ceramic <b>inlays,</b> <b>onlays,</b> <b>and</b> overlays; 2) prospective, retrospective, or randomized controlled trials conducted in humans; 3) studies with a dropout rate of less than 30 %; and 4) studies with a follow-up longer than 5 y. Of 1, 389 articles, 14 met the inclusion criteria. The meta-regression indicated {{that the type of}} ceramic material (feldspathic porcelain vs. glass-ceramic), study design (retrospective vs. prospective), follow-up time (5 vs. 10 y), and study setting (university vs. private clinic) did not affect the survival rate. Estimated survival rates for glass-ceramics and feldspathic porcelain were between 92 % and 95 % at 5 y (n = 5, 811 restorations) and were 91 % at 10 y (n = 2, 154 restorations). Failures were related to fractures/chipping (4 %), followed by endodontic complications (3 %), secondary caries (1 %), debonding (1 %), and severe marginal staining (0 %). Odds ratios (95 % confidence intervals) were 0. 19 (0. 04 to 0. 96) and 0. 54 (0. 17 to 1. 69) for pulp vitality and type of tooth involved (premolars vs. molars), respectively.

40|$|Ceramics {{have been}} {{increasingly}} becoming the prevalent materials {{of choice for}} such major prosthetic restoration as crowns and bridges. Their performance has been under much scrutiny as the key factors involved are investigated and identified for ensuring clinical success. However, long-term function in the oral cavity (mastication), and such problems as manufacturing defects, bruxism, or an impact accident, can lead to porcelain fracture. This {{has become a major}} barrier limiting more extensive exploitation of ceramic materials to fully replace metals in major dental restorative procedures such as multi-unit fixed partial dentures (FPDs), where tensile stresses may be substantial. This thesis aims to apply the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) to prediction of crack initiation and propagation in all-ceramic dental prostheses. XFEM analyses were conducted to not only help quantify stress concentration and distribution, but also inherently accommodate the failure criteria from a fracture mechanics perspective. The modelling validation was performed by comparing the XFEM simulation with the in-vitro experiments. Fractographic analysis has also been introduced to define the cause of failures, as well as to identify the role of residual stresses, and pre-existing flaws on the longevity of dental restorations. Through the eight research projects conducted in this thesis, including thermal induced fracture of core-veneered ceramic structures, fracture behaviours of <b>inlay</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlay</b> FPDs, XFEM based topology optimization of all-ceramic structures, and fracture simulations of caries restorations and crowns, XFEM has been demonstrated to be an effective tool for analysing the fracture behaviours and optimising ceramic prostheses for enhancing longevity of various restorations. The outcomes generated in this thesis provided dentists and dental technicians with fundamental understanding in the fracture mechanics for a range of all-ceramic dental prostheses, thereby obtaining clinical guide for enhancing the fracture strength of the structure.

Prosthodontists are specialist dentists who have undertaken training recognized by academic institutions in this field. Fixed prosthodontics can be used to restore single or multiple teeth, spanning areas where teeth have been lost. In general, the main advantages of fixed prosthodontics when compared to direct restorations is the superior strength when used in large restorations, and the ability to create an aesthetic looking tooth. As with any dental restoration, principles used to determine the appropriate restoration involves consideration of the materials to be used, extent of tooth destruction, orientation and location of tooth, and condition of neighboring teeth.|$|R
40|$|To date, {{treating}} vertical food impaction {{with open}} contact effectively, especially with an atraumatic therapy, remains a challenge. In this study, {{we developed a}} simple, atraumatic, and economic therapeutic measure to treat vertical food impaction.

50|$|Gold {{fillings}} {{have excellent}} durability, wear well, {{and do not}} cause excessive wear to the opposing teeth, but they do conduct heat and cold, which can be irritating. There are two categories of gold fillings, cast gold fillings (gold <b>inlays</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlays)</b> made with 14 or 18 kt gold, and gold foil made with pure 24 kt gold that is burnished layer by layer. For years, they have been considered the benchmark of restorative dental materials. Recent advances in dental porcelains and consumer focus on aesthetic results have caused demand for gold fillings to drop in favor of advanced composites and porcelain veneers and crowns. Gold fillings are sometimes quite expensive; yet, they do last {{a very long time}} - which can mean gold restorations are less costly and painful in the long run.

50|$|CAD/CAM {{dentistry}} is a {{field of}} dentistry and prosthodontics using CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) to improve the design and creation of dental restorations, especially dental prostheses, including crowns, crown lays, veneers, <b>inlays</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlays,</b> fixed bridges, dental implant restorations, dentures (removable or fixed), and orthodontic appliances. CAD/CAM complements earlier technologies used for these purposes by any combination of increasing the speed of design and creation; increasing the convenience or simplicity of the design, creation, and insertion processes; and making possible restorations and appliances that {{otherwise would have been}} infeasible. Other goals include reducing unit cost and making affordable restorations and appliances that otherwise would have been prohibitively expensive.

50|$|When decay or {{fracture}} incorporate {{areas of}} a tooth that make amalgam or composite restorations inadequate, such as cuspal fracture or remaining tooth structure that undermines perimeter {{walls of a}} tooth, an onlay might be indicated. Similar to an inlay, an onlay is an indirect restoration which incorporates a cusp or cusps by covering or onlaying the missing cusps. All {{of the benefits of}} an inlay are present in the onlay restoration. The onlay allows for conservation of tooth structure when the only alternative is to totally eliminate cusps and perimeter walls for restoration with a crown. Just as inlays, onlays are fabricated outside of the mouth and are typically made out of gold or porcelain. Gold restorations have been around for many years and have an excellent track record. In recent years, newer types of porcelains have been developed that seem to rival the longevity of gold. If the onlay or inlay is made in a dental laboratory, a temporary is fabricated while the restoration is custom-made for the patient. A return visit is then required to fit the final prosthesis. <b>Inlays</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlays</b> may also be fabricated out of porcelain and delivered the same day utilizing techniques and technologies relating to CAD/CAM dentistry.|$|E

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 200 Cerec <b>inlays</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlays</b> placed consecutively in a private practice by one of the authors (TO) between 1989 and early 1991, 187 were closely monitored over a period of 15 years. All ceramic <b>inlays</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlays</b> had been placed chairside using the Cerec 1 method and had been luted with a bonding composite. Up to 17 years after their placement, a follow-up assessment was conducted, and the restorations were classified using modified United States Public Health Service criteria. RESULTS: According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the success rate of Cerec <b>inlays</b> <b>and</b> <b>onlays</b> was 88. 7 % after 17 years. A total of 21 failures (11 %) were found in 17 patients. Of these failures, 76 % were attributed to ceramic fractures (62 %) or tooth fractures (14 %). The reasons for the remaining failures were caries (19 %) and endodontic problems (5 %). Restorations of premolars presented a lower failure risk than those of molars. CONCLUSION: The survival rate probability of 88. 7 % after up to 17 years of clinical service for Cerec computer-aided design/computer-assisted machining restorations made of Vita Mk I feldspathic ceramic is regarded as a very respectable clinical outcome...|$|E
