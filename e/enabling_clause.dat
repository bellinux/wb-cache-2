50|$|In 1979, {{as part of}} the Tokyo Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the <b>enabling</b> <b>clause</b> {{was adopted}} in order to permit trading {{preferences}} targeted at developing and least developed countries which would otherwise violate Article I of the GATT. Paragraph 2(a) provides a legal basis for extending the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) beyond the original 10 years. In practice it gave a permanent validity to the GSP. The <b>enabling</b> <b>clause</b> permits developed countries to discriminate between different categories of trading partners (in particular, between developed, developing and least developed countries) which would otherwise violate Article I of the GATT which stipulates that no GATT contracting party must be treated worse than any other (this is known as most favoured nation treatment). In effect, this allows developed countries to give preferential treatment to poorer countries, particularly to least developed countries. Paragraph 2(c) permits developing countries to enter into preferential trade agreements which do not meet the strict criteria laid out in GATT Article XXIV for regional free-trade agreements. It allows developing countries to enter into agreements which may be non-reciprocal, or cover a very limited range of products (which would otherwise contravene the GATT).|$|E

40|$|The {{hypothesis}} of this thesis is that valid administrative decisions from local authorities are guaranteed via clear and precise <b>enabling</b> <b>clauses</b> {{in the primary}} legislation. Taking examples from local government in England, the author argues that the style of drafting local authorities’ legislations influences decisions taken by local authorities - so in attempting to exercise implied powers conferred by the imprecise enabling legislation and insufficient guidance, local authorities tend to go beyond intended legal powers {{and as a result}} take unreasonable, arbitrary and invalid decisions...|$|R
5000|$|Parliament {{often and}} {{increasingly}} confers powers {{on the executive}} to make delegated (or secondary) legislation. The purpose of such legislation is often practical - to enable ministers to make provision {{at a level of}} detail inappropriate for inclusion in the Act, or designed to meet changing circumstances. But the powers delegated can also be more substantial - enabling ministers to fill in large gaps left by so-called 'skeleton bills', or to amend and even repeal primary legislation ('Henry VIII powers'). Such <b>enabling</b> <b>clauses</b> in bills remove legislation from detailed parliamentary scrutiny.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{utilization}} of cutting planes {{is a key}} technique in Integer Linear Programming (ILP). However, cutting planes have seldom been applied in Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) algorithms derived from the Davis-Logemann-Loveland (DLL) procedure for Propositional Satisfiability (SAT). This paper proposes the {{utilization of}} cutting planes in a DLL-style PBO algorithm, which incorporates the most effective techniques for PBO. We propose the utilization of cutting planes both during preprocessing and during the search process. Moreover, we also establish conditions that <b>enable</b> <b>clause</b> learning and non-chronological backtracking {{in the presence of}} conflicts involving constraints generated by cutting plane techniques. The experimental results, obtained on a large number of classes of instances, indicate that the integration of cutting planes with backtrack search is an extremely effective technique for PBO. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1971, the GATT {{followed}} {{the lead of}} UNCTAD and enacted two waivers to the MFN that permitted tariff preferences to be granted to developing country goods. Both these waivers were limited in time to ten years. In 1979, the GATT established a permanent exemption to the MFN obligation {{by way of the}} <b>enabling</b> <b>clause.</b> This exemption allowed contracting parties to the GATT (the equivalent of today's WTO members) to establish systems of trade preferences for other countries, with the caveat that these systems had to be [...] "generalized, non-discriminatory and non-reciprocal' with respect to the countries they benefited (so-called [...] "beneficiary" [...] countries).

5000|$|Each year some misguided souls {{refuse to}} pay their federal income tax {{liability}} {{on the theory that}} the 16th Amendment was never properly ratified, or on the theory that the 16th Amendment lacks an <b>enabling</b> <b>clause.</b> Not surprisingly, neither the IRS nor the courts have exhibited much patience for that sort of thing. If, strictly {{for the purposes of this}} discussion, the 16th Amendment could be disregarded, the taxpayers making those frivolous claims would still be subject to the income tax. In the first place, income from personal services is taxable without apportionment in the absence of the 16th Amendment. Pollock specifically endorsed Springer's holding that such income could be taxed without apportionment. The second Pollock decision invalidated the entire 1894 income tax act, including its tax on personal services income, due to inseverability; but, unlike the 1894 act, the current code contains a severability provision. Also, given the teaching of Graves 306 U.S. 466 (1939) - that the theory that taxing income from a particular source is, in effect, taxing the source itself is untenable - the holding in Pollock that taxing income from property is the same thing as taxing the property as such cannot be viewed as good law.|$|E
40|$|In {{understanding}} {{the proliferation of}} free trade agreements (FTAs) in Asia since 2000, {{it is important to}} distinguish between two types of FTAs in terms of a legal basis on either General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) Article XXIV or the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause.</b> The latter provision can be used when an FTA involves only developing countries. While there are a total of 34 Enabling Clause-based FTAs in effect around the globe, {{more than half of them}} are located in Asia. Moreover, the way the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> is used by developing countries in Asia is very different from other regions. Outside of Asia, the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> is usually used to form a plurilateral FTA that has an accession clause, which envisages gradual evolution into a subregion-wide cooperative agreement. In contrast, in Asia, developing counties started to use the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> to sign bilateral FTAs in 2000. Such an innovative way of using the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> is one of the main contributors to the recent proliferation of FTAs in Asia. This paper also considers the implications of this proliferation in Asia on the openness of Asian regionalism...|$|E

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{understanding of}} the history behind {{the passage of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1964 leaves out an important issue: the role of foreign relations. Legal scholarship on the basis for federal legislative power to regulate civil rights often focuses {{on the question of whether}} the Commerce Power was an appropriate basis for civil rights legislation. Congress turned to the Commerce Power because its earlier attempt to regulate race discrimination by private actors under the <b>enabling</b> <b>clauses</b> of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments was struck down by the Supreme Court. Concerned about that precedent, in the 1960 s the Kennedy Administration and members of Congress saw the Commerce Clause as a promising source of congressional regulatory power. Evidence about the impact of race discrimination on interstate commerce was brought before the Senate Commerce Committee, and legislators debated whether the bill was really about commerce, or really about a moral issue, before passing the bill. This story leaves out an important issue, for a key Kennedy Administration witness before the Committee was Secretary of State Dean Rusk whose focus was neither commerce nor morality, but foreign affairs. The nation had a crucial stake in civil rights reform, Rusk argued, because race discrimination hampered U. S. relations with other nations during the crucial period of the Cold War. There was widespread international media coverage of brutal resistance to the civil rights movement, undermining U. S. prestige around the world, with hampered U. S. Cold War leadership. Rusk urged Congress to pass the civil rights bill to safeguard the nation’s standing in the world, and he suggested that foreign relations concerns supported a broad reading of Congressional power. In essence, national security required a recalibration of federalism. This history can inform contemporary debates about the scope of Congressional power. In recent years, Congress’ regulatory power under the Commerce Clause has been constricted, and Congress’ power under the Civil rights <b>enabling</b> <b>clauses</b> remains uncertain. Recovering the fuller national stake underlying the Civil Rights Act of 1964 can help us with the question of the proper scope of national authority over civil rights today...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{question}} {{related to the}} intersection of regional trade agreements with the WTO law and potential violations thereof. As {{a result of the}} research, the study concludes that the Regional Trade Agreements created pursuant to the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> do not constitute a violation of WTO law. Historically, the WTO has been polarized between the developed countries and the developing countries, both with their own interests and demands. On the one hand developed countries foster trade liberalization in developing countries. On the other hand, developing countries request an enhanced role in global trade related issues. In an effort to solve the perpetual confrontation between the two blocks the WTO has created mechanisms such as the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> which gives developing countries special and more-favourable treatment, allowing them to create regional trade agreements. However, these mechanisms are not free from dilemmas as some countries have raised concerns related to possible sham uses of the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause.</b> It is concluded that further clarity is needed with regards to the regulation of the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> as from the analysis of the case-law, it seems that an overlap that does not contradict the current regulation of such mechanism exists...|$|E

40|$|An {{issue that}} has plagued the GATT/WTO system since its {{inception}} has been {{the question of how}} to handle the needs of both developed and developing countries in one coherent system. As developing countries make up approximately 75 percent of WTO membership, this is a very real concern for the future of the WTO. Accepting that developed countries have an obligation to support developing countries as they seek to develop, WTO members, in 1979, enacted the Decision on Differential and More Favourable Treatment, Reciprocity and Fuller Participation of Developing Countries (the 2 ̆ 2 <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> 2 ̆ 2). The <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> suspends the GATT 2 ̆ 7 s general most favored nation (2 ̆ 2 MFN 2 ̆ 2) rule and allows developed country members to give differential and more favorable treatment to developing countries. The mechanism for this treatment is the Generalized System of Preferences (2 ̆ 2 GSP 2 ̆ 2), under which developed countries offer non-reciprocal preferential treatment to products originating in developing countries. The GSP program is voluntary for developed countries, who also determine which countries receive preferences and to what extent those preferences are granted [...] . This Development will trace a short history of the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> and the successes and failures associated with attempts to use the Clause to further other goals.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the WTO case brought by India {{to challenge the}} preferential tariff treatment granted by the European Communities to twelve developing countries battling drug trade. India argued that such discriminatory practice in the granting of tariff preferences is not permissible under the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> for the Generalized Systems of Preferences (GSP). We review the practices of the United States and the EC as regards discrimination in their GSP schemes and discuss the legality of such discrimination {{under the terms of}} the <b>Enabling</b> <b>Clause</b> (and related WTO provisions). We then describe the economic effects of GSP in theory and practice, with a particular emphasis on the negative externalities that discriminatory provision of preferences might impose on excluded developing countries. We conclude that existing WTO provisions do not clearly prohibit every form of discrimination in GSP. Economic analysis provides some support for India’s view that the drug-related preferences are harmful to its interests, and we argue that the WTO indeed may have a legitimate basis to regulate discrimination in GSP. However, a tightening of WTO rules on GSP might lead the developed countries to eliminate these schemes entirely, with costs for most or all developing countries that could well exceed the benefits...|$|E

40|$|The central {{aim of this}} {{research}} project is to identify and describe a range of grammatical structures found in British Sign Language, resulting in {{an account of the}} types of structures found and any possible motivations for their use. British Sign Language is the first or preferred language {{of a large number of}} Deaf people in Britain, and may have as many as 120, 000 users (British Deaf Association, 2013). Despite Government recognition as an official language in March 2003 (United Kingdom Council on Deafness, 2003), there is little theoretical research, at an in-depth structural level, that can tell us much about the syntactic nature of the language. This research intends to expand the current knowledge of the syntactic processes occurring in British Sign Language, which has been established to some degree by Brennan et al., 1984; Kyle and Woll, 1985; Deuchar, 1984 and more recently Sutton-Spence and Woll, 1999, and Cormier, Smith and Sevcikova (2013, in press). With its central focus on clause structures, {{this research}} investigates the following questions: 1 	What syntactic structures are found in BSL? 2 	What are the frequencies of predicate types and clause structures? 3 	What influences on syntax does the visual cognition of BSL users have? 4 	What influences on syntax does the morphology of the language have? The analytical approach taken is to analyse British Sign Language entirely in its own terms and not to assume a priori a syntactic model derived from spoken languages. While conducting an inductive level of research with regards to the data, the approach is informed by cognitive linguistics (Croft and Cruse, 2009) and the semiogenetic model of signed languages (Fusellier-Souza, 2006; Slobin, 2008). The analysed data comprise samples of narratives selected from The British Sign Language Corpus, compiled by the Deafness Cognition and Language Research Centre, based at University College London. Presented in the form of quantitative tables, the analysis leads to statistics of types and frequencies of use of the central predicate structures found, as the study examines constituents within clauses and relationships that <b>enable</b> <b>clause</b> linkage. These types and frequencies are then considered in light of a cognitive explanation for their occurrence and illustrated by qualitative examples in boxes-within-boxes notation form (Kay, 2002) ...|$|R
