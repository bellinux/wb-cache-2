2500|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Lays's {{voice was}} classified as basse-taille in the Opéra company, a voice type which was initially roughly equivalent to the modern bass-baritone, but by {{the latter half of}} the 18th century had come to designate all low male voices. According to the brothers Michaud, however, Lays [...] "was not strictly a basse-taille, although he sometimes forced his voice downwards excessively to reach the lower notes, and he was listed among the company's leading basse-tailles", neither was <b>he,</b> <b>contrary</b> to some erroneous contemporary descriptions, a tenor: he was in fact [...] "an admirable baritone or concordant, low, pure, sonorous and flexible, whose range and volume were amazing". Irish tenor Michael Kelly, who happened to hear him in the 1780s, wrote that [...] "Monsieur Laisse" [...] possessed [...] "a fine baritone voice, with much taste and expression". The majority of modern authors share these opinions. According to Elizabeth Forbes, for instance, he possessed a [...] "voice, baritonal in quality, but which extended into the tenor range". In fact, his roles were mostly notated in the bass clef, but there are also cases where the tenor clef was preferred, such as the title role of Anacréon (1803) by Cherubini, or the role of Cinna in La Vestale (1807) by Spontini.|$|E

"Friday," [...] said I, [...] "you must know, {{that before}} the world was made, there was an Almighty power existing, by whose power all things were made, and whose Majesty shall have no end. To be glorified and adored by beings of a heavenly nature, he created angels and archangels, that is glorified spirits {{resembling}} himself, to encompass his throne, eternally singing forth his praise in the most heavenly sounds and divine harmony. And, among this heavenly choir, Lucifer bore a great sway, as being {{then one of the}} peculiar favourites of these celestial abodes; but <b>he,</b> <b>contrary</b> to that duty he owed his heavenly Sovereign, with unbounded ingratitude to his Divine Creator, not only envied him that adoration which was his due, but thought to usurp that throne, which he had neither power to keep, nor title to pretend to. He raised a dissention and civil war in Heaven, and had a number of angels to take his part. Unbounded folly! stupendous pride! to hope for victory, and aspire above his powerful Creator! The Deity, not fearful of such an enemy, yet justly provoked at this rebellion, commissioned his archangel Michael to lead forth the heavenly host, and give him battle; the advantage of which was quickly perceived, by Satan's being overthrown, and the prince of the air, for so was the devil called, with all his fallen angels, driven headlong into a dismal place, which is called Hell." ...|$|E

6000|$|It is {{perfectly}} obvious and {{certain that the}} two pieces of the broken kernel B do not fit together at all. Nor is this strange, if the kernel was really broken and endured the insertion of matter enough to fill nine Books (IL-XL). If kernel B really contained Book II., line 50, as Mr. Leaf avers, if Agamemnon, as in that line (50) [...] "bade the clear-voiced heralds do...." [...] something--what he bade them do was, necessarily, as his peaceful costume proves, to summon the peaceful assembly which he was to moderate with his sceptre. At such an assembly, or at a preliminary council of Chiefs, he would assuredly speak of his Dream, as he does in the part excised. Mr. Leaf, if he {{will not have a}} peaceful assembly as part of kernel B, must begin his excision at the middle of line 42, in II., where Agamemnon wakens; and must make him dress not in mufti but in armour, and call the host of the Achaeans to arm, as the Dream bade him do, and as he does in II. 443. Perhaps we should then excise II. 45 2, 45 3, with the reference to the plan of retreat, for THAT is part of kernel A where there was no promise of Zeus, and no Dream sent to Agamemnon. Then from II. 483, the description of the glorious armed aspect of Agamemnon, Mr. Leaf may pass to XI. 56, the account of the Trojans under Hector, of the battle, of the prowess of Agamemnon, inspired by the Dream which <b>he,</b> <b>contrary</b> to Homeric and French epic custom, has very wisely mentioned to nobody--that is, in the part not excised.|$|E
6000|$|Living in {{the family}} of his brother-in-law, a friend of ours had {{undertaken}} the education of his little nephew and niece. This he had conducted, more perhaps from natural sympathy than from reasoned-out conclusions, {{in the spirit of}} the method above set forth. The two children were in doors his pupils and out of doors his companions. They daily joined him in walks and botanising excursions, eagerly sought plants for him, looked on while he examined and identified them, and in this and other ways were ever gaining pleasure and instruction in his society. In short, morally considered, he stood to them much more in the position of parent than either their father or mother did. Describing to us the results of this policy, he gave, among other instances, the following. One evening, having need for some article lying in another part of the house, he asked his nephew to fetch it. Interested as the boy was in some amusement of the moment, <b>he,</b> <b>contrary</b> to his wont, either exhibited great reluctance or refused, we forget which. His uncle, disapproving of a coercive course, went himself for that which he wanted: merely exhibiting by his manner the annoyance this ill-behaviour gave him. And when, later in the evening, the boy made overtures for the usual play, they were gravely repelled--the uncle manifested just that coldness naturally produced in him; and so let the boy feel the necessary consequences of his conduct. Next morning at the usual time for rising, our friend heard a new voice outside the door, and in walked his little nephew with the hot water. Peering about the room to see what else could be done, the boy then exclaimed, [...] "Oh! you want your boots;" [...] and forthwith rushed downstairs to fetch them. In this and other ways he showed a true penitence for his misconduct. He endeavoured by unusual services to make up for the service he had refused. His better feelings had made a real conquest over his lower ones; and acquired strength by the victory. And having felt what it was to be without it, he valued more than before the friendship he thus regained.|$|E

40|$|In {{the recent}} year, a {{controversy}} about the biotype of Vibrio cholerae is coming up. Majority of E 1 Tor vibrio {{have lost the}} hemolytic activity which {{was the most important}} biological behaviour to identify the biotype of Vibrio cholerae. Although the sensitivities against polymixin B and cholera phage group IV are the most reliable test at present to identify the biotype, the strains of Vibrio cholerae which are resistant to phage IV and susceptible to polymixin B or vice versa have recently been reported. The appearance of these atypical biotype is bringing about a confusion in the viewpoint of biotype decision and an epidemiological survey. This paper describes about the appearance of atypical biotype of Vibrio cholerae in relation to the modified phage receptors seen in the mutant strains and the biological behaviours of them. In order to obtain the mutant strains resistant to a certain phage, mixed culture of phage and Vibrio cholerae in the thin layered soft agar was carried out. In this method, four groups of cholera phage (I, II, III, IV) with Asiatic vibrio (Vibrio cholerae biovar cholerae) strains C 154 and H 218, and five kinds of E 1 Tor phage (1, 2, 3, 4, 5,) with E 1 Tor vibrio (Vibrio cholerae biovar eltor) strain 757 were used. In the soft agar culture with complete bacteriolysis, a few colonies were found as the resistant mutant at times. They were identified as Vibrio cholerae and confirmed that they were not lysogenized. After this confirmation, the sensitivity of the mutant strains to the other phages was examined. In conclusion, all the receptors of Asiatic vibrio were markedly in common. On <b>he</b> <b>contrary,</b> each receptors of E 1 Tor vibrio were relatively independent. But the receptor 1 (R 1) and the receptor 5 (R 5) could be so similar in behaviour. The location of the receptors were suspected to be in order from outside R 1 and R 5 to the inside R 2, and R 3 forms a branch from an axis of R 2 as well as R 4. When Asiatic vibrio strain H 218 got resistant to a certain phage, it became resistant to all the other phage including phage IV. Besides, the strain became resistant to polymixin B, and positive in VP reaction. These phenomena suggest that E 1 Tor vibrio is a mutant strain of Asiatic vibiro...|$|E
