50|$|The {{launch of}} Expedition 10 was delayed beyond its {{scheduled}} October 9, 2004 launch date. During preflight testing, an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> was accidentally activated on the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft. The resulting damage was repaired prior to launch.|$|E
50|$|The {{launch of}} Expedition 10 was rescheduled. During {{preflight}} testing, an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> was accidentally activated on the Soyuz TMA-5 spacecraft. The resulting damage caused was repaired {{and the mission}} launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 14 October 2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{frangible}} nut, commonly {{confused with}} an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> is a component {{used in many}} industries, but most commonly by NASA to sever mechanical connections. It is, by definition, an explosively-splittable nut. The bolt remains intact while the nut itself is split into two or more parts.|$|E
50|$|Later, NASA {{announced}} that it was looking into a problem with <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> that failed to fire properly during the launch. Immediately before the twin solid rocket boosters fired into life, only one set of pyrotechnics in ten <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> exploded when commanded to do so. All 10 nuts exploded as planned, but NASA was interested in finding out an explanation for the unexpected anomaly.|$|R
50|$|Mission 6 {{tested the}} safety systems with a drop test from 700 m. One of the parachutes was opened {{to test the}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts.</b> The test was a success and the cabin was {{recovered}} in good condition.|$|R
50|$|In aviation, to {{jettison}} is {{to discard}} fuel, external stores or other expendable items. The item is usually jettisioned by operating a switch or handle; external stores may {{be separated from}} the aircraft by use of <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> or a mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Reflectors were {{arranged}} {{around the outside}} of the reactor to provide the means to control the reactor. The reflectors were composed of a layer of beryllium, which would reflect neutrons, thus allowing the reactor to begin and maintain the fission process. The reflectors were held in place by a retaining band anchored by an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt.</b> When the reflector was ejected from the unit, the reactor could not sustain the nuclear fission reaction and the reactor permanently shut down.|$|E
50|$|A {{pyrotechnic}} fastener (also {{called an}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> or pyro, within context) is a fastener, usually a nut or bolt, that incorporates a pyrotechnic charge {{that can be}} initiated remotely. One or more explosive charges embedded within the bolt are typically activated by an electric current, and the charge breaks the bolt into two or more pieces. The bolt is typically scored around its circumference at the point(s) where the severance should occur. Such bolts are often used in space applications to ensure separation between rocket stages, because they are lighter and much more reliable than mechanical latches.|$|E
50|$|Each PAM {{consists}} of four primary components: a Tandem Forward Charge (TFC), a Follow Through Charge (FTC), a propulsion system, and an electronic fusing system. The PAM is placed against the structure and fires an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> pinning the PAM in place. It then fires the TFC, which {{consists of}} two explosive devices: one, the forward charge, that cuts rebar, and the other, the hole-drilling charge, that drills {{a hole in the}} target. The FTC is then accelerated by the propulsion system into the newly drilled hole, where it detonates, removing up to 75% of the target's ability to bear loads.|$|E
50|$|Unique among {{helicopters}} of its time, it {{was fitted}} with a crew emergency extraction system. This system, when activated, fired <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> that severed the main rotor blades, egress panels were blown off {{the roof of the}} aircraft, then the crew was extracted using rockets.|$|R
50|$|The Kamov Ka-50, which entered {{limited service}} with Russian forces in 1995, {{was the first}} {{production}} helicopter with an ejection seat. The system {{is similar to that}} of a conventional fixed-wing aircraft however the main rotors are equipped with <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> to jettison the blades moments before the seat is fired.|$|R
50|$|To test {{various parts}} of the Jupiter equipment, ABMA began {{launching}} Jupiter hardware on previously planned Redstone development missions. These were known under the name Jupiter-A. Among the systems tested by Jupiter-A were the ST-80 INS, angle-of-attack sensors, fusing systems and the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> that separated the booster from the upper stage.|$|R
5000|$|Spacecraft #9 had {{originally}} been intended to fly on MA-4, but Spacecraft #8 was used instead after having been recycled from the failed MA-3 launch. #9 was {{the second of the}} [...] "Mark II" [...] Mercury capsules with a larger square window and <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> hatch, while the older [...] "Mark I" [...] capsule had small port windows and a heavy locking mechanism. Gus Grissom's flight on MR-4 had used a Mark II capsule, but it was necessary to test it on a proper orbital mission to ensure that the large window could handle the much higher heat of reentry there.|$|E
50|$|To provide {{oxidation}} resistance for reuse capability, {{the outer layers}} of the RCC were coated with silicon carbide. The silicon-carbide coating protected the carbon-carbon from oxidation. The RCC was highly resistant to fatigue loading that was experienced during ascent and entry. It was stronger than the tiles and was also used around the socket of the forward attach point of the orbiter to the External Tank to accommodate the shock loads of the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> detonation. RCC was the only TPS material that also served as structural support {{for part of the}} orbiter's aerodynamic shape: the wing leading edges and the nose cap. All other TPS components (tiles and blankets) were mounted onto structural materials that supported them, mainly the aluminum frame and skin of the orbiter.|$|E
40|$|An <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} that has a one-sided dual initiation train {{all the way down}} to the pyro charge for high reliability, while still allowing the other side of the bolt to remain in place after actuation to act as a thermal seal in an extremely high-temperature environment. This lightweight separation device separates at a single fracture plane, and has as much redundancy/reliability as possible. The initiation train comes into the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> from one side...|$|E
5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the release mechanism in an emergency, instead of the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> used on Project Mercury.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of the NASA Shuttle for {{commercial}} purposes was the deployment of the SBS 3 satellite in November, 1982 from STS-5. SBS engineers designed the cradle that sat in the cargo bay of the shuttle and spun up to 50 RPM, then ejected the spinning satellite {{with the use of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most rockets need stable {{support for}} a few seconds after {{ignition}} while the engines build up to stable, full thrust. Therefore, the vehicle is commonly held on the pad by hold-down arms or <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts,</b> which are triggered when the vehicle is stable and ready to fly, at which point all umbilical connections with the pad are released.|$|R
40|$|Threaded {{split ring}} {{connector}} quickly and cleanly separates two structural members by remote control. The connector is retained in an expanded position by spring plates that are deflected and held by an <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt.</b> Ignition {{of the bolt}} effects the separation. This conceptual approach lends itself to various configurations and sizes of structures...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{is comprised}} of a high speed door assembly, comprising an actuator cylinder and piston rods, a pressure supply cylinder and fittings, an electrically detonated <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> a honeycomb structured door, a honeycomb structured decelerator, and a structural steel frame encasing the assembly to close over a 3 foot diameter opening within 50 milliseconds of actuation, to contain hazardous materials and vapors within a test fixture...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the shock generated sources of shear type <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt,</b> five kinds of explosive bolts with different states, including high preload, low preload, no preload, no piston shear, and only propellant combustion, were designed. The decoupling of four kinds of shock sources, including {{the collision of}} propellant combustion, piston shear weak surface, end of piston stroke, and preload release, was realized. Their acceleration responses at 15 [*]cm from the shock source center on 60 [*]cm × 60 [*]cm × 1 [*]cm equivalent aluminum plate were measured by using the piezoresistive accelerometer. On this account, the relative contribution values along with frequency and the mean relative values without regard to frequency of various sources were calculated in high and low preload. Results show that the characteristics of different shock sources are different, and the shock induced by propellant combustion is mainly caused by high frequency, while piston shear and piston impact are concentrated in medium and low frequency. In the high preload condition, the preload release is major contributor to the overall shock response output, accounting for approximately 57. 51 %, while {{the contributions of the}} three shock sources of propellant combustion, piston shear, and piston impact are equivalent, but they are significant contributors in the low preload condition. This study provides design reference to reduce the pyrotechnic shock of shear type <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt...</b>|$|E
50|$|Render safe {{procedures}} and techniques apply to conventional ordnance such as nuclear, chemical, biological and conventional battlefield weapons/ordnance and unconventional ordnance such as {{improvised explosive devices}} (IED) and improvised nuclear devices (IND). RSPs can also apply to explosive components of military equipment such as {{may be found in}} military vehicles and aircraft - ejection seats, <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|The first HETE {{was lost}} during the launch on Nov.4, 1996. The Pegasus rocket {{achieved}} a good orbit, but <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> releasing HETE from another satellite (Argentina's SAC-B) and from its DPAF envelope failed to charge, dooming both satellites. A battery {{on the third}} stage of the rocket and responsible for these bolts cracked during the ascent.|$|R
50|$|Early {{separation}} systems using Marman clamps used <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> for release. These {{have problems}} of unpredictability, {{the need to}} contain debris and difficulties in testing them. A more recent approach uses a screw thread. The tension of the clamp band itself is used to power the unscrewing of a central bolt, when released by a NASA Standard Initiator (NSI), a pyrotechnic pin puller.|$|R
40|$|A {{helicopter}} emergency external-stores jettison system accommodating {{an experimental}} simplified mounting system is presented. The system's conceptual approach is described, including store interface, attachment, functional mechanisms, and system initiation. It is novel {{both in the}} stores' mounting interface logic and in the modifications to existing technology for the components. Two nonfragmenting 'ridge cut' explosive bolts were mounted in each 600 -pound store to interface with a simple plate on the aircraft. Starting designs with proven technology and functional margins were demonstrated by analysis and test through the design and development. Design details of the system's components, from the <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> to the initiation handle, are described...|$|E
40|$|Pyrotechnic release {{devices such}} as {{explosive}} bolts are prevalent for many applications due to their merits: high reliability, high power-to-weight ratio, reasonable cost, and more. However, pyroshock generated by an explosive event can cause failures in electric components. Although pyroshock propagations are relatively well understood through many numerical and experimental studies, the prediction of pyroshock generation {{is still a very}} difficult problem. This study proposes a numerical method for predicting the pyroshock of a ridge-cut <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> using a commercial hydrocode (ANSYS AUTODYN). A numerical model is established by integrating fluid-structure interaction and complex material models for high explosives and metals, including high explosive detonation, shock wave transmission and propagation, and stress wave propagation. To verify the proposed numerical scheme, pyroshock measurement experiments of the ridge-cut explosive bolts with two types of surrounding structures are performed using laser Doppler vibrometers (LDVs). The numerical analysis results provide accurate prediction in both the time (acceleration) and frequency domains (maximax shock response spectra). In maximax shock response spectra, the peaks due to vibration modes of the structures are observed in both the experimental and numerical results. The numerical analysis also helps to identify the pyroshock generation source and the propagation routes...|$|E
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} of the Space Shuttle 2. 5 -inch frangible nut was conducted to improve understanding of the current design and proposed design changes to this explosively-actuated nut. The 2. 5 -inch frangible nut is used in two places to attach the aft end of the Space Shuttle Orbiter to the External Tank. Both 2. 5 -inch frangible nuts must function to complete safe separation. The 2. 5 -inch frangible nut contains two explosive boosters containing RDX explosive each capable of splitting the nut in half, on command from the Orbiter computers. To ensure separation, the boosters {{are designed to be}} redundant. The detonation of one booster is sufficient to split the nut in half. However, beginning in 1987 some production lots of 2. 5 -inch frangible nuts have demonstrated an inability to separate using only a single booster. The cause of the failure has been attributed to differences in the material properties and response of the Inconel 718 from which the 2. 5 -inch frangible nut is manufactured. Subsequent tests have resulted in design modifications of the boosters and frangible nut. Model development and initial analysis was conducted by Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) under funding from NASA Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (NASA-JSC) starting in 1992. Modeling codes previously developed by SNL were transferred to NASA-JSC for further analysis on this and other devices. An <b>explosive</b> <b>bolt</b> with NASA Standard Detonator (NSD) charge, a 3 / 4 -inch frangible nut, and the Super*Zip linear separation system are being modeled by NASA-JSC...|$|E

50|$|The {{final phase}} of flight testing {{involved}} free-flights. These saw Enterprise mated to the SCA and carried to a launch altitude, before being jettisoned {{by the use of}} <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> to glide to a landing on the runways at Edwards AFB. The intention of these flights was to test the flight characteristics of the orbiter itself, on a typical approach and landing profile from orbit.|$|R
50|$|The Convair SM-65B Atlas, or Atlas B, also {{designated}} X-12 was {{a prototype}} of the Atlas missile. First flown on 19 July 1958, the Atlas B was {{the first version of}} the Atlas rocket to use the stage and a half design with an operational sustainer engine and jettisonable booster section. Unlike later Atlas models, the Atlas B used <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> to jettison the booster section.|$|R
50|$|At launch, {{the first}} stage engine (Merlin) is ignited and {{throttled}} to full power while the launcher is restrained and all systems are verified by the flight computer. If the systems are operating correctly, the rocket is released and clears the tower in about seven seconds. The first-stage burn lasts about 2 minutes and 49 seconds. Stage separation is accomplished with <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> and a pneumatically actuated pusher system.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{comprehensively}} evaluate {{the safety and}} reliability of a missile, this paper gives a process of how to perform fatigue assessment for release devices—such as explosive bolts—considering road roughness during its carrying on different classes of roads. Firstly, displacement power spectral density (PSD) function is used to fit models of road surfaces of Class A, C, and E. Taking the surface models as simulations, multi-body dynamics analyses with code ADAMS are performed to obtain acceleration responses of different points on the missile. Loading these accelerations, the corresponding stress distribution of <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> is achieved with FEM code ABAQUS. These loads are counted by rainflow method. Finally, constant life curves with different survival rates are employed to get the S-N curves at different stress ratios and stress concentration coefficients, and fatigue lives of <b>explosive</b> <b>bolts</b> are assessed based on the stress-life method. Afterward, the effect of pretension force on the vibration load is obtained. This paper provides a fatigue evaluation procedure for release devices, which is helpful to raise the reliability of release devices for both design and service procedures...|$|R
500|$|The launch {{simulation}} on January 27, 1967, on pad 34, was a [...] "plugs-out" [...] test {{to determine}} whether the spacecraft would operate nominally on (simulated) internal power while detached from all cables and umbilicals. Passing this test was essential to making the February 21 launch date. The test was considered non-hazardous because neither the launch vehicle nor the spacecraft was loaded with fuel or cryogenics, and all pyrotechnic systems (<b>explosive</b> <b>bolts)</b> were disabled.|$|R
