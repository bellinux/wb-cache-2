25|$|Crude oil {{development}} and production in U.S. oil reservoirs can include {{up to three}} distinct phases: primary, secondary, and tertiary (or <b>enhanced)</b> <b>recovery.</b> During primary recovery only about 10 percent of a reservoir's original oil in place is typically produced. Secondary recovery techniques extend a field's productive life generally by injecting water or gas to displace oil and drive it to a production wellbore, resulting in the recovery of 20 to 40 percent of the original oil in place. However, {{with much of the}} easy-to-produce oil already recovered from U.S. oil fields, producers have attempted several tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery, techniques that offer prospects for ultimately producing 30 to 60 percent, or more, of the reservoir's original oil in place.|$|E
