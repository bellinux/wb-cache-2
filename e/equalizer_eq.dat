5000|$|Electric guitars {{usually have}} {{one to four}} {{magnetic}} pickups. Identical pickups produce different tones depending on how near they are to the neck or bridge. Bridge pickups produce a bright or trebly timbre, and neck pickups are warmer or more bassy. The type of pickup also affects tone. Dual-coil pickups sound warm, thick, perhaps even muddy; single-coil pickups sound clear, bright, perhaps even biting. Guitars don't require a uniform pickup type: a common mixture is the [...] "fat Strat" [...] arrangement of one dual-coil at the bridge position and single coils {{in the middle and}} neck positions, known as HSS (humbucker/single/single). Some guitars have piezoelectric pickup in addition to electromagnetic pickups. Piezo pickups produce a more acoustic sound. The piezo runs through a built-in <b>equalizer</b> (<b>EQ)</b> to improve similitude and control tone. A blend knob controls the mix between electromagnetic and piezoelectric sounds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Audio <b>equalizers</b> (<b>EQs)</b> {{are perhaps}} the most {{commonly}} used tools used in audio production. The SocialEQ project is a web-based personalized audio equalization system that uses an alternative interface paradigm to the standard approach. Here, the user names a desired effect (e. g. make the sound “warm”) and teaches the tool (e. g. an equalizer) what settings make the sound embody the term. SocialEQ typically requires 25 ratings to properly personalize the equalization settings. In this paper, we present three methods to improve the speed of generating personalized items (audio settings) so users can be provided personalized EQ curves after rating a much smaller number of examples. These methods can be adapted to any situation where collaborative filtering is desirable, the end products created for users are unique and comparable to each other, but prior users did not rate the same set of examples as the current user. Methods are tested on a data set of 1635 user sessions. Keywords-audio equalizer; transfer learning; collaborative filtering; personalized item. I...|$|R

3000|$|Finally, let us {{remark that}} we cannot {{directly}} {{compare the two}} methods of signal recovery, i.e., approaches involving respective (P)SVD and Smith factorization mechanisms. The reason for this was associated, for example, {{with the lack of}} causation phenomenon in the precoder and/or <b>equalizer</b> structures (see <b>Eq.</b> (I. 4), where, e.g., U(q) = [...] [< a r r a y >], whereas for the case when, e.g., q 2 constitutes a double feed-forward, i.e., we have y(t)=u(t+ 2)).|$|R
5000|$|Some {{instrument}} amplifiers, particularly bass amplifiers, contain built-in DI units, and can {{be connected}} to a mixing console directly without needing an external direct box. This would be a typical setup for a bassist who wanted to connect their instrument through a public address system (PA system) or sound reinforcement system at a live show, while keeping the unique sound of the amplifier's preamplifier and equalizer circuitry and the custom settings. In comparison, if an external DI box is used, with the bassist plugging her/his bass into the DI box and sending the signal to their bass amp, the DI box signal would be the direct signal from the bass' pickups. With the external DI box approach, the sound shaping added to the bass' signal on the amplifier (e.g. boosting the preamplifier, adding overdrive, or adjusting the equalization to change the tone) would not {{be present in the}} external DI box signal. Some instrument amplifiers have the ability to turn off the amplifier's <b>equalizer</b> (<b>EQ)</b> through a pre-eq/post-eq switch. This can be used if a [...] "clean" [...] direct output from the amplifier is desired, which does not contain the tone shaping created by the bassist's adjustment of the EQ controls.|$|E
40|$|The DVB-T/H {{standard}} {{has been}} recently developed to provide video broadcasting services for hand-held devices [1]. The power consumption of a DVB-T/H baseband receiver must be strictly controlled {{in order to}} achieve long battery life. In response to this challenge a low-power COFDM baseband receiver for DVB-T/H is presented. It is comprised of an OFDM demodulator and forwarderror correction (FEC) blocks for complete signal synchronization, mobile channel equalization, and data demodulation and correction. In addition, multi-stage power management (PM) is also exploited to eliminate redundant transition and power dissipation of baseband modules. With an area-efficient 2 D <b>equalizer</b> (<b>EQ),</b> the proposed design can overcome 70 Hz Doppler frequency (DF) resulted from 150 km/h speed in the highest data rate mode, i. e. 31. 67 Mb/s.

40|$|Equalization of room impulse {{responses}} is an straightforward {{approach for}} dereverberation of speech signals in a hands-free scenario. The wellknown least-squares equalization filter minimizes the euclidian {{distance between the}} concatenated system of room impulse response (RIR) and equalizer and a given target system. This target system usually is chosen as a delayed discrete pulse, a delayed band-pass or a delayed high-pass filter. In this contribution we address {{the choice of the}} this delay which has to be introduced w. r. t. maximum dereverberation performance. Since designing one <b>equalizer</b> (<b>EQ)</b> for each possible delay and choosing the best one is computationally inefficient we investigate the dependence of the optimum EQ delay on various parameters describing RIRs. A high correlation was found between the so-called central time of the room impulse response and the optimum EQ delay. Since the central time can be determined based on estimates of the initial peak of the RIR and the room reverberation time, we propose to use a very short filter for system identification and an estimate of the room reverberation time to identify the optimum equalizer delay...|$|E
3000|$|A {{practical}} implementation could therefore {{start with the}} evaluation of —without the premultiplication with [...] [< a r r a y >]—as an alternative for x̂_ZP_temp. Next, the LS system from Eq. (18) is solved, which is typically very small. The calculation of q requires (N+L+K/ 3)K^ 2 flops ([22], p. 238) and the calculation of x̂_ZP_corr requires another (2 K− 1)N flops to multiply q and F^H_C. The overall computational complexity is thus equal {{to the complexity of}} Eq. (12) plus approximately O((K^ 2 + 2 K)N) flops and is generally significantly smaller than the complexity of the time-domain <b>equalizers</b> of <b>Eqs.</b> (3) and (4). Likewise, the MMSE-ZR can be implemented as a post-processing of the MMSE-FD-EXT. Based on the measurement of the actual channel and the SNR, it can be decided to use the post-processing step or not.|$|R

The GSM system with multiple users {{can be interpreted as}} MIMO system with a desired user and (cochannel and adjacent channel) interferers. Using a multiple [...] input multiple [...] output (MIMO) multiuser joint detection approach for desired signal and one or more (strongest) interferers, network capacity can be significantly increased. In this paper, we compare different multiuser detection methods that can be applied to GSM/EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) systems with Gaussian minimum [...] shift keying (GMSK) modulation in up- and downlink and 8 [...] ary phase [...] shift keying (8 PSK) in the uplink, respectively. Since an optimal solution is not feasible in these applications, joint MIMO reduced [...] state sequence estimation (RSSE) with adaptive thresholds in metric computations is applied to reduce computational complexity. The M-algorithm is explored as a second method for joint detection with reduced complexity. Algorithms for multiuser detection are compared with interference rejection methods, where interferers are suppressed by filtering.

40|$|The ever-growing {{demands for}} {{high-bandwidth}} data transfer {{have been pushing}} towards advancing research efforts {{in the field of}} high-performing communication systems. Studies on the performance of single chip, e. g. faster multi-core processors and higher system memory capacity, have been explored. To further enhance the system performance, researches have been focused on the improvement of data-transfer bandwidth for chip-to-chip communication in the high-speed serial link. Many solutions have been addressed to overcome the bottleneck caused by the non-idealties such as bandwidth-limited electrical channel that connects two link devices and varieties of undesired noise in the communication systems. Nevertheless, with these solutions data have run into limitations of the timing margins for high-speed interfaces running at multiple gigabits per second data rates on low-cost Printed Circuit Board (PCB) material with constrained power budget. Therefore, the challenge in designing a physical layer (PHY) link for high-speed communication systems turns out to be power-efficient, reliable and cost-effective. In this context, this dissertation is intended to focus on architectural design, system-level and circuit-level verification of a PHY link as well as system performance optimization in respective of power, reliability and adaptability in high-speed communication systems. The PHY is mainly composed of clock data recovery (CDR), <b>equalizers</b> (<b>EQs)</b> and high- speed I/O drivers. Symmetrical structure of the PHY link is usually duplicated in both link devices for bidirectional data transmission. By introducing training mechanisms into high-speed communication systems, the timing in one link device is adaptively aligned to the timing condition specified in the other link device despite of different skews or induced jitter resulting from process, voltage and temperature (PVT) variations in the individual link. With reliable timing relationships among the interface signals provided, the total system bandwidth is dramatically improved. On the other hand, interface training offers high flexibility for reuse without further investigation on high demanding components involved in high costs. In the training mode, a CDR module is essential for reconstructing the transmitted bitstream to achieve the best data eye and to detect the edges of data stream in asynchronous systems or source-synchronous systems. Generally, the CDR works as a feedback control system that aligns its output clock {{to the center of the}} received data. In systems that contain multiple data links, the overall CDR power consumption increases linearly with the increase in number of links as one CDR is required for each link. Therefore, a power-efficient CDR plays a significant role in such systems with parallel links. Furthermore, a high performance CDR requires low jitter generation in spite of high input jitter. To minimize the trade-off between power consumption and CDR jitter, a novel CDR architecture is proposed by utilizing the proportional-integral (PI) controller and three times sampling scheme. Meanwhile, signal integrity (SI) becomes critical as the data rate exceeds several gigabits per second. Distorted data due to the non-idealties in systems are likely to reduce the signal quality aggressively and result in intolerable transmission errors in worst case scenarios, thus affect the system effective bandwidth. Hence, additional trainings such as transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) EQ trainings for SI purpose are inserted into the interface training. Besides, a simplified system architecture with unsymmetrical placement of adaptive Rx and Tx EQs in a single link device is proposed and analyzed by using different coefficient adaptation algorithms. This architecture enables to reduce a large number of EQs through the training, especially in case of parallel links. Meanwhile, considerable power and chip area are saved. Finally, high-speed I/O driver against PVT variations is discussed. Critical issues such as overshoot and undershoot interfering with the data are primarily accompanied by impedance mismatch between the I/O driver and its transmitting channel. By applying PVT compensation technique I/O driver impedances can be effectively calibrated close to the target value. Different digital impedance calibration algorithms against PVT variations are implemented and compared for achieving fast calibration and low power requirements...|$|R
40|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} the power/mass {{requirements}} in satellite transponders and to reduce mission costs, joint amplification of multiple carriers using a single high-power amplifier (HPA) is being considered. In this scenario, a careful investigation of the resulting power efficiency is essential as amplification is nonlinear, and multicarrier signals exhibit enlarged peak-to-average power ratio. Thus, operating the amplifier close to saturation vastly increases signal distortion resulting in a severe degradation of performance, especially for higher order modulations. This paper proposes a reduced-complexity digital predistortion (DPD) scheme at the transmitter and a corresponding <b>equalizer</b> (<b>EQ)</b> at the receiver to mitigate these nonlinear effects. Scenarios include both the forward {{as well as the}} return links. In particular, the paper exploits the MIMO Volterra representation and builds on a basis pursuit approach using a LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) algorithm to achieve an efficient basis representation, avoiding large computational complexity, to describe the selection of predistorter/equalizer model. The work further compares and contrasts the two mitigation techniques taking various system aspects into consideration. The gains in performance and amplification efficiency demonstrated by the use of DPD/ EQ motivate their inclusion in next-generation satellite systems...|$|E
