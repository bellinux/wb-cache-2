40|$|Located {{within the}} fields of {{motivation}} and coping, this report examines the phenomenon of internship frustration to explore its major causes and consequences. The qualitative study relies on 181 internship reports and 10 in-depth interviews. The subjects are students {{of the department of}} Politics and Administration at the University of Konstanz (Germany). A combined analysis reveals that major triggers of internship <b>frustration</b> <b>are</b> insufficient supervision and unchallenging, repetitive tasks as well as an adverse organizational culture. Subsequent consequences of interns’ <b>frustration</b> <b>are</b> resignation and intention to turnover, but also increased levels of learnings. In contrast to employee <b>frustration,</b> it <b>is</b> shown that interns’ reactions to <b>frustration</b> <b>are</b> more likely to be carried out mentally. Therefore, acts of violence and aggression are a rare phenomenon, due to incipiently lower levels of self-consciousness of the intern in the working world. Furthermore, implications for employers, HR departments, universities and students are outlined, accompanied by theoretical insights concerning stage models of internships and ideas for future research...|$|R

After Radcliffe's death, her husband released her unfinished essay [...] "On the Supernatural in Poetry", which details the difference between the sensation of terror her works aimed to achieve and the horror Lewis sought to evoke. She states that terror aims to stimulate readers through imagination and perceived evils while horror closes them off through fear and physical dangers. [...] "Terror and Horror are so far opposite, that the first expands the soul and awakens the faculties to a high degree of life; the other contracts, freezes and nearly annihilates them." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Frustration</b> <b>is</b> {{another major}} cause of {{aggression}}. The Frustration aggression theory states that aggression increases if a person feels {{that he or she}} is being blocked from achieving a goal (Aronson et al. 2005). One study found that the closeness to the goal makes a difference. The study examined people waiting in line and concluded that the 2nd person was more aggressive than the 12th one when someone cut in line (Harris 1974). Unexpected frustration may be another factor. In a separate study to demonstrate how unexpected frustration leads to increased aggression, Kulik & Brown (1979) [...] selected a group of students as volunteers to make calls for charity donations. One group was told that the people they would call would be generous and the collection would be very successful. The other group was given no expectations. The group that expected success was more upset when no one was pledging than the group who did not expect success (everyone actually had horrible success). This research suggests that when an expectation does not materialize (successful collections), unexpected frustration arises which increases aggression.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{common law}} cases held that {{performance}} of a contract always had to take place. No matter what hardship was encountered contracting parties had absolute liability on their obligations. In the 19th century the courts developed a doctrine that contracts which became impossible to perform would be frustrated and automatically come to an end. In Taylor v Caldwell Blackburn J held that when the Surrey Gardens Music Hall unexpectedly burnt down, the owners did not have to pay compensation to the business that had leased it for an extravagant performance, because it was neither party's fault. An assumption underlying all contracts (a [...] "condition precedent") is that they are possible to perform. People would not ordinarily contract to do something they knew was going to be impossible. Apart from physical impossibility, frustration could be down to a contract becoming illegal to perform, for instance if war breaks out and the government bans trade to a belligerent country, or perhaps if the whole purpose of an agreement is destroyed by another event, like renting a room to watch a cancelled coronation parade. But a contract is not frustrated merely because a subsequent event makes the agreement harder to perform than expected, as for instance in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham UDC where a builder unfortunately had to spend more time and money doing a job than he would be paid for because of an unforeseen shortage of labour and supplies. The House of Lords denied his claim for contract to be declared frustrated so he could claim quantum meruit. Because the doctrine of <b>frustration</b> <b>is</b> a matter of construction of the contract, it can be contracted around, through what are called [...] "force majeure" [...] clauses. Similarly, a contract can have a force majeure clause that would bring a contract to an end more easily than would common law construction. In The Super Servant Two Wijsmuller BV contracted to hire out a self-propelling barge to J. Lauritzen A/S, who wanted to tow another ship from Japan to Rotterdam, but had a provision stating the contract would terminate if some event made it difficult related to the 'perils or dangers and accidents of the sea'. Wijsmuller BV also had a choice of whether to provide either The Superservant One or Two. They chose Two and it sank. The Court of Appeal held that the impossibility to perform the agreement was down to Wijsmuller's own choice, and so it was not frustrated, but that the force majeure clause did cover it. The effect of a contract being frustrated is that it is that both parties are prospectively discharged from performing their side of the bargain. If one side has already paid money over or conferred another valuable benefit, but not got anything in return yet, contrary to the prior common law position, the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 gives the court discretion to let the claimant recover a 'just sum', and that means whatever the court thinks fit in all the circumstances.|$|E
40|$|In stabled horses, {{behavioral}} {{responses to}} <b>frustration</b> <b>are</b> often observed, especially around feeding time. These behavioral responses are a useful indicator of their welfare. In this study, we investigated {{the association between}} this behavioral indicator and DRD 4 gene polymorphisms in stabled horses. Twenty one horses housed in two stables were used. The horses were observed for approximately 4 h around feeding over three or more days using focal-sampling and instantaneous-sampling. Horses were genotyped for the A–G substitution in the DRD 4 gene. The effects of the A–G substitution (with or without the A allele in the DRD 4 gene), the stables, and their interaction on the frequency of behavioral responses to <b>frustration</b> <b>were</b> analyzed using general linear models. The total time budget of behavioral responses to <b>frustration</b> <b>was</b> higher in horses without the A allele than in those with the A allele (P = 0. 007). These {{results indicate that the}} A–G substitution of the DRD 4 gene is related to frustration-related behavioral responses in stabled horses. Appropriate consideration should be made for the DRD 4 gene polymorphism when the welfare of stabled horses is assessed, based on this behavioral indicator...|$|R

We present a questionnaire assessing {{individual differences in}} the need for interpersonal touch (NFIPT), which was validated within an unrelated product-evaluation task. Before entering the laboratory, participants were briefly touched on the shoulder or received no touch. Assessing confidence and frustration within the following product-evaluation task, we examined moderating effects of NFIPT and addi-tionally effects of need for touch (NFT). Results showed that higher NFIPT participants were more confident when they were briefly touched. Effects on <b>frustration</b> <b>were</b> only found for NFT. Results show that <b>frustration</b> <b>was</b> greater for individuals with higher NFT, when they could not touch the product during the evaluation task...|$|R
