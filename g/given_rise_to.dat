5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate. This common and conspicuous species has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a number of literary and cultural references, frequently related to its song.|$|E
5|$|In later centuries Narihira {{has been}} {{considered}} the epitome of the amorous bel homme, and his romantic escapades have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> many later legends. He and his contemporary Ono no Komachi were considered the archetypes of the beautiful man and woman of the Heian court, and appear as such in many later literary works, particularly in Noh theatre.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ancestors}} of Monogenea were probably free-living flatworms similar to modern Turbellaria.According {{to the more}} widely accepted view, [...] "rhabdocoel turbellarians <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> monogeneans; these, in turn, <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> digeneans, from which the cestodes were derived. Another {{view is that the}} rhabdocoel ancestor <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> two lines; one <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> monogeneans, who <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> digeneans, and the other line <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> cestodes" [...] 1 [...]|$|R
50|$|Due {{to their}} faith, they will {{experience}} feelings {{as a result}} of repeated contact through the six sense bases. In them feeling <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> craving; craving <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> clinging; clinging <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> current existence (upapatti bhava) and the kammic causal process (kamma bhava); the kammic causal process <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> rebirth; and rebirth <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> ageing, death, grief, lamentation, pain, distress and despair.|$|R
50|$|The AB lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> neurons, skin, and pharynx. The P1 cell divides into EMS and P2. The EMS cell divides into MS and E. The MS lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> pharynx, muscle, and neurons. The E lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> intestines. The P2 cell divides into P3 and C founder cells. The C founder cells <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> muscle, skin, and neurons. The P3 cell divides into P4 and D founder cells. The D founder cells <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> muscle {{while the}} P4 lineage <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the germ line.|$|R
5|$|The city's growing Latino {{population}} has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{a number of}} local and regional Spanish language newspapers. These include El Planeta (owned by the former publisher of The Boston Phoenix), El Mundo, and La Semana. Siglo21, with its main offices in nearby Lawrence, is also widely distributed.|$|E
5|$|A Polish Nobleman is a 1637 {{painting}} by Rembrandt depicting {{a man in}} a costume of either Polish szlachta or boyar nobility. The identity of the subject of the painting is unclear, and has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> several different interpretations. The view that the figure's dress is clearly Polish is not universally held and {{it may have been a}} self-portrait.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski {{plunged into}} the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{a number of different}} theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E
50|$|The Mandaloceratidae {{are derived}} from the Reudemannoceratidae through Madiganella. The {{earliest}} mandeloceratid is Pseudogomphoceras which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Ovocerina. Ovocerina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Cinctoceras, Umbeloceras, Verspoeras, and Mandaloceras. It also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Mesoceratidae representing Mesoceras.|$|R
50|$|Synergy is caudo-caudal. The gametocysts are 70 µm × 55 µm and <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> {{multiple}} gametes.

5|$|In recent years, Belgrade {{has also}} <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> several {{world-class}} tennis {{players such as}} Ana Ivanović, Jelena Janković and Novak Đoković. Ivanović and Đoković are the first female and male Belgraders, respectively, to win Grand Slam singles titles and been ATP number 1 with Jelena Janković. The Serbian national team won the 2010 Davis Cup, beating the French team in the finals played in the Belgrade Arena.|$|E
5|$|Ottoman cuisine has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the cuisines {{of modern}} Turkey, {{parts of the}} Balkans, Cyprus, and Greece. A {{distinctive}} element is the family of small flaky pastries called börek. These are popular and widespread across the Eastern Mediterranean region, and date {{as far back as}} ancient Roman times. Börek are made of thin sheets of filo pastry, filled with mixtures such as meat, caramelised onion and sweet peppers.|$|E
5|$|Palaeobotanists study ancient {{plants in}} the fossil record to provide {{information}} about the evolutionary history of plants. Cyanobacteria, the first oxygen-releasing photosynthetic organisms on Earth, are thought to have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the ancestor of plants by entering into an endosymbiotic relationship with an early eukaryote, ultimately becoming the chloroplasts in plant cells. The new photosynthetic plants (along with their algal relatives) accelerated the rise in atmospheric oxygen started by the cyanobacteria, changing the ancient oxygen-free, reducing, atmosphere to one in which free oxygen has been abundant for more than 2 billion years.|$|E
50|$|In males, the UG sinus {{is divided}} into three regions: upper, pelvic, and phallic. The upper part <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the urinary bladder and the pelvic part <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the prostatic and {{membranous}} parts of the urethra. The phallic portion <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the penile urethra.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of 6-thioguanine <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the DAT regimen, and the {{addition of}} 6-mercaptopurine <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the DAM regimen.|$|R
50|$|Aulatornoceras, type for the Aulatornoceratinae was {{previously}} considered a subgenus of Tornoceras {{and is known}} from the Upper Devonian of North America and Europe. Aulatornoceras <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Truyolsoceras and Polonoceras, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Armatites, Kirsoceras, and Pernoceras, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Pseudoclymenia making up the Aulotornoceratidae.|$|R
5|$|Psittacosaurus {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} ceratopsians, but closer to Triceratops than Yinlong. Once in its own family, Psittacosauridae, with other genera like Hongshanosaurus, it is now considered to be senior synonym of the latter and an early offshoot of the branch that led to more derived forms. The genera closely related to Psittacosaurus are all from Asia, with the exception of Aquilops, from North America. The first species was either P. lujiatunensis or closely related, and it may have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> later forms of Psittacosaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Cat's Eye Nebula is {{structurally}} a {{very complex}} nebula, and the mechanism or mechanisms that have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> its complicated morphology are not well understood. The central bright part of the nebular consists of the inner elongated bubble (inner ellipse) filled with hot gas. It in turn is nested {{into a pair of}} larger spherical bubbles conjoined together along their waist. The waist is observed as the second larger ellipse lying perpendicular to the bubble with hot gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{dromedary}} and the Bactrian camel often interbreed {{to produce}} fertile offspring. Where the ranges {{of the species}} overlap, such as in northern Punjab, Persia and Afghanistan, the phenotypic differences between them tend to decrease {{as a result of}} extensive crossbreeding. The fertility of their hybrid has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> speculation that the dromedary and the Bactrian camel should be merged into a single species with two varieties. However, a 1994 analysis of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene showed the species display 10.3% divergence in their sequences.|$|E
50|$|Protophragmoceras <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Middle Silurian Phragmoceras, which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the {{closely related}} Middle Silurian Tubiferoceras {{and to the}} Upper Silurian Pristeroceras and Phragmocerina. Protophagmoceras also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the less {{characteristic}} but still included Middle Silurian Endoplectoceras and Sthenoceras, which extends into the Lower Devonian.|$|R
50|$|Because each nucleus {{contains}} {{a large population}} of neurons, the dorsal column nuclei <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> characteristic bumps or tubercles when viewing the posterior side of the intact brainstem. In particular, the cuneate nucleus <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the cuneate tubercle, while the gracile nucleus <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the gracile tubercle.|$|R
5000|$|Strandoceras <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Phragmoceratidae {{and very}} likely to Kiaeroceras and Cyrtogomphoceras, which in turn <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> Landeroceras, within the Cyrtogomphoceratidae ...|$|R
5|$|The long {{sentences}} of the Gun Court and its {{restrictions on the}} rights of the accused have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> constitutional challenges, some of which have been appealed to the Privy Council in London. These cases have resulted in some modifications to the court, but have upheld it on the whole. The Gun Court system has also been the target of criticism because of its lengthy delay in hearing cases, and the continuing rise in gun violence since its adoption.|$|E
5|$|Well-explored deposits, {{potentially}} classifiable as reserves, {{include the}} Green River deposits {{in the western}} United States, the Tertiary deposits in Queensland, Australia, deposits in Sweden and Estonia, the El-Lajjun deposit in Jordan, and deposits in France, Germany, Brazil, China, southern Mongolia and Russia. These deposits have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> expectations of yielding at least 40liters of shale oil per tonne of oil shale, using the Fischer Assay.|$|E
5|$|As {{a highly}} popular video game series {{with a large}} and active fan base, the Halo trilogy has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> an array of video {{productions}} in an emerging entertainment medium, machinima. Virtually all machinima footage based around the Halo games is taken from the multiplayer modes of the main trilogy games. Most productions are set outside Halo canon, while others are based on fan fiction closely relating to the official story. Halo 3 includes a saved film function that allows camera angles not possible in previous games, and other features that simplify production. The game {{has become one of}} the most popular tools for generating machinima, and Microsoft updated its user license agreement to allow noncommercial distribution of such films.|$|E

50|$|Assuming this {{is correct}} the {{evolutionary}} order appears to be: the Archigregarinorida <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Eugregarinorida {{who in turn}} <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Neogregarinorida.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{statement of}} Huygens' principle for the D'Alembertian <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the KdV hierarchy, analogously, the Dirac operator <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the AKNS hierarchy.|$|R
5|$|Carroll Baker {{was born}} and raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in a Roman Catholic family, the {{daughter}} of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, who was a traveling salesman. She is of Polish descent, which has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> a rumor that her birth name was Karolina Piekarski. However, this currently cannot be substantiated by known records. Baker's parents separated when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and younger sister, Virginia, to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. According to Baker, her mother struggled as a single parent, and the family was poor for much of her upbringing.|$|E
5|$|Contact between English and {{immigrant}} languages has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> new accents and dialects. For instance, {{the variety of}} English spoken by Poles in Manchester is distinct both from typical Polish-accented English and from Mancunian. At a local level, the diversity of immigrant communities means that some languages that are extremely rare in {{the country as a}} whole have strongholds in Northern towns: Pashto is spoken natively by 0.08% of the population of England but 0.7% of the population of Bradford, while Cantonese is the first language of 0.4% of the population of Manchester compared to 0.08% nationally.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the gradual}} {{evolution}} of the post of Prime Minister, the title is applied to early Prime Ministers only retrospectively; this has sometimes <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> academic dispute. Lord Bath and Lord Waldegrave are both sometimes listed as prime ministers. Bath was invited to form a ministry by King George II when Henry Pelham resigned in 1746, as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of William Pitt the Elder, who dominated the government during the Seven Years' War. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days, and Waldegrave after three. Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as Prime Minister, {{and they are not}} listed.|$|E
50|$|According to Donovan et al (1981) the Stephanoceratidae and Otoitdae {{both have}} their {{origin in the}} Hildoceratoidea, in the Phymatoceratidae. The Otoitidae <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Sphaeroceratidae which <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Cardioceraticae, the Stephanoceratidae to the Kosmoceratidae, all within the Stephanoceratoidea. The Stephanoceratidae, accordingly, also <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Perisphinctidae, root stock of the Perisphictoidea.|$|R
50|$|The Phylloceratina is {{the ancestral}} stock, {{derived from the}} Ceratitida {{near the end of}} the Triassic. The Phylloceratina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the Lytoceratina near the {{beginning}} of the Jurassic which in turn <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> the highly specialized Ancyloceratina {{near the end of the}} Jurassic. Both the Phylloceratina and Lytoceratina <b>gave</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> various stocks combined in the Ammonitina.|$|R
50|$|The {{symmetric}} square will <b>give</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> singlets (such as 1S, 1D, & 1G), {{while the}} anti-symmetric square <b>gives</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> triplets (such as 3P & 3F).|$|R
