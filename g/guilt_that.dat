5|$|Her {{mother died}} from {{diphtheria}} on December 7, 1892, and Elliott Jr. {{died of the}} same disease the following May. Her father, an alcoholic confined to a sanitarium, died on August 14, 1894 after jumping from a window during a fit of delirium tremens. He survived the fall but died from a seizure. Eleanor's childhood losses left her prone to depression throughout her life. Her brother Hall later suffered from alcoholism. Before her father died, he implored her {{to act as a}} mother towards Hall, and it was a request she made good upon for the rest of Hall's life. Eleanor doted on Hall, and when he enrolled at Groton School in 1907, she accompanied him as a chaperone. While he was attending Groton, she wrote him almost daily, but always felt a touch of <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> Hall had not had a fuller childhood. She took pleasure in Hall's brilliant performance at school, and was proud of his many academic accomplishments, which included a master's degree in engineering from Harvard.|$|E
5|$|In May 1582, {{letters from}} the Spanish {{ambassador}} in England, Bernardino de Mendoza, to contacts in Scotland were found on a messenger by Sir John Forster, who forwarded them to Walsingham. The letters indicated a conspiracy among the Catholic powers to invade England and displace Elizabeth with Mary, Queen of Scots. By April 1583, Walsingham had a spy, identified as Giordano Bruno by author John Bossy, deployed in the French embassy in London. Walsingham's contact reported that Francis Throckmorton, a nephew of Walsingham's old friend Nicholas Throckmorton, had visited the ambassador, Michel de Castelnau. In November 1583, {{after six months of}} surveillance, Walsingham had Throckmorton arrested and then tortured to secure a confession—an admission of <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> clearly implicated Mendoza. The Throckmorton plot called for an invasion of England along with a domestic uprising to liberate Mary, Queen of Scots, and depose Elizabeth. Throckmorton was executed in 1584 and Mendoza was expelled from England.|$|E

25|$|Impulsive {{behavior}} is common, including substance or alcohol abuse, eating disorders, unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners, reckless spending, and reckless driving. Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships, running away, and self-injury. People with BPD act impulsively {{because it gives}} them the feeling of immediate relief from their emotional pain. However, in the long term, people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> follow such actions. A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain, engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain, feel shame and guilt over their actions, feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt, and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain. As time goes on, impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain.|$|E

Since the second revolution, he feels enormous <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> his pro-terraforming position became the dominant one {{at the expense of the}} goals of Ann's anti-terraforming stance, as Sax and Ann have come to be regarded as the original champions of their respective positions. Sax becomes increasingly preoccupied with seeking forgiveness and approval from Ann, while Ann, depressed and bitter from her many political and personal losses, is suicidal and refuses to accept any more longevity treatments. However, when Sax witnesses Ann collapse into a coma during an attempt to demonstrate to her the beauty of the terraformed world, he arranges for her to be resuscitated and to be treated with the longevity treatment, both against her will.|$|E

25|$|In October 1980, {{the dozen}} or so {{erstwhile}} nuns held their first fundraiser, a bingo game and Salsa dance that was well-attended {{in large part because of}} the write-up in The San Francisco Chronicle by Herb Caen the same day, who printed their organization name, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence. The benefit was for San Francisco's Metropolitan Community Church Cuban Refugee Program, and it netted $1,500 ($ in 2009). The Sisters began making regular appearances at Castro events that focused on sexual tolerance or provided a showcase for drag. They also developed a mission statement:The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence is a leading-edge Order of queer nuns. Since our first appearance in San Francisco on Easter Sunday, 1979, the Sisters have devoted ourselves to community service, ministry and outreach to those on the edges, and to promoting human rights, respect for diversity and spiritual enlightenment. We believe all people have a right to express their unique joy and beauty and we use humor and irreverent wit to expose the forces of bigotry, complacency and <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> chain the human spirit.|$|E
500|$|The poem {{discusses}} love, sex, and marriage, {{but it is}} {{not done}} {{in the form of a}} love poem. Instead, it compares love with an Aeolian harp, which is a symbol of poetry. In terms of the relationship described, the desire expressed during an engagement with Fricker is described as innocent. Also, the anticipation of the conjugal union is free of any potential disappointment or any <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> would result in sex outside of marriage. As such, there is a thematic connection with the poem [...] "Lines Written at Shurton Bars" [...] written on the same subject around the same time. As the poem was completed after Coleridge's marriage, the themes became similar to the ideas expressed in his Reflections on Having Left a Place of Retirement. Both poems discuss the Clevedon area and the impact of the countryside upon the viewer. Also, they provide information on how Coleridge and Fricker felt during their relationship and marriage. However, Reflections suggests that there are some problems within the relationship.|$|E
500|$|The wager {{of battle}} {{was not always}} {{available}} to the defendant in an appeal of murder. If the defendant was taken in the mainour (that is, {{in the act of}} committing his crime), if he attempted to escape from prison, or if there was such strong evidence of <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> there could be no effective denial, the defendant could not challenge. Similarly, if the plaintiff was a woman, above 60years of age, a minor, lame or blind, he or she could decline the challenge, and the case would be determined by a jury. Peers of the realm, priests, and citizens of the City of London could also decline the battle if challenged. If the actual battle took place, it would occur in judicial lists, [...] square, following the taking of oaths against witchcraft and sorcery. If the defendant was defeated, and if he was still alive, he was to be hanged on the spot; not even the King could pardon him from the divine judgment against him. However, if he defeated his opponent, or if he were able to fend off his opponent from sunrise to sunset, he would go free. If the plaintiff said the word craven ("I am vanquished"), and gave up the fight, he was to be , deprived of the privileges of a freeman, and was liable for damages to his successful opponent.|$|E

500|$|Instead, Raucher {{decided to}} focus on the first major adult {{experience}} of his life, that of falling in love for the first time. The woman (named Dorothy, like her screen counterpart) was a fellow vacationer on the island whom the 14-year old Raucher had befriended one day when he helped her carry groceries home; he became a friend of her and her husband and helped her with chores after her husband was called to fight in World War II. On the night memorialized in the film, Raucher randomly came to visit her, unaware his arrival was just minutes after she received notification of her husband's death. She was confused and upset, had been drinking heavily, and repeatedly called Raucher by her husband's name. Although both ultimately [...] disrobed, contrary to popular opinion, sexual intercourse did not occur. Raucher admitted this in a 2002 interview saying it was mostly holding, but in the movie [...] "We let you think what you want." [...] The next morning, Raucher discovered that she had left the island, leaving behind a note for him (which is read {{at the end of the}} film and reproduced in the book). He never saw her again; his last [...] "encounter" [...] with her, recounted on an episode of The Mike Douglas Show, came after the film's release in 1971, when she was one of over a dozen women who wrote letters to Raucher claiming to be [...] "his" [...] Dorothy. Raucher recognized the [...] "real" [...] Dorothy's handwriting, and she confirmed her identity by making references to certain events only she could have known about. She told Raucher that she had lived for years with the <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> she had potentially traumatized him and ruined his life. She told Raucher that she was glad he turned out all right, and that they had best not re-visit the past.|$|E
500|$|A [...] "big" [...] musical number, [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] begins {{within the}} first fifteen minutes of Tangled during the film's first act when, {{on the eve of}} her eighteenth birthday, Rapunzel finally summons enough courage to ask Gothel for {{permission}} to travel and see the floating lanterns in person. Gothel, whose eternal youth and beauty solely relies on the safety and protection of Rapunzel's magical hair, denies this request by sarcastically reminding her that [...] "mother knows best," [...] warning her ward that [...] "the world is full of wicked people who want to steal her hair's magic," [...] while explaining to her that it's [...] "for her own good," [...] claiming to only want to protect her. At one point during the scene, Gothel actually contradicts herself; Teena Elizabeth of BookMyShow observed, [...] "Gothel has no intentions of letting her go. Though Mother Gothel sings, 'soon, but not yet,' but ironically later says, 'Rapunzel, don't ever ask to leave this tower...again.'" [...] Writing for the Tulsa World, Michael Smith observed that Gothel uses the song [...] "as her lie/rationale for keeping the girl safe (holding her hostage) from those who might steal her for their own hair-inspired profit schemes." [...] Amid Amidi of Cartoon Brew felt that the scene is both funny and scary, citing Gothel's [...] "theatrical gestures" [...] and [...] "claustrophobia-inducing stark black backgrounds" [...] as examples of both. [...] "cementing [...] character's ruthlessness," [...] Gothel ultimately orders Rapunzel to promise never to ask permission to leave the tower again. Moviefone's William Goss cited the musical number as an example of [...] "fear-mongering," [...] which has been defined by Dictionary.com as [...] "a person who creates or spreads alarming news." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail penned, [...] "Mother Knows Best hilariously convey the fear and <b>guilt</b> <b>that</b> have kept Rapunzel in the tower of her own free will." [...] In her book Marvels & Tales, author Kendra Magnusson observed that, during the [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] musical sequence, [...] "the manipulation of Rapunzel's hair leaves the heroine's body wrenched in one moment and bound up in it the next", depicting that, while Rapunzel's hair can be used to defend herself, [...] "it is simultaneously a liability" [...] and can just as well be used to harm her.|$|E

40|$|Guilt is {{routinely}} characterized as an emotion {{that is not}} central to morality. Guilt is often described in blanket terms that characterize it as a negative emotion that is harmful to the self, {{and that does not}} motivate people to act in pro-social ways. Some argue <b>that</b> <b>guilt</b> should be eliminated from our repertoire of moral emotions altogether. In this paper, I will defend the role of guilt in moral life. First, guilt has an important function in moral motivation. Psychological studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>guilt</b> motivates us to maintain our interpersonal relationships and cooperate with others. Additionally, guilt may {{play an important role in}} moral development, aiding in the acquisition of a moral sense. For these reasons, I will argue that it is morally appropriate to feel <b>guilt,</b> and <b>that</b> the cost of guilt is outweighed by its benefits. Therefore, guilt should not be eliminated from our repertoire of moral emotions, as this would eliminate an essential feature of moral life...|$|R
40|$|Three {{studies are}} {{reported}} in which we examined the relation between responsibility and guilt. Results from Study 1 suggested that responsibility increased {{as a function of}} <b>guilt,</b> but <b>that</b> the reverse relation did not emerge. In the second and third studies we primed either responsibility or guilt and examined how these primes influenced subsequent appraisals for novel events. We also used different manipulations of responsibility and guilt. In Study 2 guilt was operationalized as negative interpersonal consequences as evidenced by the reactions of others. Responsibility was varied by manipulating the controllability of negative outcomes. In Study 3 responsibility was manipulated in terms of the severity of negative consequences for oneself. Results of both studies showed <b>that</b> <b>guilt</b> primes gave rise to perceptions of responsibility but that responsibility primes did not affect perceptions of <b>guilt.</b> We conclude <b>that</b> responsibility is best regarded as an elaborated appraisal generated by guilt, rather than an antecedent of guilt...|$|R

Macmillan's official biographer Alistair Horne believed that Macleod's description of 17 October as “the key day” is evidence that he “changed his mind”, having not previously had a particularly firm opinion. Macmillan’s view was “well, you know … Macleod was a Highlander!” Others (e.g. Macmillan's biographer D.R.
