Hawthorne 1964/1967 {{comments}} about Kettering ignition system: [...] "Practical {{efforts to improve}} or supplant this system have failed, and it has remained virtually unchanged through the years. However, the present trend toward higher performance automobile engines threatens to render this tried and true system obsolete. The principal limitation of the Kettering system is, as typically applied, the inability to develop adequate levels of spark plug gap energy without sacrificing longevity of the <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> or the transformer coil. The inherent inefficiency {{of the system is}} particularly apparent at higher engine speeds." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{having only}} a single rotor, the RE5's engine was {{mechanically}} complex and its numerous subsystems made for a heavy motorcycle. Rotary engines produce a lot of heat, and the RE5 had [...] water- and oil-cooling, and double-skinned exhaust pipes. [...] Ignition was CDI, with two sets of <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> actuated via vacuum and rpm sensors, to light a solitary NGK spark plug. Three oil reservoirs served the sump, gearbox and total loss tank. Separate oil pumps fed (respectively) the main bearings and the inlet tracts (to lubricate tip seals). The throttle controlled both the primary carburetor butterfly and a second valve in the inlet manifold of the secondary throat (the [...] "port" [...] valve), as well as governing oil supply to the combustion chamber. Five cables in total were moved by the throttle twist grip! The carburetor {{was similar to that}} in a rotary-powered car, and was far more complicated than for normal motorcycles.|$|E
2500|$|CDI {{triggered}} by {{two sets of}} points. A basic problem with the rotary engine design {{is a lack of}} engine braking, partially due to the mass of the rotor. Leaning of the mixture on overrun also contributes to erratic and [...] "lumpy" [...] running. One way to solve the problem is to shut off ignition entirely on overrun, but this leads to excessive contamination of the combustion chamber by unwanted deposits, which can cause the apex seals to stick. Suzuki opted for a compromise by using two sets of <b>ignition</b> <b>points.</b> One set of points ran on a dual lobe cam for normal operation, firing the rotor every face. The other set ran on a single cam on the same shaft for triggering the spark plug on overrun. The second set (the B points) were {{triggered by}} an rpm sensor (the speed relay) and a vacuum switch, which meant that they worked on engine deceleration (high vacuum) and above 1,700rpm. This system fired the rotor every second face. This kept the combustion chambers relatively clean. It also served to smooth the lumpy feel of the bike as RPM reduced on overrun and addressed some issues with backfiring (more correctly, [...] "afterfiring"). Engine braking is also significantly improved. The B point system was discontinued on the [...] "A". It is believed that the factory also employed mechanics to visit dealerships and disconnect the B points on any [...] "M" [...] (1975) models still in the showrooms. Suzuki {{toyed with the idea of}} two plugs like the Mazda's, but as with so much of their engineering on this bike, overthought the application, believing that they would require two plugs of different heat ranges. The idea was dropped, and the bike shipped with a single 18mm conical seat gold palladium spark plug housed in a copper insert in the rotor housing (NGK A9EFV).|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} cost will be greatly reduced if nitrogen {{can be used}} instead of inert gas in the spray forming process of magnesium alloys, but {{the heat from the}} reaction between magnesium alloys and nitrogen makes magnesium alloy burn easily. To solve the problem above, the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of Mg-Ca alloy under nitrogen atmosphere was studied using a home-made experimental device and DSC-DTA. Results show that under nitrogen atmosphere, Ca addition has a great effect on the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of Mg alloy. The <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of the Mg- 5 Ca bulk even exceeds 1, 030 ℃, and the alloy can be held for 30 min at 900 ℃ without burning; while the average <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of Mg- 5 Ca powders is lower than 700 ℃, and it increases with the increasing particle size. Moreover, the purity of nitrogen must be in a certain scope; Mg-Ca alloy shows a higher <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> under nitrogen with a purity of 99. 5 %. Based on the experimental results, the best adding content of Ca and the purity of nitrogen were determined, and the security and economic performance of preparing magnesium alloys by spray deposition were improved with nitrogen as atomizing gas...|$|R

5000|$|HEI is characterised by the {{incorporation}} of the ignition coil built into the distributor cap for most applications.

50|$|At {{start the}} <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> is 10° BTDC. To {{facilitate}} start when coolant temperature is below 0°C the ECU will ground each trigger line 210 times/second between 10° BTDC and 20° ATDC, {{at which a}} “multi spark” will appear. The function is active up to an engine speed of 900 RPM. At idle a special ignition matrix is utilised. Normal <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> is 6°-8° BTDC. If the engine stalls e.g. cooling fan activation the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> is advanced up to 20 ° BTDC {{in order to increase}} the engines torque to restore the idle RPM. In the same way the ignition is retarded if the engines RPM is increased. When the TPS senses an increase in throttle opening the ECU leaves the idle ignition timing map and regulates the ignition timing in respect of load and engine speed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Magnesium alloys {{are very}} active and readily ignite during heating and melting. In this study, the ignition-proof {{property}} of AZ 91 D with Nd and Dy addition was discussed, {{and the effects}} of these ignition-proof elements on the microstructure and microhardness of AZ 91 D investigated. The results show that the ignition-proof performance of magnesium alloy is improved obviously. The ignition resistance is attributed to the compact oxide films, which consist of MgO, Al 2 O 3, Nd 2 O 3, Dy 2 O 3. When Dy content increased beyond 0. 5 %, the change tendency of <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of the alloy follows the shape of “v ” curve, and the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> increased with Nd addition. The optimum composition of the newly developed magnesium alloy is AZ 91 D- 3 Nd- 0. 5 Dy with the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> about 60 K higher than AZ 91 D.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{experiments}} were performed {{for the study}} of combustion characteristics of extruded polystyrene foam (XPS). The ignition temperature of extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) was studied by two different means in the fire laboratory of China University of mining and technology. Ignition temperature of extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) was measured by DW- 02 type <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> detector produced in the instrument analysis factory of jiang ning in Nan Jing. Ignition temperature with different heating power was measured by the radiation ignition instrument of extruded polystyrene foam (XPS). Results show that the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) measured by DW- 02 type <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> detector produced in the instrument analysis factory of jiang ning in Nan Jing was approximately 355 °C. <b>Ignition</b> <b>point</b> of extruded polystyrene foam (XPS) insulation board with 2. 2 cm thickness was located approximately at 365 °C ∼ 370 °C, what's more, Ignition time of extruded polystyrene insulation boar (XPS) was gradually shortened as heating power increased. In a word, extruded polystyrene insulation board was more likely ignited by open fire than thermal radiation. Conclusions have a guiding role in setting material pyrolysis parameters during the FDS simulation of extruded polystyrene board (XPS) and have an important reference value in the selection of suitable external insulation materials in the practical engineering...|$|R
40|$|In {{the design}} of {{structures}} in the offshore and process industries, {{the possibility of a}} gas explosion must always be considered. This is usually incorporated by performing explosion simulations. However, estimations based on such calculations introduce uncertainties in the design process. The main uncertainties in explosion simulations are the assumption of the gas cloud,the location of the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> and the properties of the explosion simulator itself. In this thesis, we try to investigate the level of these uncertainties and quantify them. This is done by performing a large number of simulations on three offshore modules; the Piper Alpha C module and the CMR M 24 and M 25 modules in full scale, and one onshoreplant; the Nypro UK plant at Flixborough. The simulations of the offshore modules show that there is an approximate linear relation between pressure and gas volume, it seems possible to find a linear relation between pressure and impulse, an inverse relation between pressure and duration is observed, the response of offshore structures exposed to gas explosion are rarely in the impul-sive regime, loading rates vary widely in magnitude, an assumption of a triangular explosion pulse is often correct, louvres increase pressure, impulse and duration of an explosion. The effect of <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> location is studied in detail. The location of the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> may result in explosion pressure variation with a factor of 20. While explosion impulse as function of <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> location seems to follow a normal distribution, explosion pressure has to be treated with non-parametric statistics. It is possible to derive an <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> uncertainty load factor that shows predictable behaviour by generalising the non-parametric properties of the explosion pressure. The load factor will vary with the chosen level of safety. Values of this factor for the offshore modules with different gas volumes, gas types and different levels of safety are provided. Based on the mean of a few simulations, a factor of 2 will in general be sufficient to achieve the 90 % quantile in any explosion distribution investigated. A model for taking into account the uncertainties regarding gas volume, <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> location and simulator imperfectness is proposed. Several levels of safety may be chosen. The model is intended to produce a characteristic load for structural design...|$|R

40|$|Conditions in the {{underground}} mine environment can cause self-heating of sulfide ores {{as a result of}} exothermic oxidation reactions, which may result in mine fires. This Bureau of Mines report describes thermal analyses of finely ground chalcopyrite, chalcocite, galena, pyrrhotite, marcasite, and arsenopyrite, to characterize their responses under oxidizing conditions. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were used, in the temperature range 1000 to 5000 C. Chalcopyrite showed an initial weight gain, due to formation of sul-fates, a weight loss, caused by ignition of iron sulfide to iron oxide, and a final weight gain, indicating the conversion of copper sulfide to sulfate. Chalcocite did not ignite in the temperature range studied but exhibited a rapid weight gain, because of the rapid conversion of copper sulfide to sulfate. Likewise, galena failed to ignite but underwent a steady weight gain when oxidized in a moist atmosphere, showing conver-sion of lead sulfide to sulfate below the <b>ignition</b> <b>point.</b> Marcasite underwent a rapid weight loss, indicating ignition, at 2000 C. Moisture in the oxidizing atmosphere lowered the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> of marcasite and arsenopyrite but not that of pyrrhotite.

40|$|The current WRF-Fire model {{starts the}} fire from a given <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> {{at a given}} time. We want to start the model from a given fire {{perimeter}} {{at a given time}} instead. However, the fuel balance and the state of the atmosphere depend {{on the history of the}} fire. The purpose of this work is to create an approximate artificial history of the fire based on the given fire perimeter and time and an approximate <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> and time. Replaying the fire history then establishes a reasonable fuel balance and outputs heat fluxes into the atmospheric model, which allow the atmospheric circulation to develop. Then the coupled atmosphere-fire model takes over. In this preliminary investigation, the ignition times in the fire area are calculated based on the distance from the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> to the perimeter, assuming that the perimeter is convex or star-shaped. Simulation results for an ideal example show that the fire can continue in a natural way from the perimeter. Possible extensions include algorithms for more general perimeters and running the fire model backwards in time from the perimeter to create a more realistic history.

A number of pressure peaks were identified and measured during the different stages of the explosion. Compared to end-venting, side-venting further away from the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> gave the worst performance whereas side-venting closer to the <b>ignition</b> <b>point</b> gave a better performance.

50|$|The Maicoletta used a Bosch six volt 'pendulum' {{electric}} starter system.

A separate set of <b>ignition</b> <b>points</b> fired the spark plug in the forward direction only, and when this fires the mixture in the cylinder the engine starts to rotate normally, the starter is released and the normal ignition system takes over.

50|$|In mid-1963, Ford offered {{transistorized}} ignition {{on their new}} 427 FE V8. This system only passed a very low current through the <b>ignition</b> <b>points,</b> using a PNP transistor to perform high-voltage switching of the ignition current, allowing for a higher voltage ignition spark, as well as reducing variations in ignition timing due to arc-wear of the breaker points.

The Delco system eliminated the mechanical points completely, using magnetic flux variation for current switching, virtually eliminating point wear concerns. In 1967, Ferrari and Fiat Dinos came equipped with Magneti Marelli Dinoplex electronic ignition, and all Porsche 911s had electronic ignition beginning with the B-Series 1969 models.
