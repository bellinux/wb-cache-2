5|$|The main {{short-term}} {{danger to}} Enron's survival {{at the end}} of October 2001 seemed to be its credit rating. It was reported at the time that Moody's and Fitch, two of the three biggest credit-rating agencies, had slated Enron for review for possible <b>downgrade.</b> Such a <b>downgrade</b> would force Enron to issue millions of shares of stock to cover loans it had guaranteed, which would decrease the value of existing stock further. Additionally, all manner of companies began reviewing their existing contracts with Enron, especially in the long term, in the event that Enron's rating were lowered below investment grade, a possible hindrance for future transactions.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo's stake {{purchase}} allowed Rare {{to expand}} significantly. The {{number of staff}} members increased from 84 to 250, and Rare moved out from their headquarters at the Manor Farmhouse. Rare also developed a CGI arcade fighting game, Killer Instinct, on their own custom-built arcade machine. Killer Instinct was set to be released for Nintendo's own 64-bit system, the Nintendo 64 in 1995, but was forced to release the game for the 16-bit SNES system, and had to <b>downgrade</b> the game's graphics. Killer Instinct sold 3.2 million copies, and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Killer Instinct 2. Killer Instinct Gold, the console version of Killer Instinct 2, suffered from a graphical <b>downgrade</b> due to the compression technology used to fit the arcade version onto the smaller Nintendo 64 cartridge.|$|E

5|$|On October 29, {{responding}} to growing concerns that Enron might have insufficient cash on hand, news spread that Enron was seeking a further $1–2 billion in financing from banks. The next day, as feared, Moody's lowered Enron's credit rating from Baa1 to Baa2, two levels above junk status. Standard & Poor's affirmed Enron's rating of BBB+, {{the equivalent of}} Moody's Baa1. Moody's also warned that it would <b>downgrade</b> Enron's commercial paper rating, the consequence of which would likely prevent the company from finding the further financing it sought to keep solvent.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Liza was {{the third}} {{hurricane}} of the 1968 Pacific hurricane season. Forming from {{an area of the}} Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on August 28 and reaching tropical storm strength in the same day, Liza meandered generally westward over the Pacific Ocean, reaching hurricane strength on August 29 while far from land. It maintained that intensity until September 2, when the hurricane was downgraded to a tropical storm, but avoided tropical depression status despite the presentation seen by an Air Force reconnaissance plane. After weakening, the storm moved northwestward, weakening to a depression on September 4, when it began a turn to the east. There is a possibility that the depression completed a small loop between the <b>downgrade</b> and its dissipation on September 6.|$|E

5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{opted for}} the all-new MX3000 from Siemens as a {{replacement}} for the T1000 stock instead of the T2000. Although its design was found to be unsuitable, the T2000 was initially not planned to be replaced by the MX3000, as the line was to remain with overhead wires and none of the new MX3000 trains are equipped with pantographs. However, following Oslo's decision to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to full metro standard, allowing longer than two-car trains. A proposal to <b>downgrade</b> the line to light rail standard and make it part of the Oslo Tramway was rejected.|$|E
5|$|A {{strengthening}} {{ridge to}} the south turned the storm {{to the south}}west, bringing Gillian back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When Gillian was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity to land and continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the ridge to the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On14 March, the JTWC again assessed a high potential for Gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting {{the appearance of a}} central dense overcast. At 06:00UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM to <b>downgrade</b> Gillian to a tropical low.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening, Mekkhala tracked northwestward {{and made}} landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar of the Philippines at around 15:00 Philippine Standard Time (07:00UTC), where Typhoon Hagupit also made landfall the month before. Both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Mekkhala to {{a tropical storm}} on January17, due to land interaction weakening the storm significantly. Mekkhala weakened further while crossing the Bicol Region on January 18, leading the JTWC to <b>downgrade</b> it to a tropical depression when it turned northward and emerged into the Philippine Sea. Late on the same day, the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression, and shortly after the JTWC issued the final warning as strong wind shear exposed the LLCC. The tropical depression drifted northeastward and maintained its exposed low-level circulation east of Luzon, until the system was completely absorbed by a stationary front early on January 21.|$|E
40|$|Restricted by {{the rolling}} terrains of mountainous areas in western parts of China, long steep <b>downgrades</b> are {{very common in}} mountainous freeways. Influenced by the factors like high altitude, big {{elevation}} differences, and the severe weather condition e. g. black ice, heavy snow and thick fog, most long steep <b>downgrades</b> turn to traffic accident prone sites. Moreover, once traffic accident happens, the severity is high and the society influence is wide. So the overall safety level of mountainous freeways has been greatly influenced by the safety level of long steep <b>downgrades.</b> In this paper, the safety classification methods and the general design principles of long steep <b>downgrades</b> and the design principles of safety enhancement measures for different sections of long steep <b>downgrades</b> are put forward based on the investigation of typical long steep <b>downgrades</b> in freeways. Then the methods for the safety enhancement measures design on long steep <b>downgrades</b> according to the safety level are expounded. Moreover, the design process of the safety enhancement measures design is presented.

5|$|Barbara {{strengthened}} into {{a hurricane}} around 1800UTC on May29 while located about 65mi (105km) east-southeast of Salina Cruz, Mexico. At its peak intensity {{as it was}} making landfall, it had maximum sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a barometric pressure estimated at 983mbar (hPa; 29.03inHg). With this intensity, Barbara made landfall {{on the coast of}} Tonalá, Chiapas at approximately 1950UTC. This marked both the easternmost and second earliest landfalling hurricane in the basin since reliable records began in 1966. As Barbara moved inland within the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, rapid dissipation occurred. The cloud tops warmed and Barbara degenerated into a tropical storm at 0000UTC on May30. This was followed by a <b>downgrade</b> to tropical depression nine hours later as Barbara's low-level circulation was disrupted by the mountainous terrain. Very early on May 31, the surface circulation of Barbara soon dissipated about 25mi (40km) north-northwest of Coatzacoalcos, Mexico, prior to emerging into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm's associated leftover moisture partially contributed to the formation of Tropical Storm Andrea in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Dora {{held its}} peak {{strength}} for just six hours before {{it began to}} weaken due to cooler waters {{and the presence of}} wind shear. Although the hurricane's initial weakening phase was gradual, the overall structure of Dora quickly deteriorated in response to increasingly hostile wind shear around the storm. The storm's eye abruptly dissipated less than 12hours after Dora's peak intensity, By 1800UTC on July22, the tropical cyclone had weakened to tropical storm intensity, undergoing an 80mph (130km/h) decrease in winds in just 24hours. Continued weakening prompted the NHC to <b>downgrade</b> Dora to a tropical depression two days later at 1200UTC as the system curved west of the Baja California Peninsula. Twelve hours later, the system degenerated into a remnant low pressure area devoid of any thunderstorm activity. The low persisted for a day as it tracked north-northwestward, eventually dissipating 70mi (110km) south-southwest of Bahía Asunción on July 26.|$|E
5|$|Japan is {{the third}} largest {{national}} economy in the world, after the United States and China, in terms of nominal GDP, and the fourth largest national economy in the world, after the United States, China and India, in terms of purchasing power parity. , Japan's public debt was estimated at more than 230 percent of its annual gross domestic product, the largest of any nation in the world. In August 2011, Moody's rating has cut Japan's long-term sovereign debt rating one notch from Aa3 to Aa2 inline {{with the size of}} the country's deficit and borrowing level.

5|$|Most reviewers {{recommended}} the iPhone 5S over the iPhone 5C which was released {{at the same}} time. The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and {{low end of the}} iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting <b>downgrade</b> compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due its additional gold finish.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{weakening}} {{took place}} as the storm moved over the mountainous terrain of northern Luzon. Roughly nine hours after crossing the coastline, Elsie was downgraded to a tropical storm. The weakened storm continued its westward track as it entered the South China Sea along a monsoonal surge. This surge also helped to keep Elsie as a tropical storm due to increased wind shear over the northern portion of the cyclone. The JMA, unlike the JTWC, did not <b>downgrade</b> Elsie to a tropical storm until October21. Failing to re-intensify, Elsie eventually made landfall in central Vietnam on October22 and degenerated into a remnant-low pressure system early the following day. The remnants of Elsie were monitored by the JTWC on satellite imagery {{for a short time}} until the former typhoon dissipated over Laos.|$|E
5|$|The first {{storm of}} the season {{originated}} from an area of convection east of Diego Garcia in early October 2001.

On October5, the agency re-classified it as a tropical disturbance and later as Tropical Depression 1. The circulation was partially exposed due to wind shear, although it had good outflow. The JTWC initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 01S at 0600UTC on October6, estimating winds of about 65km/h (40mph). Due to the shear, the convection gradually diminished, prompting the MFR to <b>downgrade</b> it to a tropical disturbance on October7.
