25|$|This {{image from}} the NASA {{archives}} shows several missing tiles on the STS-1 OMS pods. The problem on Columbia was that the damage was sustained from a foam strike to the reinforced carbon-carbon leading edge panel of the wing, not the heat tiles. The first Shuttle mission, STS-1, had a protruding <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> that diverted hot gas into the right wheel well on re-entry, resulting in a buckling of the right main landing gear door.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Craig Harris {{said that}} the titles were [...] "like a <b>gap</b> <b>filler</b> to make the wait for a new Pokémon game {{just a little more}} bearable". Jim Sterling of Destructoid stated, [...] "While it is, at its core, the same game that you've played many years ago, it still manages to feel new and the updated {{features}} bolster the original experience in a manner that never intrudes and only enhances". 1UP.com's Justin Haywald stated that [...] "HeartGold/SoulSilver is easily the best Pokémon game yet". VideoGamer.com reviewer Jamin Smith said, [...] "With HeartGold and SoulSilver the Pokémon series has reached a point where it can't get any better." [...] Eurogamer's Keza MacDonald gave the games a 9/10, stating [...] "They combine everything that was best about the older Pokémon games", citing the Pokémon designs and improved graphics and battle system. GamePros McKinley Noble stated that [...] "it's clear that this is a perfect experience for both old-school trainers and the newest generation of Pokémon fans." [...] GameZone's Cliff Bakehorn III said, [...] "There is not a doubt in my mind: Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are the pinnacle of the entire series." [...] Nathan Meunier of GameSpot gave the games one of the lower scores, criticizing them for a lack of innovation. GamesRadar attributed the game's success to being a remake of classic games.|$|E

2500|$|Because of the curve, <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> were required, and {{are still}} used, {{to bridge the gap}} between the {{platform}} and the doors. The now-automated <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> previously required manual operation, with a foreman and at least two train crew, all of who could directly see each other; the train crew had to give a signal to the foreman, who pulled a [...] tall wooden lever to manually extend and retract the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers.</b> The <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> are also unreliable, as they need 15 days of maintenance for every 6 months in service.|$|R

50|$|Because {{the orbiter}} {{did not have}} any handholds on its {{underside}} (as they would cause much more trouble with reentry heating than the protruding <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> of concern), astronaut Stephen K. Robinson worked from the ISS's robotic arm, Canadarm2. Because the TPS tiles were quite fragile, there had been concern that anyone working under the vehicle could cause more damage to the vehicle than was already there, but NASA officials felt that leaving the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> alone was a greater risk. In the event, Robinson was able to pull the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> free by hand, and caused no damage to the TPS on Discovery.|$|R

25|$|Alternatively, the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> may {{be mounted}} on the train, and linked to the door {{operating}} mechanism. They may be found on modern trainsets, like various versions of the Stadler GTW. Train-mounted <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> {{eliminate the need for}} careful alignment and, as the driver only gets the signal that the doors have closed when the fillers have fully retracted, require no special synchronization on departure. Moving all active components of the system to the train instead of the platform allows maintenance to be performed in a shop, rather than in the field. The city of Singapore has committed to specifying its newer trains with <b>gap</b> <b>fillers,</b> to reduce the incidence of platform gap accidents in its crowded stations.|$|R

25|$|Tracks 1 and 3 have <b>gap</b> <b>fillers.</b> Track 4 {{does not}} have <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> because of the convex curve of the platform. Track 4 can barely fit the three cars of the shuttle; it {{originally}} ended at a wall but now has a small extension for alighting passengers, so the last pair of doors of the train keep one panel disabled for added safety. Track 3 can accommodate trains with four cars as well as space for half a fifth.|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{curvature}} on the platforms, <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> {{are used to}} bridge the gap between train and platform; however, the <b>gap</b> <b>fillers,</b> which are under the platform rather than flush with the platform, are not suitable for wheelchair passengers, making the shuttle platforms virtually inaccessible to wheelchair users. Such passengers who need service to Grand Central must use the IRT Flushing Line platforms. An underpass that formerly connected the original side platforms lies between the downtown local track and the other three tracks of the BMT Broadway Line, which runs perpendicular to the shuttle.|$|R
40|$|The Semi Interlocking Masonry (SIM) bricks were {{designed}} and {{developed at the}} Univer- sity of Newcastle as {{a new type of}} energy dissipation device in buildings for use as wall panels in seismic regions. The interlocking features of SIM prevent the relative out-of-plane movement of bricks in the panel; however permit limited longitudinal movement along the bed-joint. Dry stacked SIM wall could have some gaps in both bedding and perpend joints which reduce thermal insulation efficiency. In this study non-adhesive gap-fillers were employed to improve the thermal insulation of SIM walls. The objec- tive {{of this study is to}} examine thermal properties of SIM walls by use of standard testing methodology (ASTM C 1363) and suitability of selected <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> for intended application. The results of thermal tests showed that, the thermal properties of SIM walls with <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> are equal of normal concrete wall and also, it was concluded that, the type of <b>gap</b> <b>fillers</b> has an insignificant effect on the thermal performance of SIM walls...|$|R
