40|$|Background and purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} whether postgraduate physical therapy students studying manipulation could learn to accurately produce specific forces during palpation of an intervertebral joint. Subjects. The 12 subjects (7 female, 5 male), aged 26 to 36 years (X= 295, SD— 2. 9), had each completed a 4 -year degree course in physical therapy and had worked between 3 and 10 years in clinical practice.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the performances of children exercising against varying braking forces in short-term, all-out cycling tests. The braking force resistances were 0. 04, 0. 065, 0. 075, and 0. 08 <b>kiloponds</b> for every kilogram of body mass (kp. kgBM- 1). Results for the peak and mean power performances in 30 s Wingate Anaerobic Tests (WAnT) were recorded for a wide age range {{of male and female}} children [6 (n = 23), 8 (n = 19), 10 (n = 19), and 12 (n = 14) years of age]. Univariate ANOVAs with repeated measures on resistance, and Newman Keuls post hoc analysis tests revealed that the absolute peak and mean power responses of the children increased incrementally with age and demonstrated very few sex differences. The overall meaned peak and mean power values of the four resistances and age groups were 161, 231, 242 and 248 Watts and 130, 183, 189, and 196 Watts, respectively. In all of the age groups the three higher resistances (0. 065, 0. 075, and 0. 08 kp. kgBM- 1) produced significantly higher peak and mean power performances than did the 0. 04 kp. kgBM- 1 resistance. The overall meaned relative peak and mean power values of the four resistances and age groups were 4. 9, 6. 9, 7. 4 and 7. 4 W. kg- 1 and 4. 2, 5. 2, 5. 7 and 6. 2 W. kg- 1, respectively.

All objects on the Earth's surface are subject to a gravitational acceleration of approximately 9.8 m/s2. The General Conference on Weights and Measures fixed the value of standard gravity at precisely 9.80665 m/s2 so that disciplines such as metrology would have a standard value for converting units of defined mass into defined forces and pressures.

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the energy cost of {{standardized}} physical activity (ECA) between patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy control subjects. Design: Cross-sectional study using patients with CF and volunteers from the community. Setting: University laboratory. Subjects: Fifteen patients (age 24. 6 +/- 4. 6 y) recruited with consent from their treating physician and 16 healthy control subjects (age 25. 3 +/- 3. 2) recruited via local advertisement. Interventions. Patients and controls walked on a computerised treadmill at 1. 5 km/h for 60 min followed by a 60 min recovery period and, on a second occasion, cycled at 0. 5 kp (<b>kilopond),</b> 30 rpm followed by a 60 min recovery. The ECA was measured via indirect calorimetry. Resting energy expenditure (REE), nutritional status, pulmonary function and genotype were determined. Results: The REE in patients was significantly greater than the REE measured in controls (P = 0. 03) and was not related to the severity of lung disease or genotype. There was a significant difference between groups when comparing the ECA for walking kg root FFM (P = 0. 001) and cycling kg root FFM (P = 0. 04). The ECA for each activity was adjusted (ECA(adj)) for the contribution of REE (ECA kJ kg root FFM 120 min(- 1) - REE kJ kg root FFM 120 min(- 1)). ECA(adj) revealed a significant difference between groups for the walking protocol (P = 0. 001) but no difference for the cycling protocol (P = 0. 45). This finding may be related to the fact that the work rate during walking was more highly regulated than during cycling. Conclusions ECA in CF is increased and is likely to be explained by an additional energy-requiring component related to the exercise itself and not an increased REE. Sponsorship.

40|$|Purpose: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine a biomechanical model and to help answer fundamental questions that relate to rigid plate fixation in the maxilla. Specifically, we sought to elucidate the principal strain patterns generated in the maxilla secondary to masticatory forces as well as the amount of permanent deformational changes incurred due to these loading forces. Materials and Methods: Cadaveric heads with the mandible removed were defleshed and placed in a 2 -part testing rig to hold and position the skull for testing in a standard material testing system. Rosette strain gages were attached at predefined points on the skull, and an Instron machine was used to load the skull through the loading port on the tray. A Le Fort I osteotomy was then performed on the skull, and a Walter Lorenz Ultra-Micro plating system was applied by a surgeon to reconnect the upper jaw. A 2 -mm gap was left at the line of the osteotomy, and a transducer was attached to measure closure of the gap. Again the skull was loaded with the Instron (Canton, MA) machine. Results: The results indicate a linear relationship exists with both maximum (tensile) and minimum (compressive) strain patterns relative to incremental load placement on the intact maxilla. The strain patterns after the Le Fort I osteotomy and plating were different and less linear. The differential variable reluctance transducer data showed a low rate of closure or transient increase in the gap at low loads (0 to 15 <b>kilopond</b> [kp] range) and a steeper slope of closure during high loads (15 to 60 kp range). It is also evident that axial loading forces cause permanent deformation and failure of osseous plating systems predominantly through bending. Conclusions: This model provides a foundation of knowledge regarding biomechanical strains in the maxilla subjected to static compressive loads in the force range of mastication. In addition, it serves as a comparative reference to assess rigidity of various craniofacial plating systems and to validate proposed standardized synthetic models. With the advent of increasingly precise surgery and new plating systems, this model can be used to help guide placement and design of plating systems; thereby allowing for ideal stabilization and optimizing surgical outcome...|$|E
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that submaximal cycle {{ergometer}} testing presents a reduced V 02 max score when {{compared to that of}} the treadmill test. In this study, we compared a submaximal economy test on the Monark Cycle Ergometer. The {{purpose of this study was}} for each participant to perform the same test and compare economy, V 02 ml/kg/min for a given workload, as well as calories burned between males and females during the nine minute test. By testing economy for each participant, we aim to determine whether males or females use oxygen more efficiently during testing. Before beginning the test, the Cosmed metabolic equipment was calibrated. The test was standardized to last for nine minutes at 70 rotations per minute and 1 <b>kilopond</b> of resistance. Based off of the comparison in V 02 mL/kg/min and kCal mL/kg/min, the women had the highest V 02 per given workload and also had the lowest calories burned. The women were the least efficient by having a higher V 02 while working at the same intensity as the male participants. The research used to support this study indicates that there are two components for overall metabolic power during a dynamic leg exercise on the cycle ergometer; the power used to overcome the resistance applied to the ergometer and the rate of energy expenditure required to move the lower limbs without opposition against the opposition load (Girardis, Linnarsson, Moia, Pendergast, 2 ̆ 6 Ferretti, 1999). It is also stated that during exercise at submaximal levels below lactate threshold the net V 02 of the whole body is equivalent of the net rate of energy expenditure (Storer, Davis, 2 ̆ 6 Caiozzo, 1990). The cycle ergometer is a good use to determine V 02 by collecting expired air and the volume measured in the spirometer (Saltin 2 ̆ 6 Astrand, 1967). For the results of this lab to be more accurate the resistance and intensity could have been changed at different stages of the test. This would have given and more accurate measure of the ability of each participant to reach the next stage of testing...|$|E
