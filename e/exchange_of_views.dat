5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} debate about whether Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>views.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 2, {{the council}} {{repeated}} the requirement on the baptism of all babies and some {{who failed to}} comply were arrested and fined, Manz and Blaurock among them. Zwingli and Jud interviewed them and more debates were held before the Zurich council. Meanwhile, the new teachings continued to spread {{to other parts of}} the Confederation as well as a number of Swabian towns. On 6–8 November, the last debate on the subject of baptism took place in the Grossmünster. Grebel, Manz, and Blaurock defended their cause before Zwingli, Jud, and other reformers. There was no serious <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> as each side would not move from their positions and the debates degenerated into an uproar, each side shouting abuse at the other.|$|E

25|$|Foch met Rawlinson on 3 July {{and then}} with Joffre met Haig during the afternoon, at which they objected to the {{shifting}} {{of the weight of}} the British offensive to the right flank. Haig pointed out that there was insufficient artillery ammunition to resume the attack in the north and after a full and frank <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> Joffre acquiesced. The British would end the offensive north of the Ancre and concentrate on the area between Montauban and Fricourt and then attack the German second position between Loguelval and Bazentin le Petit. Joffre gave Foch responsibility for co-ordinating the French effort with the British. Foch arranged for the French Sixth Army to continue the offensive on the south bank and to bring two more corps into the XX Corps area on the north bank to advance to the Péronne–Bapaume road to outflank the German defences along the river, dismounted cavalry linking the attacks {{on either side of the}} river. That night the Fourth Army staff ordered that preparations be made for an attack on the German second position from Longueval to Bazentin le Petit, by advancing to attacking distance through Bernafay and Caterpillar woods, Mametz Wood, Contalmaison and north of La Boisselle. The Reserve Army was to pin the German garrisons to its front and X Corps was to expand its footholds on the German front line. Haig met Rawlinson again on 4 July and laid down that Trônes Wood on the boundary with the French XX Corps, with Contalmaison and Mametz Wood on the left flank must be captured, to cover the flanks of the attack on the German second position, then visited the corps commanders to emphasise the urgency of these attacks. Foch informed Rawlinson that the French would attack at Hardecourt, together with British attacks on Trônes Wood and Maltz Horn Farm. On 5 July, Haig met Rawlinson and Gough, to arrange the preparatory attacks and to allot daily ammunition rations, most of which went to the Fourth Army. Next day Rawlinson met Fayolle to co-ordinate the attacks on Hardecourt and Trônes Wood due on 7 July, which was then postponed to 8 July after a German counter-attack on Bois Favière.|$|E

500|$|During the war, Chadwick, Cockcroft, Oliphant, Peierls, Harrie Massey and Herbert Skinner {{had met in}} Washington, DC, in November 1944, {{and drawn}} up a {{proposal}} for a British atomic energy research establishment, which they had calculated would cost around £1.5 million. The Tube Alloys Committee endorsed their recommendation in April 1945, and Attlee announced its creation in the House of Commons on 29 October 1945, informing the House that it would cost about £1 million to build and £500,000 per annum to run. The obvious choices for a director of the new establishment were Chadwick and Cockcroft, and the former urged that the latter be appointed. Cockcroft agreed, subject to stipulation in writing that he would be answerable only to the Minister and his Permanent Secretary, and, except where subject to requirements for military secrecy, the establishment would be run like a university, with free <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> and the publication of papers. His appointment was announced in November 1945, although he did not leave Canada until September 1946. The Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) did not come under Portal's control until January 1950. A committee selected a site for the AERE at RAF Harwell, an airfield about [...] south of Oxford. The airfield was a modern one, with a long runway, and the Air Ministry was reluctant to release it until the Prime Minister intervened.|$|E

In response to the British warning, Bethmann Hollweg suddenly changed course. As he wrote to Prince Tschirschky: [...] "If therefore, Austria should reject all mediation, we are faced with a conflagration in which Britain would be against us, Italy and Romania in all probability not with us. We should be two Powers against Four. With Britain an enemy, the weight of the operations would fall on Germany... Under these circumstances we must urgently and emphatically suggest to the Vienna Cabinet acceptance of mediation under the present honourable conditions. The responsibility falling on us and Austria for the consequences which would ensure in case of refusal would be uncommonly heavy." [...] Five minutes later, Bethmann Hollweg asked Vienna in a second message to stop [...] "refusing any <b>exchange</b> <b>of</b> <b>views</b> with Russia", and warned that they [...] "must refuse to allow Vienna to draw us into a world conflagration frivolously and without regard to our advice." [...] In another message, Bethmann Hollweg wrote [...] "To avert a general catastrophe or in any case to put Russia in the wrong, we must urgently wish Vienna to begin and continue conversations with Russia." [...] As the historian Fritz Fischer noted, only when Bethmann Hollweg received a clear warning that Britain would intervene in a war did he begin to apply pressure on Austria for peace. Bethmann Hollweg's advice was rejected by Austria as being too late. Count Berchtold told the German Ambassador that he would need a few days to think about the German offer, and until then, events would proceed.|$|E
