When not properly applied, {{the presence of these}} filters may have a significant influence on mould filling. 3 -D casting simulation has been applied to study the effects of the use of a ceramic filter on the metal flow in a gating system. Instead of using a pressure drop model to represent the behaviour of a fluid metal flow passing through a filter, a real exact filter geometry, which is created by a high resolution CT-scan and a non-destructive imaging technique, in the gating system is applied in the simulation. In this research, nodular cast iron is poured into a block casting. A depressurized gating system is used. After a choke, a filter with different orientations is placed in the system. Mould filling coupled with temperature is simulated. Geometries using different orientations of the filter, and without the filter have been researched. The simulated results show that the filter has no influence on the pouring time of the casting if the choke section is small enough compared to the effective section of the filter. Although the filter has no significant influence on the flow patterns in the block casting itself, the flow patterns in the <b>filter</b> <b>zone</b> are different. When the liquid metal passes a horizontal filter, it will be broken into many small streams and show a shower effect. After the part under the filter is full, the shower effect disappears.

40|$|TThe Closepet Granite, in South India, is a large, syntectonic Archaean {{granitic}} complex. Differential erosion has exposed it {{from the}} lower (25 km) to upper crust (5 km). Four main parts are recognized from bottom to top: (i) A root zone, where magmas formed, collected and rose within active shear zones, leaving schlieren behind. The surrounding crust was highly ductile, leading to diffuse deformation. (ii) A transfer zone, where the magma was progressively enriched in K-feldspar phenocrysts during its ascent. In this part, the granite rose as a mush moving as a whole within a less ductile crust. Slow cooling was responsible for a long magma residence time under conditions favoring to fabric enhancement and strain partitioning, leading to horizontal and vertical melt migration. (iii) A gap (dyke complex that acted as a <b>filter</b> <b>zone),</b> were the ascent of the mush was stopped. Probably due to high phenocryst load and high viscosity contrast with the wall rocks.

40|$|An {{embankment}} dam {{can be defined}} as a construction/barrier that impounds water. It’s main function is to collect water i. e. store water in the reservoir formed upstream of the dam. High safety standards is required with regard to the risk of damage to the dam or dam failure and the consequences it can bring to the environment, impact on buildings and facilities in the immediate area and along the river valley. As a part of the dam safety measures is the need to supplement the instrumentation of the dams. The aim off this supplement should at least reach the minimum level specified by RIDAS. However, what is not covered in RIDAS is how the installation of measuring equipment in {{embankment dam}}s should be performed. Installation work is in many parts critical to the future quality of measurement results. Drilling in an embankment dam is a delicate job because use of water, air or any other drilling additives can cause damage to central parts of the dam that are subjected to unilateral water pressure. In this thesis, a literature and field study are conducted about the drilling methods that are suitable for embankment dams and those that are currently used for instrumentation of dams as well as how the work with these methods is carried out. The study shows that the choice of drilling method and drilling fluid is determined by the location of the borehole. The circulating media used to remove drill cuttings, affects soil material around the borehole to varying degrees. This largely depends on the permeability of the material that the drilling take place in. Air requires greater flow rate for efficient flushing of drill cuttings than water or any other type of drilling fluid. Higher flow rate gives a greater impact on the soil formation. The methods of choice when advancing a drill hole through an embankment to set casing should fall on one of those methods that adds as little pressure from circulating media as possible to the surrounding soil formation, such as OD- and DR-drilling. Eccentric/concentric methods can be very inappropriate to use in a <b>filter</b> <b>zone</b> which is sensitive to pressurization, but it may be appropriate to use to set casing in supporting fill that is not sensitive to pressurization. An exception is the Wassara method, that with its low flow rate, {{can be used in a}} <b>filter</b> <b>zone.</b> Both a drill engineer and a geotechnical engineer that works as a controller, must have knowledge of the construction of a dam, material, different zones and the risks associated with the drilling procedures of an embankment dam. This is to reduce the risk of dealing causing to the dam during execution of drilling work. Validerat; 20110607 (anonymous...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 During {{construction}} of the embankment at Blue River Dam placement difficulties were occasionally experienced with the <b>filter</b> <b>zone</b> sands. In the extreme condition construction equipment became mired {{and part of the}} fill had to be removed and wasted. A laboratory investigation was conducted on materials from the above project to determine the amount of fines (material passing a No. 200 U. S.

It was reasoned the construction difficulties were due to the development of pore pressures in the sand and a subsequent loss of shear strength. In this investigation the field condition was simulated by vibrating a saturated sand sample under constant surface load and allowing the sample to drain to its top surface. During the period of vibratory loading pore pressures were measured at different depths in the sample. It was found that for a fines content greater than five percent relatively impermeable layers and excessive changes in pore pressures developed in the sample. It was concluded that these pressures were sufficient to cause construction difficulties. For a fines content less than five percent the pore pressure development was negligible.

Our approach combined field studies and “in situ” experiments to highlight {{the structure of the}} biological active <b>filter</b> <b>zone</b> as well as the mechanisms and effects of clogging in the interstices that influence the infiltration process. Campaigns to measure “in situ” infiltration rates and hydraulic potential were conducted monthly from March 2004 to April 2005. Meiofaunal abundances and fine particulate organic matter (FPOM) were determined every 6 weeks in freeze cores down to depths of 50 cm. In parallel, concentrations of carbon, nitrogen and chlorophyll a were measured in samples of unfrozen sediment cores, that were divided in 1 -cm steps down to depths of ≥ 10 cm. Similar sediment profiles were generated for analysis of colloidal carbohydrates, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and proteins between December 2005 and June 2006. Electron microscopy was used to visualize biofilm structure. Long-term experiments with natural FPOM and melamine resin particles as fluorescent tracers were performed to study “in situ” particle retention and transport, respectively. Additionally seston input was quantified during a 1 -week period in April 2005. Infiltration rates showed a high temporal and spatial variability, but were not correlated with hydraulic conductivities as hydraulic gradients changed a lot. Likewise a correlation between infiltration rates and hydraulic potentials was not observed, indicating clogging processes. These are triggered to a high extend by biological compounds. In addition, seston input and intermittent gas intrusion are considered to reduce the hydraulic conductivity considerably. No significant “in situ” transport of inert natural fluorescent tracers was observed. However, a complete and permanent clogging of the sandy sediment does not occur, and daily infiltration rates of 0. 7 – 27 Lm− 2 h− 1 (mean 9 Lm− 2 h− 1) guarantee a sufficient water supply by bank filtration for decades...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{analyses}} {{are presented in}} this thesis to address potential stability problems that may occur during gradual raisings and under seismic loading conditions of Aitik tailings dam in northern Sweden. The dam is mainly raised using upstream construction method. It is planned to raise the dam gradually in several stages. Two dam parts were studied. The first dam part is a straight dam portion, and the second dam part is a corner. The main concerns associated with future raisings of the straight dam part were: (i) {{the stability of the}} dam could be affected by an increase in excess pore pressures during sequential raisings, (ii) how to gradually strengthen the dam by using rockfill berms as supports {{in such a way that}} required slope stability can be achieved with a minimum volume of rockfill berms, and (iii) if the dam is subjected to seismic loading, whether or not an increase in excess pore pressures could lead to extensive liquefaction which may cause a failure. The problems related to the dam corner were that tension zones and/or low compression zones could develop because of the horizontal pressure of the stored tailings on the inside of the curvature of the dam corner. Numerical analyses were conducted on both the dam parts using finite element method. Two dimensional (2 D) plane strain finite element model was utilized to analyse the straight dam. The dam corner was analysed with both the three dimensional (3 D) finite element model, and the 2 D axisymmetric finite element model. Coupled deformation and consolidation analyses, and slope stability analyses were performed on both the dam parts to simulate gradual raisings, and to compute safety factors. In addition to this, dynamic analyses were carried out on the straight dam part to evaluate the potential for liquefaction, and seismic stability of the dam. The seismic behaviour of the dam was analysed for two cases: (i) a normal case (earthquake of 3. 6 Swedish local magnitude), and (ii) an extreme case (earthquake of 5. 8 moment magnitude). The results of the straight dam part, with only previously existing rockfill berms, indicate that stability of the dam was reduced due to an increase in excess pore pressures during raisings. Rockfill berms were utilized as supports to raise the dam with enough safety. An optimization technique was utilized to minimize the volume of rockfill berms. This technique could result in significant saving of cost of rockfill berms. The results of the dam corner show that tension zones and/or low compression zones were located on the surface of the dam corner, mainly above the phreatic level. It is interpreted that there is no risk of internal erosion through the embankments because no seepage path occurs above the phreatic level, and a <b>filter</b> <b>zone</b> exists along the slope of the dam. It is suggested to gradually strengthen the dam corner with rockfill berms. The results of the 2 D axisymmetric analyses of the dam corner were in a fairly good agreement with those of the 3 D analyses. This implies that the 2 D axisymmetric {{analyses are}} valid for this dam corner. This is an important finding as 2 D axisymmetric analyses require much less computational time compared to 3 D analyses. The results of the dynamic analyses performed on the straight dam (including additional rockfill berms) suggest that, for the extreme case, liquefaction could occur in a limited zone that is located below the surface near the embankments. For both the normal and the extreme case, (i) seismically induced displacements seem to be tolerable, and (ii) the post seismic stability of the dam is considered to be sufficient. The findings of this study have been practically applied to the Aitik tailings dam. In general, the modelling procedure and the optimization technique to minimize volume of rockfill berms, presented in this study, could be applied to other tailings dams.

40|$|The Lesser Sunda Archipelago, {{also known}} as Nusa Tenggara, lies in the southeastern portion of Indonesia and extends between Bali in the west, and New Guinea in the east. While the Lesser Sundas {{themselves}} are oceanic islands {{that have never been}} land bridged to a continent the islands on either side do. Bali and the other Greater Sunda Islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo become periodically land bridged with Asia during glacial maxima forming the Sunda Shelf. New Guinea and Aru become periodically land bridged to Australia during glacial maxima and form the Sahul Shelf. Given their current orientation, the Lesser Sundas may act as ‘stepping stones’ for animals and plants dispersing between the Sunda and Sahul Shelves and may act as a two-way filter for organisms dispersing between two of the world’s great biogeographical realms. Alfred Russel Wallace’s discovery of a pattern of clinal mixture of species from different biogeographical realms was a key insight leading to his identification of the Wallace Line and to his creation of the field of biogeography. Even though the Lesser Sundas {{played a critical role in}} the development of the field, this region has received little subsequent attention from historical biogeographers and our current understanding of Lesser Sunda biogeography has only modestly improved relative to what was known at the time of Wallace. The reptiles and amphibians of the Lesser Sundas represent a particularly interesting group of vertebrates from a biogeographical standpoint because they appear to show distributional patterns that are most consistent with a stepping-stone model of island colonization caused by the two-way <b>filter</b> <b>zone.</b> In Chapter 1, I review the geological and biogeographical literature for the Lesser Sundas and use these sources to formulate hypotheses concerning the colonization of the archipelago by rafting terrestrial vertebrates. In Chapters 2 through 4, I investigate the possibility that flying lizards, forest skinks, and fanged frogs have colonized the archipelago in a stepping-stone manner using a phylogenomic approach (using sequence data from mtDNA and hundreds of nuclear loci) whereby the relationships among island-specific lineages can be used to infer the sequence of island colonization. Flying lizards of the genus Draco form a monophyletic group that colonized the western Inner Arc islands of Lombok or Sumbawa from the Sunda Shelf around 10 million years ago when Lombok and Sumbawa first became land-positive. Draco continued expanding eastward through the Inner Arc until they reached Lembata, while a series of dispersal events from Flores south to Sumba, east to Timor, north to Wetar, west to Alor, and finally west to Pantar (the island immediately west of Lembata). The islands of Sumbawa and Flores contain multiple non-sister lineages that are parapatrically distributed and are exchanging migrants within an island. Forest Skinks of the genus Sphenomorphus show relatively little morphological divergence across their range yet exhibit large levels of genetic divergence. The oldest lineages of Sphenomorphus within the Lesser Sundas occur on the islands of Lombok and Flores and they expanded eastward through the Inner Arc until they reached Pantar. But rather than reaching Alor from neighboring Pantar, Sphenomorphus dispersed from Flores south to Sumba, then east to Timor, Alor, and Wetar. There are multiple non-sister lineages of Sphenomorphus on Lombok, Flores, and Sumba, and estimates of migration between lineages within each island suggest that these lineages are not interbreeding. Fanged frogs of the genus Limnonectes have colonized the Inner Arc of the Lesser Sundas from the Sunda Shelf. It is possible that Limnonectes kadarsani and L. dammermani diverged in situ on Lombok after which L. kadarsani dispersed east all the way to Lembata. But rather although a tree topology consistent with a stepping-stone pattern of island colonization is suggested by the mtDNA data, the phylogenomic results suggest a leap-frog pattern where Lembata is derived from West Flores, and these two lineages are closer related to Sumbawa than they are to Eastern Flores. The parapatrically distributed lineages on Flores are experiencing asymmetrical gene flow with successful migrants moving from west to east. In summary, the oldest islands of the western Inner Arc tend to harbor the most divergent lineages for all three focal taxa, a pattern expected from lineages originating from the Sunda Shelf. In Draco and Sphenomorphus, the islands of the eastern Inner Banda Arc are colonized by way of the ‘Sumba Route’ where they disperse into the Outer Banda Arc island of Sumba and then move east to Timor, and finally north into the eastern Inner Arc. All three focal taxa show multiple non-sister lineages on some of the larger islands, suggesting either that multiple colonization events of a single island occurred, or possibly that formerly separated paleo-islands have since merged allowing for secondary contact of lineages that diverged in allopatry. These studies have shown that the biogeography of reptiles and amphibians within the Lesser Sundas is extremely complex. By examining biogeographical patterns across many co-distributed taxa these studies have the potential to provide insights into the geological history of the archipelago. From an evolutionary perspective, these studies highlight the presence of multiple independently evolving lineages within a currently described species occurring on the same island, which suggests that species diversity within reptiles and amphibians of the Lesser Sundas is underestimated...|$|E

The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to estimate permanent displacements of Tehri dam due to an earthquake of magnitude Mw = 8 · 5, the occurrence of which has a high probability in the region, and for an earthquake of magnitude Mw = 7 · 0, for which the dam has been currently designed. A two-dimensional finite element analysis and five different semi-empirical and empirical methods, like, Seed and Makdisi’s method, Newmark’s double integration method, Jansen’s method, Swaisgood’s method and Bureau’s method have been utilized to study the probable dynamic behaviour of the dam and their results are compared to get a range of values within which, the permanent displacement of the dam, is estimated to lie. The present study shows that the predicted displacements due to an earthquake of magnitude Mw = 7 · 0 are significant but not enough to compromise the safety of the dam. However, the displacements predicted for an earthquake of magnitude Mw = 8 · 5 are quite high and might cause rupture of <b>filter</b> <b>zones.</b> The maximum deformations (755 cm for Mw = 8 · 5 and 43 cm for Mw = 7 · 0) are predicted by Seed and Makdisi’s method while the minimum deformations (14 cm for Mw = 8 · 5 and 2 · 5 cm for Mw = 7 · 0) are computed by Jansen’s method...|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{sputtered}} clusters are {{swept through}} the aggregation region (10 − 1 Torr) by argon and helium gases, where these clusters nucleate to form a distribution of nanoclusters of various sizes as represented in Fig. 2. Energetic Cu atoms sputtered from the target are cooled by the He gas leading to the nucleation of clusters. The nucleation of these small cluster ‘seeds’ {{is followed by the}} growth of the seeds into larger clusters. The growth of clusters is heavily dependent of interatomic collisions; this states the importance of Ar and He. Once the Cu clusters grow in size to exceed a critical radius, large clusters grow from the cluster seeds at a faster rate than that at which new seeds are formed. Since He is primarily responsible for the cluster-condensation process, the He partial pressure is used to control the cluster size distribution. The residence time within the aggregation zone can be varied by varying the length of the aggregation region with the linear motion drive. By controlling the aggregation length, and the residence time, one can control the distribution of the nanocluster size within the aggregation region. The nucleation and growth of clusters ceases after expansion through a nozzle where clusters expands into the <b>filtering</b> <b>zone,</b> which is maintained at a much lower pressure (10 − 4 Torr). In our system, the experimental conditions restrict the size of the nanoparticles in the range of 1 – 20 nm governed by the thermodynamic stabilities related to the cluster binding energies and recombination processes.|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the present thesis are a) {{the study of the}} behaviour of earth dams bodies under static loads charging and b) the standardization of a simulation procedure by the use of the finite element method. The data are coming from the body of the earth dam of the power plan of Sfikia. Those data concerns: a) the details of the dam's body, b) the instruments network, c) the recordings of the laboratory tests and d) the recordings of the instruments. The materials of the core were subjected to several tests. Using the data coming from 275 undistributed samples we defined the constitutive law and the mechanical parameters that reproduce the stress - strain relationship of those materials. The materials of the <b>filter</b> <b>zones</b> and the materials of the supporting zones were subjected to special laboratory tests that were carried out on very large disturbed samples. Using the data coming from those tests we determined with accuracy the mechanical properties of the zones. We also managed to define the constitutive laws of the materials. The accurate calculation of the mechanical properties and the constitutive laws combined with the calculating power of the finite element method code designed by PLAXIS BV gave us the capability to standardize a simulation procedure. In order to improve that procedure we use the readings coming from the instruments that they are permanently instituted into the dam. By the use of parametrical analyses we determined the influence of the values of Poisson ratio and of the core' s constitutive law on the results of the simulation procedure. ...|$|R

Employing a two stage approach, it {{takes advantage of the}} descriptive power of the Bag of Visual Words (BOVW) representation and the discriminative power of the proposed Longest Weighted Profile (LWP) algorithm. First, we try to identify the zones of images that share common characteristics with the query as summed up in a BOVW. Then, we <b>filter</b> these <b>zones</b> using the LWP introducing spatial constraints extracted from the query.

40|$|Vent blocking, the {{covering}} of the <b>filter</b> ventilation <b>zone</b> on a cigarette during smoking, is a potentially {{important aspect of}} smoking behavior. Various techniques {{have been used to}} assess the incidence of vent blocking, and widely different views have been expressed on its importance. Studies relevant to filter vent blocking have been reviewed with two overall objectives: to examine critically the evidence on the occurrence of vent blocking and to assess the effects of vent blocking on the smoke yield to the smoker. The reviewed studies fall into four main categories: (1) measurements of the incidence of filter vent blocking among smokers; (2) the observed effects of vent blocking on cigarette ventilation and machine smoke yields; (3) the effect of experimentally blocking vents on human smoke yields; and (4) simultaneous determination of vent blocking and smoke yield under human smoking conditions. Direct observation indicates that only 4 % of smokers have their fingers in direct contact with the cigarette during puffing. Estimates of vent blocking incidence by lips during smoking range from 15 - 24 % (saliva-staining technique) to up to 50 % ('tar’ staining pattern technique) of smokers. For those smokers who do block the ventilation zone, a mean of 27 % of the vents are blocked, and a maximum of about 50 %. When the cigarettes are machine-smoked, the smoke yield increases in a highly non-linear manner as the blocked portion of the <b>filter</b> ventilation <b>zone</b> increases. This effect is also more pronounced at higher original filter ventilation levels. In contrast, smoking behavior monitoring techniques have shown that when the experimenter deliberately blocks the vent zone, the human smoker adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. The blocked filter affects the yields of smoke components to the smoker less than it does smoking-machine measured yields. It is concluded that the incidence of vent zone blocking by fingers is quite low and relatively insignificant. The most reliable estimate for lip blocking is that up to 25 % of smokers may cover the vent zone during at least one puff and for most smokers the coverage is partial. Ventilation zone blocking as it occurs in practice has only a relatively minor effect on human smoke yields compared to other smoker behavior factors. When a human smoker inadvertently partially or completely blocks the <b>filter</b> ventilation <b>zone</b> during smoking, he/she adjusts by taking smaller and fewer puffs. Because of these changes in puffing behavior during human smoking, predictions of the effects of filter vent blocking on smoke yields based solely on smoking machine yields are deceptive...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{factors of}} suffusion {{progression}} {{due to a}} series of one-dimensional laboratory seepage tests on cohesive soil were investigated. Suffusion is the transportation of finer fractions between larger fractions with seepage force. It has been studied for noncohesive soil because suffusion often takes place in <b>filter</b> <b>zones</b> at dam sites. However, other soil structures containing cohesive soil are also threatened by suffusion, particularly in grounds imposed by a high and concentrated seepage force. Following the seepage tests, a series of laboratory penetration tests was conducted to measure the strength of ground-induced suffusion. We proposed that the potential for the onset of suffusion was governed by the gradation curves of the materials and the pore size of the outlet due to the results of seepage tests and the synthesis of previous studies. Both suffusion and clogging take place at high hydraulic gradients. Suffusion is initiated over the critical pore velocity and depends on the material properties. Namely, if suffusion is allowed in the ground and the soil is allowed to outflow from the outlet, suffusion will be initiated. If either one of these is not allowed, clogging will occur and that will lead to a reduction in hydraulic conductivity. The penetration resistance decreased in proportion to the progression of suffusion {{despite the fact that the}} absolute amount of suffused soil was subtle. This implies risks of the promotion of vulnerability in practical grounds by continuous and invisible suffusion. In addition, the turbidity of the discharged water proved that by measuring the preferential migration of finer fractions through the soil specimen, it may be possible to monitor the onset of suffusion...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Our study aims to {{identify}} anatomical characteristics of glaucoma filtering blebs {{by means of}} slit lamp-adapted optical coherence tomography (SL-OCT) and {{to identify}} new parameters for the functional prognosis of the filter in the early post-operative period. METHODS: Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, aged 18 years and older, scheduled for primary trabeculectomy at the Department of Ophthalmology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, were considered for our study. All patients underwent standardized trabeculectomy with intra-operative application of mitomycin C. The filtering blebs were evaluated clinically and with SL-OCT on day 1 and 1, 2, 4 and 12 weeks following surgery. The resulting data were analysed and weighed against surgical success. To better understand the SL-OCT data a small comparative histologic study was performed. RESULTS: The study included 20 eyes of 20 patients. After completion of our study, 15 eyes of 15 patients (mean age+/-SD 67 +/- 16 years) were eligible for data analysis and 5 eyes missed at least one follow-up visit. Filtering surgery was considered successful (intraocular pressure < or = 21 mmHg without antiglaucomatous medication) in 11 of 15 eyes. SL-OCT frequently demonstrated multiple hypo-reflective layers within Tenon's capsule ("striping" phenomenon) in the first post-operative week. Presumably, these layers corresponded with drainage channels in the histological specimen. These channels were present in functional filters {{but not in the}} failures. In addition, the visualisation of the sclera below the <b>filtering</b> <b>zone</b> was better defined in failures compared with successful filtering blebs ("shading" phenomenon). We observed no differences in the volume and clinical aspect of the blebs in the successful group compared with the unsuccessful group. CONCLUSIONS: Successful filtering blebs show characteristic optical properties on SL-OCT. These phenomena suggest a diffusely enhanced fluid content and the presence of intra-bleb drainage channels in functional filtering blebs...|$|R
40|$|The {{ongoing process}} of {{urbanisation}} in the Randstad area forces us {{take into consideration}} an integration of the Prins Clausplein with the liveable part of the city. However, as motorways cause both environmental and noise pollution, most motorways are nowadays isolated from urban areas through tunnels and sound barriers. Highway locations have a great potential. They are accessible, visible and there is lots of space available. Since the motorway is not seen as {{integral part of the}} overall urban fabric a sprawl of urbanisation is going on at these locations. This graduation project has the objective to research by means of design the possibilities to integrate the highway into the city fabric. Since this project is part of the Architectural engineering graduation laboratory the integration of Building technology and architecture is taken as point of departure {{in the structure of the}} research and design. The architectonic integration of the highway and the city and the engineering solutions for the neutralisation of nuisance caused by air pollution are integrated at all scale levels. A strategy is introduced to create buffer zones that innovatively neutralize pollution without obstructing the connection between the city and the highway. This research will focus on the neutralisation of air pollution caused by the highway in these buffer zones. The technical means of air filtering will be both researched and implemented in the design at all scale levels. The urban plan will be mainly designed to influence the airflow that direct the polluted air into <b>filtering</b> <b>zones.</b> For the <b>filtering</b> of air a vertical garden is designed as façade for the buildings facing the highway. Filtering air with vegetation is a very delicate matter. Not only should the airflows be optimized so the amount on air that contacts the leaf surface is maximized. Also the right mix of vegetation need to be planted to neutralize the different types of hazardous substances in the air. In this design project the combination of strategic urban planning and a innovative façade lead to an estimated improvement in air quality of 20 tot 30 percent. Above all the developed façade ads architectural quality to the harsh highway environment and could be applied both to new buildings as well as to existing structures. ArchitectureArchitectur...|$|R
