25|$|I think I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> things. Didn't {{know how}} to shoot music. Music had been {{important}} in my films, it was usually post production. This was tough stuff to shoot. I already had a great respect for people like Minnelli. I just couldn't seem {{to work it out}} without just putting up multiple cameras and shooting an awful lot of film... I later realized or talked to people about this and MGM in the old days everybody was on contract and they would rehearse for weeks. We don't get that. We would stage it and shoot it. We got the songs a lot of times just a few days before we shoot. We only get the final song. The structural advantage of the old studio system we didn't have. It made a very inefficient shoot. I don't think there was any other way to do it given the circumstances.|$|E

I have always liked it. It's like any soap - if you watch it, you get stuck in. I love working on it." [...] He has mentioned {{that he is the}} only cast member to have been a fan of the show since its 1999 conception, that both he and his youngest daughter Freya often watch it together [...] "as a bonding exercise", and going as far as to describe the role as [...] "a dream". Commenting on his decision only ever to reprise the role of Abra on short term contracts, Edmondson has stated that: [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> any longer. The regulars on the show work very, very hard. Basically I don't think I could do what they do and still be alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{failure of}} the film was {{due in part to}} Diamond never having acted professionally until this, his first attempt. [...] "I didn't think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> it," [...] he said later, seeing himself as [...] "a fish out of water." [...] For his role in the film, Diamond became the first-ever winner of a Worst Actor Razzie Award, even though he was {{nominated}} for a Golden Globe Award for the same role. Critic David Wild, nevertheless, noted that the film showed that Diamond was open about his religion: [...] "Who else but this Jewish Elvis could go multi-platinum with an album that featured a version of 'the Kol Nidre?'"

2500|$|Turner was big for his day ( [...] , [...] ); however, he {{was smart}} and very fast. Turner later boasted about his talent as a blocker: [...] "I {{was such a good}} blocker, that the men they put in front of me – and some were stars who were {{supposed}} to be making a lot of tackles – they would have their coaches saying, 'why ain't you making any tackles?' they'd say, 'that bum Turner is holding.' Well that wasn't true[...] [...] [...] <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> anybody that they'd put in front of me."

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed {{what it was like}} preparing for her character's rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be [...] "very work-intensive," [...] emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that [...] "these" [...] type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca's rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry's acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by [...] "the gravity" [...] of the storyline, she stated, [...] "Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn't know if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well." [...] She added, [...] "I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about." ...|$|E

6000|$|One moment I {{paused in}} eager consideration--the next, I descended to the library. A daily {{newspaper}} was kept there, filed for reference.

60|$|Two {{of these}} animals had fallen {{to me from the}} warriors whose metal I wore, and in a short time <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> them quite as well as the native warriors. The method was not at all complicated. If the thoats did not respond with {{sufficient}} celerity to the telepathic instructions of their riders they were dealt a terrific blow between the ears with the butt of a pistol, and if they showed fight this treatment was continued until the brutes either were subdued, or had unseated their riders.|$|E
60|$|Serpents were fearful {{things to}} me at that period; but {{whatsoever}} is terrible and dangerous, or so reported, has an irresistible attraction for the mind, whether of child or man; it was therefore {{always a pleasure to}} have seen a snake in the day's rambles, although the sight was a startling one. Also in the warm season it was a keen pleasure to find the cast slough of the feared and subtle creature. Here was something not the serpent, yet so much more than a mere picture of it; a dead and cast-off part of it, but in its completeness, from the segmented mask with the bright unseeing eyes, to the fine whip-like tail end, so like the serpent itself; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> it, handle the serpent as it were, yet be in no danger from venomous tooth or stinging tongue. True, it was colourless, but silvery bright, soft as satin to the touch, crinkling when handled with a sound that to the startled fancy recalled the dangerous living hiss from the dry rustling grass! I would clutch my prize with a fearful joy, as if I had picked up a strange feather dropped in passing from the wing of one of the fallen but still beautiful angels. And it always increased my satisfaction when, on exhibiting my treasure at home, the first sight of it caused a visible start or an exclamation of alarm.|$|E

5000|$|When the Soviets finally {{defeated}} the Germans in March, 1945, Nemethy suffered through similar close calls on his life. Because {{he was not}} a member of the trade union, he was arrested by the Russians but eventually escaped.

However, his artwork was rejected by the Communists as unacceptable and he was again forced into hiding. He considered leaving the country: [...] "I came to the decision to do something because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>handle</b> this situation any more. It was not safe on the street."

But I thought <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>handle</b> it, especially after doing 'The Gin Game' with Dick Van Dyke where I played {{a woman in her}} early 80s. I was just so challenged and fascinated by this script, which takes you through some emotional things and some funny things.

After skipping two matches he played against Chivas USA at the Home Depot Center on May 16, 2009. Six minutes into that match he aggravated his hamstring. It was okay throughout the week.

He said that the Sea Witch did not have the advantage of modern technology or weather forecasts from outside sources.
