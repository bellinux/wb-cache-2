Egyptian five-year credit default swaps fell by 0.25%. Al Arabiya reported that the military council said it would sack the cabinet and dissolve parliament, although they only did the latter. Celebrations and car honking were reported in Alexandria and Cairo. Celebratory gunfire in Gaza.|$|E
25|$|ETC {{can also}} refer to <b>exchange-traded</b> notes, {{which are not}} <b>exchange-traded</b> funds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exchange-traded</b> {{commodity}} is a {{term used}} for commodity <b>exchange-traded</b> funds (which are funds) or commodity <b>exchange-traded</b> notes (which are notes). These track the performance of an underlying commodity index including total return indices based on a single commodity. They are similar to ETFs and traded and settled exactly like stock funds. ETCs have market maker support with guaranteed liquidity, enabling investors to easily invest in commodities.|$|E
25|$|Futures are <b>exchange-traded,</b> while {{forwards}} are traded over-the-counter.|$|E
25|$|TASE plays a {{major role}} in the Israeli economy. TASE lists some 544 companies, 56 of which are also listed on stock exchanges in other countries. TASE also lists some 180 <b>exchange-traded</b> funds (ETFs), 60 {{government}} bonds, 500 corporate bonds, 591 <b>exchange-traded</b> notes (ETNs) and more than 1000 mutual funds.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to {{investing in a}} mutual fund indexed to the S 500, investors may also purchase shares of an <b>exchange-traded</b> fund (ETF) which represents ownership in a portfolio of the equity securities that comprise the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. These <b>exchange-traded</b> funds track the S 500 index and {{may be used to}} trade the index.|$|E
25|$|Futures {{are highly}} standardized, being <b>exchange-traded,</b> whereas {{forwards}} can be unique, being over-the-counter.|$|E
25|$|Turnover of <b>{{exchange}}-traded</b> {{foreign exchange}} futures and options has grown rapidly in recent years, reaching $166 billion in April 2010 (double the turnover recorded in April 2007). As of April 2016, <b>exchange-traded</b> currency derivatives represent 2% of OTC foreign exchange turnover. Foreign exchange futures contracts {{were introduced in}} 1972 at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and are traded more than to most other futures contracts.|$|E
25|$|Commodity ETFs (CETFs or ETCs) {{invest in}} commodities, such as {{precious}} metals, agricultural products, or hydrocarbons. Among the first commodity ETFs were gold <b>exchange-traded</b> funds, {{which have been}} offered {{in a number of}} countries. The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India when they filed a proposal with the SEBI in May 2002. The first gold <b>exchange-traded</b> fund was Gold Bullion Securities launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first silver <b>exchange-traded</b> fund was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely SPDR Gold Shares, was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.|$|E
25|$|In May 2008 Northern Trust {{started the}} first US <b>exchange-traded</b> fund on the NYSE based on TASE's benchmark, the TA-25 Index.|$|E
25|$|Gold <b>Exchange-traded</b> {{products}} (ETPs) {{represent an}} easy way to gain exposure to the gold price, without the inconvenience of storing physical bars. However <b>exchange-traded</b> gold instruments, even those that hold physical gold {{for the benefit of the}} investor, carry risks beyond those inherent in the precious metal itself. For example, the most popular gold ETP (GLD) has been widely criticized, and even compared with mortgage-backed securities, due to features of its complex structure.|$|E
25|$|If a {{position}} involves an <b>exchange-traded</b> product, the amount or percentage of initial margin is {{set by the}} exchange concerned.|$|E
25|$|As of 2009, {{there were}} {{approximately}} 1,500 <b>exchange-traded</b> funds traded on US exchanges. This count uses the wider definition of ETF, including HOLDRs and closed-end funds.|$|E
25|$|A hedge can be {{constructed}} from many types of financial instruments, including stocks, <b>exchange-traded</b> funds, insurance, forward contracts, swaps, options, gambles, many types of over-the-counter and derivative products, and futures contracts.|$|E
25|$|Products and {{services}} available for trading on ASX include shares, futures, exchange traded options, warrants, contracts for difference, <b>exchange-traded</b> funds, {{real estate investment}} trusts, listed investment companies and interest rate securities.|$|E
25|$|With an <b>exchange-traded</b> future, the {{clearing}} house interposes itself on every trade. Thus {{there is no}} risk of counterparty default. The only risk is that {{the clearing}} house defaults (e.g. become bankrupt), which is considered very unlikely.|$|E
25|$|Gold was {{the first}} {{commodity}} to be securitised through an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the early 1990s, {{but it was not}} available for trade until 2003. The idea of a Gold ETF was first officially conceptualised by Benchmark Asset Management Company Private Ltd in India, when they filed a proposal with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in May 2002. The first gold <b>exchange-traded</b> fund was Gold Bullion Securities launched on the ASX in 2003, and the first silver <b>exchange-traded</b> fund was iShares Silver Trust launched on the NYSE in 2006. As of November 2010 a commodity ETF, namely SPDR Gold Shares, was the second-largest ETF by market capitalization.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, trading {{averaged}} $500 {{million a}} day, a 55% {{increase over the}} previous year. The number of <b>exchange-traded</b> funds (ETFs) grew to 240. The Tel Bond-20 index was also launched that year. The TA-25 rose 175% in the period 2004–07.|$|E
25|$|Its {{main index}} is the NASDAQ Composite, {{which has been}} {{published}} since its inception. However, its <b>exchange-traded</b> fund tracks the large-cap NASDAQ-100 index, which was introduced in 1985 alongside the NASDAQ 100 Financial Index which tracks the largest 100 companies in terms of market capitalization.|$|E
25|$|ETCs in China and India {{gained in}} {{importance}} due to those countries' emergence as commodities consumers and producers. China {{accounted for more}} than 60% of <b>exchange-traded</b> commodities in 2009, up from 40% the previous year. The global volume of ETCs increased by a 20% in 2010, and 50% since 2008, to around 2.5 billion million contracts.|$|E
25|$|A {{financial}} derivative is {{a financial}} instrument whose value {{is derived from}} a commodity termed an underlier. Derivatives are either <b>exchange-traded</b> or over-the-counter (OTC). An increasing number of derivatives are traded via clearing houses some with Central Counterparty Clearing, which provide clearing and settlement services on a futures exchange, as well as off-exchange in the OTC market.|$|E
25|$|Derivatives {{evolved from}} simple {{commodity}} future contracts into {{a diverse group}} of financial instruments that apply to every kind of asset, including mortgages, insurance and many more. Futures contracts, Swaps (1970s-), <b>Exchange-traded</b> Commodities (ETC) (2003-), forward contracts, etc. are examples. They can be traded through formal exchanges or through Over-the-counter (OTC). Commodity market derivatives unlike credit default derivatives for example, are secured by the physical assets or commodities.|$|E
25|$|An <b>exchange-traded</b> grantor trust {{was used}} to give a direct {{interest}} in a static basket of stocks selected from a particular industry. Such products have some properties in common with ETFs—low costs, low turnover, and tax efficiency:but are generally regarded as separate from ETFs. The leading example was Holding Company Depositary Receipts, or HOLDRs, a proprietary Merrill Lynch product, but these have now disappeared from the scene. SPDR Gold Shares is a grantor trust.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the huge}} {{quantity}} of gold stored above ground {{compared to the}} annual production, {{the price of gold}} is mainly affected by changes in sentiment, which affects market supply and demand equally, rather than on changes in annual production. According to the World Gold Council, annual mine production of gold {{over the last few years}} has been close to 2,500 tonnes. About 2,000 tonnes goes into jewelry or industrial/dental production, and around 500 tonnes goes to retail investors and <b>exchange-traded</b> gold funds.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exchange-traded</b> {{funds that}} invest in bonds are known as bond ETFs. They thrive during {{economic}} recessions because investors pull their {{money out of the}} stock market and into bonds (for example, government treasury bonds or those issued by companies regarded as financially stable). Because of this cause and effect relationship, the performance of bond ETFs may be indicative of broader economic conditions. There are several advantages to bond ETFs such as the reasonable trading commissions, but this benefit can be negatively offset by fees if bought and sold through a third party.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} gold bullion fell {{dramatically}} on 12 April 2013 and analysts frantically sought explanations. Rumors spread that the European Central Bank (ECB) would force Cyprus to sell its gold reserves in response to its financial crisis. Major banks such as Goldman Sachs began immediately to short gold bullion. Investors scrambled to liquidate their <b>exchange-traded</b> funds (ETFs) and margin call selling accelerated. George Gero, precious metals commodities expert at the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) Wealth Management section {{reported that he had}} not seen selling of gold bullion as panicked as this in his forty years in commodity markets.|$|E
25|$|Many {{index funds}} and <b>exchange-traded</b> funds attempt to {{replicate}} (before fees and expenses) {{the performance of}} the S500 by holding the same stocks as the index, in the same proportions. Many other mutual funds are benchmarked to the S500. Consequently, a company whose stock is added to the list of S500 stocks may see its stock price rise, as index funds must purchase that company's stock in order to continue tracking the S 500 index. Mutual fund managers provide index funds that track the S500, the first of which was The Vanguard Group's Vanguard500 in 1976.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is {{bought and}} sold as green coffee beans by roasters, investors, and price speculators as a {{tradable}} commodity in commodity markets and <b>exchange-traded</b> funds. Coffee futures contracts for Grade 3 washed arabicas are traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange under ticker symbol KC, with contract deliveries occurring every year in March, May, July, September, and December. Coffee {{is an example of}} a product that has been susceptible to significant commodity futures price variations. Higher and lower grade arabica coffees are sold through other channels. Futures contracts for robusta coffee are traded on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange and, since 2007, on the New York Intercontinental Exchange.|$|E
25|$|Trading on {{commodities}} {{began in}} Japan in the 18th century with the trading {{of rice and}} silk, and similarly in Holland with tulip bulbs. Trading in the US began in the mid 19th century, when central grain markets were established and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring their commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (also called spot or cash market) or for forward delivery. These forward contracts were private contracts between buyers and sellers and became the forerunner to today's <b>exchange-traded</b> futures contracts. Although contract trading began with traditional commodities such as grains, meat and livestock, exchange trading has expanded to include metals, energy, currency and currency indexes, equities and equity indexes, government interest rates and private interest rates.|$|E
25|$|Hedge {{funds are}} {{structured}} to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) {{and are not}} required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or <b>exchange-traded</b> fund, which will typically have to meet regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.|$|E
25|$|Leveraged <b>exchange-traded</b> funds (LETFs or {{leveraged}} ETFs) are {{a type of}} ETF {{that attempt}} to achieve returns that are more sensitive to market movements than non-leveraged ETFs. Leveraged index ETFs are often marketed as bull or bear funds. A leveraged bull ETF fund might for example attempt to achieve daily returns that are 2x or 3x more pronounced than the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S 500. A leveraged inverse (bear) ETF fund {{on the other hand}} may attempt to achieve returns that are -2x or -3x the daily index return, meaning that it will gain double or triple the loss of the market. Leveraged ETFs require the use of financial engineering techniques, including the use of equity swaps, derivatives and rebalancing, and re-indexing to achieve the desired return. The most common way to construct leveraged ETFs is by trading futures contracts.|$|E
25|$|Chief {{economist}} for Japan at Credit Suisse, Hiromichi Shirakawa, {{said in a}} note to clients that the estimated economic loss may be around $171 billion–$183billion just to the region hit by the quake and tsunami. On 14 March, the Bank of Japan, {{in an attempt to}} maintain market stability, injected 15trillion yen into the money markets to assure financial stability amid a plunge in stocks and surge in credit risk. After it set up an emergency task force to ensure liquidity {{in the aftermath of the}} disaster, governor Masaaki Shirakawa and the bank's board also enlarged a programme to buy government bonds to <b>exchange-traded</b> funds to the tune of 10trillion yen. The BOJ chief told reporters cash injections will continue as needed. However, following the further nuclear leaks, its actions were read by the market as insufficient despite 8trillion yen being pumped into the market. On 15 March, the Topix index fell again marking a two-day plunge not seen since 1987 as Japan's default risk surged after Prime Minister Naoto Kan warned of further leaks from the damaged nuclear power plant. Commodities were also significantly lower. Residents of Tokyo were reported to have gone on panic shopping sprees as daily necessities were sought after and gasoline was stocked up with the increasing risk of radioactivity releases.|$|E
2500|$|Gold <b>exchange-traded</b> {{products}} {{may include}} <b>exchange-traded</b> funds (ETFs), <b>exchange-traded</b> notes (ETNs), and closed-end funds (CEFs), which are traded like shares {{on the major}} stock exchanges. The first gold ETF, Gold Bullion Securities (ticker symbol [...] "GOLD"), was launched in March 2003 on the Australian Stock Exchange, and originally represented exactly [...] of gold. As of November 2010, SPDR Gold Shares is the second-largest <b>exchange-traded</b> fund {{in the world by}} market capitalization.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Exchange-traded</b> options (also called [...] "listed options") are a {{class of}} <b>exchange-traded</b> derivatives. Exchange traded options have {{standardized}} contracts, and in the United States are settled through a clearing house with fulfillment guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). Since the contracts are standardized, accurate pricing models are often available. To understand which option is being traded a standardised option naming convention has been developed by the exchanges, that shows the expiry month and strike price using special letter codes.
