50|$|Since the {{velocity}} of each vehicle wheel is known and a timestamp is recorded for each axle crossing each beam, the interwheel (or <b>interaxle)</b> spacings can be determined. Once the <b>interaxle</b> spacings are known, it is compared to a table of <b>interaxle</b> spacing ranges stored in the unit to determine the correct classification of the vehicle. The results are stored on a per vehicle basis.|$|E

50|$|The V8 {{overhead}} valve hemi engine weighed only 180 kg, allowing {{the car to}} have 47/53 front/rear <b>interaxle</b> weight distribution when fully loaded. The engine was already used in the late Tatra 87 and its extreme reliability was confirmed by previous use in the Tatra 607 race car or military light truck T805. The air-cooling system was designed to cool the most heated parts of the engine more effectively.|$|E

Various information management systems at sorting yards require the operational information about the object while performing the manufacturing operations. The improvement of the determination accuracy of different parameters characterizing the rolling stock, leads to the immediate quality progress in the traffic volumes management. The aim of the paper is to develop a method to estimate the errors of determination the <b>interaxle</b> distance of the flexible units in the control section using the point path-control transducer for future {{identification of}} cars and locomotives. Methodology. To achieve this goal the simulation method and experiment planning were used. The simulation model allowing determining the time intervals between the collisions of wheelset of movable units in point path-control transducer on the control section with variable characteristics of identification devices was developed. The values of the time intervals obtained with using the simulation mode were applied in the method of experiment planning to the final target. Findings. The calculated analytical values of the errors of the <b>interaxle</b> distances do not have the significant differences from values obtained using the simulation model. It makes possible to use the received functional dependence to estimate the possible errors in the identification of rolling stock. The results of this work can be used to identify separate flexible units, and trains in general. Originality. The functional dependence of the error of the <b>interaxle</b> distance error from the fixing point of the wheel path-control transducer, the distance between the sensors and the measured distance was derived using a previously conducted research of the factors influencing the error in determining the <b>interaxle</b> distance of the movable units, and developed simulation model to calculate the <b>interaxle</b> distance. Practical value. This functional dependence allows solving the following tasks: to calculate the maximum possible error of determining the <b>interaxle</b> distance of the movable units at known parameters of control section and calculation of parameters of the control section, when the possible acceptable error of determining the <b>interaxle</b> distance of the flexible units is known. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a hierarchical control strategy for cooperative braking system {{of an electric}} vehicle with separated driven axles. Two layers are defined: the top layer is used to optimize the braking stability based on two sliding mode control strategies, namely, the <b>interaxle</b> control mode and signal-axle control strategies; the <b>interaxle</b> control strategy generates the ideal braking force distribution in general braking condition, and the single-axle control strategy can ensure braking safety in emergency braking condition; the bottom layer is used to maximize the regenerative braking energy recovery efficiency with a reallocated braking torque strategy; the reallocated braking torque strategy can recovery braking energy {{as much as possible}} in the premise of meeting battery charging power. The simulation results show that the proposed hierarchical control strategy is reasonable and can adapt to different typical road surfaces and load cases; the vehicle braking stability and safety can be guaranteed; furthermore, the regenerative braking energy recovery efficiency can be improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{takes the}} {{electric}} off-road vehicle with separated driven axles as the research object. To solve the longitudinal dynamics driving control problems, vehicle dynamics model, and control strategies were studied {{and the corresponding}} simulation was carried out. An 8 -DOF vehicle dynamics model with separated driven axles was built. The driving control strategies on the typical roads were put forward. The recognition algorithm of the typical road surfaces based on the wheels’ slip rates was proposed. And the two control systems were designed including the pedal opening degree adjustment control system based on PI algorithm and the <b>interaxle</b> torque distribution control system based on sliding mode control algorithm. The driving control flow of the proposed vehicle combining the pedal adjustment control system with the <b>interaxle</b> torque distribution control system was developed. And the driven control strategies for the typical roads were simulated. Simulation {{results show that the}} proposed drive control strategies can adapt to different typical road surfaces, limit the slip rates of the driving wheels within the stable zone, and ensure the vehicle driving safely and stably in accordance with the driver's intention...|$|E
