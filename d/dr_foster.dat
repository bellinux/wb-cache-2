25|$|The {{strategy}} of Bonin's defense attorneys, William Charvet and Tracy Stewart, was {{to challenge the}} credibility of numerous prosecution witnesses, and to suggest that extremely significant mitigating factors as to {{the root causes of}} Bonin's behavior lay in the extensive physical, sexual, and emotional abuse he had endured throughout his childhood and adolescence. To support this contention, Bonin's defense attorneys summoned an expert on the developmental effects of violence and abuse on children named Dr. David Foster, to testify as to the conclusions of his psychological examinations upon Bonin. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Foster</b> opined that Bonin had, as a result of repeated abandonment, not received the nurturing, protection, and behavioral feedback as a child necessary for sufficient psychological development. This had been so consistent and prevalent, Foster stated, that Bonin held a confusion as to the differences between violence and love. In a direct rebuttal, the prosecution summoned a forensic psychiatrist and expert in both impulse disorders and sexual sadism named Dr. Park Dietz, who testified that the overall pattern of Bonin's behavior was inconsistent with an inability to control his impulses. Dr. Dietz further testified as to Bonin's actions being reflective of planning as opposed to impulsive behavior. In summary, Dr. Dietz concluded that Bonin was a sexual sadist, and that although Bonin suffered from an antisocial personality disorder, neither of these conditions had impaired his ability to control his actions.|$|E
25|$|Freddie worries over Effy's {{psychological}} {{state in}} his centric episode, {{as she is}} developing a psychotic depression that resembles what his mother had before she committed suicide. He is able to save Effy after an attempt on her life; she is hospitalised and he is left desolate. JJ's episode sees him {{fall in love with}} a single mother called Lara (Georgia Henshaw), through whom he finds a new-found confidence and begins to doubt whether he really needed to be so highly medicated his whole life. In the penultimate episode, Effy's psychiatric counsellor Dr John Foster (Hugo Speer) uses unorthodox hypnotic methods to cure Effy's depression, making her forget and want to abandon her old friends. After an incident at the spot of Tony's accident where she nearly commits suicide again, her psychosis comes back and Freddie insists <b>Dr</b> <b>Foster</b> cease treating Effy. Later, Foster lures Freddie to discuss Effy, and brutally murders Freddie with a baseball bat. In the finale episode, everyone deals with Freddie's absence, thinking that he has left of his own volition. Naomi and Emily finally repair their damaged relationship, scorched by cheating, and Naomi confesses she loved Emily since they first met; Thomas and Pandora are thrown back together by chance when they both get into Harvard College; a mostly-recovered Effy holds Freddie's birthday party in his shed, knowing that he loved her and pining for his return. Cook, who is on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, uncovers Dr Foster's killing and after confronting him, furiously lunges at Foster. The series ends here in freeze-frame leaving both Cook's and John Foster's fates unknown.|$|E

The program focused on providing veterinary {{advice on how}} to better care for one's pets.

Animal Planet marketed Faithful Friends as [...] "the definitive source for your pet's wellness and a home for professional veterinarian advice."

500|$|Ned {{grew up in}} New York and {{was the son of}} [...] "freaky beatniks" [...] who did not {{discipline}} Ned (as {{they did}} not think it was right) and let him run wild. Eventually they took him to <b>Dr.</b> <b>Foster,</b> a psychiatrist, who put the young Ned through the University of Minnesota Spankalogical Protocol, which involved eight months of continuous spanking. The treatment worked so well that it rendered Flanders unable to express any anger at all and resulted in his trademark nonsensical jabbering at moments when he was particularly close to losing his temper, causing Ned to unknowingly repress his anger.|$|E

Ned is visited by his childhood psychiatrist, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Foster,</b> who tells Ned about his childhood as an out-of-control brat raised by beatnik parents. Ned's treatment involved eight months of continuous spanking. The treatment worked so well that it rendered him unable to express any anger, and Ned's repressed anger built up inside him until he erupted.|$|E

6000|$|... "That's creepy," [...] says <b>Dr.</b> <b>Foster.</b> [...] "But I {{think one}} of my {{experiences}} would run it close. Shortly after I put up my plate I had a visit from a little hunch-backed woman who wished me to come and attend to her sister in her trouble. When I reached the house, which was a very poor one, I found two other little hunched-backed women, exactly like the first, waiting {{for me in the}} sitting-room. Not one of them said a word, but my companion took the lamp and walked upstairs with her two sisters behind her, and me bringing up the rear. I can see those three queer shadows cast by the lamp upon the wall as clearly as I can see that tobacco pouch. In the room above was the fourth sister, a remarkably beautiful girl in evident need of my assistance. There was no wedding ring upon her finger. The three deformed sisters seated themselves round the room, like so many graven images, and all night not one of them opened her mouth. I'm not romancing, Hargrave; this is absolute fact. In the early morning a fearful thunderstorm broke out, one of the most violent I have ever known. The little garret burned blue with the lightning, and thunder roared and rattled as if it were on the very roof of the house. It wasn't much of a lamp I had, and it was a queer thing when a spurt of lightning came to see those three twisted figures sitting round the walls, or to have the voice of my patient drowned by the booming of the thunder. By Jove! I don't mind telling you that {{there was a time when}} I nearly bolted from the room. All came right in the end, but I never heard the true story of the unfortunate beauty and her three crippled sisters." ...|$|E
