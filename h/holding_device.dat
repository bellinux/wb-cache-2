40|$|Abstract:- Zero-order <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> (ZOH) {{are mainly}} used in digital control {{applications}} {{to obtain the}} output analog signals of digitally implemented controllers. However, it is proved that special <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> such as the fractional order <b>hold</b> <b>device</b> (FROH) can improve, if properly tuned, the performance of hybrid control systems. Although the applicability of these devices has been theoretically studied in numerous works, there is no report of real experimentation with digital controllers that include special <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> for the control signal interpolation. This lack of real application experiments is mainly due to the difficulties encountered in implementing such <b>hold</b> <b>devices</b> with the processing speed and configurability that real-time digital controllers require. This paper describes a totally configurable digital design of a FROH device, adequate for any digital control system platform. The implementation of an 8 -bit resolution FROH prototype {{has been carried out}} and its performance tested on a field programmable gate array (FPGA) ...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{synthesis}} of controllers for time varying systems {{in order to satisfy}} an induced 2 -norm closed loop performance bound. This performance criterion is a generalisation of the well known H 1 norm criterion used in the frequency domain for analysis and synthesis of linear time invariant control systems. A number of different time varying system frameworks are considered, for which there are no frequency domain counterparts. One such class is that of aperiodic sampleddata systems, that is continuous time systems connected to a discrete controller via sampling and <b>hold</b> <b>devices.</b> Multiple generalized sampling and <b>hold</b> <b>devices,</b> which may be aperiodic and asynchronous, are permitted within the framework considered in this thesis.

50|$|The {{calibration}} process entails harvesting consistent crop at {{a constant}} speed to produce a consistent grain mass flow rate to the mass flow sensor.

50|$|Complex forms {{made on a}} {{wood lathe}} develop from {{surprisingly}} few types of cuts: parting, planing, bead, cove, and hollowing. Parting separates the wood from the <b>holding</b> <b>device,</b> or establishes depth cuts. Planing is done with a tool in which the bevel below the cutting edge supports wood fibers, just as in a typical wood planer. Beads are a convex shape relative to the cylinder, and coves are a concave shape. Hollowing techniques are a combination of drilling and scooping out materials. The woodturner is at liberty to choose {{from a variety of}} tools for all of these techniques, {{and the quality of the}} cuts improves with practice wielding the tool selected. Turners rely upon three points of contact making any type of cut: the tool presses down on the tool rest, and against the woodturner's body before contacting the surface of the wood, most often with a bevel edge riding the surface of the wood. The objective is to position the tool correctly so that the wood comes around to the cutting edge, generating a thin shaving without chipping or tearing out sections of the wood. Woodturners prefer to use very clean cuts to minimize the time spent with abrasives. When it is necessary to sand the piece, they do so on the lathe, using abrasives held by hand, in an inertial sander which revolves with the wood's own rotation, or with power tools—drills or right-angle drills. The lathe also becomes a useful <b>holding</b> <b>device</b> for carving, burning, texturing, coloring, and finishing the form.|$|E
