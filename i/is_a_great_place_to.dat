Thermodynamic stasis and extended hardware life are far easier to obtain without these punishing conditions seen in LEO. L2 is not just a great gateway—it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> store propellants. ...L2 is an ideal location to store propellants and cargos: it is close, high energy, and cold.

2500|$|In each episode, Penn and Teller debunk {{a chosen}} {{misconception}} such as cryptozoology, debate a controversial topic like gun control, or [...] "expose the truths" [...] {{of an organization}} like PETA. Sometimes their objective is not to completely dismiss the topic at hand but to decry {{certain aspects of the}} topic that they believe to be pernicious, misleading, unnecessary, or overemphasized. For example, in the case of college they argue that while college <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> learn, drink beer or train for a career, the concept of diversity is bullshit when used as an excuse to restrict free speech or selectively recruit to fill quotas. Or that [...] "the casual asshole, or just plain dickhead, might do well in an anger management program" [...] but teaching people they can relieve anger through attacking or screaming at inanimate objects is bullshit, since this [...] "venting" [...] (as it's called in the industry) by an angry person in a social situation will lead to violence.|$|E

Moved by a desire to use the country's own national flag and anthem this has included ridiculing the term [...] "Chinese Taipei" [...] not only in the national and international press but by Taiwanese legislators; New Power Party (NPP) Executive Chairman Huang Kuo-chang in particular lambasted the English-language guide to the Universiade for its [...] "absurd" [...] use {{of the label}}, illustrating this with statements extracted from the guide rendered nonsensical by their author's insistence on completely avoiding the name [...] "Taiwan" [...] not only when referring to the label under which Taiwanese athletes compete, but even when referring to geographical features such as the island of Taiwan itself. These statements included [...] "Introduction of our Island: [...] Chinese Taipei is long and narrow that lies north to south ," [...] and [...] "Chinese Taipei is a special island and its Capital Taipei <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> experience Taipei's culture."
