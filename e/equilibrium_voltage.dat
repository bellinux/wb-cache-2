30|$|Voltage {{collapse}} usually {{occurs in}} heavy load power systems. A heavy load power system {{subject to a}} failure or disturbance undergoes voltage collapse if post-disturbance <b>equilibrium</b> <b>voltages</b> are below acceptable limits. The voltage collapse is generally initiated by either load variations or contingencies and is characterized by high reactive power demand and high reactive power loss in transmission network and shortage of fast-acting reactive reserves [1]. The fast reactive sources are generators, synchronous condensers, and power electronics-based flexible dynamic voltage restorer. Adequate reactive power reserve is expected to maintain system integrity during post contingency operation when considering random failures. As a well-established ancillary service, the reactive power support and the voltage control {{play a vital role}} in power system operation. The impact of reactive power on system stability and security has been well investigated [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. During a contingency, the real power component of line loading does not change significantly, whereas the reactive power flow can change dramatically [2]. The reason is that the bus voltage drop due to a component failure reduces the reactive power generation from the charging of line and shunt capacitors. Therefore, sufficient reactive reserve should be available to meet the reactive power requirement following a contingency. Reactive power which can be delivered in a power system depends on its network configuration, operating condition, and locations of reactive power sources. References [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] show that the reactive power was the key to solve voltage problems in system operation and should be considered in reliability evaluation.|$|R
