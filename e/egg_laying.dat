5|$|Mallards are opportunistically {{targeted}} by brood parasites, occasionally having eggs laid in their nests by redheads, ruddy ducks, lesser scaup, gadwalls, northern shovellers, northern pintails, cinnamon teal, common goldeneyes, and other mallards. These eggs are generally accepted when they resemble the eggs {{of the host}} mallard, but the hen may attempt to eject them or even abandon the nest if parasitism occurs during <b>egg</b> <b>laying.</b>|$|E

50|$|Like most lizards, goannas <b>lay</b> <b>eggs.</b> Most <b>lay</b> <b>eggs</b> in a nest or burrow, {{but some}} species <b>lay</b> their <b>eggs</b> inside termite mounds. This offers {{protection}} and incubation; additionally, the termites {{may provide a}} meal for the young as they hatch.

5|$|In most {{of their}} range, <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> begins in late February. In colder climates, it is later, e.g. April in Greenland and Tibet. In Pakistan, {{egg-laying}} takes place in December. Eggs and hatchlings are preyed on, rarely, by large hawks and eagles, large owls, martens and canids. The adults, which are very rarely predated, are often successful in defending their young from these predators, due to their numbers, large size and cunning. They have been observed dropping stones on potential predators that venture close to their nests.|$|E
5|$|Temnothorax unifasciatus, a myrmicinid ant, {{has been}} shown not to have {{collective}} worker policing. However, when a queen is removed, a rank order for reproduction appears, where top ranking reproductives display aggression towards lower-order female workers. Thus, reductions in <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> are created by dominance hierarchies. Individuals do not act in benefit of the colony, instead opting to increase their own fitness by laying their eggs and reducing the contributions of opponents.|$|E
5|$|When {{copulation}} takes place, {{the male}} butterfly or moth places a capsule of sperm (spermatophore) in a receptacle {{of the female}} (called the corpus bursae). The sperm, when released from the capsule, swims directly into or via a small tube into a special seminal receptacle (spermatheca), where the sperm is stored until it is released into the vagina for fertilisation during <b>egg</b> <b>laying,</b> which may occur hours, days, or months after mating. The eggs pass through the ovipore. The ovipore {{may be at the}} end of a modified ovipositor or surrounded by a pair of broad setose anal papillae.|$|E

5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a varied}} {{group of animals}} from taxonomic, {{morphological}} and ecological standpoints. Birds, at over 10,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides perciform fish. Using fossil evidence, paleontologists have identified over 500 distinct genera and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both extant species (birds) and fossil remains. Through {{the first half of}} the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and cold-blooded. Most research conducted since the 1970s, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated metabolisms and numerous adaptations for social interaction. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Evidence suggests that <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> and nest building are additional traits shared by all dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>laying</b> {{dates and}} clutch size vary by region; in Texas {{the time period}} is from late February to late August, in Iowa it ranges from late April to June. The clutch size is {{generally}} 3 to 6 eggs, but can reach as high as seven in Texas. The eggs are creamy white with brown or reddish-brown spots, and are more heavily marked at the broad end. The eggs are incubated by the female for 12–16 days. After the young hatch, they are fed exclusively on invertebrates and they fledge in 12–14 days. As many as three broods may be raised by a pair in a single breeding season. In one study, three of the 70 fledglings remained or defended territory adjacent to the natal area.|$|E
5|$|Extra-pair {{copulation}} with neighbouring birds {{has been}} recorded and may be a reason for adult males {{to stay close to}} the female before and during the <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> period. Females may sometimes associate with two males and all three help in raising the brood. The typical clutch consists of two eggs which are incubated in turns by both parents. The eggs are brick red with the broad end covered more densely with blotches of red, brown, and black. The parents begin incubating soon after the first egg is laid leading to asynchronous hatching. The first egg hatches after about 42 days. The second chick may hatch three to five days later and a longer delay increases the likelihood that it will die of starvation. In cliffs where the nests are located close to each other, young birds have been known to clamber over to neighbouring nests to obtain food. In the Spanish population, young fledge and leave the nest after 90 to 110 days. Fledged birds continue to remain dependent on their parents for at least a month.|$|E
40|$|The study {{carried out}} an {{empirical}} analysis of egg production functions, a case Study of Ikot Ekpene and Uyo Metropolis of Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. Specifically, {{this study was}} carried out to estimate the egg production functions {{in the study area}}, determine the resource use efficiency of egg producers in the study area and to make recommendations based on the findings. Data for this study were obtained from primary source collected from thirty – seven (37) purposively selected poultry farmers using personal observations and interview method while the secondary data were obtained from farm records kept by the farmers. Regression analysis was carried out to show the relationship between <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> and several input explanatory variables namely; feed intake, mortality rate, culling rate, labour and floor space. Resource use efficiency analysis was used to determine the rationality of the firms in their use of resources. The result showed that the effect of feed intake and labour on <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> was significant at 0. 01 % level, Floor space was also significant at 0. 01. Further analysis showed that sum of elasticities for feed, labour and floor (EP) is 1. 59 indicating an increasing return to scale scenario, implying that a 1 % increase in the variables; feed, labour, and floor space will lead to a 1. 59 % increase in <b>egg</b> <b>lay.</b> Of all the four egg production function estimated in this study, {{it became clear that the}} exponential function was found to be the lead equation since four out of the five variables employed in this study were significant where as other forms had less numbers of significant variables. The analysis with respect to resource use showed that feed, labour and floor space were over utilized during the period of <b>egg</b> <b>lay...</b>|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to analyse some {{reproduction}} parameters with relation {{to the shape of}} the growth curve. Two genetically different methods of breeding were applied - hybridisation and selection, which lead to the division of the thesis into two parts. The results of both analyses confirm significant relationship between growth and reproduction traits of organism. 1. Diallel analysis based this conclusion on the results of confrontation of heterosis for growth parameters (partial weights and parameters of growth curve) and <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> level. Genetical analysis of partial weights showed that better growth of hybrids compare to their parents (positive heterosis) in acceleration phase is accompanied by positive heterosis also for egg production. And on the contrary, lower growth rate in acceleration phase (negative heterosis) is followed by lower egg production of hybrids in comparison to their parents (negative heterosis). Genetical analysis of growth curve parameters confirmed that positive/negative heterosis in acceleration phase modifies shape of growth curve of hybrids; it moves inflection point to earlier/later age. This drift is directly connected with the onset of <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> in individual genotypes. 2. Long-term divergent selection aimed at the shape of growth curve using relative weight gain during the liner phase of growth curve as a selection criterion caused the shift of the inflection point (t+) which was accompanied by the shift of body weight (y+) in the same direction. It was found that both lines are the same maturity rate (Ut) at the onset of <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> which means that they have the same proportion of body weight from the final mature weight; so they do not start their <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> at the same age or live weight. Lines with longer acceleration phase (higher both t+ and y+) start <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> period later and produce more defect eggs than lines with lower t+ and y+ values. Different weight of sex glands (testicles, ovaries) and a number of growing follicles confirmed the differences in onset of reproduction between lines. Carcass analyses performed during maturing and early stage of production confirmed that proportion of abdominal fat is important factor for sexual function in period when organism is still growing. The active reproduction function results in lower growth rate in final period of growth.

5|$|The Delichon species {{typically}} feed {{higher in}} the air, and take smaller prey than other swallows. It is believed that this reduces inter-specific food competition, particularly with the barn swallow which shares much of the breeding and wintering range of the martins. The insects eaten are mostly small flies, aphids and Hymenoptera such as winged ants. A wide range of other insects are caught, including Lepidoptera, beetles and lacewings. The Asian house martin appears to occasionally take terrestrial springtails and larvae and the common house martin also sometimes feeds on the ground. These martins are gregarious, feeding in flocks often with other aerial predators like swifts, or other hirundines such as the barn or striated swallows. In the case of at least the common house martin, the start of <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> appears {{to be linked to}} the appearance of large numbers of flying aphids, which provide a stable and abundant food supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{grey-necked rockfowl}} breeds either {{alone or in}} small colonies {{averaging}} two to five nests in size, though nearly fifty nests are present at one site. It is monogamous and therefore does not breed with rockfowl other than its mate. It is believed to breed cooperatively in Equatorial Guinea, as four different birds were observed feeding one nest. The rockfowl's courtship displays are unknown. The timing of the <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> in a colony is not synchronized, leading to various stages of development of nestlings within the colony. It {{has been suggested that}} this is to promote cooperative breeding. The laying dates also vary by region, typically coinciding with {{a few weeks before the}} onset of the wet season; in areas where the wet season is bimodal, two different breeding seasons occur. However, in mountainous regions such as Mount Cameroon, it breeds during the dry season to avoid the frequent mists of the wet season. Birds in Nigeria lay their eggs between August and November, birds in Gabon lay between November and April, birds in western Cameroon lay between March and November with peaks of June, July, and October, and birds in southern Cameroon have two breeding seasons, a main one from October to December and a secondary one lasting from April to May. In Equatorial Guinea, nesting occurs in mid-February.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as <b>egg</b> <b>laying</b> is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or of the hole left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E

40|$|A {{replicated}} {{comparison of}} reciprocal recurrent selection (rrs) based on crossbred performance and within strain-selection (wss) based on purebred performance {{was made in}} three diverse environments over ten generations {{for the improvement of}} a heterotic trait, 4 -day virgin <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> of Tribolium castaneum. A selection intensity of 20 % based on performance in either an optimum (33 °), a mild stress (38 °), or a severe stress (28 °) environment was applied uniformly. Periodically, the performance of each population was measured in all three environments to provide both direct and correlated responses. —Heritability of <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> in the base population ranged from 0. 36 ± 0. 03 in optimum to 0. 26 ± 0. 03 in severe stress. Estimates of dominance effects assumed significant proportions in severe stress only. Genetic correlations for <b>egg</b> <b>lay</b> in diverse environments were large and positive (. 6 to. 8). —Only in severe stress did the rrs response significantly exceed that for wss. Quadratic adjustments fitted to response curves revealed that small initial genetic gains under rrs were followed by significantly increasing rates of gain in late generations of selection. The reverse was true for wss. This and evidence from realized heritabilities and genetic correlations suggested that rrs had utilized both additive and dominance effects, but wss response was limited to additive effects. —These results agree with selection theory in demonstrating that purebred selection is more efficient than crossbred selection in utilizing additive gene effects. The latter method has merit when non-additive effects assume significant proportions, and this is the more probable case for severe stress conditions...|$|R
