5|$|According to many observers, {{including}} Ray Ferraro {{and teammates}} Brendan Gallagher and Connor McDavid, Tanev {{was perhaps the}} best defenceman in the tournament {{in terms of his}} defensive play - he and his defence partner, Morgan Rielly, were not on the <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> a single goal against at even-strength. Tanev also played a major role on Canada’s tournament-best penalty kill that allowed just two goals against in 29 opportunities. He registered one assist during the tournament.|$|E

Bertuzzi apologized to Moore and his family, as well as to Burke, Canucks owner John McCaw, Jr., the Canucks organization, his teammates, and the fans in a press conference two days later.|$|E
5|$|Anna Elisabeth Johansson Bågenholm (born 1970) is a Swedish {{radiologist}} from Vänersborg, {{who survived}} after a skiing accident in 1999 left her trapped under {{a layer of}} <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> 80minutes in freezing water. During this time she became a victim of extreme hypothermia and her body temperature decreased to , {{one of the lowest}} survived body temperatures ever recorded in a human with accidental hypothermia. Bågenholm was able to find an air pocket under the ice, but suffered circulatory arrest after 40minutes in the water.|$|E
5|$|During the {{planning}} of Troll, which opened in 1990, {{it was decided that}} the station was to be placed at such a location as to allow it to have an airstrip for year-round operations. Jutulsessen was chosen as the location, in part because it provided a base nunatak for the research station {{and at the same time}} was close to blue <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> the runway. At the time, all cargo and passengers to Troll had to either be transported by ship, or flown in via the airport at the Russian base Novolazarevskaya or Henriksenskjera.|$|E

40|$|Vessels {{operating}} in northern waters {{during the winter}} months constantly face a hazard of icing. This applies particularly to the Canadian east coast fishing vessels. Though there has been considerable data collected on the amount of marine <b>icing</b> <b>for</b> different environmental conditions, the sources are scattered and not easily accessible. Therefore the Canadian Hydraulics Centre of National Research Council Canada developed a comprehensive Marine Icing Database. The database contains more than 1000 events of marine <b>icing</b> <b>for</b> different environmental conditions collected from year 1970 and onwards. It {{can be used as a}} tool to predict <b>icing</b> severity <b>for</b> different environmental conditions, with direct applications on the Grand Banks. This paper describes the database in detail.

5|$|In {{his second}} season with the Wild Ballard was hit by the New York Islanders' Matt Martin after making a pass. The hit was {{delivered}} as Ballard turned away from Martin. Ballard's head struck a glass partition and as he fell his head bounced off the ice. He lay on the <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> {{a few minutes before}} being able to leave the ice on his own. Ballard suffered a concussion and multiple facial fractures as a result. He was taken to Regions Hospital for evaluation and observation and released the next day. There was no penalty or suspension in result of the hit.|$|E
5|$|Jordal Amfi, {{an outdoor}} {{artificial}} ice rink, was built with {{a capacity for}} 10,000 spectators.

He was carried off the ice immediately and had surgery done the same night. Phaneuf was said to be off the <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> four-to-six weeks, and made a return to the Leafs' line-up on December 9, 2010, a home ice game against the Philadelphia Flyers, which Philadelphia won 4–1, though he had one assist on the lone Toronto goal.|$|E
5|$|The Nottingham Panthers were revived largely {{thanks to}} the efforts of Gary Keward. In 1980 the Ice Stadium directors, led by Charles Walker, agreed to a request by Keward to give ice hockey another chance. The Sheffield Lancers, a team Keward helped to run, were {{relocated}} to Nottingham taking the name of the team that had occupied the same building 20 years earlier. On 20 September 1980 the modern Panthers took to the <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> the first time defeating the Solihull Barons 7–4 at the Ice Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant ice was still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural ice was at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E

5|$|Although to date most KBOs still appear spectrally featureless due {{to their}} faintness, {{there have been a}} number of successes in {{determining}} their composition. In 1996, Robert H. Brown et al. acquired spectroscopic data on the KBO 1993 SC, which revealed that its surface composition is markedly similar to that of Pluto, as well as Neptune's moon Triton, with large amounts of methane <b>ice.</b> <b>For</b> the smaller objects, only colors and in some cases the albedos have been determined. These objects largely fall into two classes: gray with low albedos, or very red with higher albedos. The difference in colors and albedos is hypothesized to be due to the retention or the loss of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) on the surface of these objects, with the surfaces of those that formed far enough from the Sun to retain H2S being reddened due to irradiation.|$|E
5|$|Clara {{volunteers to}} speak to Skaldak to try and calm him, {{relaying}} the Doctor's words to Skaldak, though {{he knows that the}} Doctor is listening. The Doctor informs Skaldak he was encased in the <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> 5000 years. Skaldak laments the loss of his daughter and his people; however, the Doctor tries to comfort him with the knowledge that the Ice Warriors still live, just not on Earth or Mars. Skaldak escapes from his armour - an act of great dishonour - and stops broadcasting the signal to the other Ice Warriors because he believes himself to be the only one of his kind left. The Doctor surmises that, thinking himself to be the last of his kind, Skaldak has nothing left to lose. He manages to grab and kill three members of the crew.|$|E
5|$|Formby's {{health was}} further damaged in the {{influenza}} pandemic of 1918, {{during which he}} contracted the disease while appearing at the Manchester Hippodrome {{and was unable to}} work for a month. He was taken ill during the runs of pantomimes in both 1918 and 1919, was forced to rest for three months in 1919, and collapsed on stage during a performance in Newcastle upon Tyne in the 1920–21 pantomime season. Formby was advised by doctors to emigrate to South Africa for the benefit of his health, but he preferred to stay in Britain, with his wife and children, and continued to work. During his performances his wife would wait in the wings with <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> him to suck to stop internal bleeding, and an oxygen tent was present in the stage wings ready for emergencies.|$|E

5|$|Mala and the Eskimos go {{bowhead whale}} hunting in wooden boats and with {{harpoons}} {{provided by the}} white men, and an actual whale hunt and carcass slaughtering is depicted on film. After the successful hunt, two drunken white men kidnap Aba (and prevent Mala from rescuing her) and force her to get drunk. The ship captain rapes Aba, who escapes at dawn. The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the <b>ice)</b> <b>for</b> an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a harpoon (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{targeted}} by terrestrial and pagophilic predators. The polar bear is well adapted for hunting Arctic seals and walruses, particularly pups. Bears {{are known to}} use sit-and-wait tactics as well as active stalking and pursuit of prey on ice or water. Other terrestrial predators include cougars, brown hyenas and various species of canids, which mostly target the young. Pinnipeds lessen the chance of predation by gathering in groups. Some species are capable of inflicting damaging wounds on their attackers with their sharp canines—an adult walrus is capable of killing polar bears. When out at sea, northern elephant seals dive {{out of the reach}} of surface-hunting orcas and white sharks. In the Antarctic, which lacks terrestrial predators, pinniped species spend more time on the ice than their Arctic counterparts. Arctic seals use more breathing holes per individual, appear more restless when hauled out, and rarely defecate on the ice. Ringed seals build dens underneath fast <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> protection.|$|E
5|$|Returning for a {{third season}} with Hamilton in 1962–63, Henderson led the Ontario Hockey Association in scoring with 49 goals in 48 games. He added 27 assists to finish the season with 76 points. A bout of strep throat {{resulted}} in his missing Hamilton's playoff games, but he was called up to the Detroit Red Wings late in their season when they were short of players. Henderson played his first two NHL games against the Toronto Maple Leafs, with only one shift in each game. In his first game, Henderson elbowed Dick Duff in the head, sparking a fight. He {{spent the rest of}} the game on the bench after several Toronto players threatened retaliation against him. In his second, he incurred a slashing penalty during his only time on the ice. Henderson estimated that he was on the <b>ice</b> <b>for</b> only 20 seconds over the two games, but drew nine penalties in minutes.|$|E
