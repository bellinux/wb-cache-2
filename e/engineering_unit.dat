5|$|When the Spanish–American War broke out, Savage {{volunteered to}} lead men in battle. Instead, {{he was given}} command of an <b>engineering</b> <b>unit</b> which then built a {{complete}} base in Havana. Returning to New York, he wrote more books and corresponded with his wife who traveled often to the Russian Empire to visit their daughter and her Russian husband. Four years after mustering out of the Army, Savage was knocked down and mortally wounded {{at the age of}} 57 by a horse and carriage on the streets of New York.|$|E
5|$|After his training, Rane {{was posted}} to the 28th Field Company, an <b>engineering</b> <b>unit</b> of the 26th Infantry Division which, at the time, was {{fighting}} the Japanese in Burma. As his division retreated from the Japanese after the failed Arakan Campaign, he, {{along with his}} two sections, was hand-picked by his company commander to stay back behind at Buthidaung to destroy key assets and then be evacuated by the Royal Indian Navy. Though the objective was soon achieved, the expected pickup did not happen. This forced Rane and his men to cross a river that was patrolled by the Japanese to reach their lines. Rane, along with his two sections, expertly evaded the Japanese troops, and joined the 26th Infantry Division at Bahri. For his actions, {{he was promoted to}} havaldar (sergeant).|$|E

2500|$|Until 1960, Portuguese {{military}} forces serving in Guinea were composed of units led by white officers, with commissioned soldiers (whites), overseas soldiers (African assimilados), and native or indigenous Africans (indigenato) {{serving in the}} enlisted ranks. [...] General Spínola's Africanization policy eliminated these discriminatory colour bars, and called for the integration of indigenous Guinea Africans into Portuguese {{military forces}} in Africa. [...] Two special indigenous African counterinsurgency detachments were formed by the Portuguese Armed Forces. [...] The first of these was the African Commandos (Comandos Africanos), consisting of a battalion of commandos composed entirely of black soldiers (including the officers). [...] The second was the African Special Marines (Fuzileiros Especiais Africanos), Marine units entirely composed of black soldiers. [...] The African Special Marines supplemented other Portuguese elite units conducting amphibious operations in the riverine areas of Guinea {{in an attempt to}} interdict and destroy guerrilla forces and supplies. [...] General Spínola's Africanization policy also fostered a large increase in indigenous recruitment into the armed forces, culminating the establishment of all-black military formations such as the Black Militias (Milícias negras) commanded by Major Carlos Fabião. [...] By the early 1970s, an increasing percentage of Guineans were serving as noncommissioned or commissioned officers in Portuguese military forces in Africa, including such higher-ranking officers as Captain (later Lt.
