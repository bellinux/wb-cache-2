5|$|February 18: Construction begins for Y-12, {{a massive}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant for {{enriching}} uranium at Oak Ridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation,</b> gaseous {{diffusion}}, and thermal diffusion technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project. In February 1943, Groves {{came up with the idea}} of using the output of some plants as the input for others.|$|E
5|$|Worn {{out by the}} effort, Urey {{left the}} project in February 1945, handing over his {{responsibilities}} to R. H. Crist. The K-25 plant commenced operation in March 1945, and as the bugs were worked out, the plant operated with remarkable efficiency and economy. For a time, uranium was fed into the S50 liquid thermal diffusion plant, then the K-25 gaseous, and finally the Y-12 <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant; but soon {{after the war ended}} the thermal and <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plants were closed down, and separation was performed by K-25 alone. Along with its twin, K-27, constructed in 1946, it became the principal isotope separation plant in the early post-war period. For his work on the Manhattan Project, Urey was awarded the Medal for Merit by the Project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.|$|E

25|$|In the <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> process (EMIS), {{metallic}} uranium {{is first}} vaporized, and then ionized to positively charged ions. The cations are then accelerated and subsequently deflected by magnetic fields onto their respective collection targets. A production-scale mass spectrometer named the Calutron was developed during World War II that provided {{some of the}} 235U used for the Little Boy nuclear bomb, which was dropped over Hiroshima in 1945. Properly the term 'Calutron' applies to a multistage device arranged in a large oval around a powerful electromagnet. <b>Electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> has been largely abandoned in favour of more effective methods.|$|R
50|$|Uranium {{tetrachloride}} (UCl4) is {{compound of}} uranium in oxidation state +4. It {{was used in}} the <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> (EMIS) process of uranium enrichment. It {{is one of the main}} starting materials for organouranium chemistry.|$|R
5|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> for uranium {{enrichment}} was {{abandoned in the}} post-war period {{in favor of the}} more complicated, but more efficient, gaseous diffusion method. Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan Project were dismantled {{at the end of the}} war, some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military, scientific and medical purposes.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for {{the design}} and {{construction}} of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant, which {{came to be called}} Y-12, was assigned to Stone & Webster by the S-1 Committee in June 1942. The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. Construction began in February 1943.|$|E
5|$|A British mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, headed by Mark Oliphant, assisted with that of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> process at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Cockcroft became the director of the joint British-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. A British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory was led by Chadwick, and later Peierls, which included several of Britain's most eminent scientists. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership, and ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E
500|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> used devices {{known as}} calutrons, {{a hybrid of}} two {{laboratory}} instruments, the mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name was derived from [...] "California university cyclotrons". In November 1943, Lawrence's team at Berkeley was bolstered by 29 British scientists, including Oliphant.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the PAEC did not forgo the <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> {{research}} and a parallel program {{was conducted by}} theoretical physicist G.D. Alam at Air Research Laboratories (ARL) located at Chaklala PAF base, though G.D. Allam had not seen a centrifuge, but only had a rudimentary knowledge of the Manhattan Project.|$|R
5|$|Joan Elizabeth Curran (26 February 1916 – 10 February 1999) was a Welsh {{scientist}} who played {{important roles in}} the development of radar and the atomic bomb during the Second World War. She invented chaff, a radar countermeasure technique credited with reducing losses among Allied bomber crews. She also worked {{on the development of the}} proximity fuse and the <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> process for the atomic bomb.|$|R
5|$|In the {{electromagnetic}} process, {{a magnetic field}} deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because {{it was based on}} proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and would rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|A {{disappointed}} Oliphant {{flew to the}} United States {{to speak}} to the American scientists. These included Ernest Lawrence at the University of California's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley. The two men had met before the war, and were friends. Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium. Uranium-235 makes up only about 0.72% of natural uranium, so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90% uranium-235 from natural uranium. The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion, but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934: <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation.</b> This was the process that Nier had used.|$|E
5|$|After the 1990–91 Gulf War, UNSCOM {{determined}} that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium. Iraq chose {{to develop the}} electromagnetic process over more modern, economic, and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build, with fewer technical challenges, and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls. At the time the program was discovered, Iraq {{was estimated to be}} two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons. The program was destroyed in the Gulf War. Consequently, the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear-related dual-use equipment, material and technology.|$|E
25|$|Harold Alvin Fidler (August 02, 1910 – April 2, 2004) was the Associate Director of the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory from 1958 to 1974. During World War II {{he served}} as the Manhattan Project's California Area Engineer, where he worked with Ernest O. Lawrence's Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, which was {{developing}} calutrons for <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation.</b> As such, {{he was responsible for}} the administration of contracts between the Army and the University of California.|$|R
50|$|Tarmiya was {{the main}} site for <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> (EMIS) program for the {{enrichment}} of uranium. The site included both 1200 mm and 600 mm separators. Tarmiya {{was the site of}} the 20 calutrons used to enrich uranium to 35%, located in two buildings at the site. This huge facility was designed to house 90 electromagnetic isotope separators and eight such separators were actually placed in operation in September 1990, resulting in the production of around half a kilogram of 4% enriched uranium.|$|R
50|$|The main {{thrust of}} Iraq's uranium {{enrichment}} program was {{the development of}} technology for <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> (EMIS) of indigenous uranium. This uses the same principles as a mass spectrometer (albeit on a much larger scale). Ions of uranium-238 and uranium-235 are separated because they describe arcs of different radii when they move through a magnetic field. This process {{was used in the}} Manhattan Project to make the highly enriched uranium used in the Hiroshima bomb, but was abandoned soon afterwards.|$|R
5|$|Because {{uranium-235}} {{was known}} to be fissionable, it was the first material pursued in the approach to bomb development. As the first design developed (as well as the first deployed for combat), it is sometimes known as the Mark I. The vast majority of the work {{came in the form of}} the isotope enrichment of the uranium necessary for the weapon, since uranium-235 makes up only 1 part in 140 of natural uranium. Enrichment was performed at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, where the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant, known as Y-12, became fully operational in March 1944. The first shipments of highly enriched uranium were sent to the Los Alamos Laboratory in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|December 9, and December 19, 1942, and January 14, February 10–11, March 18, April 29, and September 10–11, 1943. Its {{first meeting}} on June 25, 1942 was {{attended}} by Bush, Styer and Colonels Marshall and Kenneth Nichols. It discussed the acquisition of land for the project's production facilities, which the Army recommended be {{in the vicinity of}} Knoxville, Tennessee, with the Boston firm of Stone & Webster as the project's principal contractor. The meeting on July 30, 1942, was devoted to reviewing progress on isotope separation by the centrifugal and gaseous diffusion methods. The August 26, 1942, meeting considered Lawrence's <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> project, and expansion of the program to produce heavy water.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron. In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to operate, and cost more to build.

500|$|The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District, Colonel James C. Marshall, and his deputy, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols, {{discovered}} that the <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> process would require [...] of copper, which was in desperately short supply. However, they realized that silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with the Under Secretary of the Treasury, Daniel W. Bell, and asked for the transfer of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository. Nichols later recalled the conversation: ...|$|R

However, silver could be substituted, in an 11:10 ratio. On 3 August 1942, Nichols met with Under Secretary of the Treasury Daniel W.

[...] "Young man," [...] Bell told him, [...] "you may think of silver in tons but the Treasury will always think of silver in troy ounces!" [...] Eventually, [...] were used.|$|R
5|$|In early 1944 the Currans {{were part}} of a group of British {{scientists}} invited to go to the US to take part in the Manhattan Project – the Allied project to develop an atomic bomb. They joined the British Mission at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory in California, headed by Mark Oliphant, a distinguished Australian scientist that Joan knew from the Cavendish Laboratory. Oliphant also acted as de facto deputy to Ernest Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory. The mission of the laboratory was to develop the <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> process to create enriched uranium for use in atomic bombs.|$|R
5|$|Lawrence went on {{to build}} a series of ever larger and more {{expensive}} cyclotrons. His Radiation Laboratory became an official department of the University of California in 1936, with Lawrence as its director. In addition {{to the use of}} the cyclotron for physics, Lawrence also supported its use in research into medical uses of radioisotopes. During World War II, Lawrence developed electromagnetic isotope separation at the Radiation Laboratory. It used devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. A huge <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant was built at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which came to be called Y-12. The process was inefficient, but it worked.|$|E
5|$|A British mission led by Akers {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} gaseous diffusion technology at the SAM Laboratories in New York. Another, led by Oliphant, who acted as deputy director at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, assisted with the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> process. Cockcroft became the director of the Anglo-Canadian Montreal Laboratory. The British mission to the Los Alamos Laboratory led by James Chadwick, and later Peierls, included distinguished scientists such as Geoffrey Taylor, James Tuck, Niels Bohr, William Penney, Frisch, Ernest Titterton and Klaus Fuchs, who was later revealed to be a Soviet spy. As overall head of the British Mission, Chadwick forged a close and successful partnership with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, the director of the Manhattan Project. He ensured that British participation was complete and wholehearted.|$|E
5|$|On 26 May 1943, Oliphant {{wrote to}} Appleton {{to say that}} he had been {{considering}} the problem of electromagnetic isotope separation, and believed that he had devised a better method than Lawrence's, one which would result in a five to tenfold improvement in efficiency, and make it more practical to use the process in Britain. His proposal was reviewed by Akers, Chadwick, Peierls and Simon, who agreed that it was sound. While the majority of scientific opinion in Britain favoured the gaseous diffusion method, there was still a possibility that <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> might be useful as a final stage in the enrichment process, taking uranium that had already been enriched to 50 per cent by the gaseous process, and enriching it to pure uranium-235. Accordingly, Oliphant was released from the radar project to work on Tube Alloys, conducting experiments on his method at the University of Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|As the {{problems}} were being resolved, Khan began the enrichment operations. By the start of 1983, the KRL had developed around 1500–2900 gas centrifuges loosely based on Urenco Group technology. It was thanks to Abdul Qadeer Khan's effort that on 4 June 1978, scientists working in the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL) succeed in enriching uranium by <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> of 238U and 235U isotopes at the then-Pakistan Air Force controlled-Chaklala Air Force Base Centrifuge Laboratory (CACL). Ghulam Dastagir Alam, who co-headed the isotope separation project, informed Abdul Qadeer Khan. Khan immediately went to GHQ to informed General Zia-Ul-Haq.|$|R
50|$|As {{opposed to}} uranium, the {{parallel}} plutonium programme is indigenous, locally developed and culminated under the scientific directorship of PAEC chairman Munir Ahmad Khan. Since 1972, earlier efforts were directed towards plutonium and necessary infrastructure {{was built by}} Bhutto {{as early as the}} 1970s. Contrary to popular perception, Pakistan did not forego or abandon the plutonium program and pursued it along with the uranium route. Despite many setbacks and international embargo, PAEC continued its research on plutonium and created a separated <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> program alongside the enrichment program, under Dr. G D Allam, a theoretical physicist.|$|R

The design called for five first-stage processing units, known as Alpha racetracks, and two units for final processing, known as Beta racetracks. In September 1943 Groves authorized construction of four more racetracks, known as Alpha II. When the plant was started up for testing on schedule in October 1943, the 14-ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment because {{of the power of the}} magnets, and had to be fastened more securely. A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out. In December Groves ordered a magnet to be broken open, and handfuls of rust were found inside. Groves then ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned. A pickling plant was established on-site to clean the pipes and fittings.|$|E
5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation,</b> the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the facts about fast neutron reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|The {{experiments}} with the 184-inch magnet {{led to the}} construction of a prototype calutron called the XA. It contained a rectangular, three-coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side, with four vacuum tanks, each with a double source. At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee, which had superseded the S-1 Uranium Committee on 19 June, there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge, where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located, for reasons of economy and security. Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>separation</b> plant located much nearer to Berkeley. The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942, by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection. The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering.|$|E

50|$|The Y-12 {{facility}} began {{operating in}} November 1943, separating uranium-235 from natural uranium, which is 99.3% uranium-238, by using calutrons to perform <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation.</b> Y-12 separated the uranium-235 for Little Boy, the nuclear weapon that was dropped on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945. K-25, another facility in Oak Ridge, produced enriched uranium using gaseous diffusion. However, K-25 {{did not begin}} operating until March 1945 and fed slightly enriched uranium to Y-12's Beta Calutrons as the push to obtain enough uranium 235 for Little Boy came in the early summer of 1945. The S-50 Thermal Diffusion Plant at the K-25 site also provided feed material for Y-12's Beta Calutrons.|$|R
50|$|Larson was senior chemist from 1942 to 1945 on Ernest Lawrence's {{team that}} oversaw the {{construction}} and operation of the Y-12 National Security Complex. The plant used <b>electromagnetic</b> isotope <b>separation</b> to produce most of the uranium-235 for Little Boy, the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Larson suggested and oversaw improvements to the plant that increased the yield of the process. Uranium atoms were buried in {{the walls of the}} stainless steel receivers by the calutrons, then recovered chemically. Larson's solution was to copper-plate the receivers, which increased the yield as more atoms could be more easily recovered from copper than stainless steel. In 1948, Larson became the director of the Y-12 Complex.|$|R
