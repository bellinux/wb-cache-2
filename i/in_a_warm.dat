5|$|During {{the months}} of May and June, four named systems developed. In July, one {{tropical}} storm and two hurricanes formed. The following month, five tropical systems developed. Towards {{the end of the}} season, tropical cyclone activity declined somewhat. While five storms formed in September, only one formed in October and none during the month of November. A moderate El Nino was present throughout the season; water temperatures across the equatorial Central Pacific were 1.3°C (3°F) above normal.

5|$|An {{occluded}} front is formed {{during the process}} of cyclogenesis when a cold front overtakes a warm front. The cold and warm fronts curve naturally poleward into the point of occlusion, which is also known as the triple point in meteorology. It lies within a sharp trough, but the air mass behind the boundary can be either warm or cold. In a cold occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is cooler than the cool air ahead of the warm front, and plows under both air masses. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> occlusion, the air mass overtaking the warm front is not as cool as the cold air ahead of the warm front, and rides over the colder air mass while lifting the warm air. A wide variety of weather can be found along an {{occluded front}}, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage is associated with a drying of the air mass. Occluded fronts are indicated on a weather map by a purple line with alternating half-circles and triangles pointing in direction of travel. Occluded fronts usually form around mature low pressure areas.|$|E

Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all, Kyle encourages him to go, even offering to help pay for his ticket. Although Butters, Ike, Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew, an undaunted Cartman uses his mother's credit card to book a trip to Somalia. After a long flight and a 49-hour bus ride, the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates. Once there, however, they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land, the complete opposite of their expectations.|$|E

5|$|Mainly nocturnal, {{the female}} redback {{lives in an}} untidy web <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> {{sheltered}} location, commonly near or inside human residences. It preys on insects, spiders and small vertebrates that become ensnared in its web. It kills its prey by injecting a complex venom through its two fangs when it bites, before wrapping them in silk and sucking out the liquefied insides. Often, It first squirts its victim with what resembles 'superglue' from its spinnerets, immobilising the prey by sticking the victim's limbs and appendages to its own body. The Redback Spider then trusses the victim with silk. Once its prey is restrained, it is bitten repeatedly on the head, body and leg segments and is then hauled back to the Redback Spider's retreat. Sometimes a potentially dangerous victim can be left to struggle for hours until it is exhausted enough to approach safely. Male spiders and spiderlings often live {{on the periphery of}} the female spiders' web and steal leftovers. Other species of spider and parasitoid wasps prey on this species. The redback is one of few arachnids that usually display sexual cannibalism while mating.|$|E
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm,</b> shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E
5|$|Volvariella surrecta {{is a rare}} species, {{even though}} its major host is quite common; the {{conditions}} required for the parasite to produce fruit bodies are not well known. Some authors have suggested that it may grow equally well as a parasite or a saprobe. V.surrecta has been found on its host in several different habitat types, including birch woodlands, pine plantations, scrub, thickets of small trees or shrubs beside roads, and under brambles. No definite preference for soil type has been determined, having been found in sands, clay, gravels, and peat. In 1867, Worthington George Smith {{reported that he had}} successfully cultivated the species by partially burying fruit bodies under water-soaked rotting fir leaves that were placed in a bell-glass <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warm</b> room. According to his account, a white mycelium grew over the leaves and eventually formed small white pins (immature, undifferentiated fruit bodies) that grew into fully formed mushrooms about two weeks after starting.|$|E

Her goal for the 2008 Beijing Paralympics was to set a {{personal}} best, but she also had eyes on a medal. She took the year off her psychology degree to train six times a week. At the 2008 games, along with her team mates Christie Dawes, Madison de Rozario, and Jemima Moore, she achieved her best Paralympic result, winning a silver medal behind China's world record in the T53/54 4x100m relay. In the individual events, she finished fifth in the women's T53 100m event (a race won in world record time by Huang Lisha), seventh in the women's T53 200m event (also won in a world record time by Huang), seventh in the women's T53 400m event, and led out the women's 800m final, eventually finishing sixth. After a couple of sub-par competition results in 2011, Ballard made big changes to her diet, gloves, technique, chair position, and training regime. She entered the 2012 London Paralympics ranked world number one in both the T53 100m and 200m. At the games, Ballard participated in the T53 class events for 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m events. She won two silver medals in the 200m and 400m T53 events, and a bronze medal in the 100m T53 event.|$|E

Three well blowout scenarios, two shipping accidents and a pipeline rupture were considered.

Future atmospheric forcing was based on the IPCC’s A 1 B scenario, with the ocean data generated by the hydrodynamic model SINMOD. We found differences in “typical” outcome of <b>a</b> spill <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warmer</b> future compared to the present, mainly due to a longer season of open water. We have demonstrated that ice cover is extremely important for predicting the fate of an Arctic oil spill, and find that oil spills <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>warming</b> climate will <b>in</b> some cases result in greater areal coverage and shoreline exposure...|$|R
