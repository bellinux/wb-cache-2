5000|$|The Haj subsidy is {{a subsidy}} given to Indian Muslim Hajj pilgrims by the Government of India {{in form of}} <b>discounted</b> <b>Air</b> <b>fares</b> on Indian Government owned Air India. The program has its origins in British colonial era. In post-colonial era, the Government of India {{expanded}} the program in 1959 with the Hajj Act. The subsidy initially applied to Indian Muslim pilgrims traveling for religious reasons to Saudi Arabia, Syria, Iraq, Iran and Jordan. Haj subsidy started in 1954, as an idea initiated by the then government, with flights between Mumbai and Jeddah. Additional flight legs were added over the years, and since 1984, all Haj traffic has been shared by Air India and Saudia, the national carriers of India and Saudi Arabia.The monopoly of these airlines has proven the most contentious point of the subsidy with some Muslims objecting to it by claiming that the real beneficiary is Air India as the subsidy is actually a discount on an overpriced <b>air</b> <b>fare.</b> [...] There have also been requests by Muslims to withdraw subsidy including some Muslim Parliament members as it is against Islam even it was beneficial.|$|R

40|$|The Commonwealth's {{regulation}} of interstate aviation, {{in place for}} over thirty years, {{came to an end}} at midnight on 30 October 1990. This study reviews the developments {{in the last few months}} of regulation and in the first year of deregulation. Based on the first year's evidence, de{{regulation of}} domestic aviation in Australia has, from the consumer's perspective, been very successful. Reliance on market forces and competition, as opposed to regulation, has so far provided clear benefits to consumers in terms of lower fares and improved servcie quality. In particular, <b>discount</b> <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> have been much deeper and more readily available under deregulation. Between September 1990 and June 1991 quarters, real average fares of a large sample of the top 20 routes fell by 12 per cent. Service quality on a number of dimensions has also improved with deregulation. Most notably, an analysis of the services provided by domestic and commuter operators on the top 40 routes indicated that there was a 21 per cent increase in the number of flights between the June quarters of 1990 and 1991. The airlines have been able to reduce costs, but their financial performance has been adversely affected by the recession and the increased level of competition in the industry. the analysis suggests that the expected outcomes from deregulation are being realised so far. ...|$|R
500|$|In July 2014, SpiceJet {{announced}} up to 50 percent <b>discount</b> in <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> due to competition. In August 2014, SpiceJet {{became the}} second largest carrier in terms of passenger market share after IndiGo, beating full service carrier Jet Airways {{for the first time}} in its operational history. In December 2014, financial losses and unpaid dues led to cancellation of many domestic flights. Directorate General of Civil Aviation issued a warning to the airline over non-payment of salaries and dues and the carrier was put on cash-and-carry mode by airport operators, meaning the airline can use the airport facilities only upon prior payment of money. On 17 December 2014, all flights were grounded after oil companies refused to refuel its planes due to non-payment of dues with flights resuming the next day. [...] Flights resumed the next day. In January 2015, the Sun group sold its entire shareholding and transferred control to Ajay Singh.|$|R
40|$|This study {{sought to}} find out how {{commercial}} airlines are facilitating domestic tourism in Kenya. Domestic tourism involves locals visiting fun places, holiday destinations and entertaining centers for their own relaxation or fun activities within the national boundaries. The locals may decide to visit such places {{to get away from the}} usual pressure associated with work, monotony of daily living and time to bond with the family. Domestic tourism has seen a significant increase that has been caused by several external influences that have impacted on the consumers. Several organizations, both public and private sectors have encouraged domestic tourism by giving incentives to persons interested. In this paper data was collected from the print media. The aim of the study is to identify the means, in which commercial airlines use to reach the domestic tourist as well as ways that commercial airlines use to promote domestic tourism in Kenya. The study concluded that commercial airlines have largely employed print media to communicate to the consumers the following; reduction of fares, increased frequency of specific routes, and introduction of new routes. The advertisements are especially heavy during the period following long holidays, which shows that the airlines are appealing to the consumers who are working to take advantage of the period and travel to a different destination to unwind and also spend time with the family. Commercial airlines have greatly encouraged domestic tourism by offering reduced fares to popular destinations, and tour operators not wanting to be left behind offer <b>discounted</b> packages on <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> and accommodation during this season.

40|$|There are recent {{evidence}} that air transport demand {{may not have}} a perfectly reversible relationship with income and jet fuel prices, as is assumed in most demand models. However, it is not known if the imperfectly reversible effects of jet fuel price are a result of asymmetries in the supply side, i. e., asymmetries in cost pass through from fuel prices to <b>air</b> <b>fare,</b> or of demand side behavioral asymmetries whereby people value gains and losses differently. This paper uses US time series data and decomposes <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> and fuel price into three component series to develop an econometric model of air transport demand that is capable of capturing the potential imperfectly reversible relationships and test for {{the presence or absence of}} reversibility. We find that air transport demand shows asymmetry with respect to <b>air</b> <b>fare,</b> indicating potential imperfect reversibility in consumer behavior. We also find evidence of asymmetry and hysteresis in cost pass-through from jet fuel prices to <b>air</b> <b>fare,</b> showing rapid increases in airfare when fuel prices increases but a slower response in the opposite direction...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a new {{approach}} to model capacity constraints in discrete choice with at least some capacity-related variables missing, like e. g. the price of a commodity. Airport choice models often do not contain <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> because of measurement difficulties as <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> are often not included in passenger surveys and thus essential information regarding ticket price is lost to the researcher. Since <b>air</b> <b>fares</b> vary more across ticket categories at an airport than a ticket category varies across different airports, <b>air</b> <b>fare</b> related information cannot be reconstructed in many cases by the researcher. However, capacity constraints are becoming increasingly more important and thus including capacity constraints in airport choice models is reasonable. The model approach is based on individual utility maximisation and thus fits into the discrete choice framework. Furthermore, nonlinear programming is employed to find a feasible solution regarding capacity constraints. Thereby, detailed statements on how limited airport capacity changes traveller behaviour with regard to airport choice on the level of individual air travellers and airports are possible. The paper concludes with an empirical example to demonstrate the methodology and show the impact of limited airport capacity on airport choice of air travellers. ...|$|R
