40|$|An 8 -channel receive {{coil array}} was {{constructed}} and implanted {{adjacent to the}} skull in a male rhesus monkey {{in order to improve}} the sensitivity of (functional) brain imaging. The permanent implant was part of an acrylic headpost assembly and only the coil element loop wires were implanted. The tuning, matching, and preamplifier circuitry was connected via a removable external assembly. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise amplification for parallel imaging were compared to single-, 4 -, and 8 -channel <b>external</b> receive-only <b>coils</b> routinely used for macaque fMRI. In vivo measurements showed significantly improved SNR within the brain for the implanted versus the <b>external</b> <b>coils.</b> Within a region-of-interest covering the cerebral cortex, we observed a 5. 4 -, 3. 6 -fold, and 3. 4 -fold increase in SNR compared to the external single-, 4 -, and 8 -channel coils, respectively. In the center of the brain, the implanted array maintained a 2. 4 ×, 2. 5 ×, and 2. 1 × higher SNR, respectively compared to the <b>external</b> <b>coils.</b> The array performance was evaluated for anatomical, diffusion tensor and functional brain imaging. This study suggests that a stable implanted phased-array coil can be used in macaque MRI to substantially increase the spatial resolution for anatomical, diffusion tensor, and functional imaging. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Regular {{gasoline}} two-stroke engines {{will run}} backwards {{for short periods}} and under light load with little problem, {{and this has been}} used to provide a reversing facility in microcars, such as the Messerschmitt KR200, that lacked reverse gearing. Where the vehicle has electric starting, the motor will be turned off and restarted backwards by turning the key in the opposite direction. Two-stroke golf carts have used a similar kind of system. Traditional flywheel magnetos (using contact-breaker points, but no <b>external</b> <b>coil)</b> worked equally well in reverse because the cam controlling the points is symmetrical, breaking contact before top dead center (TDC) equally well whether running forwards or backwards. Reed-valve engines will run backwards just as well as piston-controlled porting, though rotary valve engines have asymmetrical inlet timing and will not run very well.|$|E
50|$|By 1920 his {{research}} {{led to his}} invention of the magnetron. This {{took the form of}} a central cathode and a coaxial cylindrical anode split into two halves, with an axial magnetic field produced by an <b>external</b> <b>coil.</b> The Hull magnetron was tested as an amplifier in radio receivers and also as a low-frequency oscillator. It was reported in 1925 that a magnetron made at GERL could generate a power of 15 kW at a frequency of 20 kHz. At the time Hull anticipated that the magnetron would find greater use as a power converter than in communication applications. Hull's split-anode magnetron didn't prove to be capable of high frequency or high power output and was little used. However, during World War 2 John Randall and Harry Boot built on Hull's concept to develop the modern cavity magnetron, the first device which could produce high power at microwave frequencies, and the resulting centimeter-band radar proved a crucial advantage for the Allies in aerial warfare.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a modern}} installation, the magneto {{only has a}} single low tension winding which is {{connected}} to an external ignition coil which not only has a low tension winding, but also a secondary winding of many thousands of turns to deliver the high voltage required for the spark plug(s). Such a system is known as an [...] "energy transfer" [...] ignition system. Initially this was done because {{it was easier to}} provide good insulation for the secondary winding of an <b>external</b> <b>coil</b> than it was in a coil buried {{in the construction of the}} magneto (early magnetos had the coil assembly externally to the rotating parts to make them easier to insulate—at the expense of efficiency). In more modern times, insulation materials have improved to the point where constructing self-contained magnetos is relatively easy, but energy transfer systems are still used where the ultimate in reliability is required such as in aviation engines.|$|E

40|$|Higher spatial {{resolution}} imaging {{is required for}} smaller monkey brains compared to those of humans in order to reveal equivalent anatomical detail. In turn, increased signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio is needed to support the smaller voxel sizes. Although conventional phased-array coils (Roemer, 1990) offer {{a significant increase in}} SNR, the arrays never reach their full potential due to the distance between the coil and the monkey brain. Here we describe the design and use of an implanted 8 -channel phased-array coil on top of the monkey’s skull, embedded inside the acrylic headpost. This improves the SNR of monkey imaging without having to rely on high field scanners. Moreover, this approach does not require additional invasive procedures and has the advantage that, across days, the imaged tissue is always at a fixed position relative to the receive coils. The coil array consisted of a central loop surrounded by 7 loops and fits tightly around the skull of a monkey. Except for the copper wires and connectors, no electrical components were used on the implanted part of the array. The array was implanted on top of the skull of the monkey underneath the headpost and was covered with dental acrylic. The external matching and detuning circuit components were positioned on detachable circuit boards. In an anesthetized macaque, we compared the SNR performance of the implanted array to that of several <b>external</b> <b>coils</b> (1 -, 4 -, and 8 -channels). The data show a 3. 8 -, 3. 0, and 2. 7 -fold increase in SNR in the brain compared to an external 1, 4, and 8 -channel coil, respectively. Furthermore, fMRI with 500 μm isotropic voxels, structural imaging (MPRAGE) with 200 µm isotropic voxels, and diffusion-weighted imaging with 700 µm isotropic voxels was performed and confirmed the superior SNR obtained with implanted coils relative to monkey imaging at 3 Tesla using 4 or 8 -channel <b>external</b> <b>coils.</b> In conclusion, significant improvements in SNR were obtained compared to <b>external</b> <b>coils.</b> The use of the implanted array coils for macaque MRI allows very high {{spatial resolution}} imaging (an improvement of roughly 1 log unit), while retaining the SNR in structural imaging and functional fMRI at 3 T relative to previous approaches. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{a repeat of the}} post First World War economic recession, GM started the [...] "Chevrolet Cadet" [...] project (a compact car intended to sell for less than [...] ), that ran from 1945 to 1947, to extend the Chevrolet range downwards in the U.S. new car market. Chevrolet head of engineering Earle S. MacPherson was in charge of development. It had a unibody structure, an over-square over head valve engine, a strut-type front suspension, small-diameter road wheels, a three-speed gearbox, brake and clutch pedals suspended from the bulkhead rather than floor-mounted, and integrated fender/body styling. It was light and technically advanced, but GM's management cancelled it, stating that it was not economically viable. The anticipated post Second World War U.S. car market recession hadn't materialised. The MacPherson strut, probably the world's most common form of independent suspension, evolved in the GM Cadet project by combining long tubular shock absorbers with <b>external</b> <b>coil</b> springs, and locating them in tall towers that directed the vertical travel of the wheels and also formed the [...] "king pin" [...] or [...] "swivel pin axis" [...] around which the front wheels could turn. It was elegantly simple, with just three links holding the wheel in place - the strut itself, the single-piece transverse lower arm, and the anti-roll bar that doubled as a drag link for the wheel hub. MacPherson took his ideas to Ford instead. They were first used in the French 1948 Ford Vedette. Next in the 1950 British Ford Consul and Zephyr (British mid-size cars, {{the same size as the}} Cadet), which owed more to the Cadet than just the MacPherson strut suspension, and caused a sensation when they were launched. In 1953, a miniaturised economy car version, the Anglia 100E was launched in Britain.|$|E
