5000|$|At {{the time}} of the passage of COGSA the {{customary}} <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> for most cargo was the [...] "revenue ton" [...] - the number of long tons (2240 lb, 1017 kg) or measurement tons (100 cubic feet) that would produce the most revenue for the shipowner. For example, a cargo of aluminium ingots, which were not packaged for shipment, would be heavy and dense, so the customary <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> for aluminum ingots would be the long ton, a measurement of weight. By comparison, a shipment of canoes, which were not packaged for shipment, would be light but would take up a large volume, ensuring the customary <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> would be the measurement ton of [...] If a canoe were 2 ft wide by 2 ft high by 10 ft long (0.6 m x 0.6 m x 3 m), its measurement would be 40 cubic feet (2 x 2 x 10) which would be one measurement ton (anything less than 100 would be 1 by default) and hence the limitation would be $500 per canoe.|$|E
5000|$|The courts, {{possibly}} {{believing that}} Congress' approach was too cumbersome, jettisoned the word [...] "customary" [...] from the phrase [...] "customary freight unit" [...] {{and decided that}} whatever <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> the shipowner applied would be the <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> for determining the limitation on liability. Again, seeing an opportunity to limit their liability for cargo damage, shipowners began freighting all cargo by unit, rather than by units of weight or measurement. Consequently, an automobile which might have a volume of 400 cubic feet (15 m3), or 4 measurement tons, which would previously entitle the carrier to a limitation of $2000, was now freighted as [...] "one automobile" [...] thereby reducing the shipowner's liability from $2000 per automobile to $500.|$|E

50|$|The {{three main}} {{categories}} of locomotives are often subdivided in their usage in rail transport operations. There are passenger locomotives, freight locomotives and switcher (or shunting) locomotives. These categories determine the locomotive's combination of physical size, {{starting tractive effort}} and maximum permitted speed. Freight locomotives are normally designed to deliver high starting tractive effort—needed to start trains that may weigh as much as 15,000 LT—and deliver sustained high power, at the sacrifice of maximum speed. Passenger locomotives develop less starting tractive effort but are able to operate at the high speeds demanded by passenger schedules. Mixed traffic locomotives (US English: general purpose or road switcher locomotives) are built to provide elements of both requirements. They do not develop as much starting tractive effort as a <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> but are able to haul heavier trains than a passenger engine.|$|E

50|$|The two RSD-7 demonstrators were {{significant}} for Alco. They were built {{with the intention}} of challenging the Fairbanks-Morse Train Master H24-66. When built in early 1954 the RSD-7 delivered the highest continuous tractive effort of all diesel locomotives then available. The RSD-7 offered 75% more dynamic braking capacity than any standard <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> available at the time. The superlatives of the RSD-7 allowed two units to do the work of three conventional 4-motor units. The dynamic brake system was mounted on top the long hood, leaving room in the short hood for a steam generator. The RSD-7 was the first Alco built with the notched corner sand fills. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the coiled air brake intercoolers mounted just above and ahead of the radiator intakes. The RSD-7 was the first Alco to use the then new Model 710 water cooled turbocharger in a 16-cylinder engine. The two demonstrators were numbered DL600 and DL601. The DL600 weighed 360,000 pounds at the standard 60,000 pounds per axle. The DL601 weighed 390,000 to test the gains in adhesion from the extra weight. Additional experimentation by Alco used new fuel injection pumps and nozzles, increased fuel rack settings, and an aftercooler was applied to reduce engine air inlet temperature. The aftercooler allowed higher density inlet air into the engine that promoted greater fuel burning efficiency. The aftercooler became the feature that allowed the 244 to be pushed to 2400 horsepower and the designation of 244H. The 244H is also known as the Alco 250 engine to disassociate it from the troubled 244 engine series. The maroon, yellow and gray painted RSD-7 demonstrators began a 23-railroad, 50,000 mile demonstration tour in the Spring of 1954. The tour concluded in September 1954 and the two units were refurbished before sale to the Santa Fe.|$|E

50|$|After declaring country’s {{independence}} in 1921, the country started to develop under MPP and People’s Government’s multifaceted progressive socio-economic policy. The special regulation {{to establish a}} public school was approved by People’s government on August 14, 1921 and the Ministry of Home Affairs set up a special department in charge of schools and enlightenment on August 31, 1921. On November 2, 1921, the first 3-year state-run school was established in capital city which set the basis for literacy for all. The establishment of the Institute of Manuscripts on November 19, 1921, served {{as the beginning of}} scientific organizations of Mongolia. As national trade was considered to be vital to the revival of economy The Mongolian Cooperative for Mutual Assistance was founded with 70 members. The circulation of the new national currency in 1925, marked the birth of Mongolia’s banking and taxation system. Since 1925, carpet-weaving, wood processing, iron smelting brick and gypsum plants were established, the Nalaikh coal mine, power plant and the leather factory in Altanbulag was expanded. Small-scale hand-craft cooperatives met domestic demand for goods such as clothing. All these laid down the beginning of qualitative change in the economic system of Mongolia. Since the establishment of People’s Government in 1921, the country abandoned its old court system which had used harsh interrogation methods and corporal punishment, introducing a new penitentiary and re-education centers. With the view of fostering culture and arts in Mongolia, the People’s government established the Sukhbaatar Club in 1924, thus laying the foundations of national cultural and art organizations. In 1925, clubs were established in several provinces while mobile red gers were put into operation to promote culture and education among the general public this enabling people to have access to books and newspapers, cinema etc. On March 25, 1921, the People’s Provisional Government issued a resolution to establish the unit to treat patients in the military facilities which began providing free medical treatment to the military and civilians, thus beginning the modern health system in the country. In 1930, the People’s Health Ministry was established and the state policies and activities on health started to be implemented. The first national radio broadcasting was aired on September 1, 1934. The establishment of the Communications unit in the capital city in 1921 laid down the foundation for Mongolian Communications. In 1925 a flight between Troyitskosavsk and Ulaanbaatar was launched, paving the way for Mongolian air forces and civil aviation. The establishment of the State <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> in July, 1925 laid down the foundation for automobile transportation. In 1940-1960, the Mongolian People’s Revolutionary Party intensified its activities to develop the country by implementing a series of important projects with the view to re-organizing the agricultural sector into a system of cooperatives and gradually develop other sectors of the economy of strategic importance in planned method. The 11th Congress of the MPP, held in December 1947, approved the first 5-year plan of the country with the objectives to intensify the development of the economy, industries, animal husbandry and agriculture through series of stages. The decision of the 3rd Plenum of the Central Committee of MPP to cultivate untouched land enabled the country to produce wheat which met nation’s domestic needs.|$|E

40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} from maritime transport represent 3. 3 % of global anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. These emissions are forecasted {{to increase by}} 150 % - 250 % up to 2050, due to increased freight volumes (Buhaug et al., 2009). Fulfilling anticipated climate requirements (IPCC, 2007) could require the sector to reduce emissions per <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> transported {{by a factor of}} five or six. This thesis, focus on strategies and measures for reducing maritime CO 2 emissions within the maritime sector. These emissions can also be reduced outside the sector through market based measures (MBM) by buying emission quotas, which basically means that the shipping sector pays other sectors for reducing their emissions. New and emerging technologies can also contribute to emission reductions. However the objective of this work has been to focus on reducing emission through improving energy efficiency. One of the objectives for this research, has been to investigate if the available strategies and measures for improving energy efficiency on its own could enable emission reductions by up to 85 % per <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> transported by 2050, which is a substantial challenge. The question is thus how to realize the required greenhouse gas reductions, {{and at the same time}} meet sea-transport system mission objectives. A fundamental criterion for enabling this has been to establish the main drivers for making ships more energy efficient and environmentally friendly, and the relationship between the main drivers. The methodological strategy to achieve this has been to include both the micro and macro perspective of shipping. This thesis consists of three parts. The first part contains: an introduction to maritime transport and emission reductions; the state of the art study; the context for my research and the introduction to my journal papers.

40|$|Optimizing the {{performance}} of multimodal freight transport networks involves adequately balancing the interplay between costs, volumes, times of departure and arrival, and times of travel. In order to study this interplay, we propose an assignment model that is able to efficiently determine flows and costs in a multimodal network. The model {{is based on a}} so-called user equilibrium principle, which is at the basis of Dynamic Traffic Assignment problems. This principle takes into account transport demands to be shipped using vehicles that transport single <b>freight</b> <b>units</b> (such as trucks) or multiple <b>freight</b> <b>units</b> (such as trains and barges, where demand should be bundled to reach efficient operations). Given a particular demand, the proposed model provides an assignment of the demand over the available modes of transport. The outcome of the model, i. e., the equilibrium point, minimizes users’ generalized costs, expressed as a function of mode, travel time and related congestion, and waiting time for bundling sufficient demand in order to fill a vehicle. The model deals with these issues across a doubly-dynamic time scale and in an integrated manner. One dynamic involves a learning dynamic converging towards an equilibrium (day-to-day) situation, reflecting the reaction of the players towards the action of the others. Another dynamic considers the possible departure time that results in minimum expected costs, also {{due to the fact that}} players mutually influence each other on the choice of departure times, due to congestion effects and costs for early/late arrival of <b>freight</b> <b>units.</b> This is a choice within a given time horizon such as a day or a week. We present a study on the influence and sensitivity of different model parameters, in order to analyse the implications on strategic decisions, fostering a target modal share for freight transportation. We also study under which conditions the different modes can be substitutes for each other. Marine and Transport TechnologyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCO 2 {{emissions}} from maritime transport represent 3. 3 % of the world's total CO 2 emissions and are forecast {{to increase by}} 150 %– 250 % by 2050, due to increased freight volumes (Second IMO GHG study, 2009). Fulfilling anticipated climate requirements (IPCC, 2007) could require the sector to reduce emissions per <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> {{by a factor of}} five or six. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) is currently debating technical, operational and market-based measures for reducing greenhouse gas {{emissions from}} shipping. This paper also investigates the effects of economies of scale on the direct emissions and costs of maritime transport. We compared emissions from the current fleet (2007), with what can be achieved by increasing average vessel size. The comparison is based on the 2007 levels of trade and predictions for 2050. The results show that emissions can be reduced by up to 30 % at a negative abatement cost per ton of CO 2 by replacing the existing fleet with larger vessels. Replacing the whole fleet might take as long as 25 years, so the reduction in emissions will be achieved gradually as the current fleet is renewed...|$|E
40|$|CO 2 {{emissions}} from maritime transport represent around 3 % of total annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These emissions {{are assumed to}} increase by 150 – 250 % in 2050 in business-as-usual scenarios with a tripling of world trade, while achieving a 1. 5 – 2 °C climate target requires net zero GHG emissions across all economic sectors. Consequentially, the maritime sector is facing the challenge to significantly reduce its GHG emissions as contribution to the international ambition to limit the effects of climate change. This article {{presents the results of}} a review of around 150 studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of the CO 2 emissions reduction potentials and measures published in literature. It aims to identify the most promising areas, i. e. technologies and operational practices, and quantify the combined mitigation potential. Results show a significant variation in reported CO 2 reduction potentials across reviewed studies. In addition, no single measure is sufficient to achieve meaningful GHG reductions. Emissions can be reduced by more than 75 %, based on current technologies and by 2050, through a combination of measures if policies and regulations are focused on achieving these reductions. In terms of emissions per <b>freight</b> <b>unit</b> transported, it is possible to reduce emissions by a factor of 4 – 6...|$|E
