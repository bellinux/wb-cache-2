40|$|National Natural Science Foundation of China [31070522]; Program for New Century Excellent Talents in University [NCET- 07 - 0725]Fruit {{stones and}} pericarps of Litchi chinensis, waste {{products}} of the food, were studied {{as a source of}} polymeric proanthocyanidins. The structures of the polymeric proanthocyanidins isolated from Litchi chinensis were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) coupled with high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS) analysis. The spectra obtained through MALDI-TOF MS analysis revealed that the dominant A-type procyanidin polymers occurred in each polymer length with one or more A-type linkages. The polymeric proanthocyanidins of litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> exhibited longer polymer length than those of fruit pericarps, with polymerization degrees up to 20 and 11 for <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> and pericarps, respectively. After depolymerization with toluene-a-thiol, HPLC-ESI-MS analysis showed that epicatechin and A-type dimer were the major constituent units, and the mean polymerization degrees were 15. 4 and 5. 8 for polymeric proanthocyanidins of <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> and pericarps, respectively. The antioxidant properties investigated using DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods showed that the higher polymerization degree of polymeric proanthocyanidins from litchi <b>fruit</b> <b>stones</b> exhibited higher antioxidant activities than those from litchi pericarps.

Their structures were analyzed and elucidated by methods of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and high performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS). The results demonstrated that these compounds are complicated mixtures of homo- and heteropolymers consisting of procyanidin/procyanidin gallate and prodelphinidin. They possessed structural heterogeneity in monomer units, polymer length, and interflavan linkage (A-type and B-type). Their antityrosinase and antioxidant activity were then investigated.

50|$|Plant macrofossils are {{preserved}} through four main modes of preservation at archaeological sites. First, plant remains, usually cereal grains, chaff, seeds and charcoal are largely reduced to elemental carbon (charred) {{when they are}} heated in a reducing atmosphere. These {{are referred to as}} 'charred' or 'carbonised' plant remains. This mode of preservation is biased towards plant remains that come into contact with fire, through cooking or fuel use, and those which are less fragile, such as cereal grains and nutshell. Second, plant remains deposited in permanently waterlogged anoxic conditions {{are preserved}} as the absence of oxygen prohibits microbial activity. This mode of preservation occurs in deep archaeological features such as wells, in urban settlements where organic refuse is rapidly deposited, and at settlements adjacent to lakes or rivers. A wide range of plant remains are usually preserved, including seeds, <b>fruit</b> <b>stones,</b> nutshells, leaves, straw and other vegetative material. Third, calcium-phosphate mineralisation of plant remains occurs usually in latrine pits and in middens, as plant remains are completely replaced by calcium-phosphate. In latrine pits, plant remains which have been consumed by humans are the most common items, such as seeds of flavourings, fruit pips and <b>fruit</b> <b>stones.</b> Finally, plant remains are preserved by desiccation in arid environments, where the absence of water limits decomposition. Delicate vegetative plant remains are preserved, such as onion skin and artichoke bracts, alongside <b>fruit</b> <b>stones,</b> cereal chaff and seeds of wild plants.|$|R
