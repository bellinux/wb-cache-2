5|$|Both McLuhan and Innis {{assume the}} {{centrality}} of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, {{and because of the}} close proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E

When his opportunity did come, Alan proved a real stalwart. In addition, his Trumperian style must have influenced for good vast numbers of young boys. Unquestionably, the line of Trumper and Kippax <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with the grace and elegance which is more frequently associated with players from NSW than from other States.|$|E

25|$|The Western Theater {{typically}} receives {{less attention}} than the Eastern Theater. This <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> {{do with the}} greater proximity of action in the east to capitals and to major population centers. However, some historians consider it the war's most important theater. While the Eastern Theater essentially remained in stalemate until 1864, Union troops in the west, beginning in 1861, were able to steadily surround and drive back the Confederate troops, forcing them into eventual capitulation. This was done through a steady series of Union victories in major battles, interrupted by only a single defeat, which took place at Chickamauga.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrine}} of the limited scope (or extent) of the atonement is intimately tied up with the {{doctrine of}} the nature of the atonement. It also <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with the general Calvinist view of predestination. Calvinists advocate the satisfaction theory of the atonement, which developed in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury and Thomas Aquinas. In brief, the Calvinistic refinement of this theory, known as penal substitution, states that the atonement of Christ pays the penalty incurred by the sins of menthat is, Christ receives the wrath of God for sins and thereby receives in himself the penalty of the sins of men.|$|E

25|$|Thus, Kumar {{sees the}} task of {{scholars}} of media and culture as twofold: “to explain and critique the state of culture and society, and then to act upon the world to change it. In taking up this challenge, classical Marxism {{as a guide to}} action <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> offer” (85). In addition, this type of work is possible according to Kumar due to the contradictory nature of media: “Media texts are contradictory, as all reality is contradictory. And contradiction allows for change within the totality of social relations. This change is the product of human beings resisting their conditions of oppression and exploitation” (p.84).|$|E
25|$|Newer {{versions}} of the firmware contain the option to choose between five overclock ("turbo") presets that when used, attempt to maximize {{the performance of the}} SoC without impairing the lifetime of the board. This is done by monitoring the core temperature of the chip, the CPU load, and dynamically adjusting clock speeds and the core voltage. When the demand is low on the CPU or it is running too hot the performance is throttled, but if the CPU <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do and the chip's temperature is acceptable, performance is temporarily increased with clock speeds of up to 1GHz depending on the individual board and on which of the turbo settings is used.|$|E
25|$|Psychology <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> discuss about pseudoscience thinking, {{as it is}} the illusory {{perceptions}} of causality and effectiveness of numerous individuals that needs to be illuminated. Research suggests that illusionary thinking happens in most people when exposed to certain circumstances such as reading a book, an advertisement or the testimony of others are the basis of pseudoscience beliefs. It is assumed that illusions are not unusual, and given the right conditions, illusions are able to occur systematically even in normal emotional situations. One of the things pseudoscience believers quibble most about is that academic science usually treats them as fools. Minimizing these illusions in the real world is not simple. To this aim, designing evidence-based educational programs can be effective to help people identify and reduce their own illusions.|$|E

25|$|In the Short Parliament {{that started}} on 13 April 1640, Hampden stood forth amongst the leaders. He guided the House {{in the debate}} on 4 May in its {{opposition}} to the grant of twelve subsidies {{in return for the}} surrender of ship money. Parliament was dissolved the next day, and on 6 May an unsuccessful search was made among the papers of Hampden and of other chiefs of the party to discover incriminating correspondence with the Scots. During the eventful months which followed, when Strafford was striving in vain to force England, in spite of its visible reluctance, to support the king in his Scottish war, rumour <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> tell of Hampden's activity in rousing opposition. It is likely enough that the rumour is in the main true, but we are not possessed of any satisfactory evidence on the subject.|$|E
25|$|The Bundahishn, a Zoroastrian {{account of}} {{creation}} {{completed in the}} 12th century <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say about Ahriman and {{his role in the}} cosmogony. In chapter 1.23, following the recitation of the Ahuna Vairya, Ohrmuzd takes advantage of Ahriman's incapacity to create life without intervention. When Ahriman recovers, he creates Jeh, the primal whore who afflicts women with their menstrual cycles. In Bundahishn 4.12, Ahriman perceives that Ohrmuzd is superior to himself, and so flees to fashion his many demons with which to conquer the universe in battle. The entire universe is finally divided between the Ohrmuzd and the yazads on one side and Ahriman with his devs on the other. Ahriman slays the primal bull, but the moon rescues the seed of the dying creature, and from it springs all animal creation. But the battle goes on, with mankind caught in the middle, whose duty it remains to withstand the forces of evil through good thoughts, words and deeds.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin of Tudela visited Aleppo in 1173, when {{he found}} a Jewish {{community}} of 1,500 (or on another reading 5,000) souls with three noteworthy rabbis attending to their spiritual needs: Moses Alconstantini, Israel, and Seth. Petaִhiah of Regensburg was there between 1170 and 1180, and Alִharizi fifty years later. The former calls the citadel the palace of King Nour-ed-din, and says that there were 1,500 Jews in Aleppo, of whom the chief men were Rabbis Moses Alconstantini, Israel, and Seth. Yehuda Alharizi, author of the Taִhkemoni <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> say in praise of the Aleppo Jews. In 1195 the leading Jew was Joseph ben Judah, who had migrated from the Maghreb by way of Egypt, {{where he was the}} friend of Maimonides, who wrote for him the Guide for the Perplexed. Other men of learning were Azariah and his brother Samuel Nissim, the king's physician Eleazer, Jeshua, Jachin Hananiah, and Joseph ben ִHisdai. Although he respected them far more than their Damascene counterparts, Alharizi thought little of the Aleppo poets, of whom he mentions Moses Daniel and a certain Joseph; the best was Joseph ben Tsemah, who had good qualities but wrote bad verse. Their piety must have been extreme, for Eleazer is held up to scorn for having traveled on the Sabbath, although at the sultan's command. Alharizi died in Aleppo and was buried there.|$|E

500|$|During the 20th century, Virginia Radley {{declares}} that Reflections [...] "although not so striking in imagery {{as is the}} 'Eolian Harp,' still <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> recommend it in this respect [...] The impression left with the reader that the cottage and its surroundings are inestimably lovely, quiet, and peaceful is a paramount one, while the dead lines [...] do not move the reader at all, except to make him wonder if the move from Clevedon {{for the cause of}} humanity was a necessary one." [...] Richard Haven argues that the poem's image of the moral path is weak because [...] "the returned traveller can only dismiss his ascent to another mode of being as a pleasant but useless memory".|$|E
500|$|Maxwell's {{purpose in}} {{constructing}} this analogy {{was not to}} represent mechanical systems in terms of electrical networks. [...] Rather, it was to explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms. [...] As electrical phenomena became better understood the reverse of this analogy, using electrical analogies to explain mechanical systems, started to become more common. [...] Indeed, the lumped element abstract topology of electrical analysis <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> offer problems in the mechanical domain, and other energy domains for that matter. [...] By 1900 the electrical analogy of the mechanical domain was becoming commonplace. [...] From about 1920 the electrical analogy became a standard analysis tool. [...] Vannevar Bush was a pioneer {{of this kind of}} modelling in his development of analogue computers, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by Clifford A. Nickle.|$|E
500|$|Sebastian {{reflected}} on his song's popularity, [...] "I guess its success {{is due to}} it being a well-written pop ballad, coupled {{with the fact that}} it's perfectly suited to my voice, and also my back-story... It doesn't take a genius to realise that the show was mostly responsible for the songs enormity but still, I'm glad I was the guy standing there at the end singing it". In a review for Sebastian's fifth number one single [...] "Who's That Girl" [...] in 2010 The Vines Tim Byron said [...] "Angels Brought Me Here" [...] was [...] "heavily associated with the climax of the show, and thus [...] pre-packaged meanings and associations that other songs will not ... something of the joy of music, of its eternal mystery, gets leached out in the process". Byron felt there was considerable [...] "controversy over whether to give ARIA awards to people like Guy Sebastian" [...] due to concerns about the artist's credibility. Byron added [...] "But it's hard to argue that Guy Sebastian's continued success, seven years later, <b>has</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do with Australian Idol.....even his 'brand recognition' will have faded by now.....If he is still successful, it's more and more because of his musical talent." ...|$|E
