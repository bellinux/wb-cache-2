5|$|Five weeks later, Oxbow {{was entered}} in the Grade II mile and one-sixteenth (1,700m) Risen Star Stakes. Ridden {{for the third time}} by Jon Court, Oxbow was {{assigned}} the far outside post at number ten, and was the second favorite at 4–1. He broke fifth from the gate, moved to third passing the stands, but lost ground by being five horses wide around the first turn. In the stretch, Oxbow took the lead but could not hold it and finished fourth, although he and the three top-placed horses all ended the race within a length and a half of each other <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> finish. The winner was I've Struck a Nerve, at odds of 135–1. Oxbow again progressed in performance, earning a speed figure of 98 and five more points toward Derby qualification.|$|E
5|$|Reich {{responded with}} a 25-page letter in which he tried to change Einstein's mind. To rule out the {{influence}} of convection he told Einstein {{that he had taken}} certain measures, including introducing a horizontal plate above the accumulator, wrapping it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket,</b> hanging it from the ceiling, burying it underground and placing it outside. He wrote that in all these circumstances the temperature difference remained, and was in fact more marked in the open air. Einstein did not respond to this or to Reich's future correspondence– Reich would write regularly reporting the results of his experiments– until Reich threatened three years later to publish their previous exchange. Einstein replied that he could not devote any further time to the matter and asked that his name not be misused for advertising purposes. Reich believed that Einstein's change of heart was part of a conspiracy of some kind, perhaps related to the communists or prompted by the rumours that Reich was ill. Reich published the correspondence in 1953 as The Einstein Affair.|$|E

5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been {{proposed}} to use the neutrons to breed additional fission fuel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> of nuclear waste, a concept known as a fission-fusion hybrid. In these systems, the power output is enhanced by the fission events, and power is extracted using systems like those in conventional fission reactors.|$|E

25|$|Numerous {{secondary}} bundle burials of {{the bones}} of individuals previously stored in a charnel house were also made into the mound. After a few final intrusive burials into the southwestern edge, Sub3 and Sub1 were covered over <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> of earth and given its distinctive ridgetop shape. All of the burials in the mound are located within an area circumscribed by the arc of the woodhenge circle. In total roughly 272 individuals had been interred in Mound 72. In all six separate episodes of burial had happened at the mound, stretching over roughly one hundred year period. Researchers theorize that this could represent the lineage of a prominent family along with many retainers and sacrifices. Scholars believe almost 62 percent of the over 270 people interred in the mound were sacrificial victims, based on signs of ritual execution, method of burial, and other factors.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} treat {{patients}} {{infected with the}} plague, various methods were used including sweating, bloodletting, forced vomiting, and urinating. Several symptoms of the illness included blotches, hardening of the glands under the groin and underarms, and dementia. Within the initial phase of the disease, bloodletting {{was performed on the}} same side of where the physical manifestations of the buboes or risings appeared. For instance, if a rising appeared on the right side of the groin the physician would bleed a vein in the ankle on the same side. In the case of sweating, it was achieved with such medicines as Mithridate, Venice-Treacle, Matthiolus, Bezoar-Water, Serpentary Roots and Electuarium de Ovo. Sweating was used when measures were desperate; if a patient had tokens, a severe version of risings, the physician would wrap the naked patient <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> drenched in cold water. This measure was only performed while the patient still had natural heat in his system. The desired effect was to make the patient sweat violently and thus purge all corruption from the blood which was caused by the disease.|$|E

500|$|... "Already Gone" [...] {{received}} universal {{critical acclaim}} and {{is regarded as}} one of the musical and lyrical highlights of All I Ever Wanted.

[...] He continues, [...] "she spits emotion and heart into a song that makes me want to curl up <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and long for someone". Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly said Clarkson [...] "knows that the anguish she likes to sing about is enjoyed by millions of people as grandiose admissions of vulnerability. Yet the music that delivers that message is anything but vulnerable. There's a reason they call them power ballads: a sad song blasted at full volume is a metaphor for finding strength in pain." [...] His point was echoed by Danton of [...] The Hartford Courant, who stated that Clarkson [...] "pours on the heartache", and by Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune, who called the song an [...] "extravagant ballad".|$|E

Some months later, Phemie, Eachann's girlfriend, is occasionally disturbed by elusive shadows she senses on the loch, which make her think of Murdoch, her former paramour. While she sat dreaming of Eachann one evening when staying at a sheiling near the loch, she sensed the flicker of a shadow behind her, except this time it was Murdoch. He promptly overpowered her by enveloping her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> and tying her hands. At that point, a water bull came to Phemie's rescue by knocking Murdoch to the ground. The bull then knelt down allowing Phemie to get on its back, before transporting her {{at the speed of light}} back to the home of her mother. The bull disappeared never to be seen again but a [...] "voice was heard in the air calling out loudly". The verse heard was in Gaelic, and translates as: ...|$|E

After the door was opened, Misch only took a quick [...] "glance". He saw Eva, with her legs drawn up, to Hitler's left on the sofa. Her eyes were open and she was dead. Hitler was also dead. He was either sitting on the sofa or in the armchair by it; his head [...] "had fallen forward slightly". Misch started to leave to report the events to Schädle, but then stopped and returned to the door of Hitler's study. By then Misch observed that Hitler's corpse had been removed from inside the study and wrapped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket.</b> Several men then picked it up and carried it past him. Misch left and reported the events to Schädle, who instructed him to return to his duty station. After returning to the telephone exchange, Misch later recalled Unterscharführer Retzbach proclaiming [...] "So they're burning the boss now!" [...] Retzbach asked Misch if he was going upstairs to watch the events, but Misch declined to go. Thereafter, Günsche came down and told Misch that the corpses of Hitler and Braun had been burned in the garden of the Reich Chancellery.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>blanket</b> were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith forced herself to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E
