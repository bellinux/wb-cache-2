5|$|In 1585 the Flemish {{mathematician}} Simon Stevin {{published a}} small pamphlet called De Theinde ("the tenth"). Decimal fractions had been employed for {{the extraction of}} square roots some five centuries before his time, but nobody used decimal numbers in daily life. Stevin declared that using <b>decimals</b> was so important that the universal introduction of decimal weights, measures and coinage {{was only a matter}} of time.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{proposed}} that the U.S. dollar should have fractional coins using <b>decimals,</b> rather than eighths like the Spanish coinage. This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, for reducing {{the cost of living}} for the poor. One of his main objectives was for the general public to become accustomed to handling money on a frequent basis.|$|E
5|$|Newton is {{generally}} {{credited with the}} generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions {{to the theory of}} finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula) and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. Newton's work on infinite series was inspired by Simon Stevin's <b>decimals.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A <b>decimal</b> numeral, or just <b>decimal,</b> or, {{improperly}} <b>decimal</b> number, refers {{generally to}} the notation {{of a number}} in the <b>decimal</b> system, which contains a <b>decimal</b> separator (for example 10.00 or 3.14159). Sometimes these terms are used for the any numeral in the <b>decimal</b> system.

5|$|The Decimal Classification {{introduced}} {{the concepts of}} relative location and relative index which allow new books {{to be added to}} a library in their appropriate location based on subject. Libraries previously had given books permanent shelf locations that were related to the order of acquisition rather than topic. The classification's notation makes use of three-digit Arabic numerals for main classes, with fractional <b>decimals</b> allowing expansion for further detail. Using Arabic numerals for symbols, it is flexible to the degree that numbers can be expanded in linear fashion to cover special aspects of general subjects. A library assigns a classification number that unambiguously locates a particular volume in a position relative to other books in the library, {{on the basis of its}} subject. The number makes it possible to find any book and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves. The classification system is used in 200,000 libraries in at least 135 countries.|$|E
5|$|The Jiuzhang suanshu {{was perhaps}} the most {{groundbreaking}} of the three surviving Han treatises. It is the first known book to feature negative numbers, along with the Bakhshali manuscript (200 CE?– 600 CE?) of India and the book of the Greek mathematician Diophantus (fl. 3rd century) written in about 275 CE. Negative numbers appeared as black counting rods, while positive numbers appeared as red counting rods. Although the decimal system existed in China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600– c. 1050 BCE), the earliest evidence of a decimal fraction (i.e. the denominator is a power of ten) is an inscription on a standard volume-measuring vessel dated 5 CE and used by the mathematician and astronomer Liu Xin (46 BCE– 23 CE). Yet the first book to feature decimal fractions was the Jiuzhang suanshu, as a means to solve equations and represent measurements. Gaussian elimination, an algorithm used to solve linear equations, was known as the Array Rule in the Jiuzhang suanshu. While the book used continued fractions to find the roots of equations, Liu Hui built on this idea in the 3rd century when he increased the <b>decimals</b> to find the cube root of 1,860,867 (yielding the answer 123), the same method used in the Horner scheme named after William George Horner (1786–1837).|$|E

40|$|<b>Decimal</b> {{arithmetic}} {{has gained}} high {{impact on the}} overall performance of today’s financial and commercial applications. <b>Decimal</b> arithmetic is pervasive in human-oriented applications but has a limited use in numerical data processing. <b>Decimal</b> additions and multiplication plays a main role in <b>decimal</b> operations which is used in any <b>decimal</b> arithmetic algorithm. <b>Decimal</b> digit adders and <b>decimal</b> digit multipliers are usually the building blocks for higher order <b>decimal</b> adders and multipliers. FPGAs provide an efficient hardware platform that can be employed for accelerating <b>decimal</b> algorithms. In this paper, different designs for two <b>decimal</b> digit adders and one <b>decimal</b> digit multiplier are proposed.

50|$|To {{change a}} common {{fraction}} to a <b>decimal,</b> divide the denominator into the numerator. Round {{the answer to}} the desired accuracy. For example, to change ¼ to a <b>decimal,</b> divide 4 into 1.00, to obtain 0.25. To change ⅓ to a <b>decimal,</b> divide 3 into 1.0000..., and stop when the desired accuracy is obtained. Note that ¼ can be written exactly with two <b>decimal</b> digits, while ⅓ cannot be written exactly with any finite number of <b>decimal</b> digits.To change a <b>decimal</b> to a fraction, write in the denominator a 1 followed by as many zeroes as there are digits {{to the right of the}} <b>decimal</b> point, and write in the numerator all the digits in the original <b>decimal,</b> omitting the <b>decimal</b> point. Thus 12.3456 = 123456/10000.|$|R
5000|$|During the French Revolution in 1793, in {{connection}} with its Republican calendar, France attempted to introduce a <b>decimal</b> time system.

Therefore, the <b>decimal</b> hour was {{more than twice as}} long (144 min) as the present hour, the <b>decimal</b> minute was slightly longer than the present minute (86 seconds) and the <b>decimal</b> second was slightly shorter (0.86 sec) than the present second. Clocks were manufactured with this alternate face, usually combined with traditional hour markings. However, it didn't catch on, and France discontinued the mandatory use of <b>decimal</b> time on 7 April 1795, although some French cities used <b>decimal</b> time until 1801.|$|R

25|$|The square {{roots of}} the perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, etc.) are integers. In all other cases, the square roots of {{positive}} integers are irrational numbers, and therefore their decimal representations are non-repeating <b>decimals.</b>|$|E

25|$|Decimal numbers, while arguably {{more useful}} to work with when {{performing}} calculations, sometimes lack the precision that common fractions have.

25|$|The cyclic {{behavior}} of repeating <b>decimals</b> in multiplication also {{leads to the}} construction of integers which are cyclically permuted when multiplied by certain numbers.

25|$|The integer part, or {{integral}} part of a <b>decimal</b> is the integer written {{to the left of}} the <b>decimal</b> separator (see also truncation).

50|$|Several {{characters}} in Unicode {{can serve as}} a <b>decimal</b> separator depending on the locale. <b>Decimal</b> fractions are represented in text as a sequence of <b>decimal</b> digit numerals with a <b>decimal</b> separator separating the whole-number portion from the fractional portion. For example, the <b>decimal</b> fraction for “¼” is expressed as zero-point-two-five (“0.25”). Unicode has no dedicated general <b>decimal</b> separator but unifies the <b>decimal</b> separator function with other punctuation characters. So the “.” used in “0.25” is the same period character used to end the sentence. However, cultures vary in the glyph or grapheme used for a <b>decimal</b> separator. So in some locales, the comma may be used instead ”0,25”. Still other locales use a space for “0 25”. The Arabic writing system includes a dedicated character for a <b>decimal</b> separator that looks much like a comma ”٫” (U+066B) which when combined with the Arabic graphemes for the Arabic-Indic <b>decimal</b> digits to express one-quarter appears as: “٠٫٢٥”.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{non-integral}} values, such as <b>decimal</b> 0.2, have {{an infinite}} place-value representation in binary (.001100110011...) {{but have a}} finite place-value in binary-coded <b>decimal</b> (0.0010). Consequently, a system based on binary-coded <b>decimal</b> representations of <b>decimal</b> fractions avoids errors representing and calculating such values.|$|R
25|$|Fractional numbers {{can also}} be written without using {{explicit}} numerators or denominators, by using <b>decimals,</b> percent signs, or negative exponents (as in 0.01, 1%, and 10−2 respectively, {{all of which are}} equivalent to 1/100).

25|$|Informally, non-terminating <b>decimals</b> {{are easily}} understood, {{because it is}} clear that a real number can be {{approximated}} to any required degree of precision by a terminating decimal.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{parallel}} and digit-serial implementations of area-efficient 3 -operand <b>decimal</b> adders are proposed.

40|$|Binary Coded <b>Decimal</b> (BCD) {{in which}} four bits {{are used for}} each <b>decimal</b> digit is a widely used {{encoding}} for <b>decimal</b> data. <b>Decimal</b> arithmetic and shifting are simplified by using operands in this form, and both rounding to a specified number of digits and conversions to or from characters are trivial. For the storage and simple manipulation of <b>decimal</b> data, BCD remains an appropriate encoding to use. In some situations, however, a more compact representation offers significant advantages. <b>Decimal</b> floating-point numbers in a compact form {{can be used to}} implement the requirements of the IEEE 854 standard and meet the increasing demands for <b>decimal</b> arithmetic in applications. An efficient encoding scheme for <b>decimal</b> data is described by Chen and Ho.

Densely Packed <b>Decimal</b> (DPD) is an refinement of the Chen ho encoding. It gives the same compression and speed advantages but is not limited to multiples of three digits. The DPD encoding allows arbitrary-length <b>decimal</b> numbers to be coded efficiently while keeping <b>decimal</b> digit boundaries accessible.
