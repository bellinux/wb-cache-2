5000|$|The {{original}} Farmall {{is widely}} viewed as the first tractor to combine a set of traits that would define the row-crop tractor category, although competition in the category came quickly. Although {{it was not the}} first tractor to have any one of these traits, it was early in bringing the winning combination to market. The traits included (a) 'tricycle' [...] (a single front wheel or narrowly spaced pair), <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> quickly adjustable <b>axle</b> track, excellent visibility all around and under the machine, and light weight; (b) sufficient power for plowing and harrowing, and a belt pulley for belt work; and (c) all at low cost, with a familiar brand and an extensive distribution and service network. The first group of traits allowed for more nimble maneuvering and accurate cultivation than most other tractors of the day; additionally, because of the second group, the Farmall could also, like previous tractors, perform all the other duties a farmer would have previously achieved using a team of horses. A tractor could yield lower overall operating costs than horses {{as long as it was}} priced right and reliable (and its fuel supply as well). The Farmall, mass-produced with the same low-cost-and-high-value ethos as the Ford Model T or Fordson tractor, could meet that requirement. The Farmall was thus similar to a Fordson in its capabilities and affordability, but with better cultivating ability.|$|R

50|$|It is {{relatively}} affordable {{in the markets}} where sold when compared to four-wheel drive vehicles (the Kijang is a rear-wheel drive) and features high seating capacity, <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> and rugged suspension, popular features in an area with generally poor road conditions and large extended families.|$|R
50|$|An {{additional}} {{issue is}} that rollover is a greater risk with the Stryker relative to other transport vehicles, due to its higher center of gravity. The <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> however, is likely to reduce {{the damage caused by}} land mines and improvised explosive devices on the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|The second {{generation}} Hyundai i20 supermini {{has a new}} exterior and interior design, and a new 1.4 litre diesel engine. The car also has a <b>higher</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> than before, 170mm as against 165mm of the old i20. The i20 has 285 litres of boot space.|$|R
50|$|SUVs {{are known}} for <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> upright, boxy body, and high H-point. This can make them more likely to roll over due to their high center of gravity. Bodies of SUVs have {{recently}} become more aerodynamic, but the sheer size and weight keeps their fuel economy poor.|$|R
50|$|The Nemo {{was further}} tested in an {{ammunition}} trailer prototype equipped with Nemo driven posterior axle; the brakes were {{built into the}} fore axle.

25|$|Sport utility {{vehicles}} are off-road vehicles with four-wheel drive and true off-road capability. They most often feature <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> and an upright, boxy body design. Sport Utilities are typically {{defined by a}} body on frame construction which offers more off-road capability but reduced on-road ride comfort and handling compared to a cross-over or car based utility vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|In 1921 Norton {{launched}} the 'Colonial' {{which was a}} Model 16 with <b>higher</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> for use on poor quality roads, and designated the UK model as the 16H (for 'Home').

The Street 750 weighs 218kg and has a <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> of 144mm giving it the lowest weight and the <b>highest</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> of Harley-Davidson motorcycles currently available.|$|R
50|$|Access to {{the canyon}} is either by a strenuous seven mile hike from the Pollack Bench trailhead {{or by the}} Black Ridge access roads. The latter are reached via the {{adjacent}} Colorado National Monument. These dirt roads are open seasonally and should only be attempted in a <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> four wheel drive vehicle under dry conditions due to steep, rocky grades.|$|R
50|$|The paved {{main road}} allows {{visitors}} {{to drive to}} major attractions and through the park. The unpaved roads may require a vehicle with <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance,</b> and four-wheel drive. An example is the Geology Tour Road {{in the center of}} the park. Visitors with a four-wheel drive vehicle can use this road for a self-guided tour with stops that describe the region's geology.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{previous}} Land Rovers, {{this car}} is {{manufactured in the}} Halewood Body & Assembly facility, near Liverpool, and was until 2009 manufactured alongside the Jaguar X-Type as Jaguar X-Type and Landrover Freelander both used modified version of Ford's front wheel drive platform. The new Freelander features <b>higher</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> and off-road capabilities that are closer to other Land Rover models.|$|R
2500|$|The Countryman has {{a longer}} wheelbase, more {{interior}} room, and <b>higher</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> than the Clubman. It {{uses the same}} engines as the Hatch/Clubman range, but with an optional all-wheel-drive powertrain (dubbed [...] "ALL4") to allow minimal off-road and rugged terrain driving. A six-speed manual transmission is standard on all models, with automatic transmission available on all petrol and diesel models except the 90bhp One D.|$|R
50|$|Current {{accommodation}} {{consists of}} chalets at Mashatu camp, Tamboti tented bush camp, Modumele Wilderness Camp and Molope Camp. A vehicle with <b>high</b> <b>ground</b> <b>clearance</b> is needed, {{especially for the}} southern part. Although it is an ideal stop over for the Tuli Block in Botswana, the Mapungubwe National Park in Zimbabwe or {{the northern part of}} Kruger Park, the reserve is worth a proper visit even by itself.|$|R
