40|$|The tonus of {{the muscles}} of {{heliotropic}} insects is due chiefly to the action of light; it is markedly decreased in the dark. Each eye controls the tonus of a different group of muscles {{on both sides of}} the body. Different areas of each eye likewise are related to the tonus of different muscle groups, and the relationship is entirely analogous to that of the otic labyrinth of vertebrates. Asymmetrical conditions of muscle tension are produced by any procedure which establishes an unequal photochemical reaction in the two eyes, by difference in illumination, by partial or complete blackening of one eye, or establishing unequal sensitiveness in the two eyes. The unbalanced condition of muscle tonus expresses itself in unusual postures of the resting insects, and in movements in forced paths—circus motions when one eye has been blackened. These reactions vary directly with the intensity of the illumination, as shown not only by the variation in diameters of the circles, but also by the reactions of the insects on vertical surfaces and on the turntable. The relation of the results of these experiments to the problem of <b>heliotropic</b> <b>orientation</b> is too obvious to require detailed discussion, which could only lead to a repetition of the description of the mechanism f heliotropism which Loeb has so clearly expounded. The experiments are so completely in accordance with Loeb's muscle tension theory of heliotropism, that they are tantamount to a complete proof of it...|$|R

Recent work shows that crystalline orientation can be used to optimize PMOS and NMOS device performance. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of <b>device</b> <b>orientation</b> on the performance of width-quantized FinFET circuits that are sensitive to the β-ratio. We first extend mobility models to include (110) <b>orientation</b> <b>devices</b> and subsequently generate lean SPICE models for 45 nm and 13 nm FinFETs for both (100) and (110) orientations. Results from SPICE-based circuit simulations of read stability of an SRAM cell show that mixing (100) and (110) <b>device</b> <b>orientation</b> provides 24 % better read stability over (110) devices and 10 % better stability over (100) devices when all transistors are minimum-sized.

30|$|It is {{important}} to recognize the carrying position of an unconstrained smartphone accurately and robustly, since carrying positions may directly impact the parameter settings for step detection and step length estimation. Many previous works [24, 25] have pointed out that the acceleration patterns for different carrying positions show distinct features. The statistics of three dimensional raw measured acceleration samples are deployed as input features to develop the carrying position classifier. The developed classifiers are all designed upon relatively stable <b>device</b> <b>orientations.</b> If the <b>device</b> <b>orientations</b> are unconstrained, the raw measured acceleration samples may vary a lot with the changing orientations under the same carrying positions. As a result, these classifiers may render degraded recognition accuracy with the unconstrained uses of smartphones.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our {{approach}} to enable a single user to control a swarm of multiple unmanned micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) without significant cognitive effort. Since even moderately sized swarms exhibit several dozens of degrees of freedom, most of the control effort has to be off-loaded from the human to an autonomous swarm controller unit. The set of MAVs equipped with an on-board camera allows the simultaneous observation of a target from multiple perspectives. Since the MAVs can hover at a position but are also very agile, the perspective on the target can be maintained for fixed or mobile targets. A typical application is documentation or analysis of sportive outdoor activities, such as biking, skiing or climbing. We describe how the swarm controller unit determines and maintains the formation that satisfies all the perspectives specified by the user by using position and attitude information obtained from onboard inertial measurement units (IMUs) and GPS-receivers placed on the MAVs and the target. A device carried by the observed person acts as user interface and provides the target position using its built-in GPS sensor. The formation of the swarm can be defined with respect to different reference orientations. We describe three such reference orientations: geographic <b>orientation,</b> <b>device</b> <b>orientation</b> and <b>device</b> movement. We have validated our concept by carrying out two outdoor experiments. The first experiment included a single quadrotor, whose flight parameters were changed by user input during the experiment (“changing perspective”). In the second experiments the observed person additionally walked along a certain path, and a formation of four quadrotors was following and observing the person, (“changing perspective and moving user”) ...|$|R
30|$|Though a lot {{of works}} [7 – 14] {{have been done in}} {{integrating}} PDR with WiFi localization, some key problems remain to be solved to enhance reliability and applicability. Firstly, existing approaches always empirically set process and measurement noise parameters, whose inaccurate settings may render degraded performance. Secondly, most existing integrated localization approaches assumes that the device carrying positions and <b>device</b> <b>orientations</b> are fixed, such as held in hand [15, 16]. This assumption limits the applications of localization system using smartphones, whose carrying positions and orientations are always unconstrained.

30|$|Due to the {{changing}} <b>device</b> <b>orientations</b> caused by body locomotion, such as leg locomotion, it is inapplicable to compute user heading by {{the most commonly used}} device estimation approach [11], which adds heading offset to device heading. This is because the heading offset between device heading and user heading varies due to {{the changing}} <b>device</b> <b>orientations</b> and is difficult to be estimated. For a smartphone put in the pocket, uDirect approach [12] has been proposed by extracting walking direction in a specific region, where the walking direction dominates the acceleration vector. However, the specific region may be easily corrupted by body locomotion. In contrast, the PCA-based approaches [13] are more robust, since it exploits all samples in the walking step. Regardless of the changing <b>device</b> <b>orientations,</b> PCA may extract the walking direction along the maximum variations of the acceleration signals in the horizontal plane.|$|R

It is suggested that the use of the thermal heliotrope for solar array orientation could significantly reduce array cost, thereby increasing the competitive economic posture of solar arrays for terrestrial applications. The thermal heliotrope modified for terrestrial use is readily adaptable to orient solar energy concentrators, such as furnaces and stills...|$|R

The error between the accurate calculation model and the traditional model is analyzed by simulating. The simulation show that the modeling error is proportional to the tilt angle and the pitch angle, when the change of the tilt angle and the pitch angle is 1 °, the max change of the modeling error will be 3. 6701 ″.

The interactions between the blanket and the structure {{that is used to}} package, deploy, support and, if necessary restow it, are addressed along with systems constraints such as spacecraft configuration, size, and payload requirements. The influence on blanket design is emphasized. The three main mission classes considered are low Earth orbital (LEO), intermediate, or LEO to GEO transfer, and geosynchronous (GEO). Although interplanetary missions could be considered to be a separate class, their requirements, primarily power per unit mass, are generally close enough to geosynchronous missions to allow this mission class to be included within the third type. Examination of the critical elements of each class coupled with considerations of the shuttle capabilities is used to define the type of blanket technology most likely required to support missions that will be flown starting in 1990...|$|R

These range from one dimensional input on a haptic feedback steering wheel to a six degree of freedom position and <b>orientation</b> <b>device</b> and further, to assemblies of such devices. On the surface most of the variations can be accommodated logically with standardized input models combining existing logical input devices and haptic feedback processes as acknowledgement/echos. However it is very uncertain whether such a model can adequately model the system requirements for effective haptic feedback. In this paper we review the input models that have developed over the past 20 years and ask "Is it {{the end of the road}} for the conceptual model of input incorporated into the early graphics standards and elaborated over the years?"

While current literature contains some of the necessary information, nothing was in a pocket-style format.

After gaining approval from the IRB, I sent 21 questionnaires to people that had traveled to Africa. I asked them about preparations before the trip, actions to take while in Africa, and proper attitudes and demeanors while working with local people. The responses were quite varied and provided information that would not be obvious to someone that has never been to Africa. For example, flexibility and humility were more important than strength, responsibility, and creativity.

40|$|An Augmented Reality (AR) {{application}} {{is essentially a}} platform that integrates the selected hardware components via their corresponding software interfaces. In {{the context of this}} research, a software interface is a piece of code implemented to establish communication channels between a hardware device and the AR application platform. The implementation of such an interface for each piece of hardware in an AR application requires a significant amount of time and coding effort. In all engineering and scientific applications of AR developed thus far, although they largely integrate and communicate with the same set of hardware components, the effort invested in implementing the required software interfaces has been repeatedly duplicated. The objective of the presented research has been to remedy this situation by designing and implementing an extensible software framework that allows application developers to communicate with typical AR hardware components.

40|$|Structural and paleomagnetic {{studies of}} Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) cores are {{severely}} {{hampered by the}} fact that the recovered cores can rarely be reoriented with any degree of confidence. Although several techniques for orienting cores have been used, none is without limitations. Core <b>orientation</b> <b>devices</b> used during drilling are expensive to operate and are usually unreliable. A common alternative, used when no core orientation tools are available, is to assume that the horizontal component of the magnetization direction of the core pointed north, and thus that features may be oriented relative to this direction. However, this neglects the effects of secular variations in the Earth's magnetic field and of later tectonic rotation on the sample. In this paper we outline a technique for core reorientation that matches distinctive inclined planar features measured on the core with their images on Formation MicroScanner and Borehole Televiewer wireline logs. It allows reorientation of structural and magnetic data, and hence the possibility of detecting vertical axis tectonic rotations using Paleomagnetism.
