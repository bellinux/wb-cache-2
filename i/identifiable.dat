5|$|The {{following}} {{types of}} cyclones are <b>identifiable</b> in synoptic charts.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{also produce}} <b>identifiable</b> inaudible {{infrasonic}} signatures.|$|E
5|$|Esolen is a Catholic, and his {{writings}} generally contain an <b>identifiable</b> conservative or traditionalist perspective. Dissatisfaction {{over some of}} the views that he expressed contributed to his decision to leave Providence College.|$|E
5|$|Only one of {{the victims}} was {{visually}} <b>identifiable.</b> Eventually, 147 were identified by fingerprint, dental records, and X-ray comparisons. The remaining 81 were identified through DNA tests.|$|E
5|$|Stage 2A: Unilateral tumor with {{incomplete}} gross resection; <b>identifiable</b> ipsilateral and contralateral {{lymph node}} negative for tumor.|$|E
5|$|Stage 2B: Unilateral tumor with {{complete}} or incomplete gross resection; with ipsilateral lymph node positive for tumor; <b>identifiable</b> contralateral lymph node negative for tumor.|$|E
5|$|The jacanas are a {{group of}} {{tropical}} waders. They are <b>identifiable</b> by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.|$|E
5|$|Undifferentiated endometrial carcinomas make up {{less than}} 1–2% of {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancers. They have a worse prognosis than grade III tumors. Histologically, these tumors show sheets of identical epithelial cells with no <b>identifiable</b> pattern.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the score}} is through-composed, within the general {{structure}} of the opera there are several <b>identifiable</b> numbers: four solos given to the three main characters, a trio and a brief love duet. Only Lauretta's O mio babbino caro, the best-known of the solos, is separable from its context and can be sung as a concert piece.|$|E
5|$|Because fossils <b>identifiable</b> as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively}} in the lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils {{exclusively in the}} upper layers, a fossil lacking the skull can be identified based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
5|$|Because {{species of}} aetosaurs {{typically}} have restricted fossil ranges and are {{abundant in the}} strata they are found in, they are useful in biochronology. Osteoderms {{are the most common}} remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single <b>identifiable</b> scute can accurately date the layer it is found in.|$|E
5|$|Constantin Amăriuţei {{was noted}} for {{defining}} Mitică's character (Miticism) through onthologic terms {{borrowed from the}} German philosopher Martin Heidegger. He thus argued that, for all their mundane motivations, the character and his peers illustrated a search present with all individuals, <b>identifiable</b> with Heidegger's concepts of Being-in-the-World and Being-toward-death (see Heideggerian terminology).|$|E
5|$|Dedicated to Mme la Baronne V. d'Indy, {{the fifth}} barcarolle was written after {{a five-year period}} in which Fauré {{composed}} nothing for the piano. Orledge calls it powerful, agitated and virile. It {{is the first of}} Fauré's piano works in which there are no <b>identifiable</b> sections; its changes are in metre, not in tempo.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus {{is among}} the most easily <b>identifiable</b> dinosaurs, with its typical sauropod shape, long neck and tail, and four sturdy legs. For many years, it was the longest dinosaur known. Its great size may have been a {{deterrent}} to the predators Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus: their remains have been found in the same strata, which suggests that they coexisted with Diplodocus.|$|E
5|$|Election surveys, {{defined as}} opinion surveys of how electors will vote at an election, {{or of the}} {{preferences}} of electors concerning any candidate or group of candidates or any political party or issue with which an <b>identifiable</b> candidate or group of candidates is associated at an election.|$|E
5|$|File:Oakland Skyline and Lake Merritt.jpg|thumb|center|1000px|Panorama of Oakland's skyline (Some {{buildings}} are <b>identifiable</b> using the cursor)|alt=Daytime skyline {{of a city}} behind a lake, showing several tall skyscrapers {{in the middle of}} the image, with several low-rises on the left and trees on the right.|$|E
5|$|Iguanodon {{material}} {{has also been}} used in the search for dinosaur DNA and other biomolecules. In research by Graham Embery et al., Iguanodon bones were processed to look for remnant proteins. In this research, <b>identifiable</b> remains of typical bone proteins, such as phosphoproteins and proteoglycans, were found in a rib.|$|E
5|$|In June 1970, the Dubna {{team made}} {{improvements}} on their original experiment, providing a purer target {{and reducing the}} intensity of transfer reactions by installing a collimator before the catcher. This time, {{they were able to}} find 9.1MeV alpha activities with daughter isotopes <b>identifiable</b> as either 256103 or 257103; thus, the original isotope was either 260105 or 261105.|$|E
5|$|Most teeth have <b>identifiable</b> {{features}} that distinguish them from others. There are several different notation systems {{to refer to}} a specific tooth. The three most common systems are the FDI World Dental Federation notation, the universal numbering system, and Palmer notation method. The FDI system is used worldwide, and the universal is used widely in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Since the Cambrian {{explosion}} {{there have}} been five distinctly <b>identifiable</b> mass extinctions. The last mass extinction occurred some 66 million years ago, when a meteorite collision probably triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but spared small animals such as mammals. Over the past 66million years, mammalian life diversified.|$|E
5|$|Sulu-type {{compositions}} on the kulintangan {{are found}} among the Tausug, Samal, Yakan, Sama/Badjao, Iranun and Kadazan-Dusun. Though there exist no <b>identifiable</b> rhythmic or melodic differences between patterns with names such as the Maguindanao, each group has their own music compositions. For instance, the Tausug have three <b>identifiable</b> compositions—Kuriri, Sinug, and Lubak-Lubak—the Yakan have two—Tini-id and Kuriri—and the Dusun have three—Ayas, Kudidi and Tidung. Though these melodies vary even within groups like the Maguindanao and Maranao, one theme which characterizes the Sulu-type is the exchange of short melodic phrases between the kulintangan and the Agungs, where both instruments imitate and duplicate each other's rhythms very quickly. This is clearly seen in the Tausug Sinug and Yakan Tini-id and Kuriri compositions where this sort of jousting becomes a game of skill and virtuoso playing.|$|E
5|$|The Indian subcontinent is {{the range}} of {{subspecies}} N. p. ginginianus, {{the smallest of the}} three subspecies, which is <b>identifiable</b> by a pale yellow bill. The subspecies name is derived from Gingee in southern India where the French explorer Pierre Sonnerat described it as Le Vautour de Gingi and it was given a Latin name by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus (1790).|$|E
5|$|The jacanas are a {{group of}} {{tropical}} waders in the family Jacanidae. They are found throughout the tropics. They are <b>identifiable</b> by their huge feet and claws which enable them to walk on floating vegetation in the shallow lakes that are their preferred habitat.|$|E
5|$|The saints are <b>identifiable</b> from Latin {{inscriptions}} {{lining the}} borders of the imitation bronze frame, which is original. Van der Paele is <b>identifiable</b> from historical records. He is dressed in the finery of a medieval canon, including white surplice, as he piously reads from a book of hours. He is presented to Mary by Saint George, his name saint, who holds aloft his metal helmet in respect. Saint Donatian, dressed in brightly coloured vestments, stands to the left. The panel is noted for the finery of clothing, including exquisite representations of furs, silks and brocades, and the elaborate and detailed religious iconography. The Virgin's throne is decorated with carved representations of Adam and Eve, prefigurations of the Crucifixion and Resurrection of Jesus, and scenes from the Old Testament. The painting is lined with a series of inscriptions which comment on the saints, and include van Eyck's signature.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin and}} oral cavity telangiectasias are {{visually}} <b>identifiable</b> on physical examination, and similarly the lesions {{in the nose}} may be seen on endoscopy of the nasopharynx or on laryngoscopy. The severity of nosebleeds may be quantified objectively using a grid-like questionnaire in which the number of nosebleed episodes and their duration is recorded.|$|E
5|$|The velites {{were placed}} {{at the front of}} the maniples, so that the velites had the chance to prove {{themselves}} and win glory by seeking out single combat with an enemy. This is also why they wore highly <b>identifiable</b> wolfskin headdresses.|$|E
5|$|Twitter {{has become}} internationally <b>identifiable</b> by its {{signature}} bird logo. The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010. A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the Welsh Highland Railway, {{the track}} bed was sold off {{piecemeal}} - often reverting {{to the original}} owners, paying much less than they had sold it for originally. Although there has been minor development on parts of the route, and Wistlandpound Reservoir has flooded the track bed close to its mid-point, much is still in open countryside, with many sections <b>identifiable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Water is {{the main}} {{ingredient}} of beer, accounting for 93% of its weight. Though water itself is, ideally, flavorless, its level of dissolved minerals, specifically, bicarbonate ion, does influence beer's finished taste. Due to the mineral properties of each region's water, specific areas were originally the sole producers of certain types of beer, each <b>identifiable</b> by regional characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Within {{cartilaginous}} fish, approximately 7 {{out of the}} 41 {{families of}} neoselachians (modern sharks, skates, and rays) disappeared after this event and batoids (skates and rays) lost nearly all the <b>identifiable</b> species, while more than 90% of teleost fish (bony fish) families survived.|$|E
5|$|A {{centre of}} {{religious}} discussions called Anubhava Mantapa ("Hall of experience") in Kalyani became the conclave where devotees gathered {{to discuss their}} mystic experiences. Here, they expressed their devotion to Shiva in simple poems called Vachanas. These were spontaneous utterances of rhythmic, epigrammatical and satirical prose emphasising the worthlessness of riches, rituals and book learning. Many of these poems are anonymous, but the authors are <b>identifiable</b> by the unique divine name of the god Shiva that is invoked in the poem.|$|E
5|$|A quietly spoken athlete, he {{frequently}} states that his victories are {{a tribute to}} his country. Eritrea is one of Africa's newest and least populous countries, and Zersenay's achievements on the world athletics stage have {{made him one of}} the country's most <b>identifiable</b> sportsmen. He is a popular public figure in his home country; 2500 guests attended his wedding to Merhawit Solomon, which was broadcast live on Eritrean television. His brother, Kidane Tadese, is also a professional distance runner who has competed at the World Cross Country Championships and the 2008 Summer Olympics.|$|E
5|$|Although Herod's {{renovation}} of the Second Temple was initiated in late 1st century BCE, excavations beneath the street near the arch revealed three oil lamps of a type common {{in the first century}} CE and 17 <b>identifiable</b> coins, several of which were struck by Valerius Gratus, Roman procurator of Judea, in the year 17/18 CE. This means that the arch and nearby sections of the Western Wall were constructed after this date.|$|E
5|$|Bathhouses are {{not always}} <b>identifiable</b> as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses {{sometimes}} display the rainbow flag, which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the gay press and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first television advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on commercial television in Melbourne promoted Wet on Wellington, a sauna in Wellington Street, Collingwood.|$|E
5|$|By about 5500BC, small tribes {{living in}} the Nile valley had {{developed}} {{into a series of}} cultures demonstrating firm control of agriculture and animal husbandry, and <b>identifiable</b> by their pottery and personal items, such as combs, bracelets, and beads. The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badari, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high quality ceramics, stone tools, and its use of copper.|$|E
5|$|Cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) {{have a more}} {{advanced}} immune system. They have three specialized organs that are unique to Chondrichthyes; the epigonal organs (lymphoid tissue similar to mammalian bone) that surround the gonads, the Leydig's organ {{within the walls of}} their esophagus, and a spiral valve in their intestine. These organs house typical immune cells (granulocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells). They also possess an <b>identifiable</b> thymus and a well-developed spleen (their most important immune organ) where various lymphocytes, plasma cells and macrophages develop and are stored.|$|E
