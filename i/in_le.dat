5|$|All of Van Dormael's films contain surreal elements. In {{his first}} two films, these moments were few, like dancing flowers in Toto le héros or Georges flying around the room <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> huitième jour. Mr. Nobody makes much more {{extensive}} use of surreal imagery throughout the film.|$|E
5|$|Answering an {{advertisement}} <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Figaro after his {{discharge from the}} army, Mézières was employed by the publishing house Hachette as an illustrator {{on a series of}} books titled Histoire des Civilizations (History of Civilization), for which he brought in Giraud to help him out with the chore. Intended to run to twenty volumes, Histoire des Civilizations folded after just five.|$|E

5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's next Adventure of Tintin {{would be}} The Secret of the Unicorn, serialised <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Soir from June 1942. He had collaborated closely with Van Melkebeke on this project, who had {{introduced}} many elements {{from the work}} of Jules Verne into the detective story, in which Tintin and Haddock searched for parchments revealing the location of hidden pirate treasure. The Secret of the Unicorn marked the first half of a story arc that was completed in Red Rackham's Treasure, serialised <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Soir from February 1943; in this story, Tintin and Haddock search for the pirate's treasure in the Caribbean, with the character of Professor Calculus being introduced to the series. Following Red Rackham's Treasure, Hergé drew illustrations for a serialised story titled Dupont et Dupond, détectives ("Thomson and Thompson, Detectives"), authored by the newspaper's crime editor, Paul Kinnet.|$|E

5|$|In autumn 1943, Hergé {{had decided}} that he wanted Jacobs to {{collaborate}} with him on The Adventures of Tintin. Although initially hesitant, Jacobs eventually agreed, adopting the paid position in January 1944. Jacobs and Hergé became close collaborators and greatly influenced each other, while together they developed the plot for the next Adventure of Tintin, The Seven Crystal Balls, which began serialisation <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Soir in December 1943.|$|E
5|$|Like Le Guin's earlier novel The Word for World Is Forest, {{this story}} {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} humans and their natural environment. The story also makes repeated references to the poetry of Andrew Marvell, including in the title. The story was republished <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Guin's collections The Wind's Twelve Quarters and Buffalo Gals and Other Animal Presences, {{as well as in}} many other anthologies. It was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Related to {{this use}} of resonance, Messiaen also {{composed}} music in which the lowest, or fundamental, note is combined with higher notes or chords played much more quietly. These higher notes, far from being perceived as conventional harmony, function as harmonics that alter the timbre of the fundamental note like mixture stops on a pipe organ. An example is {{the song of the}} golden oriole <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> loriot of the Catalogue d'oiseaux for solo piano (Example 4).|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} crash, a {{memorial}} stone {{in memory of}} the victims was erected near the crash site <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Vernet.

5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed in the {{massacre}} were exhumed in 1942 by the French, but only about 50 of the 97 were successfully identified. The bodies were then reburied <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Paradis churchyard, which now forms part of the Le Paradis War Cemetery administered by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

5|$|While doing {{research}} for his decorations, he read in an American magazine the article Comics in your Life. Fascinated, Vandersteen searched {{for more information}} on the subject. He rediscovered Hergé with The Adventures of Tintin <b>in</b> <b>Le</b> Petit Vingtième, but also the realistic work of Hal Foster in Prince Valiant. But it took a few more years before this fascination translated into steady publication of his own comics. Meanwhile, his first published drawings appeared in Entre Nous, the internal magazine of L'Innovation.|$|E
5|$|While most of Belgium was occupied, King Albert I {{continued}} {{to command the}} Belgian Army along {{a section of the}} Western Front, known as the Yser Front, through West Flanders from his headquarters in Veurne.

Belgium's colonial possession in Africa, the Belgian Congo, also remained loyal to the Allies and the Le Havre government.|$|E
