2500|$|In England in 1924, doctors {{reported}} {{the first case}} of asbestosis, a chronic illness caused by the inhalation of asbestos fibers. [...] By the 1950s, evidence linking asbestos to cancer was mounting. [...] Richard Doll, an epidemiologist at Turner and Newall, reported (in spite of company pressure) that people exposed to asbestos for 20 or more years had a 10 times higher risk of developing lung cancer than the general population. Also, a formerly rare and almost always fatal cancer, mesothelioma, was reported in epidemic proportions near asbestos mines in South Africa. In the 1960s, the British Journal of <b>Industrial</b> <b>Medicine</b> indicated that simply living near an asbestos factory, or in an asbestos-insulated building, increased mesothelioma risk.|$|E
