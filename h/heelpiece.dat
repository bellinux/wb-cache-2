40|$|Many {{women feel}} pain and {{discomfort}} when wearing high heels to certain events. This {{is a problem}} because {{it can lead to}} a variety of health issues. It would be beneficial and convenient if a woman could remove the <b>heelpiece</b> from her shoe while still wearing the same product. However, there is currently no popular high heels that can convert to a flat shoe on the market today. Our goal was to perform an in depth human factors analysis with regards to high heel use and formulate a solution to these problems. After reviewing literature, conducting a survey, and analyzing current materials used in shoe making, we proposed a solution and created a prototype that demonstrates how a <b>heelpiece</b> can detach from a shoe converting it into a flat. This proposed design had to be durable, convenient, and aesthetically pleasing in order to realistically expect demand for such a product. We discovered solutions that address these issues along with a viable mechanism for connecting and disconnecting the <b>heelpiece.</b> Further research in the manufacturing of such materials could definitely lead to the production of an exceptional product...|$|E
40|$|Alstonia scholaris (L.) R. Br. is one {{of native}} and fast growing species in Indonesia. This species is {{potential}} for forest plantation. Its wood {{can be used for}} boxes, matches, <b>heelpiece,</b> crafts (mask and puppet),Â  pencil slate, and pulp. This paper aims to study the growth of Alstonia scholaris at 6 month old in Sumber Klampok, Bali. This experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design with provenances as treatment. The research used 5 provenances, i. e. Lombok (NTB), Jayapura (Papua), Solok (West Sumatera), Timor (NTT) and Bali. Material genetic from 46 parent trees were used and we observed 4 seedling of each patent trees with 6 replications. The result showed that provenances of Bali, Lombok dan NTT were the best provenances for survival rate, height, and stem diameter...|$|E
