40|$|Electric Energy Storage (EES) is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} promising options for reducing the need for costly upgrades in distribution networks in Queensland (QLD). However, It is expected, the full potential for storage for distribution upgrade deferral cannot be fully realized due to high cost of EES. On the other hand, EES used for distribution deferral application can support a variety of complementary storage applications such as energy price arbitrage, time of use (TOU) energy cost reduction, wholesale electricity market ancillary services, and transmission upgrade deferral. Aggregation of benefits of these complementary storage applications would have the potential for increasing the amount of EES that may be financially attractive to <b>defer</b> <b>distribution</b> network augmentation in QLD.

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the impact of}} reactive power support of single-phase electric vehicle chargers, during charging, in a low-voltage residential distribution grid. For a representative Flemish case study, reactive power support is investigated for three different electric vehicle charging strategies: uncoordinated charging, residential off-peak tariff charging, and vehicle-based peak shaving. For an increasing electric vehicle penetration rate and an increasing amount of reactive power injection, {{the impact on the}} residential voltage deviations, peak load, and grid losses is calculated. The results of the case study show that the implementation of a capacitive load behavior in electric vehicle chargers has a beneficial impact on the voltage deviations. Furthermore, for a capacitive power factor of 0. 95 or higher, there is no disadvantage with respect to the residential peak load and the residential grid losses. However, the cost related to the increased apparent power rating of the vehicle chargers, required to supply the reactive power, should be assessed compared to the mentioned advantages. If the benefits outweigh the costs, reactive power support could be considered in the grid compliance requirements of electric vehicle chargers, as it allows <b>deferring</b> <b>distribution</b> grid infrastructure investments. status: publishe...|$|R

We present a simple approach for implementing flexible locking strategies in an object-oriented system, {{in which the}} components themselves may be composite objects.

A major advantage of distributed resources is their potential for <b>deferring</b> investments in <b>distribution</b> network capacity.

40|$|Abstract—The primary {{objective}} of any electric utility {{company in the}} new competitive environment would be to increase {{the market value of}} the services it provides with the right amount of reliability, and at the same time, lower its costs for operation, maintenance, and construction of new facilities in order to provide lower rates for customers. The electric utility company will strive to achieve this objective via many different means, one of which is to <b>defer</b> the capital <b>distribution</b> facility requirements in favor of a distributed generation (DG) solution by an independent power producer (IPP) to meet the growing customer load demand. In this case, the distribution capital investment deferral credit received by the IPP will be dependent on the incremental system reliability improvement rendered by the DG solution. In other words, the size, location and the reliability of the DG will be based on the comparable incremental reliability provided by the distribution solution under considerations. This paper presents a reliability model for determining the DG equivalence to a distribution facility for use in distribution system planning studies in the new competitive environment.

40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of increasing utilization of the transmission and distribution infrastructure without significant upgrade, the domestic electric power utility industry is investing heavily in technologies to improve network dynamic performance through a program loosely referred to as Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS). Devices exploiting recent advances in power electronics are being installed in the power system to offset the need to construct new transmission lines. These devices collectively represent investment potential of several billion dollars over the next decade. A similar development, designed to curtail the peak loads and thus <b>defer</b> new transmission, <b>distribution,</b> and generation investment, falls under a category of technologies referred to as demand side management (DSM). A subset of broader conservation measures, DSM acts directly on the load to reduce peak consumption. DSM techniques include direct load control, in which a utility has the ability to curtail specific loads as conditions warrant. A novel approach has been conceived by Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to combine the objectives of FACTS and the technologies inherent in DSM to provide a distributed power system dynamic controller. This technology has the potential to dramatically offset major investments in FACTS devices by using direct load control to achieve dynamic stability objectives. The potential value of distributed versus centralized grid modulation has been examined by simulating the western power grid under extreme loading conditions. In these simulations, a scenario is analyzed in which active grid stabilization enables power imports into the southern California region to be increased several hundred megawatts beyond present limitations. Modeling results show distributed load control is up to 30 percent more effective than traditional centralized control schemes in achieving grid stability...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} more {{flexible}} and secure electric systems, the changing in the regulatory and economic scenarios, the importance of harnessing energy savings and minimizing environmental impacts have been providing the impetus for an intensive exploitation of Distributed Generation (DG). Such exploitation is leading to a new paradigm for the distribution system, often summarised {{with the concept of}} active network. Active network, in opposition to traditional passive distribution systems, which have only to supply end users, means a distribution system where customers, power producers and Distribution System Operators (DSOs) actively interact to sell or purchase energy and to manage and operate the network. Active networks in their ultimate arrangement may receive benefits from the adoption of meshed topology in opposition to the dominant radial scheme and for this reason the investigation on meshed networks performances with high level of distributed generation may be very useful. As well known, meshed networks may have positive effects on power losses, on voltage regulation, on network reliability, and on the exploitation of lines and substation transformers. All these benefits can be advantageously used to <b>defer</b> investments in <b>distribution</b> networks, but it is necessary to investigate at what extent meshed networks can be useful to accommodate more DG and whether such a revolutionary change can be really economically convenient. The main idea of the paper is to investigate on possible technical and economical benefits achievable with the transformation from radial to weakly meshed networks. Studies have been performed on a benchmark network, based on a real Italian distribution network, by using a specific software tool developed by the authors to solve distribution planning problems. The distribution planning studies allows identifying the reference network for both radial and meshed case and defining different optimal development strategies able to minimise the cost of energy losses, of network upgrading, and of service interruptions...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of Electric Energy Storage {{has been recognized}} {{as early as the}} 1970 ’s. When integrated into electrical networks Electric Energy Storage has the potential of numerous technological and financial benefits. The {{importance of}} Electric Energy Storage is growing as more renewable energy sources and higher consumer loads are added to existing networks. However, many of the beneficial effects derived from Electric Energy Storage remain to be examined in detail. Therefore, it is the objective of this thesis to examine several of these benefits, determine the methods by which they can be incorporated into a Medium Voltage network and ascertain their precise effects on this network. In this thesis three Electric Energy Storage benefits are reviewed and examined: peak shaving, frequency control and voltage control. Following this examination the technique of peak shaving has been chosen to be further explored by subjecting it to various scenarios. Peak shaving has been selected as it appears to have the most potential benefits when applied to an electrical network. These benefits are expected to be power supply increase, congestion relief, transmission upgrade deferral, and distribution upgrade deferral. For the analysis process the Electric Energy Storage technology used is a Battery Energy Storage System. The Battery Energy Storage System provides for peak shaving on the Medium Voltage network. In order to test five different scenarios an algorithm is developed using the DigSILENT Programming Language. This algorithm is tested using a simple reference network in order to determine if it functions properly. After this, a test model based on an existing Medium Voltage network is created using PowerFactory on which the five different scenarios are tested. These scenarios are based on future growth of the network and an increase of the use of Photovoltaic and Electric Vehicles. Several simulations are run using these scenarios on different parts of the Medium Voltage network of Goeree- Overflakee to ascertain the effects of peak shaving on the network. In order to test the effects on different network configurations three different actual network feeders are analyzed, two radial configured feeders and one meshed configured feeder. From the results of this examination and research it is concluded {{that it is possible to}} use peak shaving to increase the power supply, reduce congestion, and <b>defer</b> transmission and <b>distribution</b> upgrades on a radial configured network. However, the process for meshed configuration simulation is not as straight forward. While the initial results are positive, additional research into the parameters of the simulation software is required to provide a definite conclusion for meshed configurations. Finally, the addition of Electric Vehicles creates complications in the operation of the Battery Energy Storage System. Several solutions are proposed to alleviate these complications. The addition of Photovoltaics partially removes some of these complications. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer ScienceElectrical Sustainable Energ...|$|R
40|$|The International Energy Agency has {{observed}} {{that nearly all}} countries now offer, or are planning, feed-in tariffs (FiTs) for solar PV but the debate has shifted from ‘if or how to implement a FiT’ to ‘how {{to move to a}} self-sustaining market post FiT’. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explain how a sustainable FiT can be designed for residential solar PV installations to simultaneously enhance the diffusion of other distributed resources, such as energy storage, focusing on the case of ‘solar rich’ Australia. Solar PV is approaching price parity at the retail level where the electricity price charged includes both transmission and distribution costs, in addition to the wholesale price. So the economic rationale for paying a FiT premium above market rates to achieve dynamic efficiency is no longer warranted. However, there is justification pay a premium to encourage dynamic innovation in energy storage. Socially, FiTs can be a problem because they tend to exacerbate social inequality by providing a transfer of wealth from poorer to richer households. Additionally, new investment in distribution and transmission driven by peak demand spikes from air conditions acts a further transfer of wealth from poorer to richer households. Environmentally, FiTs can also fall short of their full potential to cut emissions if they lack ‘time of day’ price signals that reflect movements in the wholesale price and lack a price signal to <b>defer</b> investment in <b>distribution</b> and transmission. We provide a framework in which a sustainable FiT can be designed that positively addresses all three areas of concern: social, environmental and economic. This framework identifies the market failures that exist in the residential solar PV electricity and other distributed resources, which include exacerbating inequity, poorly targeting myopic investment behaviour, inadequate transmission and distribution investment deferment price signals and inappropriate infant industry assistance. We argue that these market failures require addressing before the market can operate in an allocatively efficient manner. The sustainable FiT that we propose would lead to improvements in environmental, social and economic factors. The resultant transmission and distribution investment deferment would meet both environmental and economic objectives. Directly providing finance for solar PV and other distributed resources in rental properties would address both social equity and investment myopia. We argue that introducing appropriate pricing signals for solar PV and other distributed resources would be in the ongoing interest of customers. It is time to progress from FiTs focused on dynamic efficiency to a sustainable FiT for solar PV that emphasises allocative efficiency as an explicit goal and introduce support for other distributed resources to encourage dynamic efficiency. The proposed framework provides appropriate prices signals for the assimilation of other distributed resources. ...|$|R
