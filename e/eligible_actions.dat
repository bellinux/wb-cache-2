40|$|Problem {{formulation}} {{and challenges}} Many decision−making systems adopt lookahead policies {{to select the}} most promising <b>eligible</b> <b>actions.</b> In most cases, the deeper a program looks ahead, the better performance it will achieve. But as Nau has suggested, sometimes looking ahead deeper consistently degrades {{the quality of a}} decision, which is called pathology. This is usually somewhat contradictory to our intuition. Although some researchers have discovered pathology in several games, like the Pearl Game, little is known about why and how pathology occurs. Some intuitive explanations were given, but they were neither general nor theoretically grounded. Further study on pathology is needed. With a better understanding of such anomalies, {{we will be able to}} avoid pathology and design better evaluation functions or algorithms, thus improve the performance of our searching process. According to the advice Prof. Bulitko gave us based on his experiences, and the work we have done, we have a feeling that the use of an inadmissible function may cause pathologies.

40|$|Introduction For any application, the {{designer}} of a distributed system {{has the responsibility}} of certifying the correctness of the system, before users start using it. This guarantee might possibly hold as long every hardware and software component works according to specifications. This chapter explains what correctness criteria are considered important for distributed systems. In message passing models, the state of a distributed system consists of the local states of all the processes, and {{the states of the}} channels connecting these processes. For the locally shared variable models, channel states are irrelevant. The state of a distributed system is also called its configuration. From any state, the execution of each <b>eligible</b> <b>action</b> takes the system to a new state.

40|$|Tradable green {{certificate}} (TGC) schemes {{have been developed}} and tested in several countries to foster market-driven penetration of renewable energy sources. Another well-known and widely analysed type of market–based instrument is the tradable CO 2 permit. The first international CO 2 emission trading scheme will soon start in the European Union (EU). Recently the attention of policy makers has been attracted {{by the possibility of}} introducing tradable certificates for energy savings (TCES) to stimulate energy efficiency investments and achieve national energy efficiency targets. TCES schemes have been recently introduced in Italy and the UK. However, there is a debate over the effectiveness and applicability of this instrument. The paper describes the concept of a TCES scheme in the EU policy context. It discusses the main elements of a TCES scheme: the creation of the market and of the demand (<b>eligible</b> <b>actions</b> and technologies), the trading rules (validity of certificates, banking, borrowing), the possible cost-recovery mechanisms, and institutional infrastructure and processes to support the scheme (measurement and verification, penalty for non-compliance) ...|$|E
40|$|In a {{framework}} where no common forestry policy exists at the EU level (such as the Common Agriculture Policy for agriculture), this report lists EU {{policies that have}} an impact on climate change mitigation that can be achieved by the forestry sector. With the objective of analyzing the coherence of these policies, we have established a typology and a hierarchy firstly by laying out the legal status and the financial and institutional resources associated with each policy, and secondly by reviewing the objectives of each policy in regards to climate change mitigation in the forestry sector. We finally analyze potentials synergies and conflicts between them. The consequences of each policy on climate change mitigation is assessed through three principal mitigation pathways in the forestry sector: carbon sequestration in forests, energy substitution (biomass, etc.), and what we refer to as the “harvested wood product use effect” (the sequestration of carbon in wood products and the substitution of more carbon-intensive materials with wood). The forest-related EU policies analyzed in this report are found to be globally coherent in terms of shared objectives, defining an EU forestry mitigation strategy focused on energy substitution through: • the Climate and Energy Package that does not address exclusively the forestry sector but has significant influence on energy substitution; • the European Agriculture Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD), the most important fund concerning forestry. Among the <b>eligible</b> <b>actions</b> which touch upon climate and forestry, member states have favoured those supporting energy-substitution {{and to a lesser extent}} carbon sequestration in forests; Non-mandatory policies such as forest strategies and the forest action plan have diversified objectives touching upon the three mitigation pathways. However their non-legally binding nature brings us to play down their importance. In the end, despite the unbalanced attention given to the different mitigation options, policy objectives are nevertheless coordinated and often complementary in terms of climate change mitigation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Following recent discussions, {{there is}} hope that a {{mechanism}} for reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) will be agreed by the Parties of the UNFCCC at their 15 th meeting in Copenhagen in 2009 as an <b>eligible</b> <b>action</b> to prevent climate changes and global warming in post- 2012 commitment periods. Countries introducing a REDD-regime in order to generate benefits need to implement sound monitoring and reporting systems and specify the associated uncertainties. The principle of conservativeness addresses the problem of estimation errors and requests the reporting of reliable minimum estimates (RME). Here the potential to generate benefits from applying a REDD-regime is proposed with reference to sampling and non-sampling errors that influence the reliability of estimated activity data and emission factors. Results A framework for calculating carbon benefits by including assessment errors is developed. Theoretical, sample based considerations {{as well as a}} simulation study for five selected countries with low to high deforestation and degradation rates show that even small assessment errors (5 % and less) may outweigh successful efforts to reduce deforestation and degradation. Conclusion The generation of benefits from REDD is possible only in situations where assessment errors are carefully controlled. </p...|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, a single-bus and a multi-bus {{representation}} of the German power system are investigated for high penetration levels of wind and solar energy. A technologically diverse portfolio of power system units consisting of dispatchable generators, storage facilities and a cluster of flexible electric water heaters is interfaced with the grid in order {{to compensate for the}} fluctuating renewable infeed. The power system units are modeled with the Power Nodes modeling framework, and their parameterization and technical constraints are implemented based on real performance figures derived from literature. An extended case study with varying fluctuating renewable supply sce-narios and different scalings of the power system units is presented. Each simulation covers a time span of one full year with a sampling time of 15 min-utes. A model predictive control approach is applied to optimally dispatch the power system units. Thereby, the common concept of economic dispatch utilizing real monetary costs is extended by additional objectives enforced by heuristically chosen cost terms in order to gain a realistic dispatch behav-ior. Load shedding and curtailment of the intermittent renewable generators is considered as <b>eligible</b> control <b>action.</b> The simulation results are analyzed with the objective to determine the impacts of storages and flexible loads on the power system’s hosting capacity for fluctuating renewable infeed and the requirement for dispatchable generation units. ...|$|R

50|$|The purport of this {{statement}} is that all three twice-born castes are qualified to study the Vedas but attaining the status of viprata - that of being a Brāhmana, is very rare. Whereas a Kshatriya engages himself mostly in ruling over his kingdom and a Vaishya, in trade etc; the person of a Brāhmana, {{because it is not}} intended for enjoying sense-pleasures, must be subjected to strict disciplines in preparation of enjoying eternal joy in store after death, the ultimate vaiśnavam padam which is the dharma only of Brāhmaņas. Through a Sanskrit inscription, written in late Brahmi script, found on the Talagunda Stone-pillar in Shimoga district dated 455-470 A.D; it became known that a Kadamba king named Śāntivarman had saved the Brahmanahood in the Kaliyuga. In his commentary on the Aitareya Upanishad (Sloka III.ii.3), Shankara states that the Atman is expanded only in human beings who are therefore endowed with intelligence; who see what is known, give expression to what is known and know what is to come; they know the visible and the invisible and perceive the immortal through the mortal. Thus, according to Shankara, the individual self is conscious living entity that makes the individual body <b>eligible</b> for <b>action</b> and knowledge. Accordingly, the term Viprata, here, refers to the inwardly inspired or awakened body and mind; it does not refer to persons born in the families of Brahmins as has been erroneously interpreted by the orthodox interpreters.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Building on Existing Tools to Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening (BETTER) cluster {{randomized}} {{trial in}} primary care settings demonstrated a 30 % improvement in adherence to evidence-based Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening (CDPS) activities. CDPS activities included healthy activities, lifestyle modifications, and screening tests. We present a protocol for the adaptation of BETTER to a public health setting, and testing the adaptation in a cluster randomized trial (BETTER HEALTH: Durham) among low income neighbourhoods in Durham Region, Ontario (Canada). Methods The BETTER intervention consists of a personalized prevention visit between a participant and a prevention practitioner, which {{is focused on the}} participant’s eligible CDPS activities, and uses Brief Action Planning, to empower the participant to set achievable short-term goals. BETTER HEALTH: Durham aims to establish that the BETTER intervention can be adapted and proven effective among 40 – 64  year old residents of low income areas when provided in the community by public health nurses trained as prevention practitioners. Focus groups and key informant interviews among stakeholders and eligible residents of low income areas will inform the adaptation, along with feedback from the trial’s Community Advisory Committee. We have created a sampling frame of 16 clusters composed of census dissemination areas in the lowest urban quintile of median household income, and will sample 10 clusters to be randomly allocated to immediate intervention or six month wait list control. Accounting for the clustered design effect, the trial will have 80 % power to detect an absolute 30 % difference in the primary outcome, a composite score of completed <b>eligible</b> CDPS <b>actions</b> six months after enrollment. The prevention practitioner will attempt to link participants without a primary care provider (PCP) to a local PCP. The implementation of BETTER HEALTH: Durham will be evaluated by focus groups and key informant interviews.
