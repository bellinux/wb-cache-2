5|$|By late 1869, enough nickels, as {{the coin}} {{came to be}} called, had been {{produced}} {{to meet the needs}} of commerce, and production dropped off. The new coins tended to accumulate in the hands of merchants beyond the legal tender limit, but banks refused to accept them beyond the one-dollar maximum. Storeowners were forced to <b>discount</b> <b>the</b> coins to brokers. Postmasters, compelled by law to accept the coins, found that the Treasury would not accept them as deposits except in lots of $100, in accordance with the authorizing statute. In 1871, Congress alleviated the problem by passing legislation allowing the Treasury to redeem unlimited quantities of nickels and other low-denomination coins when presented in lots of not less than $20. It would not be until 1933, long after the shield design passed from the scene, that the nickel was made legal tender without limit.|$|E
5|$|Linderman {{ordered a}} review {{of the success of the}} trade dollar in China. It was {{discovered}} that the coins circulated reasonably well in southern China, but usage in the north was limited. As the price of silver decreased, employers in the United States began paying workers in trade dollars purchased at a <b>discount.</b> <b>The</b> situation frustrated the public, as the coins were widely disliked and many banks and businesses refused to accept them. In response, many towns, mostly in the western states, set a fixed value on trade dollars. Businesses which did accept trade dollars to avoid offending customers could not deposit them in banks or use them to pay taxes, and sold them to brokers. The brokers in turn recirculated the coins by selling them at a discount from face value to employers who included them in workers' pay packets. In 1883, members of the New York Mercantile Exchange petitioned Congress to allow redemption of the coins by the government.|$|E
5|$|Not only do {{they affect}} injured people's self-image, these {{stereotypes}} are particularly harmful when held by counselors and professionals involved in rehabilitation. Caregivers affected by these culturally transmitted beliefs may treat their patients as asexual, particularly if the injury occurred {{at a young age}} and the patient never had sexual experiences. Failure to recognize injured people's sexual and reproductive capacity restricts their access to birth control, information about sexuality, and sexual health-related medical care such as annual gynecological exams. Another common belief that affects sexual rehabilitation is that sex is strictly about genital function; this could cause caregivers to <b>discount</b> <b>the</b> importance {{of the rest of the}} body and of the individual.|$|E

5|$|Citadel was {{the last}} German {{strategic}} offensive on the Eastern Front, {{and one of the}} largest battles in history, involving more than four million men. By the time the Wehrmacht launched their initial assault on 5 July 1943, the Soviet forces outnumbered them by nearly three to one. Walther Model was in command of the northern pincer, with the Ninth Army, while Manstein's Army Group South formed the southern pincer. Both armies were slowed as the tanks were blown up in minefields and caught up in combat on a series of prepared Soviet defensive lines. After five days of fighting Model's advance was stopped, with the Ninth Panzers suffering 25,000 casualties. By 13 July Model's forces were being drawn away towards Orel, where the Soviet army had launched Operation Kutuzov. Manstein's forces were able to penetrate the Soviet lines, causing heavy casualties. He reached, but did not enter or capture, Prokhorovka, his first major objective, on 11 July, inflicting serious Soviet losses in the resulting Battle of Prokhorovka. However, on 13 July Hitler called off the failed Kursk offensive; the Allies had landed in Sicily, so he issued the order for a withdrawal. Manstein protested; he felt that the Soviet forces had exhausted all their reserves in the area, and {{he did not want to}} stop until all his own reserves had been committed. Hitler, however, insisted on calling off the operation. Although Soviet casualties were indeed heavy, modern historians <b>discount</b> <b>the</b> possibility of a successful German continuation of the offensive.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{summarized}} compendium {{of all the}} methods and theories on company valuation using cash flow <b>discounting.</b> <b>The</b> paper shows the ten most commonly used methods for valuing companies by cash flow discounting: 1) free cash flow <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> WACC; 2) equity cash flows <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> required return to equity; 3) capital cash flows <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> WACC before tax; 4) APV (Adjusted Present Value); 5) the business's risk-adjusted free cash flows <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> required return to assets; 6) the business's risk-adjusted equity cash flows <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> required return to assets; 7) economic profit <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> required return to equity; 8) EVA <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> WACC; 9) the risk-free rate-adjusted free cash flows <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> risk-free rate, and 10) the risk-free rate-adjusted equity cash flows <b>discounted</b> at <b>the</b> required return to assets. All ten methods always give the same value. This result is logical, since all the methods analyze the same reality under the same hypotheses; they only differ in the cash flows taken as {{starting point for the}} valuation. The disagreements in the various theories on the valuation of the firm arise from the calculation {{of the value of the}} tax shields (VTS). The paper shows and analyses 9 different theories on the calculation of the VTS: No-cost-of-leverage, Modigliani and Miller (1963), Myers (1974), Miller (1977), Miles and Ezzell (1980), Harris and Pringle (1985), Damodaran (1994), With-cost-of-leverage and Practitioners method. The paper contains the most important valuation equations according to these theories, and also shows the changes that take place in the valuation equations when the debt's market value does not match its book value.
