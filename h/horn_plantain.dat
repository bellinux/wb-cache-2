40|$|Abstract: Nutrient {{potassium}} {{is critical}} in plantain (Musa species cv. AAB) nutrition and may {{play a key role}} in its vegetative growth and bunch development. Application of 300 kg muriate of potash (K 20) per hectare was beneficial in the plant crop, while a higher rate (400 kg K 0 /ha) enhanced growth and yield components (number 2 of hands and fingers/bunch, finger mass, girth and length). Plants fertilized with 400 kg K 0 /ha were tallest 2 (3. 5 m), with largest pseudostem girth (56 - 58 cm), most (11 - 12) number of functional leaves at flowering and flowered after 9 mouths of vegetative growth. Bunch mass, bunch yield/ha and yield components were significantly (P = 0. 05) highest at 300 kg k 20 /ha in the plant crop and at 400 kg K 20 /ha in the ratoon crop. Heaviest bunches were 8. 8 and 9. 8 kg/plant in plant and ratoon crops, giving the respective corresponding bunch yields of 15. 7 and 16. 3 tonnes/ha. An application of 300 Kg K 20 /ha would be adequate for sustainable production of false <b>horn</b> <b>plantain</b> in the high rainforest zone of Cross River State, Nigeria...|$|E
40|$|On two {{plantations}} {{of first}} harvest of Musa AAB each consisting of separate lots of False <b>Horn</b> <b>Plantain</b> (Semi-Giant and Dwarf) nematode populations were determined in plants with {{one to three}} days flowering and in their respective succeeding suckers. The objective {{was to determine if}} there is a relationship between the nematode population in mother plants and their succeeding suckers. Sixty and twenty plants of each cultivar were evaluated in Pococí (70 masl) and Matina (40 masl) locations, respectively. Nematodes were extracted by maceration of the roots, pouring the suspension through a series of 0. 5 / 0. 150 / 0. 038 mm (N° 30 / 100 / 400 mesh) sieves nested together with the 0. 5 mm on top. Populations levels were expressed per 100 g of roots. The results showed no linear relationship between the nematode populations of the flowering plants and their succeeding sucker. Although the differences were not statistically significant, the densities of R. similis determined in flowering plants tended in most cases to overestimate the populations in the succeeding suckers. Sampling flowering plants at Pococí (70 masl) overestimated Helicotylenchus spp. populations in the succession suckers of both cultivars, while those at Matina (40 masl) were underestimated. The estimation of Meloidogyne spp. and Pratylenchus spp. populations was also not reliable. To decide on nematicide applications, it is recommended to sample the succeeding suckers of recently flowering plants...|$|E

40|$|Plantain is an {{important}} staple in West and Central Africa, where it is predominantly grown by smallholder farmers. On-farm data are rare but yields {{are considered to be}} low. We collated actual yields in the region, reviewed regional plantain research published from 1976 to 2013, then estimated what yields would be attainable on smallholder farms if the proven, best-fit innovations were adopted. Mean actual yields reported ranged from 2. 9 to 8. 9 Mg ha− 1 with a mean of 5. 7 Mg ha− 1 for False <b>horn</b> <b>plantain</b> and 4. 5 to 10. 2 Mg ha− 1 with a mean of 7. 8 Mg ha− 1 for French plantain. Experiments found dealt with: cultural practices, particularly intercropping; abiotic factors such as fertiliser, mulch application and irrigation; biotic factors, predominantly sucker sanitation methods, but including three controlled yield loss studies on nematodes and black sigatoka; landrace comparisons and the introduction of improved cultivars, predominantly those exhibiting black sigatoka-tolerance. We conclude that intercropping should be retained according to farmer preference as {{there was no evidence of}} yield reductions for plantain. Boiling water treatment of suckers should be universally recommended. Inputs, whether mulch or K fertiliser up to 300 kg ha− 1 should be applied as both reduced plant losses and increased bunch mass. With the highest yielding local landrace type, on-farm yields could be increased from 7. 8 Mg ha− 1 to 35. 5 Mg ha− 1 with purchased inputs or to 23. 7 Mg ha− 1 without purchased inputs...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the systemicity of BBTV from one plant of the mat to the physically attached shoots, 60 mats both of “Yangambi Km 5 ”, Musa AAA {{and those of the}} false <b>horn</b> <b>plantain</b> “Libanga Likale”, Musa AAB showing severity levels from 0 to 5 were selected in backyards in Kisangani. In addition, 30 sucker corms per genotype were put under macro-propagation and leaf samples of lateral shoots that had emerged were tested using triple antibody sandwich-enzyme linked immuno sorbent assay (TAS-ELISA). In the backyards, for mats with no visible banana bunchy top disease (BBTD) symptoms, none of the analyzed mats with a total of 29 plants of “Yangambi Km 5 ” and of 35 plants of “Libanga Likale” tested ELISA positive, indicating the absence of the BBTV infection. However, for the severity levels of one to five, 32 to 63. 5 % of plants in the mats were ELISA positive for “Yangambi Km 5 ”, while 34. 9 to 73. 2 % of plants from “Libanga Likale” tested positive for BBTV. After macro-propagation, 100 % of lateral shoots of both cultivars at BBTD severity levels 4 and 5 tested positive. On the other hand, none of the lateral shoots at level 0 tested ELISA positive. However, for levels 1 to 3 some ELISA negative plantlets (40 to 23 % for “Yangambi Km 5 ” and 53 to 15 % for “Libanga Likale”) were observed. This study indicates the need for the complete destruction of all mats harbouring plants with BBTD severity levels of 3, 4 and 5. Macro-propagation of suckers with severity level 1 symptoms could produce virus-free plantlets but ELISA testing of the lateral shoots is essential to pinpoint the virus-free plantlets.

40|$|Background: The {{problems}} of vitamin A deficiency and chronic diseases {{have emerged in}} recent years in some countries in the Micronesian region. These problems are associated with the dietary shift towards imported processed foods and lifestyle changes. Research in the Federated States of Micronesia indicates that yellow- and orange-fleshed banana cultivars contain significant levels of provitamin A carotenoids. Objective: To identify further banana cultivars that may be promoted to alleviate vitamin A deficiency among children and women and chronic disease problems among adults. Methods: Ripe fruit of banana cultivars growing in Australia (sourced mostly from a field research collection) were assessed for carotenoid content and flesh color. Ten cultivars with yellow or yellow/orange flesh color (including common cultivars of Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands) were selected and compared with two cream-fleshed cultivars, including Williams, of the Cavendish group, the most commonly marketed banana worldwide. Carotenoid content was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Flesh color was analyzed by HunterLab colorimetry. Results: The yellow/orange-fleshed Asupina (a Fe'i banana) contained the highest level (1, 412 μg/ 100 g) of trans β-carotene, the most important provitamin A carotenoid, a level more than 20 times higher than that of Williams. All 10 yellow or yellow/orange-fleshed cultivars (Asupina, Kirkirnan, Pisang Raja, <b>Horn</b> <b>Plantain,</b> Pacific Plantain, Kluai Khai Bonng, Wain, Red Dacca, Lakatan, and Sucrier) had significant carotenoid levels, potentially meeting half or all of the estimated vitamin A requirements for a nonpregnant, nonlactating adult woman within normal consumption patterns. All were acceptable for taste and other attributes. The cream-fleshed cultivars had minimal carotenoid levels. There was a positive significant correlation between carotenoid content and deeper yellow/orange coloration indicators. Conclusions: These yellow- or yellow/orange-fleshed carotenoid-rich banana cultivars should be considered for promotion in order to alleviate vitamin A deficiency and chronic disease in susceptible target communities and to provide variety and enjoyment as exotic fruits in both developing and industrialized countries...|$|E
40|$|The agronomic, {{nutritional}} {{composition of the}} green stages of fruit and the consumer acceptance of FHIA- 21 (tetraploid hybrid plantain) from Honduran Agricultural Research Foundation was conducted in the forest region of Ghana. The standard AOAC methods {{were used to determine}} the moisture, crude protein, ash, crude fibre, potassium, iron, calcium, carbohydrate, sodium and crude fat. Pulp colour was measured with a Chromatometer. Results on the agronomy indicated that the hybrid was very tolerant to the black Sigatoka disease with high number of functional leaves at flowering and at harvest. The crop cycle was comparable to that of False <b>Horn</b> <b>plantains.</b> The yield performance of the hybrid was high ranging from 34 - 38 t ha- 1 across the locations. The yield values have been stable over the three-year study period. In addition, the FHIA hybrid plants were relatively short. The physio-chemical composition results showed that the hybrid had high fat (1. 94 %) and water (60 %) contents. The potassium content was also high (1060 mg/ 100 g dry weight) however, the iron content (0. 45 mg/ 100 g dry weight) was low. The high potassium level in the hybrid may be an advantage for use as a therapy. The tetraploid hybrid had bright orange pulp colour which was indicative of the presence of provitamins and carotenoids. The consumer acceptability results revealed that FHIA- 21 compared favourably with the local triploid (Apem). The hybrid was accepted for ampesi, fufu and ripe fried plantain. However acceptability of the hybrid as ripe fried plantain was at ripening stages 3 and 4. Beyond these stages of ripening, the hybrid could only be used for processed (mashed) food recipes...|$|R
40|$|Plantain {{is a major}} {{staple food}} in the humid tropics of Africa {{providing}} more than 25 % of the carbohydrates required by about 70 million people. In addition to being an important staple food for rural and urban consumers, plantain provides {{an important source of}} revenue for smallholders who produce them in compounds or home gardens as well as in large-scale field production. In Nigeria three main plantain cultivars are grown; the French plantain the <b>Horn</b> <b>plantain</b> and the Falsehorn plantain. Each of these cultivars produces only one bunch of fruit and yet some farmers in Eastern Nigeria claim to have a plantain 'type' that produced two bunches at fruiting. A scientist from the Department of Crop Science of the University of Nigeria, conducted a survey in Southern Nigeria into the incidence of a phenomenon known as 'double bunching'. While the centre of origin or concentration of this plantain 'type' cannot yet be pinned down to any particular location of Southern Nigeria, it was observed that double-bunching was found in every part of Southern Nigeria where plantain is primarily cultivated. The reason for this double bunching, or dichotomy, is still unknown but it was observed that some 50 % of the suckers from double-bunching plantains reverted back to single bunching. The initial investigation has thrown up some interesting questions that need further research such as: - Is dichotomy of genetic origin, that is through mutation of the existing plantain cultivars? - Is the dichotomous plantain a naturally occurring but endangered plantain 'types that has not been noted scientifically nor fully domesticated and multiplied for wider cultivation? - Are there certain environmental factors (especially nutritional) that could induce dichotomy in plantain? The researchers are interested in proposals or funding that would enable more research to be conducted into the preservation and development of this potentially useful plantain.

40|$|Plants display {{remarkable}} sexual diversity. Regardless of this variation, most {{flowering plants}} are hermaphrodites and contain flowers with {{both male and}} female sex organs. However, various sexual systems have evolved in which male and female organs have been separated between flowers and between individuals. In gynodioecious species, hermaphrodites co-exist with females, plants that lack pollen production (male-sterile individuals). Since females have lost their ability to produce pollen, they are dependent on hermaphrodites for fertilization. One necessary condition for the maintenance of this sexual polymorphism is the occurrence of a reproductive ‘female advantage’. The female advantage implies that females should produce more seeds or higher quality seedlings in comparison to hermaphrodites and the magnitude of the female advantage is dependent on the sex determination system. In {{the most common form of}} gynodioecy, nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy, mutations that lead to male-sterility are located in the cytoplasm and the effect of these male-sterility mutations can be counteracted by nuclear alleles (male- fertility restorers). In species with nuclear-cytoplasmic gynodioecy, females require only a slight reproductive advantage over hermaphrodites to be maintained within a population (female advantage > 1). The female advantage is generally attributed to resource reallocation from pollen to seed production and avoidance of inbreeding depression since females are obligate outcrossers. In most gynodioecious species that have been studied over the years, females had a clear reproductive advantage over hermaphrodites, although the magnitude of the female advantage generally differed among populations. Variation in the magnitude of the female advantage is not surprising since seed production of females is strongly dependent on pollen availability. In populations or patches with a low number of hermaphrodites, females may experience low seed set due to pollen limitation, while in populations or patches with a high number of hermaphrodites, females may have a reproductive advantage. When females produce more seeds than hermaphrodites the frequency of females may locally increase, which in turn may contribute to variation in sex ratios among populations. Population female frequencies are highly variable and generally range from a low percentage to more than 50 % females. Many gynodioecious species also have populations that consist purely of hermaphrodites. When the frequency of females within a population is low, floral sex ratios can still be highly variable, since sex expression can also vary within individuals. Hermaphrodites of many gynodioecious species are dichogamous, indicating that they separate the maturation of male and female organs in time. Differences in timing of male and female function of a flower, typically lead to a shift in floral sex ratio during a population’s flowering season. To gain insights into the various aspects that may affect seed production and genetic variation in gynodioecious plant species, I quantified seed production and offspring fitness across a wide range of populations that differed in population size and sex ratio to understand how these variables affected the female advantage and sex ratio evolution. I assessed genetic diversity in a number of spatially separated populations to understand how genetic variation is partitioned among populations and between sex morphs. Moreover, I studied temporal variation in female reproductive success within and among individuals across an entire flowering season to get a better understanding of the impact of within-population sex ratio variation on seed set. To address these research objectives, two gynodioecious species, Saxifraga granulata (meadow saxifrage) and Plantago coronopus (buck’s- <b>horn</b> <b>plantain),</b> were studied. In this thesis, I show that variation in sex expression within inflorescences, among individuals and among populations highly affected seed production of my study species. In populations of P. coronopus, seed production was highly dependent on population sex ratio, in populations with a low frequency of females both females and hermaphrodites produced more seeds than in populations with a high female frequency. Females produced fewer seeds than hermaphrodites on average, however, offspring fitness of females was higher than offspring fitness of hermaphrodites. Furthermore, genetic analyses showed that both females and hermaphrodites were highly genetically diverse, but adult hermaphrodites showed increased levels of homozygosity as well as severe inbreeding depression after selfing. In S. granulata, the occurrence of female individuals was low, but flowers of hermaphrodites differentially invested in male and female function; the first-opening central flower generally had a long female phase and produced significantly more seeds than early and late lateral flowers. Furthermore, early flowering plants produced more seeds than late flowering plants. Populations of S. granulata were highly genetically diverse, which was most likely related to its high ploidy level (octoploid) and the ability to reproduce clonally. Despite the differences between Saxifraga granulata and Plantago coronopus in terms of reproduction, floral biology, pollination mode, and ploidy level, I have shown that the large variation in sex expression within inflorescences, among individuals and among populations highly affected seed production. My results further showed that plant mating system and the extent of inbreeding depression affect the distribution of genetic variation among populations and sex morphs. Although not explicitly investigated, they also point to the importance of local spatial structure of gynodioecious populations for regulating the evolutionary maintenance of gynodioecy. status: publishe...|$|E
