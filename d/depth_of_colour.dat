60|$|Philippa only {{moved her}} head lazily. The sunlight, which {{came down in}} a {{thousand}} little zigzags through the wind-tossed trees, fell straight upon her rather pale, defiant little face, with its unexpressed evasive charm, and seemed {{to find a new}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> in the red-gold of her disordered hair. Her slim, perfect body was stretched almost at full length, one leg drawn a little up, her hands carelessly drooping towards the grass. The cigarette was still burning in the corner of her lips.|$|E
6000|$|Good drawing is, {{as we have}} seen, an {{abstract}} of natural facts; you cannot represent all that you would, but must continually be falling short, whether you will or no, of the force, or quantity, of Nature. Now, suppose that your means and time do not admit of your giving the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> in the scene, and that you are obliged to paint it paler. If you paint all the colours proportionately paler, as if an equal quantity of tint had been washed away from each of them, you still obtain a harmonious, though not an equally forcible statement of natural fact. But if you take away the colours unequally, and leave some tints nearly as deep {{as they are in}} Nature, while others are much subdued, you have no longer a true statement. You cannot say to the observer, [...] "Fancy all those colours a little deeper, and you will have the actual fact." [...] However he adds in imagination, or takes away, something is sure to be still wrong. The picture is out of harmony.|$|E

60|$|But Miss Hotspur had by {{that time}} {{resolved}} that Lord Alfred should have a fair chance. If she could teach herself to think that of all men walking the earth Lord Alfred was {{the best and the}} most divine, the nearest of all men to a god, how excellent a thing would it be! Her great responsibility as to the family burden would in that case already be acquitted with credit. The wishes of her father, which on such a subject were all but paramount, would be gratified; and she herself would then be placed almost beyond the hand of misfortune to hurt her. At any rate, the great and almost crushing difficulty of her life would so be solved. But the man must have enough in her eyes of that godlike glory to satisfy her that she had found in him one who would be almost a divinity, at any rate to her. Could he speak as that other man spoke? Could he look as that other one looked? Would there be in his eye such a <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> in his voice such a sound of music, in his gait so divine a grace? For that other one, though she had looked into the brightness of the colour, though she had heard the sweetness of the music, though she had watched the elastic spring of the step, she cared nothing as regarded her heart--her heart, which was the one treasure of her own. No; she was sure of that. Of her one own great treasure, she was much too chary to give it away unasked, and too independent, as she told herself, to give it away unauthorized. The field was open to Lord Alfred; and, as her father wished it, Lord Alfred should be received with every favour. If she could find divinity, then she would bow before it readily.|$|E
60|$|And of {{the grace}} and subtlety with which he joined his work {{to that of the}} Gaddis, you may judge at once by {{comparing}} the Christ standing on the fallen gate of the Limbo, with the Christ in the Resurrection above. Memmi has retained the dress and imitated the general effect of the figure in the roof so faithfully that you suspect no difference of mastership--nay, he has even raised the foot in the same awkward way: but you will find Memmi's foot delicately drawn-Taddeo's, hard and rude: and all the folds of Memmi's drapery cast with unbroken grace and complete gradations of shade, while Taddeo's are rigid and meagre; also in the heads, generally Taddeo's type of face is square in feature, with massive and inelegant clusters or volutes of hair and beard; but Memmi's delicate and long in feature, with much divided and flowing hair, often arranged with exquisite precision, as in the finest Greek coins. Examine successively in this respect only the heads of Adam, Abel, Methuselah, and Abraham, in the Limbo, and you will not confuse the two designers any more. I have not had time to make out more than the principal figures in the Limbo, of which indeed the entire dramatic power is centred in the Adam and Eve. The latter dressed as a nun, in her fixed gaze on Christ, with her hands clasped, is of extreme beauty: and however feeble the work of any early painter may be, in its decent and grave inoffensiveness it guides the imagination unerringly to a certain point. How far you are yourself capable of filling up what is left untold and conceiving, as a reality, Eve's first look on this her child, depends on no painter's skill, but on your own understanding. Just above Eve is Abel, bearing the lamb: and behind him, Noah, between his wife and Shem: behind them, Abraham, between Isaac and Ishmael; (turning from Ishmael to Isaac), behind these, Moses, between Aaron and David. I have not identified the others, though I find the white-bearded figure behind Eve called Methuselah in my notes: I know not on what authority. Looking up from these groups, however, to the roof painting, you will at once feel the imperfect grouping and ruder features of all the figures; and the greater <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b> We will dismiss these comparatively inferior paintings at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "To {{an immense}} extent," [...] agreed the Philosopher. [...] "It seized a natural human passion {{and turned it}} to good uses. Then it was a reality. So once was the divine right of kings, the infallibility of the Church, for cumbering {{the ground with the}} lifeless bodies of which mankind has paid {{somewhat}} dearly. Not its upstanding lies-- they can be faced and defeated--but its dead truths are the world's stumbling-blocks. To the man of war and rapine, trained in cruelty and injustice, the woman was the one thing that spoke of the joy of yielding. Woman, as compared with man, was then an angel: it was no mere form of words. All the tender offices of life were in her hands. To the warrior, his life divided between fighting and debauchery, his womenfolk tending the sick, helping the weak, comforting the sorrowing, must have moved with white feet across a world his vices had made dark. Her mere subjection to the priesthood, her inborn feminine delight in form and ceremony--now an influence narrowing her charity--must then, to his dim eyes, trained to look upon dogma as the living soul of his religion, have seemed a halo, deifying her. Woman was then the servant. It was naturally to her advantage to excite tenderness and mercy in man. Since she has become the mistress of the world. It is no longer her interested mission to soften his savage instincts. Nowadays, it is the women who make war, the women who exalt brute force. Today, it is the woman who, happy herself, turns a deaf ear to the world's low cry of pain; holding that man honoured who would ignore the good of the species to augment the comforts of his own particular family; holding in despite as a bad husband and father the man whose sense of duty extends beyond the circle of the home. One recalls Lady Nelson's reproach to her lord after the battle of the Nile. 'I have married a wife, and therefore cannot come,' is the answer to his God that many a woman has prompted to her lover's tongue. I was speaking to a woman only the other day about the cruelty of skinning seals alive. 'I feel so sorry for the poor creatures,' she murmured; 'but they say it gives so much more <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> to the fur.' Her own jacket was certainly a very beautiful specimen." ...|$|E

60|$|The art of painting, {{properly}} so called, {{consists in}} {{laying on the}} least possible colour that will produce the required result, and this measurement, in all the ultimate, that is to say, the principal, operations <b>of</b> <b>colouring,</b> is so delicate that not one human hand in a million has the required lightness. The final touch of any painter properly so named, of Correggio--Titian--Turner--or Reynolds--would be always quite invisible to any one watching {{the progress of the}} work, the films of hue being laid thinner than the <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the grooves in mother-of-pearl. The work may be swift, apparently careless, nay, to the painter himself almost unconscious. Great painters are so organized that they do their best work without effort: but analyze the touches afterwards, and you will find the structure and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>colour</b> laid mathematically demonstrable to be of literally infinite fineness, the last touches passing away at their edges by untraceable gradation.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} <b>of</b> congenital <b>colour</b> defects on {{a clinical}} computer test for equiluminous colour discrimination is studied. Differences in {{relative spectral sensitivity}} and changes in colour contrast discrimination are two distinct manifestations of the abnormal genes responsible for congenital red-green defects. The very simple and rapid method of the heterochromatic flicker brightness test acts like an anomaloscope {{and can be used}} to distinguish protan and deuteran defectives. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the congenital <b>colour</b> defect can be quantified by the colour contrast threshold measured in equiluminous conditions along a single red-green axis identical for all types <b>of</b> red-green <b>colour</b> defectives. Colour contrast thresholds in tritan colour axes are not influenced by congenital red-green defects and therefore they are of extreme clinical interest to detect and quantify acquired colour defects, even {{in the presence of a}} previously unknown congenital red-green defect...|$|R
40|$|Cheap {{and easy}} to use eye {{tracking}} can be used to turn a common display into a gaze-contingent display: a system that can react to the user’s gaze and adjust its content based on where an observer is looking. This can be used to enhance the rendering on screens based on perceptual insights and the knowledge about what is currently seen. This thesis investigates how GCDs can be used to support aspects <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> and <b>colour</b> perception. This thesis presents experiments that investigate the effects <b>of</b> simulated <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field and chromatic aberration on depth perception. It also investigates how changing the colours surrounding the attended area can be used to influence the perceived colour and how this can be used to increase <b>colour</b> differentiation <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> and potentially increase the perceived gamut of the display. The presented investigations and empirical results lay the foundation for future investigations and development of gaze-contingent technologies, as well as for general applications <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> and <b>depth</b> perception. The results show that GCDs can be used to support the user in tasks that are related to visual perception. The presented techniques could be used to facilitate common tasks like distinguishing the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> objects in virtual environments or discriminating similar colours in information visualisations.

40|$|In 1949 Munari {{designs for}} the first time a series of “libri illeggibili” (illegible books), which abandon textual {{communication}} in behalf of aesthetic function only. Paper is no longer the support of the text only, but it also communicates a message through the format, the colour, the cuts and their successions. The elements that usually set up a book (like the colophon and the title-page) are kept off, and the reading seems the execution of a melody, with always different tones during the sequence of the pages. Dominated by visual rarefaction and materials’ experimentation, the production of the “libri illeggibili” has been carried on by Munari all life long. In 1955 some of them have been on display at the MoMA; in its Design Collection are still to see 9 “libri illeggibili”.

6000|$|Our {{carriage}} {{has four}} French officers; they talk neither to us nor to each other; they sleep, sitting well back, hardly moving all night; {{one of them}} snores a little, but with a certain politeness. We leave them {{in the early morning}} and get down into the windy station at Valence. In pre-war days romance began there when one journeyed. A lovely word, and the gate of the South. Soon after Valence one used to wake and draw aside a corner of the curtain and look at the land in the first level sunlight; a strange land of plains, and far, yellowish hills, a land with a dry, shivering wind over it, and puffs of pink almond blossom. But now Valence was dark, for it was November, and raining. In the waiting-room were three tired soldiers trying to sleep, and one sitting up awake, shyly glad to share our cakes and journals. Then on through the wet morning by the little branch line into Dauphiné. Two officers again and a civilian, in our carriage, are talking in low voices of the war, or in higher voices of lodgings at Valence. One is a commandant, with a handsome paternal old face, broader than the English face, a little more in love with life, and a little more cynical about it, with more <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>colouring</b> in eyes and cheeks and hair. The tone of their voices, talking of the war, is grave and secret. [...] "Les Anglais ne lâcheront pas" [...] are the only words I plainly hear. The younger officer says: [...] "And how would you punish?" [...] The commandant's answer is inaudible, but by the twinkling of his eyes one knows it to be human and sagacious. The train winds on in the windy wet, through foothills and then young mountains, following up a swift-flowing river. The chief trees are bare Lombardy poplars. The chief little town is gathered round a sharp spur, with bare towers on its top. The colour everywhere is a brownish-grey.|$|R
