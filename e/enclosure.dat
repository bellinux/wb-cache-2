5|$|Subwoofers {{are made}} up of one or more woofers mounted in a {{loudspeaker}} enclosure—often made of wood—capable of withstanding air pressure while resisting deformation. Subwoofer enclosures {{come in a variety of}} designs, including bass reflex (with a port or vent), using a subwoofer and one or more passive radiator speakers in the <b>enclosure,</b> acoustic suspension (sealed <b>enclosure),</b> infinite baffle, horn-loaded, and bandpass designs, representing unique trade-offs with respect to efficiency, low frequency range, cabinet size and cost. Passive subwoofers have a subwoofer driver and <b>enclosure</b> and they are powered by an external amplifier. Active subwoofers include a built-in amplifier.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of exclusion fences in preventing the colonization of carrot plantings by the carrot rust fly, Psila rosae (F.), was tested in small field plots. Fenced <b>enclosures</b> {{were surrounded by}} panels of mesh nylon window screen l 20 cm high. Control <b>enclosures</b> were left unfenced. Although the number of first generation P. rosae adults captured on yellow sticky traps was not significantly different between control and fenced <b>enclosures,</b> the number of second generation adults emerging within <b>enclosures</b> was significantly higher in control <b>enclosures</b> than in fenced <b>enclosures.</b> The percentage of unmarketable carrots, % damaged carrots, % urunarketable yield, % damaged yield, and number of lesions per carrot werc all significantly higher In control <b>enclosures</b> than in fenced <b>enclosures.</b> We conclude that exclusion fences impede the colonization of carrot plantings by P. rosae and reduce damage to carrots.

5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the <b>enclosure</b> of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} <b>enclosure</b> process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 <b>enclosure</b> acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid to mark out the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} large grazers (Daphnia) and {{nutrients}} (nitrogen and phosphorus) on epilimnetic ciliate communities were investigated in eight large in situ <b>enclosures.</b> Contrasts in Daphnia abundance {{were created by}} stocking planktivorous fish (Phoxinus eos) {{in four of the}} eight <b>enclosures.</b> Contrasts in nutrients were created by adding nitrate and phosphate to two <b>enclosures</b> with fish and to two <b>enclosures</b> without fish. Both the biomass and mean length of total zooplankton were significantly greater in the fish-free <b>enclosures</b> than in the <b>enclosures</b> with fish. Addition of nutrients and fish produced a four-fold variation in concentration of total epilimnetic phosphorus and six-fold variation in algal biomass (Chl a). Duphniu were virtually absent in the <b>enclosures</b> with fish. The abundance of ciliates was one to three orders of magnitude lower when Daphnia were abundant. Addition of nutrients did not increase ciliate abundance in <b>enclosures</b> with Daphnia, but ciliate mean lengths were larger in these <b>enclosures.</b> Ciliate abundance increased with increasing zooplankton biomass when Daphnia were lacking, but it declined rapidly when Daphnia were abundant, producing a hyperbolic pattern. When the data for all the treatments were considered together, there was no relationship between copepod biomass and ciliate abundance, but positive relationships, although not highly significant, cmcrged when the data for <b>enclosures</b> with and without fish were considered separately. Our results suggest that large grazers are the most important factor regulating ciliate communitie...|$|R
40|$|Grazing {{management}} and seasonality strongly influence the recovery potential of herbaceous vegetation in semi-arid rangelands of southern Ethiopia after history of heavy grazing. We investigated effects of management (<b>enclosures</b> versus grazed landscapes), age of <b>enclosures</b> and seasonality related to rainfall (i. e., independent variables) on herbaceous biomass, grass basal cover, herbaceous species abundance, species richness and diversity in a savanna rangeland of southern Ethiopia. We further assessed {{the relationship between}} the herbaceous biomass and species richness. Management significantly affected most of the herbaceous response variables (i. e., comparing <b>enclosures</b> and open grazed). Herbaceous biomass, grass basal cover, herbaceous species richness and diversity were greater in <b>enclosures</b> than in grazed areas. Rainfall was also influential on herbaceous biomass, grass basal cover, abundance of herbaceous species, herbaceous species richness and diversity. Herbaceous biomass, abundance and diversity did not however vary with the age of <b>enclosures,</b> while herbaceous species richness appeared to decrease as the age of <b>enclosures</b> advanced. Grass basal cover initially decreased and later on increased with the age of <b>enclosures,</b> so that the older <b>enclosures</b> disclosed improvement of grass basal cover...|$|R
40|$|I {{designed}} and tested experimental <b>enclosures</b> with 1 -way exits {{for the study}} of emigration in house mice. Rapid emigration from barren <b>enclosures</b> supported the contention that all mice can find and use the exits if conditions in the <b>enclosures</b> are unsuitable for them. Invariable residency in resource-rich <b>enclosures</b> during the spring, summer and fall revealed that resident animals will not cross the exits during routine behaviors. The <b>enclosures</b> and exits permitted normal emigratory and residency behavior. In experiments on the role of emigration in population regulation, the number of resident mice was consistent in <b>enclosures</b> with fixed levels of resources. The number of residents was about double in <b>enclosures</b> with twice the resources. The first male and few females added in each trial usually became resident, and mice added subsequently usually emigrated. My data suggest that mice were regulating their numbers to available resources through spacing and emigration...|$|R

5|$|The {{purpose of}} Neolithic causewayed {{enclosures}} is unclear, {{and they probably}} had a variety of functions. As well as burials, indicating the site at Maiden Castle was important for rituals related to death, pottery from the coast and areas {{to the east and}} west indicate it was used as a meeting place which attracted people over long distances. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the <b>enclosure</b> was abandoned around 3,400BC. Arrowheads discovered in the ditches may indicate that activity at the <b>enclosure</b> met a violent end.|$|E
5|$|Through the <b>enclosure</b> ran the processional path, {{which led}} from the temple {{entrance}} through the main gate in the <b>enclosure</b> wall. The path was frequently decorated with sphinx statues and punctuated by barque stations, where the priests carrying the festival barque could set it down to rest during the procession. The processional path usually ended in a quay on the Nile, which served as the entrance point for river-borne visitors and the exit point for the festival procession when it travelled by water. In Old Kingdom pyramid temples, the quay adjoined an entire temple (the valley temple), which {{was linked to the}} pyramid temple by the processional causeway.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the main}} {{doors of the}} Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A {{staircase}} leads to the boardroom and trophy room.

40|$|We {{conducted}} large-scale, replicated {{experiments to}} test the effects of two parallel power lines on area use, behaviour, and activity of semidomestic reindeer in <b>enclosures.</b> Yearling female reindeer were released into four 50 &#x 00 D 7; 400 &#x 2009;m enclosures; two treatment <b>enclosures</b> with power lines and two control <b>enclosures.</b> Reindeer from two herds, one from Kautokeino (domestic tame) and one from V 5;g 5;, (domestic wild) were tested separately and compared. Individual location within the <b>enclosures</b> was not affected by the power lines. Effects on restless behaviour were ambiguous, with slightly more restless behaviour in the treatment <b>enclosures</b> for the domestic tame reindeer, while the domestic wild reindeer maintained a stable level in the treatment <b>enclosures,</b> increasing with time in the control <b>enclosures.</b> Activity changes were slightly more common among animals within treatment <b>enclosures</b> for both herds, with no indication of habituation during the experiment. The domestic wild reindeer had {{more than three times}} the amount of restless behaviour than the domestic tame reindeer. Our study indicates that for reindeer in <b>enclosures,</b> the disturbance from a power line construction is negligible. This suggests that power lines are a minor disturbing factor compared to human handling when using fenced in areas like grazing gardens in reindeer husbandry...|$|R

40|$|Mariculture of {{tropical}} sea cucumbers is promising, but the nursery rearing of juveniles is a bottleneck for farming and sea ranching. We conducted four medium-scale experiments lasting 3 – 6 weeks, using thousands of cultured juvenile sandfish Holothuria scabra, to optimise nursery rearing in mesh <b>enclosures</b> in earthen seawater ponds and to test rearing in <b>enclosures</b> in the sea. In one experiment, survival in fine-mesh <b>enclosures</b> (1 m 3; 660 -mm mesh) related nonlinearly to juvenile size, revealing a threshold body length of 5 – 8 mm for initial transfer from hatchery tanks. Survival in <b>enclosures</b> within ponds {{in the other}} experiments ranged from 78 – 97 %, and differences in growth rates among experiments were explained largely by seasonal differences in seawater temperatures in ponds. Stripped shadecloth units within fine-mesh <b>enclosures</b> increased feeding surfaces and improved growth rates by. 15 %. On the other hand, shading over the <b>enclosures</b> may lower growth rates. Following the rearing in fine-mesh <b>enclosures,</b> small juveniles (0. 5 to 1 g) were grown to stocking size (3 – 10 g) in coarse-mesh <b>enclosures</b> of 1 -mm mesh. Sand or mud added to coarse-mesh <b>enclosures</b> did not significantly improve growth compared to controls without sediment. Survival of sandfish juveniles in coarse-mesh <b>enclosures</b> set on the benthos within seagrass beds differed between two sheltered bays and growth was slow compared to groups within {{the same type of}} <b>enclosures</b> in an earthen pond. Our findings should lead to significant improvement in the cost-effectiveness of rearing sandfish juveniles to a stocking size compared to established methods and highlight the need for further research into nursery systems in the sea...|$|R
