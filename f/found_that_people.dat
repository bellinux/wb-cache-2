5|$|Nuttin {{frames the}} cause {{in terms of}} ownership, which has roots in {{economic}} psychology. The endowment effect has <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> ascribe more value to things merely because they own them. Nuttin puts the name-letter effect down to people automatically liking and valuing anything that is connected to them. As such, the name-letter effect {{is just one example}} of a more general mere-ownership effect. In which case, various verifiable predictions follow.|$|E

5|$|Time: In a {{study on}} {{preferences}} for initials, Stieger and LeBel <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who had changed their name after marrying continued to show a preference for the initial of their abandoned birth name decades into their marriage. Also, subjects who had been married {{less than two years}} already showed a name-letter effect for their new last name initial.|$|E
5|$|One study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with {{or without}} {{hypertension}} who excreted less than 3 grams of sodium per day in their urine (and therefore were taking in less than 3g/d) had {{a higher risk of}} death, stroke, or heart attack than those excreting 4 to 5 grams per day. Levels of 7g per day or more in people with hypertension were associated with higher mortality and cardiovascular events, but this was not found to be true for people without hypertension. The US FDA states that adults with hypertension and prehypertension should reduce daily intake to 1.5g.|$|E
5|$|Research by Chandler, Griffin, and Sorensen into a {{link between}} letter names and {{donations}} has been widely accepted. They analyzed the records of disaster relief donations after seven hurricanes (among others, Katrina, Rita and Mitch). They <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> who shared an initial with the hurricane were overrepresented as donors. They concluded {{that people want to}} overcome some of the negative feelings associated with the shared name and thus donate.Simonsohn suggested that implicit egotism only applies to cases where people are nearly indifferent between options, and therefore it would not apply to major decisions such as career choices, but would to low-stakes decisions such as choosing a charity.|$|E

2500|$|Another study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people's</b> {{memories}} for how distressed they felt {{when they learned}} of the 9/11 terrorist attacks changed over time and moreover, were predicted by their current appraisals {{of the impact of}} the attacks (Levine et al., 2004). It appears that memories of past emotional responses are not always accurate, and can even [...] be partially reconstructed based on their current appraisal of events.|$|R

5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base {{the level of}} their current spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E
5|$|Similar effects {{should be}} found for other {{attributes}} connected to the self, such as the numbers of one's birthday. Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> like the numbers representing the month and year of their birth more. They also found that subjects liked the year of their graduation more. In a study of Japanese students, Kitayama and Karasawa found a strong birthday-number effect for {{the day of the}} month, especially for numbers higher than 12. The higher numbers may be more uniquely associated with birthdays, whereas lower numbers could be more saturated with other meanings.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{top secret}} nature of the work, the Los Alamos Laboratory was isolated. Feynman indulged his curiosity by {{discovering}} the combination locks on cabinets and desks used to secure papers. He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> tended to leave their safes unlocked, or leave them on the factory settings, or write the combinations down, or use easily guessable combinations like dates. Feynman played jokes on colleagues. In one case he found the combination to a locked filing cabinet by trying the numbers he thought a physicist would use (it proved to be 27–18–28 after the base of natural logarithms, e = 2.71828...), {{and found that the}} three filing cabinets where a colleague kept a set of atomic bomb research notes all had the same combination. He left a series of notes in the cabinets as a prank, which initially spooked his colleague, Frederic de Hoffmann, into thinking a spy or saboteur had gained access to atomic bomb secrets.|$|E

5|$|In {{controlled}} {{studies in}} the lab, Hodson and Olson tried to find evidence of people liking everyday things (e.g. foods, animals) that matched their name initials. No evidence was found, neither for a between-subjects effect (e.g. Judy did not like things starting with J, such as jam, more than Doug liked things starting with J), nor for a within-individuals effect (e.g. Judy did not like jam more than honey).The researchers did discover a small but reliable effect of initials on brand-name preferences within individuals (e.g. Hank did likeHondamore than non-matching brands).They speculated that brand names {{are more likely to}} communicate identity to others than other everyday things.Stieger extended this research by looking at buying preferences for product names. He <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> were disproportionately more likely to buy products matching their initials.The effect mainly occurred for big brands. No correlation was found between the strength of an individual's name-letter effect and the strength of his or her name-letter-branding effect.|$|E
5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people</b> with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who fail to make improvements in their health after one year.|$|E

30|$|Regardless of the objectively correct {{form for}} {{explanations}} in psychology, these {{might not be}} the explanations <b>that</b> <b>people</b> subjectively find satisfying. Indeed, prior work has <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>people’s</b> subjective sense of understanding or satisfaction is often decoupled from whether or not an explanation is accurate (Trout, 2002, 2016). For example, people tend to prefer teleological explanations even when they are not appropriate, as for natural phenomena (Lombrozo & Carey, 2006). People also prefer longer explanations (Kikas, 2003; Langer, Blank, & Chanowitz, 1978), explanations with more causal factors (Zemla, Sloman, Bechlivanidis, & Lagnado, 2017), and explanations that additionally provide a vacuous label for a phenomenon (Giffin, Wilkenfeld, & Lombrozo, 2017).|$|R
