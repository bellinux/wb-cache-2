Take two <b>examples</b> <b>for</b> <b>illustration.</b> The understanding of the correspondence between interleaving and matching is of huge importance, since matching has been the method used in the beginning (modified from Morse theory). A summary of works can be found in Vin de Silva et al. Many theorems can be proved much more easily in a more intuitive setting. Another example is the relationship between the construction of different complexes from point clouds. It has long been noticed that Čech and Vietoris-Rips complexes are related. Specifically, [...] The essential relationship between Cech and Rips complexes can be seen much more clearly in categorical language.|$|E
