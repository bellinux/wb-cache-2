A popular method for defeating descending slashes was to simply beat the sword aside.

If the angle of the block was drastic enough, the curve of the nihontō's blade would cause the attacker's blade to slide along its counter and off to the side.|$|E

To minimize <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> of the machined glass, which is common when cutting materials harder than 50 HRC, adopting right parameters is required followed by additional effort and cost.

The work was conducted under plane stress conditions in a hard, brittle limestone. The purpose of these experiments was to first {{gain an understanding of}} the basic crack propagation process under a sharp indenter, and second, to determine how the crack propagation process could be used to improve mechanical fragmentation systems. Three methods of rock fracture with the wedge indenter were investigated in this program. These were the confined indentation tests, the unconfined splitting tests, and the <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> tests. The confined indention tests represent worst case conditions for crack growth and formed the lower bound on fracture efficiency.

Little independent evidence regarding their mechanical properties exists to facilitate material selection process. The {{purpose of this}} study was to measure the <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> resistance and flexural strength of the novel PICN and RNC materials and compare it to two commonly used feldspathic ceramic (FC) and leucite reinforced glass-ceramic (LRGC) CAD/CAM materials that share the same indications. Materials and Methods: For the <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> test, 20 specimens/group were tested. Square prism specimens 10 10 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks, polished and adhesively attached on a 4 mm thick resin bed fabricated in a custom holder. A 120 degree sharp conical indenter was mounted on a universal testing machine and the specimens edge was positioned in distances varying from 0. 1 mm to 0. 7 mm horizontally from the indenter tip. Two <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> tests were performed per sample at a crosshead speed of 0. 1 mm/min and the critical force at which a chip spalled off the edge was recorded. One-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). For the flexural strength test, 22 specimens/group were tested. Beam specimens 18 4 1. 2 mm were sectioned from the commercially available CAD/CAM blocks and polished. A 3 -point flexure test was performed on a universal testing machine with a test fixture support span of 15 mm and the crosshead speed set at 0. 5 mm/min. Weibull statistics determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Flexural modulus and work of fracture were also measured and one-way ANOVA determined intergroup differences (f¿=. 05). Results: Regarding <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> resistance, one-way ANOVA revealed significant differences with the materials ranking RNC 3 ̆eLRGC=FC 3 ̆ePICN (P=. 05).

Experiments are conducted {{to study the}} machinability of Si 3 N 4 under LAMill. The effects of temperature on cutting forces, tool wear, surface integrity, <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> and material removal mechanisms are investigated. It is shown that when temperature increases, cutting force and tool wear are significantly decreased, surface integrity is improved, chip size is increased and material removal demonstrates more plastic characteristics. The mechanisms of <b>edge</b> <b>chipping</b> at elevated temperature are investigated theoretically and experimentally. When temperature is above the softening point and below the brittle/ductile transition temperature, the mechanism is mainly through softening. When temperature is above the brittle/ductile transition temperature, toughening mechanism contributes significantly to the reduced <b>edge</b> <b>chipping.</b> The coupled effect of softening and toughening mechanisms shows that temperature range between 1200 to 1400 °C has the most significant effect to reduce <b>edge</b> <b>chipping.</b> Distinct element method (DEM) is applied to simulate the micro-mechanical behavior of Si 3 N 4. First, quantitative relationships between particle level parameters and macro-properties of the bonded particle specimens are obtained, which builds a foundation for simulation of Si 3 N 4. Then, extensive DEM simulations are conducted to model the material removal of machining Si 3 N 4. The simulation results demonstrate that DEM can reproduce the conceptual material removal model summarized from experimental observations, including the initiation and propagation of cracks, chip formation process and material removal mechanisms. It is shown that material removal is mainly realized by propagation of lateral cracks in machining of silicon nitride. At the elevated temperature under laser assisted machining, lateral cracks are easier to propagate to form larger machined chips, there are fewer and smaller median cracks therefore less surface/subsurface damage, and crushing-type material removal is reduced. The material removal at elevated temperature demonstrates more plastic characteristics. The numerical results agree very well with experimental observations. It shows that DEM is a promising method to model the micro-mechanical process of machining Si 3 N 4...|$|E
