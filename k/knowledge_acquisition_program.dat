40|$|Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) {{is a new}} {{discipline}} which {{investigates the}} inductive construction of first-order clausal theories from examples and background knowledge. We survey the most important theories and methods of this new field. First, various problem specifications of ILP are formalized in semantic settings for ILP, yielding a ''model-theory'' for ILP. Second, a generic ILP algorithm is presented. Third, the inference rules and corresponding operators used in ILP are presented, resulting in a ''proof-theory'' for ILP. Fourth, since inductive inference does not produce statements which are assured to follow from what is given, inductive inferences require an alternative form of justification. This can {{take the form of}} either probabilistic support or logical constraints on the hypothesis language. Information compression techniques used within ILP are presented within a unifying Bayesian approach to confirmation and corroboration of hypotheses. Also, different ways to constrain the hypothesis language or specify the declarative bias are presented. Fifth, some advanced topics in ILP are addressed. These include aspects of computational learning theory as applied to ILP, and the issue of predicate invention. Finally, we survey some applications and implementations of ILP.

The study elicits change readiness factors, at the individual and firm levels, that influence the <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> process and {{are based on the}} context of professional service firms. Design/methodology/approach – The qualitative study is grounded in interpretive philosophy and adopts a multiple-case study design. Three New Zealand Professional Service firms were analyzed for this study. Using grounded theory analysis, categories and concepts of change readiness that shape <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> were identified. Findings– <b>Knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> understanding, <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> context and individual differences, represent primary dimensions defining change readiness for the <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> process. Finally, distinctive firm archetypes, inter-profession differences and professionals’ demography, affect the way change readiness elements shape the <b>knowledge</b> <b>acquisition</b> process in the firms studied.

The study involves three professional service firms; hence, interpretation of the findings is limited.
