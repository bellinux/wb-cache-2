5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in tone {{between the}} two {{versions}} of the elegy; the early one ends with an emphasis on the narrator joining with the obscure common man, while the later version ends with an emphasis on how it is natural for humans to want to be known. The later ending also explores the narrator's own death, whereas the earlier version serves as a Christian consolation regarding death.|$|E
5|$|On {{some of the}} figures, however, {{there still}} remains clear {{evidence}} of painting in carbon black. The apparent explanation {{for this is that}} over the long period that Michelangelo was at work, he probably, for a variety of reasons, varied his technique. Things that might affect the degree of finish achieved on a particular giornata include the heat and humidity of the day and the length of daylight hours. Whatever the reason for the difference <b>is,</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in approach to the light and shade on the individual figures is clearly apparent.|$|E

5|$|The school vacated {{the entire}} 199293 season and every game it played from the 199596 season through the 199899 season. This {{included}} the 1997 National Invitation Tournament title and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament title. It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993, 1996 and 1998. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between forfeiting {{a game and}} vacating a game; a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win. This included virtually the entire career of Fisher's successor, Brian Ellerbe. However, it did not include all games that Webber played or was eligible because all but the final two games of his freshman year were retained.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no single}} treatment, and the {{effectiveness}} of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference,</b> rather than a disease that must be treated or cured.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear, {{sometimes}} referred to as windshear or wind gradient, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in wind speed and direction over a relatively short distance in the Earth's atmosphere. Wind shear can be broken down into vertical and horizontal components, with horizontal wind shear seen across weather fronts and near the coast, and vertical shear typically near the surface, though also at higher levels in the atmosphere near upper level jets and frontal zones aloft.|$|E

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure on the outer edge {{as well as the}} outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, {{to the rest of the}} text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice on the outer edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E
5|$|Hume {{notes that}} the skull of the Rodrigues {{starling}} {{was about the same}} size as that of the hoopoe starling, but the skeleton was smaller. Though the Rodrigues starling was clearly able to fly, its sternum was smaller compared to that of other starlings; however, it may not have required powerful flight, due to the small area and topography of Rodrigues. The two starlings differed mainly in details of the skull, jaws, and sternum. The maxilla of the Rodrigues starling was shorter, less curved, had a less slender tip, and had a stouter mandible. Not enough remains of the Rodrigues starling have been found to assess whether it was sexually dimorphic. Subfossils show a disparity in size between specimens, but {{this may be due to}} individual variation, as the differences are gradual, with no distinct size classes. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in bill length and shape between two Rodrigues starling specimens, which could indicate dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|Standard cards can be {{purchased}} at vending machines within all Metrorail stations, at Metro sales offices, selected retail stores, and online. The purchase price includes $2 for the card itself plus an initial fare value, which varies depending on where they are purchased: cards purchased at stations cost $10 ($2 for the card and $8 fare value), while those purchased online cost either $10 or $30 ($2 for the card and $8 or $28 fare value). The cards can be reloaded using farecard vending machines or using cash at fareboxes onboard buses. Until 2016, riders could also add value to their SmarTrip cards by trading in paper farecards (a used farecard up to $20, or an unused farecard of any value). There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> between SmarTrip and CharmCard on the maximum value that can be stored on the card. SmarTrip can store up to $300 in value, while CharmCard can store up to $200.|$|E
