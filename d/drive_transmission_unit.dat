40|$|WO 15097040 A 2 [EN] Disclosed is an {{apparatus}} for transmitting energy using laser radiation, said apparatus comprising a <b>transmission</b> <b>unit</b> which emits an energy-transmitting laser beam that is directed in a targeted manner onto a reception <b>unit,</b> the <b>transmission</b> <b>unit</b> and the reception unit being {{oriented relative to}} one another {{in such a way that}} the laser beam emitted by the <b>transmission</b> <b>unit</b> is always incident on the reception unit. In order to improve operational safety of said apparatus, an enveloping-space monitoring unit verifies whether any foreign object is located in an enveloping space extending around the energy-transmitting laser beam, and when a foreign object is detected in the enveloping space, the enveloping-space monitoring unit generates a turn-off signal which prevents the energy-transmitting laser beam from emerging from the <b>transmission</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|R

40|$|Modes of {{operation}} adapt block ciphers to many applications. Among the encryption modes, only CFB (Cipher Feedback) has {{both of the}} following properties: Firstly it allows <b>transmission</b> <b>units</b> shorter than the block-cipher length to be encrypted and sent without delay and message expansion. Secondly, it can resynchronize after the loss of such <b>transmission</b> <b>units.</b> However, CFB is inefficient in such applications, since for every <b>transmission</b> <b>unit,</b> regardless how short, {{a call to the}} block cipher is needed. We propose a new mode {{of operation}} based on CFB which remedies this problem. Our proposal, OCFB, is almost optimally efficient (i. e., almost as many message bits are encrypted as block-cipher output bits produced) and it can self-synchronize after the loss or insertion of <b>transmission</b> <b>units.</b> We prove the security of CFB and OCFB in the sense of modern cryptography...|$|R
