Heuristically, {{if we have a}} space M for which each point m ∊ M corresponds to an algebro-geometric object Um, then we can assemble these objects into a tautological family U over M. (For example, the Grassmannian G(k, V) carries a rank <b>k</b> <b>bundle</b> whose fiber at any point L ∊ G(k, V) is simply the linear subspace L ⊂ V.) M is called a base space of the family U. We say that [...] such a family is universal if any family of algebro-geometric objects T over any base space B is the pullback of U along a unique map B → M. A fine moduli space is a space M which is the base of a universal family.|$|E

We show that every Riemannian (or unitary) vector bundle with parallel curvature over M is an associated vector bundle of a canonical principal bundle, with the connection {{inherited from the}} principal bundle. The problem of finding Riemannian (or unitary) vector bundles with parallel curvature then reduces to finding representations of the structure group of the canonical principal bundle. This paper concerns connections on Riemannian vector bundles over simply connected symmetric spaces. Given a hypothesis about the Riemannian curvature of a symmetric space, we show that every Riemannian vector bundle with parallel curvature over that space is an associated vector bundle of a canonical principal bundle, with the connection inherited from the principal bundle. The problem of finding Riemannian vector bundles with parallel curvature then reduces to finding representations of the structure group of the canonical principal bundle. Our results apply also to unitary vector bundles, since a C <b>k</b> <b>bundle</b> {{can be viewed as}} an R 2 <b>k</b> <b>bundle</b> together with an additional structure...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Users {{are often}} {{faced with the}} problem of finding {{complementary}} items that together achieve a single common goal (e. g., a starter kit for a novice astronomer, a collection of question/answers related to low-carb nutrition, a set of places to visit on holidays). In this article, we argue that for some application scenarios returning item bundles is more appropriate than ranked lists. Thus we define composite retrieval as the problem of finding <b>k</b> <b>bundles</b> of complementary items. Beyond complementarity of items, the bundles must be valid w. r. t. a given budget, and the answer set of <b>k</b> <b>bundles</b> must exhibit diversity. We formally define the problem and characterize its complexity. We prove that the problem in its general form is NP-hard and that also the special cases in which each bundle is formed by only one item, or only one bundle is sought, are hard. Our characterization however suggests us how to adopt a two-phase approach (Produceand-Choose, or PAC) in which we first produce many valid bundles, and then we choose k among them. For the first phase we devise two ad-hoc clustering algorithms, while for the second phase we adapt heuristics with approximation guarantees. We also devise another approach which is based on first finding a k-clustering and then selecting a valid bundle from each of the produced clusters (Cluster-and-Pick, or CAP). We compare experimentally the proposed methods on a large real-world database of user-generated restaurant reviews from Yahoo! Local, exploring their performance under a variety of settings. Our experiments show that when diversity is highly important, CAP is the best option, while when diversity is less important, a PAC approach constructing bundles around randomly chosen pivots, is better...|$|R

Our main result {{asserts that}} {{for any given}} numbers C and D the class of simply {{connected}} closed smooth manifolds of dimension m < 7 which admit a Riemannian metric with sectional curvature bounded in absolute value by |K | ≤ C and diameter uniformly bounded from above by D contains only finitely many diffeomorphism types.

40|$|Sweet sorghum has {{potential}} as an energy crop in the Southwest since, compared to corn, it requires less fertilizer and water, is cheaper to grow, and requires less energy to process into ethanol. The {{purpose of this}} study is to determine the feasibility of obtaining two crops of sweet sorghum from a single seeding.
