5|$|Brussels also <b>has</b> <b>better</b> {{transport}} links than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil servants which reduce costs. Some commentators further underline that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax {{after a long}} and hard working day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges {{by the city of}} Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting. The controversy died down when the European Parliament decided to officially buy the buildings on 24 October 2006.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy <b>has</b> <b>better</b> {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, <b>has</b> <b>better</b> results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E

50|$|The {{expression}} <b>had</b> <b>better</b> <b>has</b> similar {{meaning to}} should and ought when expressing recommended or expedient behavior: I <b>had</b> <b>better</b> {{get down to}} work (it {{can also be used}} to give instructions with the implication of a threat: you <b>had</b> <b>better</b> give me the money or else). The had of this expression is similar to a modal: it governs the bare infinitive, it is defective in that it is not replaceable by any other form of the verb have, and it behaves syntactically as an auxiliary verb. For this reason the expression <b>had</b> <b>better,</b> considered as a kind of compound verb, is sometimes classed along with the modals or as a semimodal.|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of research were to find out: 1) {{which one is}} better learning achievement, scientific NHT, scientific TAPPS, or scientific classical, 2) {{which one is better}} learning achievement, students with high, medium, or low AQ, 3) in each learning models, which one is better learning achievement, students with high, medium, or low AQ, 4) in each AQ level, which one is better learning achievement, scientific NHT, scientific TAPPS, or scientific classical. This research was the quasi experimental research with 3 × 3 factorial design. The population of research was all grade VIII students of Junior High School in Surakarta. The samples were chosen by using stratified cluster random sampling. The instruments that used were achievement test and Adversity Quotient (AQ) questionare. The proposed hypothesis of the research were tested by using the unbalanced two-way ANOVA. The results of this research were as follows. 1) Scientific NHT <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than scientific TAPPS and scientific classical, while scientific TAPPS <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than scientific classical. 2) The students with high AQ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than medium and low AQ, while the students with medium AQ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than low AQ. 3) In scientific NHT, the students with high, medium, and low AQ had the same learning achievement. In scientific TAPPS, the students with high AQ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than medium AQ, while the students with high and medium AQ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than low AQ. In scientific classical, the students with high AQ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than medium and low AQ, while the students with medium AQ <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than low AQ. 4) At the students with high AQ, scientific NHT and scientific classical had the same learning achievement with scientific TAPPS, while scientific NHT <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than scientific classical. At the students with medium AQ, scientific NHT had the same learning achievement with scientific TAPPS, while scientific NHT and scientific TAPPS <b>had</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement than scientific classical.
