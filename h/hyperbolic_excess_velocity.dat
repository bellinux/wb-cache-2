40|$|In {{support of}} future NASA {{asteroid}} sample return missions, this thesis examines strategies {{to reduce the}} number of feasible asteroid targets. Reachable sets are defined in a reduced classical orbital element space. The boundary of this reduced space is obtained by extremizing a family of convex combinations of orbital elements. The resulting group of optimization problems is solved using a direct collocation pseudospectral technique by a MATLAB application package called DIDO. The reachable sets are examined to narrow the possible valid asteroid choices in order to aid in mission design and analysis of alternative targets.

These objects may provide access to potential resources, as well as be potential scientific mission opportunities. A {{statistical approach is used}} to assess the fraction of the near-Earth object population with a given set of Keplerian elements. This is used to estimate the number of objects with the potential to fly-by the Earth with low relative velocities. The circular restricted three-body problem is then used to show that objects approaching Earth at low <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>excess</b> <b>velocities</b> can potentially be gravitationally captured at Earth. The Tisserand parameter, used as an approximation of the Jacobi constant, can be used to delimit the orbital regions from were low-energy transfers should be expected to exist and asteroids could possibly be transported at a minimum expenditure of energy. Finally, a semi-analytical approximation of the gravitational perturbation in the CR 3 BP is used to assess the feasible asteroid transport fluxes of capturable material that could be achieved by judicious use of Earth gravitational perturbations...|$|R
40|$|Recently Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) {{as a main}} {{propulsion}} system has been investigated as an option to support manned space missions to near-Earth destinations for the NASA Gateway spacecraft. High efficiency SEP systems are able {{to reduce the amount}} of propellant long duration chemical missions require, ultimately reducing the required mass delivered to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) by a launch vehicle. However, for long duration interplanetary Mars missions, using SEP as the sole propulsion source alone may not be feasible due to the long trip times to reach and insert into the destination orbit. By combining an SEP propulsion system with a chemical propulsion system the mission is able to utilize the high-efficiency SEP for sustained vehicle acceleration and deceleration in heliocentric space and the chemical system for orbit insertion maneuvers and trans-earth injection, eliminating the need for long duration spirals. By capturing chemically instead of with low-thrust SEP, Mars stay time increases by nearly 200 days. Additionally, the size the of chemical propulsion system can be significantly reduced from that of a standard Mars mission because the SEP system greatly decreases the Mars arrival and departure <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>excess</b> <b>velocities</b> (V(sub infinity)) ...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} {{completely}} leave one planet's gravitational field to reach another, a hyperbolic trajectory {{relative to the}} departure planet is necessary, with excess velocity added to (or subtracted from) the departure planet's orbital velocity around the Sun. The desired heliocentric transfer orbit to an outer planet will have its perihelion at the departure planet, requiring the <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>excess</b> <b>velocity</b> to be applied in the posigrade direction, when the spacecraft is away from the Sun. To an inner destination planet, aphelion {{will be at the}} departure planet, and the excess velocity is applied in the retrograde direction when the spacecraft is toward the Sun. Since interplanetary spacecraft spend a large period of time in the heliocentric orbit between the planets, which are at relatively large distances away, the patched-conic approximation is much more accurate for interplanetary trajectories than for translunar trajectories. The patch point between the hyperbolic trajectory relative to the departure planet and the heliocentric transfer orbit can be assumed to occur at the planet's sphere of influence radius relative to the Sun, as defined above in Orbital flight.|$|E

40|$|The {{equations}} yielding {{the performance}} of a single lunar flyby in removing incoming <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>excess</b> <b>velocity</b> to capture payloads on interplanetary trajectories are briefly derived. The impossibility of using a single lunar flyby to capture a body entering the earth-moon system with a hyperbolic velocity in excess of about 1. 9 km/s is discussed, and a method of using a double flyby of the moon to significantly improve this performance is developed. The equations for achieving a double lunar flyby are derived by solving the orbital equations and Lambert's problem both for the incoming trajectory in the plane of the moon's orbit and for arbitrary declination. For the in-plane case it is shown that the maximum removable <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>excess</b> <b>velocity</b> is 2. 2687 km/s.
