5|$|In {{the third}} Test, too, Ring's batting made more <b>impact</b> <b>than</b> his bowling. A wet pitch led to 22 wickets {{falling on the}} first day, and {{temporary}} Australian captain Arthur Morris rejigged his batting order {{at the end of}} the day, opening the second innings with Ian Johnson and Gil Langley, sending Geff Noblet in when Johnson was out and then Ring as a second nightwatchman when Noblet was out. Ring lasted into the second day when conditions were easier, and top-scored for the Australian team with 67, which remained his best score in Tests. He took three of the four wickets that fell as West Indies successfully chased a target of 233 on Christmas Day.|$|E

However, on Meiyappan's insistence, Ganesan {{played the role of}} Raju. The role of Dr. Gopal went to S. A.

5|$|Jarre's {{follow-up}} album, Équinoxe, {{was released}} in 1978. It was composed with sequencers, particularly on the bass, and features a more baroque and classical style than Oxygène, with more emphasis on melodic development. Though its sales were still very healthy, it had less of an <b>impact</b> <b>than</b> Oxygène, but the following year Jarre held a large open-air concert on Bastille Day, at the Place de la Concorde. The free outdoor event set a new world record for {{the largest number of}} spectators ever at an open-air concert, drawing more than 1million spectators. Although it {{was not the first time}} he had performed in concert (Jarre had already played at the Paris Opera Ballet), the 40minute-long event, which used projections of light, images and fireworks, served as a blueprint for Jarre's future concerts. Its popularity helped create a surge in sales—a further 800,000 records were sold between 14 July and 31 August 1979—and introduced the Frenchman to Francis Rimbert, who worked for Jarre during two decades on a full-time basis.|$|E

40|$|We {{analysed}} {{the environmental}} impacts of three biogas systems based on dairy manure, sorghum and maize. The geographical scope of the analysis is the Po valley, in Italy. The anaerobic digestion of manure guarantees high GHG (Green House Gases) savings thanks to the avoided emissions from the traditional storage and management of raw manure as organic fertiliser. GHG emissions for maize and sorghum-based systems, on the other hand, {{are similar to those of}} the Italian electricity mix. In crop-based systems, the plants with open-tank storage of digestate emit 50 % more GHG than those with gas-tight tanks. In all the environmental impact categories analysed (acidification, particulate matter emissions, and eutrophication), energy crops based systems have much higher <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> the Italian electricity mix. Maize-based systems cause higher <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> sorghum, due to more intensive cultivation. Manure-based pathways have always lower <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> the energy crops based pathways, however, all biogas systems cause much higher <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> the current Italian electricity mix. We conclude that manure digestion is the most efficient way to reduce GHG emissions; although there are trade-offs with other local environmental impacts. Biogas production from crops; although not providing environmental benefits per se; may be regarded as an option to facilitate the deployment of manure digestion...|$|R

30|$|As {{energy sources}} and {{consumption}} patterns are critical towards overall {{environmental impacts of}} energy consumption practices, environmentally friendly energy sources should be promoted.

Similarly, anthropogenic emissions due to fossil fuel have comparatively higher emission and negative environmental <b>impacts,</b> <b>than</b> that of biogenic emission from burning wood materials (Bergman and Bowe 2008). Therefore, while choosing energy sources for the timber production process, {{there needs to be}} proper care in the use of renewable energy instead of fossil fuel-based energy techniques. Even if fossil fuel based energy source are to be used, efforts must be made to use as little energy as possible.|$|R

25|$|As {{with many}} widely used natural products, {{the demand for}} menthol greatly exceeds the supply from natural sources.

40|$|The {{climate impacts}} from {{bioenergy}} involve an important time aspect. Using forest residues for energy {{may result in}} high initial emissions, but net emissions are reduced over time since, if the residues were left on the ground, they would decompose and release CO 2 to the atmosphere. This article investigates the climate impacts from bioenergy with special focus on the time aspects. More specifically, we analyze the climate impacts of forest residues and stumps where combustion related emissions are compensated by avoided emissions from leaving {{them on the ground}} to decompose. These biofuels are compared with fossil gas and coal. Net emissions are defined as emissions from utilizing the fuel minus emissions from a reference case of no utilization. Climate impacts are estimated using the measures radiative forcing and global average surface temperature. We find that the climate impacts from using forest residues and stumps depend on the decomposition rates and the time perspective over which the analysis is done. Over a 100 year perspective, branches and tops have lower climate <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> stumps which in turn have lower <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> fossil gas and coal. Over a 20 year time perspective, branches and tops have lower climate <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> all other fuels but the relative difference is smaller. However, stumps have slightly higher climate impacts over 20 years than fossil gas but lower <b>impacts</b> <b>than</b> coal. Regarding metrics for climate impacts, over shorter time scales, approximately 30 years or less, radiative forcing overestimates the climate impacts compared with impacts expressed by global surface temperature change, which is due to the inertia of the climate system. We also find that establishing willow on earlier crop land may reduce atmospheric CO 2, provided new land is available. However, these results are inconclusive since we haven't considered the effects of producing the agricultural crops elsewhere...|$|R
