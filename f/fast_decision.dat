40|$|Abstract. A central {{problem in}} {{information}} retrieval is the automated classification of text documents. While many existing methods achieve good levels of performance, they generally require levels of computation that {{prevent them from}} making sufficiently <b>fast</b> <b>decisions</b> in some applied setting. Using insights gained from examining the way humans make <b>fast</b> <b>decisions</b> when classifying text documents, two new text classification algorithms are developed based on sequential sampling processes. These algorithms make extremely <b>fast</b> <b>decisions,</b> because they need to examine {{only a small number}} of words in each text document. Evaluation against the Reuters- 21578 collection shows both techniques have levels of performance that approach benchmark methods, and the ability of one of the classifiers to produce realistic measures of confidence in its decisions is shown to be useful for prioritizing relevant documents. ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{research}} investigates how people use observed decision time to form expectations of others' behavior in social dilemmas. In four studies, participants received information about others' <b>decision</b> times (<b>fast</b> or slow) {{and were asked}} to estimate how much they contributed to a common pool. People believe <b>fast</b> <b>decisions</b> are more extreme than slow decisions; in other words, they assume that <b>fast</b> <b>decisions</b> are either extremely selfish or extremely cooperative. People also believe that fast deciders are less moral (Studies 1 and 2) and less conflicted (Study 2) than slow deciders. Beliefs about decision time depend on whether time can be attributed to self-paced reaction times or external time constraints. When decisions are made under external time constraints, time has inconsistent or heterogeneous effects on behavioral expectations (Study 2). Decision time also moderates the effects of other informational cues: Positive facial expressions and perceptions of trustworthiness have stronger effects on expectations when paired with <b>fast</b> <b>decisions</b> (Study 3). Finally, observed decision time also has behavioral consequences – people make more extreme decisions when interacting with a partner who decided quickly (Study 4). Observed decision time plays a crucial role in how expectations of others' behavior are formed...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To examine if neurotics are the {{exception}} to the speed-accuracy rule and in fact are more accurate when making <b>faster</b> <b>decisions.</b> Design: The study employed a laboratory-based, cross-sectional design. Method: One hundred and ninety-six elite young cricketers completed measures of neuroticism before performing a cricket-specific computer-based decision-making task. Results: Neuroticism significantly moderated the relationship between decision-making time and decision-making accuracy such that decreases in response time were associated with improvements in decision-making accuracy for individuals with high levels of neuroticism. Conversely, decreases in response time were associated with decrements in accuracy for individuals with low levels of neuroticism. Conclusions: The study presents the first data that confirm that speed accuracy trade-offs do not occur across all individuals; individuals with high levels of neuroticism benefit from making <b>faster</b> <b>decisions...</b>|$|R

Slime moulds were given a simple discrimination task: selecting the highest-quality food item from a set of three options. We investigated the effect of two stressors, light exposure and hunger, on the speed and accuracy of decision-making. We also examined the effect of task difficulty. When given a difficult discrimination task, stressed individuals tend to make <b>faster</b> <b>decisions</b> than non-stressed individuals. This effect was reversed in plasmodia given easy discrimination tasks, where stressed individuals made slower decisions than non-stressed individuals. We found evidence of SATs, such that individuals who made <b>fast</b> <b>decisions</b> were more likely to make costly errors by selecting the worst possible food option. Our results suggest that SATs occur in a wider range of taxa than previously considered...|$|R

The {{state-of-the-art}} video {{coding standard}} H. 264 /AVC achieves sig-nificant coding performance improvement by choosing the rate-distortion (RD) optimized encoding mode {{from a list}} of candidate modes at the cost of intensive computations, which limits the practical application of H. 264 /AVC.

Tyto algoritmy jsou poté rozebrány detailněji. Dále se tato práce zabývá návrhem algoritmu Genetického Programování (GP), který je použit pro vytváření klasifikátoru obrazových dat. Vytvořený klasifikátor je použit jako alternativní způsob klasifikace objektů v obraze ve frameworku Viola-Jones. V práci je rozebrána implementace algoritmů, které jsou implementovány v jazyce Java. Algoritmus GP je integrován do knihovny “Image Processing Extension” programu RapidMiner. Algoritmy VFDT a CVFDT jsou testovány na syntetických a reálných textových datech.
