5000|$|Decatising or decatizing, {{also known}} as crabbing, blowing, and <b>decating,</b> {{is the process of}} making {{permanent}} a textile finish on a cloth, so that it does not shrink during garment making. The word comes from the French , which means to remove the [...] or finish of the wool. Though used mainly for wool, the term is also applied to processes performed on fabrics of other fibers, such as cotton, linen or polyester. Crabbing and blowing are minor variations on the general process for wool, which is to roll the cloth onto a roller and blow steam through it.|$|E

The main causes and possible perspectives of that development are elaborated. There are explored philosophical ideas which influenced the emergence of political science, the process of its institutionalisation and the relation between political science and political philosophy. The analysis of the process of institutionalisation aims at identification of the main causes of the conflict between two disciplines. The culmination of that conflict occured at sixth decade of twentieth century and was named “The Behavioral Revolution”.

40|$|Nearly two <b>decates</b> ago, Arabs {{who volunteered}} to aid the anti-Soviet {{struggle}} in Afghanistan dispersed from the conflict zone to pursue their newfound passion: jihad {{in the path of}} God. Known as “Arab Afghans,” these veterans participated in national insurgencies and civil wars, facilitated international terrorism and became ideologues of global jihad. Today, Iraq’s global jihadists are facing a similar moment. Al-Qa`ida in Iraq (AQI) is under tremendous military pressure from Sunni tribes, nationalist insurgents and U. S. - Iraqi counter-insurgency operations. There is a distinct possibility that AQI could be driven out of Iraq in the near future. It is unclear, however, what the movement will do next. The experiences of Arab Afghans suggest that the defeat of AQI may generate new threats associated with the dispersal of its fighters in the region and around the world. Therefore, it is vitally important to revisit the experiences of the Arab Afghans to develop lessons for present day Iraq...|$|R

The cancerous and non-cancerous areas were selectively obtained by microdissection, and the methylation status of the CDX 2 promoter of each area was assessed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). In all 10 cases, CDX 2 expression was clearly observed in the nucleus of the non-cancerous background of the intestinal metaplasic area, where the unmethylation pattern of the CDX 2 gene promoter prevailed with reduced MeCP 2 expression.

40|$|There {{has been}} an {{increased}} interest in researching and developing technical solutions for underwater vehicles the last years. In most cases, underwater vehicles are expensive and not affordable to private individuals. Development of low cost ROVs has lately been increasing supported by an active Do-It-Yourself (DIY) community. The OpenROV project has contributed to this community by producing cheap ROVs with open source software, encouraging users {{to develop their own}} plugins. Development of a lost cost ROV were carried out fall 2014, as a project thesis follestad. The result was a low-cost ROV prototype, called Neptunus using OpenROV computer hardware and software. The growth of the internet over the last <b>decates</b> has motivated the development of web applications. The communication between web servers and clients has been dominated by the use of the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the request-response pattern. In the recent years, developments have been made to facilitate bi-directional communication protocols. The WebSockets protocol provides this, {{as an alternative to the}} HTTP protocol. Node. js is a runtime environment that uses the Google V 8 JavaScript engine to run Node. js web servers. The use of the WebSockets protocol is facilitated in Node. js web servers, making it a desireable choice for real-time applications. Design of hardware and software solutions for the ROV Neptunus was performed. This includes review of frameworks and software tools. A Node. js web server was implemented on a BeagleBone computer running Linux Ubuntu. The Node. js specific framework Express. io was used. A user interface consisting of an operator interface and a developer interface was implemented in JavaScript. The operator interface contains methods for controlling the ROV with the use of keyboard, touchscreen and joystick. The operator interface contains functionality vital in development such as logging and plotting. A control module was implemented to control the ROV with either motion control or manual control. This included a thrust allocation procedure for the motion control mode. A camera module for streaming of the video was implemented. The mjpg-streamer application was used to stream the video from the camera to the client. A simulator module was implemented to facilitate parallel development. Remote monitoring and control over WiFi was implemented. This included methods for taking and giving control, as only one operator can be in control at any time. All the implemented functionality was tested. Documentation of the system and relevant software tools for development was included...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmmonium (18 -crown- 6 -ether) cadmium (II) tri-thiocyanate [(NH 4 [Cd(NCS) 3]. C 12 H 24 O 6] (ACCTC) is the {{potential}} inorgani-organic hybrid material, which has many applications {{in the field of}} laser displays and optical communications. The crystal growth of ACCTC has been carried out by slow evaporation solvent technique (SEST) at ambient temperature and its dimension was found to be 10 × 5 × 5 mm 3. The single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis has confirmed the cell parameter of the grown crystal. The FT-IR spectrum is used to identify the functional groups present in ACCTC. The optical transmission is found by UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer. From the optical spectrum, good prominent optical transmission in the entire ultra violet to IR region has been well proved and hence it is an essential requirement for non-linear optical applications. Thermal analysis carried out on ACCTC revealed that it is thermally stable up to 237 ° C which is far better than Li[Cd(NCS) 3]. C 12 H 24 O 6 (CLTC); 170 ˚C 170 ˚C, CdHg(SCN) 4 (CMTC); 199 ˚C 199 ˚C and Hg(N 2 H 4 CS) 4 Zn(SCN) 4 (TMTZ); 185 ˚C 185 ˚C. The Vicker's hardness tester is used to estimate the mechanical hardness of the grown crystal and the results are reported. Introduction. Recently, Nonlinear opitcal material plays an impartant role in the photonics and optoelectronics. New nonlinear optical (NLO) frequency conversion mateirals {{have a significant impact on}} laser technology, optical datastorage and telecommunications. The past few <b>decates,</b> a new series of hybrid nonlinear optical crystal based on polymeric cadmium-thiyocyante anions and complex cations [1 - 3] have received wide attention due to their good optical and interesting physical properties such as thermal, mechanical and second harmonic generation effects. Renewed attention has been received recently for the polymer, inorganic and organic, materials. IPOS series, thiocyanate (SCN) ligand forms a coordination polymeric chain combined with the d 10 transition metal ion and leads a non-centrosymmetric structure. A novel series of coordination solids explained as IPOS with the general formula [H-G] [M-L], where the inorganic anion [M]-is ligand (L) coordination polymer such as [Cd(SCN) 3] ∞ and the organic cation [H-G] + is a host (H) -guest (G) complex such as [(crown ether) -(alkali metl) ]. Earlier scientists and researchers [4] reported the growth of a novel hybrid nonlinear optical compound [(18 C 6) K][Cd(SCN) 3], which is wide optically transparent from 220 to 3, 300 nm and exhibits efficient SHG. Based on the design theory, attempts were made to combine 18 -crown- 6 ether (18 C 6) and thiocyanate ligands with the transition metal ion Cd 2 + and the alkali metal ion NH 4 +. A new nonlinear optical compound [(NH 4) [Cd(NCS) 3]. C 12 H 24 O 6] [Ammonium (18 -crown- 6 -ether) cadmium (II) tri-thiocyanate, ACCTC] material has been synthesized. Signle crystals of ACCTC with dimension of 10 × 5 × 5 mm 3 were grown from aqueous solutions via solvent evaporation technique.
