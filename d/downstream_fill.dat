40|$|A {{rainstorm}} on 27 – 28 May 2003 {{caused a}} debris slide in the fill batter of a recently constructed road crossing of a zero-order stream in Compartment 107, Chichester State Forest, Australia. The slide became more liquid downslope, changing to a debris flow. This flow completely blocked the inlet {{of the next}} downstream road crossing of the same stream, where it had changed to first order. Gullying of the <b>downstream</b> <b>fill</b> batter at the second crossing was caused by water flowing over the road. The estimated volume of sediment removed by the upslope debris slide was 350 [*]m³, and the estimated erosion volume by gullying of the <b>downstream</b> <b>fill</b> batter at the second crossing was 100 [*]m³. Mass movements have occurred in Compartment 107 before any forestry activities {{because of the presence}} of colluvium-filled bedrock depressions. Furthermore, the channel downstream of the second crossing has transported much larger quantities of coarser sediment than what was mobilized during and after the event of 27 – 28 May 2003. Channel bank exposures reveal up to 2. 5 -m-thick, poorly sorted gravels, which, on the basis of soil development in the overlying deposits, appear to be older than 200 [*]years. Sediment was deposited in the channel downstream of the second crossing, as determined using Munsell Soil Colour as a fingerprinting technique. The volumes involved were relatively minor and were only deposited in slackwater areas as spatially disjunct, relatively thin patches. Sediment was restricted to the first 500 [*]m downstream of the second crossing and was unlikely to have reached the main stream, Allyn River, in any measurable quantity. The channel downstream of the second road crossing is a high-energy feature because it contains a range of channel units (waterfalls, bedrock, boulder and log steps, cascades, etc.) formed by erosion of resistant materials. Similar and larger events to that of 27 – 28 May 2003 in the following 13 months did not cause further road erosion, indicating that the installed rehabilitation measures stabilized the road...|$|E
40|$|Freudenberg Sealing Technologies has {{developed}} a new concept for the manufacture of diaphragm accumulators. Its advantages are a reduced need for components, fewer process steps, shorter assembly times, {{a higher level of}} product cleanliness, and an expansion of the product portfolio into additional fields of application. These diaphragm accumulators also weigh significantly less. This is opening up new opportunities for applications in the automotive and industrial fields. The assembly concept is based on a hermetically sealed pressure chamber in which the joining of the two housing halves with the help electromagnetic pulse technology (EMPT) as well as the filling of the gas side with nitrogen takes place in a single operation. In this way, <b>downstream</b> <b>filling</b> to generate the initial gas charge is no longer necessary...|$|R

50|$|Once {{initially}} established, continued {{lava flow}} creates a steeper upstream face as it battles the rising water, but with most lava flowing unimpeded downstream covering the now-dried river bed and its alluvial sediments, sometimes for miles. Thus emplaced, {{the shape of}} a lava dam resembles an elongated blob, wedged in the valley bottom. At the same time, the water continues to flow, the lake continues to rise and accumulate sediment, which previously had migrated unimpeded <b>downstream.</b> Sediment <b>filling,</b> over-topping, downward erosion, waterfalls and under-cutting inevitably follow, unless an alternative outlet is established, for water and sediment elsewhere in the drainage.|$|R

Each node of the supply chain is governed by the following rules in each period (to be referred to as a week): (1) receiving orders from <b>downstream</b> node, <b>filling</b> orders as possible according to current inventory and shipping goods, last round stock out being filled at this round; (2) checking inventory, determining next round order quantity and sending purchase orders to upstream node, and placed orders not being cancelled; (3) receiving goods from upstream node, or producing and replenishing stocks, and shipments made not being returned.|$|R

(2011) 10. 1111 /j. 1471 - 4159. 2011. 07234. x ABSTRACT: SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide {{sensitive}} factor attachment protein receptors) -mediated exocytotic {{release of}} neurotransmitters {{is a key}} process in neuronal communication, controlled {{by a number of}} molecular interactions. A synaptic vesicle v-SNARE protein (VAMP 2 or synaptobrevin), in association with two plasma membrane t-SNAREs (syntaxin 1 and SNAP 25), assemble to form a protein complex that is largely accepted as the minimal membrane fusion machine. Acidification of the synaptic vesicle lumen by the large multi-subunit vacuolar proton pump (V-ATPase) is required for loading with neurotransmitters. Recent data demonstrate a direct interaction between the c-subunit of the V-ATPase and VAMP 2 that appears to play a role at a late step in transmitter release. In this review, we examine evidence suggesting that the V 0 membrane sector of the V-ATPase not only participates in proton pumping, but plays a second distinct role in neurosecretion, <b>downstream</b> of <b>filling</b> and close to vesicle fusion...|$|R
50|$|The Tiefentalbach flows {{down from}} mount Möhringer Berg through a wooded valley and joins the Krähenbach from the right, {{opposite}} Eßlingen Mill, which is situated below {{the ruins of}} Konzenberg Castle. Further <b>downstream,</b> a reservoir <b>fills</b> almost the entire width of the valley. The Krähenbach flows {{to the right of}} this reservoir and on through the Bächetal valley. After a recent nature restoration project, the Krähenbach is once again able to meander through this valley. It then reaches the northern edge of the village of Möhringen an der Donau. This village is now part of Tuttlingen and lies in the floodplain {{on the left side of}} the Danube. Inside Möhringen, the Krähenbach takes up a stream coming down from the Kühltal valley on the right.|$|R
50|$|This {{storage and}} {{associated}} pipeline {{was built to}} provide water to the Kidston Goldmine in the early 1980s on the Copperfield River, {{a tributary of the}} Einasleigh River in the Gilbert River catchment. The dam {{was one of the first}} dams built in Australia using the Roller Compacted Concrete technique.At the closure of the mine, the storage was handed back to the state and is owned/ managed by DEWS. Downstream properties receive water via a pipeline which was built to supply the mine and associated township. There is also a local arrangement to release water (towards the end of winter) to <b>fill</b> <b>downstream</b> waterholes. This allows riparian properties access to water for stock and domestic use until the coming wet season.|$|R
40|$|Chinaâs oil {{sector has}} been {{dominated}} by three large state-owned oil companies in charge of developing the countryâs domestic reserves, building and operating pipelines, managing Chinaâs increasingly sophisticated <b>downstream,</b> and <b>filling</b> its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR). Over the years, as Chinaâs demand has outstripped production, they have also become major investors in the global upstream and established a presence in global refining and oil trading. They now rank among the top ten global oil companies. Yet despite Chinaâs growing international reach, its oil sector remains heavily dominated by the Chinese state. From a majority stake in the oil companies, through price setting and diplomatic support for outbound investments, the government maintains significant influence over commercial decisions. At the same time, the technical knowhow and market expertise of the National Oil Companies (NOCs) offer them an important role in policy-making. This relationship is poorly understood, but it is now set to evolve further, alongside government efforts to gradually liberalize the energy sector and reform its state owned giants. This paper provides a historic overview of the development of the Chinese oil industry, focusing on the relations {{between the government and the}} oil companies before assessing how the reform agenda outlined by President Xi Jinping and the liberalization of the oil industry is impacting governmentâindustry relations, as well as Chinaâs global energy footprint...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{communities}} {{are known to}} strongly influence rates of biogeochemical cycling in wetland ecosystems; specifically, they are strong determinants of rates of denitrification typically observed. Human induced land use changes have significantly reduced the acreage of wetland habitats, with dam building in the eastern United States figuring prominently in these losses. Wetlands located behind these dams turned into ponds, and this ecosystem alteration significantly lowers denitrification potential. Due to these ecosystem land use changes, higher exports of anthropogenic nitrate continue to leach off the land, ultimately ending up in open bodies of water. The damming and subsequent ponding of these floodplain systems have caused radically altered environmental conditions for relict wetland soils. Microbial {{communities are}} resistant to change, and may undergo periods of dormancy when conditions are not conducive to activity, but it is uncertain how long they can withstand the effects of ecosystem alteration. By removing the dam and the depositional sediments, wetland restoration efforts attempt to stimulate higher rates of denitrification observed at the site. However, understanding if the microbial community inhabiting the relict hydric soil has a high restoration potential (e. g., capability of performing higher rates of denitrification when wetland hydrology is returned) is important when studying sites targeted for restoration. This thesis attempts to address wetland restoration potential with two studies. In the first part, the hydric soil from Big Spring Run (a site targeted for wetland restoration) was surveyed for both denitrification potential and microbial community composition. Big Spring Run (BSR) {{was the site of}} a floodplain wetland prior to European settlement; however, in the 1800 s, a dam was erected <b>downstream,</b> <b>filling</b> the wetland to create a mill pond. The dam was removed in the mid- 1900 s; however the relict wetland soil remained buried under settled pond sediments. The relict wetland soil at BSR was surveyed to see if the microbial communities present in the relict hydric soil (which has been buried for over 200 years) are still functional. Results indicate that the current buried hydric soil performs denitrification at significantly lower rates than any of the surveyed reference wetlands (Nov 2010 F[4, 31] = 13. 75, p< 0. 0001; March 2011 F[4, 42] = 84. 6, p< 0. 0001; June 2011 F[4, 35] = 71. 89, p< 0. 0001). Bacterial community composition was also distinct between all of the sites sampled (ANOSIM R= 0. 693, p< 0. 001) indicating that no specific community composition is needed to perform denitrification. The second part of this thesis attempts to determine if the microbial community contained within relict hydric soil will perform high rates of denitrification again ii when dynamic wetland hydrology is restored. Soil from the altered BSR site was transplanted to nearby wetland ecosystems and denitrification rates and microbial community composition were assessed before and after transplanting. Results indicate that when stable wetland environmental parameters dominate, the microbial communities perform higher rates of denitrification in the transplanted sites than in their current altered conditions (F[5, 66]= 8. 459, p< 0. 0001). However these denitrification rates, while improved over their current conditions, are still significantly lower than any of the surveyed reference wetland sites. Results were mixed when other environmental parameters (e. g., cold temperatures, persistent flooding, and high stream flow) affected the results. Further work is needed to test the long term implications of these findings; however the preliminary results indicate that while the hydric soil microbial communities do show slight improvements in denitrification potential after transplanting, the soil microbial community at BSR seems resistant to a full recovery of denitrifying potential...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Valley fill mining has the {{potential}} to alter headwater stream habitat in many areas in the eastern United States. In valley fill mining, overburden is removed to expose underlying coal seams. The overburden is then deposited in the adjacent valley. The deposited overburden from mining increases sedimentation, increases stream conductivity, and alters hydrologic regimes <b>downstream</b> of the <b>fill.</b> Changes in <b>downstream</b> communities are not well documented. However, it was suspected the increased sedimentation and conductivity would have deleterious effects upon the downstream macroinvertebrate communities. In southern West Virginia, four pairs of streams, each consisting of a fill and a reference stream, were selected as representative of watersheds experiencing valley fill mining. Stream pairs were selected for similar environmental conditions, with one stream having a valley fill in its headwaters. Each stream was sampled by replicate Surber samples (N = 9 per stream). Water chemistry and sediment measurements also were taken at each location. Valley fill streams had significantly higher specific conductance (p< 0. 01), but did no...|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from partially full to full flow in downward sloping pipes often occurs with a hydraulic jump that entrains air bubbles <b>downstream</b> in a <b>filled</b> conduit {{that makes it}} difficult to define the boundary between the air entrainment and air transport behind the jump in circular conduits. With the aim of addressing this issue, an experimental investigation that included the measurement of air bubble velocities with a high speed camera at distances of 1, 5 and 10 diameters downstream of the jump was carried out. The analysis results showed that when the distance beyond the jump was less than 10 diameters, the velocity profiles were irregular and influenced by the eddying action of the jump; however, when it was greater than 10 diameters, the velocity distribution was very similar to that of a typical fully developed velocity profile in a circular conduit. The work concentrated on a mild downward slope S = 0. 087 ( = 5 °) and small Froude numbers ranged from 0. 045 to 2. 04...|$|R
40|$|The sea ﬂoor of intraslope minibasins on passive contine ntal margins plays asigniﬁcant role in {{controlling}} turbidity current pathw ays {{and the resulting}} sed-iment distribution. To address this, laborat ory analogue modelling of intra-slope minibasin formation is combined with numeri cal ﬂow simulations ofmulti-event turbidity currents. This approach permits an improved under-standing of evolving ﬂow–bathymetry–deposit interactions and the resultinginternal stacking patterns of the inﬁlls of such minibasins. The bathymetryincludes a shelf to slope channel followed by an upper minibasin, which areseparated by a conﬁning ridge from two lower minibasins that compares wellwith analogous bathymetries reported from natural settings. From a wider rangeof numerical ﬂow experiments, a series of 100 consecutive ﬂows is reported indetail. The turbidity currents are released into the channel and upon reachingthe upper minibasin follow a series of stages from short initial ponding, ‘ﬁllingand spilling’ and an extended transition to long retrogradat ional ponding. Uponreaching the upper minibasin ﬂoor, the currents undergo a hydraulic jump andtherefore much sediment is deposited in {{the central part of}} the minibasin andthe counterslope. This modiﬁes the bathymetry such that in the ﬁll and spillstage, ﬂow stripping and grain-size partitioning cause some ﬁner sediment to betransported across the conﬁning ridge into the lower mini basins. Throughoutthe basin inﬁll pro cess, the sequences retrograde upstream, accompanied by lat-eral switching into locally formed depressions in the upper minibasin. After theﬁll and spill stage, signiﬁcant deposition occurs in the channel where retrograd-ing cyclic steps with wavelengths of 1 to 2 km develop as a function of pulsatingﬂow criticality. These resul ts are at variance with conventional schemes thatemphasize sequenti al <b>downstream</b> minibasin <b>ﬁlling</b> through ponding domi-nated by vertical aggradation.

40|$|In {{the fall}} of 2001, the Army Corps of Engineers {{introduced}} an additional requirement for the nationwide permit (NWP) 21. In the permit application, the coal company is required to provide information showing that the impacts on the aquatic environment are both individually and cumulatively minimal. The definition of “minimal ” impact {{has yet to be}} determined by agencies. Therefore, to determine the aquatic impacts resulting from valley fills, we have compared pre and post valley fill construction data. Water quality collected downstream from constructed valley fills indicated that values for alkalinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), chloride, sulfate, and hardness were elevated compared to the pre valley fill construction values. However, water quality constituents usually remained within the ranges recommended for freshwater organisms. Benthic macroinvertebrate data collected <b>downstream</b> from valley <b>fills</b> indicated that there was a shift in the community composition from a predominantly pollution sensitive and facultative community to a community dominated by facultative and tolerant individuals. The West Virginia Stream Condition Index (WV-SCI) decreased slightly, and in many streams went from a “very good ” designation to one of “good”. It is very important for coal companies to be aware of procedures that will help decrease the individual and cumulative effects of constructing valley fills, and the data necessary to make a determination of impacts. Pre-existing data from all streams with proposed valley fills, and data from the receiving streams are necessary. Reference data are also imperative from existing valley fills of similar size in the same watershed that were constructed utilizing the same mining methodology...|$|R
5000|$|Although hydropolitical {{tensions}} {{in the region have}} existed for centuries, population pressures in the 1960s led each country to pursue unilateral development of water resources. The Keban Dam was built in southern Anatolia from 1965 to 1973 and Syria built its Tabqa Dam between 1965 and 1973. Despite bilateral and sometimes tripartite (including the Soviet Union) negotiations, no formal agreements were in place when the two dams became operational in 1973. As the dams began to <b>fill,</b> <b>downstream</b> water flow decreased significantly. In 1974, Syria granted an Iraqi request and allowed an additional 200 mcm/year to flow from the Tabqa Dam. The following year, however, Iraq asked for Arab League intervention, citing that the flow of water reaching Iraq had fallen from the normal 920 m³/s to an [...] "intolerable" [...] 197 m³/s. The Syrian government responded by claiming that water flow into Syria had been reduced by more than 50%. After trading mutually hostile statements, Syria withdrew from an Arab League committee tasked with resolving the dispute. Tension increased in May 1975 as Syria closed its airspace to Iraqi flights and both countries amassed troops on their borders. Saudi Arabian intervention, however, defused the situation with both sides arriving at an agreement that averted the impending violence. The terms of the agreement were never made public, but Iraqi sources have privately said that Syria was permitted to keep 40% of the water in the Euphrates flowing through its country, while 60% of the water was to be allowed to flow south through Iraq.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{saltwater}} intrusion in coastal aquifers is {{dealt with by}} the proper setup of a sand-box device to develop laboratory experiments in a controlled environment. Saline intrusion {{is a problem of}} fundamental impor- tance and affects the quality of both surface water and groundwater in coastal areas. In both cases the phenomenon may be linked to anthropogenic (construction of reservoirs, withdrawals, etc.) and/or natural (sea-level excursions, variability of river flows, etc.) changes. In recent years, the escalation of this problem has {{led to the development of}} specific projects and studies to identify possible countermeasures, typically consisting of underground barri- ers. Physical models are fundamental to study the saltwater intrusion problem, since they provide benchmarks for numerical model calibrations and for the evaluation of the effectiveness of solutions to contain the salt wedge. In order to study and describe the evolution of the salt wedge, the effectiveness of underground barriers, and the distance from the coast of a withdrawal that guarantees a continuous supply of fresh water, a physical model has been realized at the University of Padova to represent the terminal part of a coastal aquifer. It consists of a laboratory flume 500 cm long, 30 cm wide and 60 cm high, filled for an height of 45 cm with glass beads with a d 50 of 0. 6 mm and a uniformity coefficient d 60 /d 10 = 1. 5. The material is homogeneous and characterized by a porosity of about 0. 37 and by an hydraulic conductivity of about 1. 8 x 10 - 3 m/s m/s. Upstream from the sand-box, a tank, continuously supplied by a pump, provides fresh water to recharge the aquifer, while the <b>downstream</b> tank, <b>filled</b> with salt water, simulates the sea. The volume of the downstream tank (about 2 m 3) is about five times the upstream one, so that density variations due to the incoming fresh water flow are negligible. The water level in the two tanks is continuously monitored by means of two level probes and is controlled by a couple of spillways placed in both the upstream and downstream tanks, ensuring a constant gradient during the tests. The flow rate spilled from the downstream tank is continuously measured so that it is possible to control the fulfillment of the stationary condition in the system. While we use food dye to mark saltwater to give an easy visual evidence of the salt wedge, the spatio-temporal evolution of the concentration is monitored during the experiment by using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). An electrode system specifically realized to be effective in the flume is used during the experiments to achieve electrical resistance measurements, later converted in concentrations through the calibration of a petrophysical law. The presentation describes the laboratory setup and the data achieved from the developed experiments compared with numerical simulations obtained by the SUTRA software...|$|R

The current nozzle-to-case joint design incorporates primary, secondary and wiper (inner-most) 0 -rings and polysulfide joint-fill compound.

Though the condition does not threaten motor safety, evidence of hot gas to the wiper 0 -ring results in extensive reviews before resuming flight. NASA and solid rocket motor manufacturer Thiokol are working to improve the nozzle-to-case joint design by implementing a more reliable J-leg design and a thermal barrier, This paper presents burn-resistance, temperature drop, flow and resiliency test results for several types of NASA braided carbon-fiber thermal barriers. Burn tests were performed to determine the time to burn through each of the thermal barriers when exposed to the flame of an oxy-acetylene torch (5500 F), representative of the 5500 F solid rocket motor combustion temperatures. Thermal barriers braided out of carbon fibers endured the flame for over 6 minutes, three times longer than solid rocket motor burn time. Tests were performed on two thermal barrier braid architectures, denoted Carbon- 3 and Carbon- 6, to measure the temperature drop across and along the barrier in a compressed state when subjected to the flame of an oxyacetylene torch. Carbon- 3 and Carbon- 6 thermal barriers were excellent insulators causing temperature drops through their diameter of up to a 2800 and 2560 F. respectively.
