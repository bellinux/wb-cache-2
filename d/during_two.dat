5|$|Fear {{response}} in women <b>during</b> <b>two</b> {{different points in}} the menstrual cycle has been examined. When estrogen is highest in the preovulatory stage, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.|$|E

5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have been badly {{affected}} by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism <b>during</b> <b>two</b> outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E

5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. <b>During</b> <b>two</b> days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army in the pocket.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1916, Active {{was assigned to the}} Grand Fleet and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland later in the year. Shortly afterwards, she was briefly assigned as the flotilla leader of the 4th DF and escorted {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August. By the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the Dover Patrol and was present <b>during</b> <b>two</b> battles with German destroyers, but was not engaged in either. Active was based in Ireland by {{the beginning}} of 1918, but was soon transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and based in Gibraltar for the rest of the war.

5|$|Carpenter faced many {{problems}} associated with this, including {{the possibility of the}} Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers, during their transport to the civilian court. During transport, Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone. This allowed him to slip the manacle from his wrist while he sang his death chant. With a small hidden knife that was not found <b>during</b> <b>two</b> separate searches, he stabbed the driver (who survived), both falling out of the wagon, grabbed a soldier's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt.|$|E

5|$|During the 2006–07 season, manager Colin Todd {{had been}} sacked {{because of a}} poor run of results. Club captain David Wetherall was {{originally}} appointed Todd's successor on a caretaker basis, before being handed the role {{until the end of}} the season, during the following month. Wetherall could not stop City's run of poor form, and the club were relegated to League Two on 28 April 2007 after a 3–0 defeat at Chesterfield. It was the club's third relegation in seven seasons, and meant the 2007–08 season would be their first season in the fourth division of English football in 25years. On 22 May 2007, former City player Stuart McCall, who had played more than 400games for the club <b>during</b> <b>two</b> previous spells, was announced as the club's new manager to take over on 1 June 2007. Although the club had just 13players with first-team experience, the bookmakers made City second favourites to win the League Two title.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; the scenes set around the Osbourne {{residence}} for instance, were all filmed at once, <b>during</b> <b>two</b> to three days, though during the episodes, the scenes took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts of the sequence were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were shot by the second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to double as a beach.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1896 tour, the English {{authorities}} realised action {{had to be}} taken. Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed {{each year}} between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897–98. <b>During</b> <b>two</b> of the matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. Fry, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled Fry and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are among}} the least studied of all lemurs, and {{little is known about}} them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur (P.pallescens) has been studied {{relatively}} well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, Jean-Jacques Petter, and Georges Pariente <b>during</b> <b>two</b> expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in Kirindy Forest. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large baobab trees) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs (Mirza coquereli) during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30sleeping sites may be used {{over the course of a}} year, each for a variable length of time.|$|E
