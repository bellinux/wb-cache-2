25|$|The usual scheme <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these {{celestial}} deities is {{male and}} the other female, though the exact gender of the Sun or Moon tends to vary among subsequent Indo-European mythologies. The original Indo-European solar deity {{appears to have been}} female, a characteristic not only supported by the higher number of sun goddesses in subsequent derivations (feminine Sól, Saule, Sulis, Solntse—not directly attested as a goddess, but feminine in gender — Étaín, Grían, Aimend, Áine, and Catha versus masculine Helios, Surya, Savitr, Usil, and Sol) (Hvare-khshaeta is of neutral gender), but also by vestiges in mythologies with male solar deities (Usil in Etruscan art is depicted occasionally as a goddess, while solar characteristics in Athena and Helen of Troy still remain in Greek mythology). The original Indo-European lunar deity appears to have been masculine, with feminine lunar deities like Selene, Minerva, and Luna being a development exclusive to the eastern Mediterranean. Even in these traditions, remnants of male lunar deities, like Menelaus, remain.|$|E
25|$|Another {{important}} question is the existence of automorphisms in recursion-theoretic structures. One of these structures <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> recursively enumerable sets under inclusion modulo finite difference; in this structure, A is below B {{if and only if}} the set difference B'A is finite. Maximal sets (as defined in the previous paragraph) have the property that they cannot be automorphic to non-maximal sets, that is, if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned, then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set. Soare (1974) showed that also the converse holds, that is, every two maximal sets are automorphic. So the maximal sets form an orbit, that is, every automorphism preserves maximality and any two maximal sets are transformed into each other by some automorphism. Harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property: that of the creative sets, the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} mining at Philmont {{dates back to}} the years {{immediately}} after the Civil War. U.S. soldiers were stationed in the West after the war, as the U.S. Army was driving out the American Indians. The story <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these soldiers befriended an Indian, who happened to give him a shiny rock. The shiny material in the rock was found to be copper. According to the story, the soldier and two of his friends went up to investigate, and found gold. They could not stay to mine the gold and the area was overrun by miners by the time they returned the next year. Scores of gold mines were excavated in Philmont, and operated into the early 20th century. A large vein of gold is said to lie under Mount Baldy to this day, but extracting it has not been feasible. It is a common joke at Philmont that some day the mines under Baldy will collapse and Phillips will be the highest mountain in Philmont. The Contention Mine, located at Cyphers Mine, and the Aztec Mine, located at French Henry, are open to guided tours.|$|E
25|$|Inter{{national}} {{and national}} events {{for the sport}} include the Winter Paralympics, World Championships, World Cups, Continental Cups, National Championships, IPCAS Races and IPCAS Para-Snowboard. Skiers from 39 different countries actively compete in para-alpine skiing in a sport <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> eight governed by the International Paralympic Committee Sports Committee, with rules for para-alpine skiing {{set forth in the}} IPCAS Rules and Regulations. Event specific rules may be created for events like the Paralympic Games. One set of rules was created in 1994 and were specified in the IPC Handbook. This was used to govern IPC-sanctioned events like the Paralympic Games for many years. Competition rules for classes use rules set by or modified from rules created by the International Ski Federation (ISF). These rules were set at the 42nd International Ski Conference in 2000. The two rule sets worked in concert with each other, with the ISF rules specifying the rules for alpine skiing, and the IPC providing modifications for para-alpine skiing. The IPC Alpine Sports Assembly Executive Committee can determine if skiers are eligible to compete in IPC sanctioned events at their own discretion regardless of what the rules say. National Paralympic Committees can have their own rule sets at national competitions.|$|E

500|$|Dynamic DNA {{nanotechnology}} uses {{a mechanism}} called toehold-mediated strand displacement {{to allow the}} nucleic acid complexes to reconfigure {{in response to the}} addition of a new nucleic acid strand. [...] In this reaction, the incoming strand binds to a single-stranded toehold region of a double-stranded complex, and then displaces one of the strands bound in the original complex through a branch migration process. The overall effect <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the strands in the complex is replaced with another one. [...] In addition, reconfigurable structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as deoxyribozymes and ribozymes, which can perform chemical reactions, and aptamers, which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules.|$|E

500|$|The view {{of modern}} historians <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{important}} effects was the strain it put {{on the relationship between}} Rome and Byzantium.

500|$|It had {{not been}} thought {{necessary}} to inscribe the word [...] "cents" [...] on the nickel; the silver and copper-nickel three-cent pieces had circulated for years with only a Roman numeral to indicate the denomination. [...] Enterprising fraudsters soon realized that the new nickel was close in diameter {{to that of the}} five-dollar gold piece, and if the new coin was gold-plated, it might be passed for five dollars. [...] They soon did so, and had success in passing the coin. Some coins were given a reeded edge by the fraudsters, to make them appear more like the gold coins. [...] A widespread tale <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the perpetrators of this fraud was a man named Josh Tatum, who would go into a store, select an item costing five cents or less, and offer the gold-plated piece in payment—and many clerks gave him $4.95 in change. [...] According to the tale, the law had no recourse against Tatum, as he had tendered the value of his purchase and had merely accepted the change as a gift. By some accounts, Tatum could not have misrepresented the value of the coin as he was a deaf-mute.|$|E
500|$|Among {{art historians}} and critics, Ruisdael's {{reputation}} {{has had its}} ups and downs over the centuries. The first account, in 1718, is from Houbraken, who waxed lyrical over the technical mastery which allowed Ruisdael to realistically depict falling water and the sea. In 1781, Sir Joshua Reynolds, founder of the Royal Academy, admired the freshness and force of Ruisdael's landscapes. A couple of decades later other English critics were less impressed. In 1801, Henry Fuseli, professor at the Royal Academy, expressed his contempt for the entire Dutch School of Landscape, dismissing it as no more than a [...] "transcript of the spot", a mere [...] "enumeration of hill and dale, clumps of trees". Of note <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Fuseli's students was Constable, whose admiration for Ruisdael remained unchanged. Around the same time in Germany, the writer, statesman and scientist Johann Wolfgang von Goethe lauded Ruisdael as a thinking artist, even a poet, saying [...] "he demonstrates remarkable skill in locating the exact point at which the creative faculty comes into contact with a lucid mind". John Ruskin however, in 1860, raged against Ruisdael and other Dutch Golden Age landscapists, calling their landscapes places where [...] "we lose not only all faith in religion but all remembrance of it". In 1915, the Dutch art historian Abraham Bredius called his compatriot not so much a painter as a poet.|$|E

2500|$|The {{assignment}} of orientational symbols to physical quantities and {{the requirement that}} physical equations be orientationally homogeneous can actually {{be used in a}} way that is similar to dimensional analysis to derive a little more information about acceptable solutions of physical problems.

[...] If the lowest power of a physical variable is fractional, both sides of the solution is raised to a power such that all powers are integral. [...] This puts it into [...] "normal form". [...] The orientational equation is then solved to give a more restrictive condition on the unknown powers of the orientational symbols, arriving at a solution that is more complete than the one that dimensional analysis alone gives.

Other quirks include a 'hump' in the scratch plate which moves the neck pick-up closer to the neck on the bass side, and a replacement of all of the pick-ups, though this replacement was due to damage rather than the perception of a tonal inadequacy.

2500|$|... "A Copy of Verses" [...] {{contains}} a few statements, such as Every's declaration {{to have been}} [...] "part-owner" [...] to land near Plymouth, that were later corroborated by William Philips, the captured crew member with whom Every had once shared information. Despite this, it is unlikely Every wrote the verses. A more likely scenario <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the approximately fifteen or twenty loyal sailors who refused to join the mutiny had shared their knowledge of Every upon returning to England, where it was quickly turned into a ballad. A slightly modified copy was delivered to the Privy Council of England by Sir James Houblon on 10 August 1694, where it was used as evidence during the inquiry on the mutiny. By announcing Every's supposed intentions of turning pirate even before the mutiny was carried out, the ballad may have served to strengthen the Council's convictions that the mutinous crew harbored piratical intentions from the onset. It is possible, therefore, that the ballad may have actually been written and distributed {{as a way to}} convict Every. In any case, the strength of the ballad likely {{played a role in the}} government's outlawing of Every nearly two years before he had become known as the most infamous pirate of his time.|$|E
