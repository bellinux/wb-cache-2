5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards.

40|$|The {{philosophy}} behind charting-by-exception (CBE) {{remains a}} source of professional concern almost 30 years after its introduction. The literature lacks both qualitative and quantitative studies that address staff nurse views of CBE {{or the use of}} CBE data for clinical decision making. Purpose The specific aim {{of this study was to}} explore the decision making of medical-surgical nurses who use CBE as their method of documentation. Method Grounded theory was used to explore how medical-surgical nurses decide whether to follow a CBE policy on a <b>day-to-day,</b> patient-by-patient <b>basis.</b> Approval of the AMSN Research Committee and the Rutgers University Institutional Review Board was obtained. Telephone interviews were conducted with 16 registered nurses, recruited from the AMSN membership, working in staff nurse positions on an acute care medical-surgical unit who described their perspectives and experiences in using CBE to document clinical data. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim, and these data were analyzed using the constant comparative method as described by Glaser (1998). Findings The theory that emerged is a three-step process which includes Coming to Terms with the Method, Being Responsible in Documentation, and Creating a Protective Picture (CAPP). CAPP is the core category that explains how the participants resolved their main concern - creating documentation they believed would be protective of their patients, themselves, and/or their employers. Conclusion The theory provides insight into what nurses consider responsible documentation practices and the decision-making process they use when documenting under a CBE policy with an exception-based electronic documentation system...|$|R

The survey included a representative number of 383 recreational fishermen. Using Redundancy Analysis (RDA) with dummy variables (explanatory variables), we studied the relationships of important recreational fishery parameters. We concluded that, as there is a variety of competing users of freshwater resources there is a necessity to provide the laws to all the parties involved. In addition, we have found a relationship between knowledge of legal regulations and level of education. Recreational fisheries are oft en considered satisfactory even if no fish has been caught. The key factors are contact with nature, social interaction and breaks from <b>day-to-day</b> routines.

40|$|Inequality {{appears to}} be back on the {{intellectual}} and political agenda. This paper provides a commentary on this renewed interest, drawing on an empirical discussion of inequality in the UK. The paper argues that inequality should be seen as produced in the inherently unequal social relations of production, drawing attention to the role of social struggle in shaping dynamics of inequality. However, inequality is not just produced in dynamic class struggle in the formal economy, but also through the social reproduction of labour power on a <b>day-to-day</b> and inter-generational <b>basis.</b> As such, inequalities of household resources at any point in time may be reproductive of greater future inequality. It is argued that inequality has risen in the UK over recent decades because of changes in the social relations of production in the formal economy and social reproduction in the domestic sector, both of which have witnessed significant state interventions that have increased structural inequalities. It is argued that, absent of significant change, the underpinning structural dynamics in the UK will lead to further increases in inequality over the short and longer-term. Given this, we might expect to see an already emergent ‘New Politics of Inequality’ intensifying in the coming decades...|$|R
40|$|Objective : Children 2 ̆ 7 s {{physical}} activity levels are difficult to establish on a <b>day-to-day</b> or season-to-season <b>basis.</b> Most studies have attempted to measure reliability in habitual settings.

Methods : Fifteen boys and 19 girls (aged 6 to 11 years) from 2 schools in North West England wore heart rate monitors for 5 consecutive days in summer and winter terms to assess day-to-day and seasonal variability during school recess. Data were collected in 2004. Repeated measures ANOVA 2 ̆ 7 s and intraclass correlations (ICC) analysed the day-to-day and seasonal variability in children 2 ̆ 7 s moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity (VPA) data.

40|$|Many animals use {{conspicuous}} {{display to}} attract mates, {{and there should}} be selection for displays to occur at times and places that maximise the probability of mating, while minimising energetic costs and predator attraction. To select the best times for display, individuals may use environmental cues, the presence of other individuals, or both, but few studies have examined these sources of variation in display activity. In this study, we examined physical environmental and social factors triggering displays in a tropical, terrestrially breeding frog, Cophixalus ornatus. To measure the influence of physical environmental conditions on calling activity, we recorded temperature, rainfall, moon illumination/visibility, humidity, barometric pressure and intensity of calling activity throughout a breeding season at six locations along a 560 -m transect. The intensity of calling varied daily, seasonally, and at a small spatial scale. Variation in calling activity from day to day was large. There was also a strong seasonal trend in calling activity: few males called {{at the start of the}} season, activity peaked shortly after the beginning of the season, and then declined linearly from the peak to the end of the season. There was also consistent variation among sites along the transect, which may have been due to variations in frog density at each site, or to consistent microscale variations in physical conditions, or both. After statistically removing consistent local variation among sites, a principal components analysis suggested that a maximum of 35. 8 % of the variation in calling activity among days was due to factors common to all sites, such as weather, moon illumination, or large-scale social facilitation (e. g. of choruses by other choruses). The remainder of the variation among sites (64. 2 %) was due to site-specific factors, such as small-scale social facilitation or unmeasured, apparently stochastic effects, such as microenvironmental physical factors that do not vary consistently over sites. Regressions of environmental variables on residual calling activity (after removing consistent effects of site and season), alone or in combination, accounted for very little of the variation in the number of calling males (maximum 10 %). Thus, our data, showing strong seasonal effects and consistent variation among sites combined with large amounts of variation in the number of calling males at small spatial scales, suggest that environmental conditions, such as temperature, rainfall, moon illumination and barometric pressure, which act over large spatial scales, may determine the overall environmental envelope within which calling can occur but do not account for most of the variation in the number of calling males on a <b>day-to-day</b> or site-to-site <b>basis.</b> Similarly, variations in the number of calling males at small spatial scales suggest that social facilitation is a relatively unimportant trigger for displays on a large scale in these frogs. On the other hand, our data suggest that social facilitation may have important effects on variation in the number of calling males on a <b>day-to-day</b> and site-to-site <b>basis.</b> We used playback experiments to assess whether the sound of calling could initiate displays. We played either a taped chorus or white noise in areas where few (zero to two) males were calling. The number of calling males increased both during and after the chorus stimulus, whereas there was no increase in calling in response to white noise. These data suggest that examining variation in calling activity at small spatial scales can reveal the sources of variation for the number of calling males, and indicate that, in these frogs, males tend to use the calling of other individuals as a cue to determine when to display...|$|R
40|$|Small towns {{fulfilled}} {{an important}} and unique role in southern life. After examining archival resources, public documents, and {{the architecture of the}} town of Clinton, Louisiana, two distinct but interlocking themes emerge. The first is the quest for order, respectability, and prosperity. The second is an outgrowth of those three goals, in that the social and economic infrastructure created by the townsfolk's activities acted as a catalyst to produce interactions that would not otherwise have occurred in a predominantly rural setting. Social, economic, and political interactions in small towns took place on a <b>day-to-day</b> and face-to-face <b>basis.</b> Village life allowed the citizens to interact with those outside their family groups and immediate neighbors for a broader social and economic base than country-dwellers yet did not provide the anonymity of large cities like New Orleans or Charleston. In the years before the American Civil War, wealthy and middle-class whites dominated Clinton's society and economy. By building railroads, establishing strong mercantile houses, and developing a varied corps of artisans, Clinton's elite made the town the center of a booming cotton region. One-third of the village's 1000 residents were slaves, and despite the lack of anonymity within the community, they were still able to create a semblance of a unique subculture away from whites' prying eyes. Following the Civil War, however, the small-town environment proved particularly stifling for the freed slaves, as white-supremacist attitudes prohibited free development of social and political organizations, with the notable exception of black churches. Whites in Clinton reacted violently to their loss of power, ultimately pursuing a massive campaign of terror against local Republicans during the contested presidential election of 1876. Small-town life is not incongruous within the framework of southern history; in fact, these villages incorporated the best and worst features of the southern rural and urban milieux...|$|R
30|$|As a {{well-known}} written description {{and a plan}} in educational contexts, curriculum or syllabus, serves {{as one of the}} most important and valuable resources. Curriculum will provide an instructional framework for teachers to organize teaching activities efficiently and help students learn as effectively as possible in a language course, or an individual class on a <b>day-to-day</b> and cumulative <b>basis</b> through the entire language program (Brown 1995; Li 2008). Richards (2001) states that curriculum plays a crucial role in language teaching and learning because successful language programmes are assumed to be dependent upon curriculum development activities. Wiggins and McTighe (2007) address that curriculum is not just a list of topics or key facts and skills. It will guide teachers and students to achieve desired student performance results by implementing appropriate learning activities and assessments. Hans & Betty (2015) believe that curriculum is the vehicle by which the development of epistemological, praxis and ontological elements can be incorporated into the life and learning of today’s students, ensuring that they graduate ready and willing to make a positive difference in the world of tomorrow. Many other scholars also state that syllabus can exert a variety of purposes: as an agreement between teachers and students; as a device for communicating; as an overall plan of action for the course; as a teaching tool or resource, an artifact for teacher evaluation; as a cognitive map of the course to share with students; as a highly facilitator of students’ learning; as an inexpensive assessment of the instructional practices instructors use in their course; as a powerful indicator of what takes place in classrooms and as evidence for accreditation (Slattery & Carlson 2005; Thompson 2007; Cullen & Harris 2009; Sinor & Kaplan 2010; Willinghan-McLain 2011). The more explicit the course curriculum or syllabus in terms of objectives, content, instructional resources and grading components is, the better it enables the processing of information gained in a learning situation and the students’ final grade performances as well. But the understanding of curriculum or syllabus is closely related to a number of contextual factors which determine the success of a language program, and the shift of curriculum or syllabus will definitely bring great challenges and changes for teaching and learning process.|$|R

40|$|E-, P- and L-selectin {{belong to}} the C-type lectin family of cell {{adhesion}} molecules that initiate inflammatory response. Infammation per se is a physiologocal defense mechanism, but excessive leukcyte extravasation leads to numerous pathoIogical and disease states, as well as metastatic cancer spread. Leukocyte tethering and rolling toward inflammatory site start with the interaction of selectins and the carbohydrate epitope of their glycoprotein ligands, sialyl Lewisx. Therefore inhibitors of selectin-ligand interaction are of high pharmaceutical interest as potent anti-inflammatory agents. Tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewisx serves as a lead strucure in chemical and computational search for selectin antagonists. Structural NMR and X-ray studies indicated binding mode of sialyl Lewisx with E-, and P-selectin, but improved structural studies with {{the second and third}} generation antagonists is missing. We expressed recombinant human E-, P- and L-selectin/IgG as secreted proteins in mammalian expression system and purified them to homogniety. Acitivity of the proteins was confirmed with blocking monoclonal antibodies and ligand binding confirmed by NMR. Bioassays were developed in cell-free and cell-based formats with E-selectin/IgG to evaluate inhibitory potencies of in-house synthesized selectin antagonists. Due to variation and instabilities on <b>day-to-day</b> and batch-to-batch <b>basis,</b> assays were used only for preliminary antagonists screen. To enhance further structural studies, we developed a new system for the expression of truncated form of human E-selectin (lectin and EGF-like domains). Initialy we tried to express these two domains in E. coli, but refolding of expressed inclusion bodies was inefficient. Therefore lectin and EGF-like domains of human E-selectin were expressed as secreted form in baculovirus-infeced insect cells with a flag-epitope on its C-terminus. Expressed protein (LecEGFFlag) was monomeric in solution, correctly folded and active, as confirmed in the reaction with monoclonal blocking antibodies, and NMR studies. Protein was expressed in two distinct glycosylation forms, with apparent molecular weigts of 19. 96 kDa and 21. 15 kDa. In addition, we developed {{for the first time a}} cell-free assay with truncated form of Eselectin (aforementioned LecEGFFlag) for the evaluation of of E-selectin inhibitors. In a proof-of-concept manner, three different E-selectin antagonists were tested and obtained IC 50 values were in close agreement with published results. Reproducibility and stability of the assay on day-to-day and batch-to batch basis make it suitable not only for the preliminary screening, but also to quantify inhibitory potencies of E-selectin antagonists.
