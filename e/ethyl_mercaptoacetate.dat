50|$|Compared to fenclozic acid, {{piprozolin}} shows choleretic {{rather than}} antiinflammatory activity. That is, the compound {{is useful in}} those conditions where the flow of bile is to be increased.Condensation of <b>ethyl</b> <b>mercaptoacetate</b> with ethyl cyanoacetate leads to thiazolinone (4); an intermediate such as 3, involving addition of the mercaptide to the nitrile function can reasonably be invoked. M/ethylation with di(m)ethyl sulfate proceeds on nitrogen with the comcomitant shift of the enamine to afford olefin (5). Bromination of the active methylene (6) followed by displacement of halogen by piperidine affords the choleretic piprozolin (7).|$|E

Without solvent, 1 a and 2 a react to give 10 a in addition to 5 a- 9 a. In Et 2 O {{in the presence of}} aniline, reaction of 1 a,b with 2 a affords the ethyl 1, 3, 4 -thiadiazole- 2 -carboxylate 10 a and l 0 b, respectively, as major products. The structures of the unexpected products 6 a, 7 a, and 10 a have been established by X-ray crystallography. Ethyl 4 H- 1, 3 -thiazine-carboxylate 8 h was transformed into ethyl 7 H- thieno[2, 3 -e][1, 3]thiazine-carboxylate 11 (Scheme 3) by treatment with aqueous NaOH or during chromatography. The structure of the latter has also been established by X-ray crystallography. In the presence of thiols and alcohols, the reaction of 1 a and 2 a yields mainly adducts of type 12 (Scheme 4), compounds 5 a, 7 a, and 9 a being by-products (Table 1). Reaction mechanisms for the formation of the isolated products are delineated in Schemes 4 - 7 : the primary cycloadduct 3 of the diazo compound and the C=S bond of 1 undergoes a base-catalyzed ring opening of the 1, 3 -thiazole-ring to give 10. In the absence of a base, elimination of N 2 yields the thiocarbonyl ylide A', which is trapped by nucleophiles to give 12. Trapping of A' by H 2 O yields 1, 3 -thiazole- 5 (4 H) -one 9 and <b>ethyl</b> <b>mercaptoacetate,</b> which is also a trapping agent for A', yielding the diester 7. The formation of products 6 and 8 can be explained again via trapping of thiocarbonyl ylide A' either by thiirane C (Scheme 6) or by 2 a (Scheme 7). The latter adduct F yields 8 via a Demjanoff-Tiffeneau-type ring expansion of a 1, 3 -thiazole to give the 1, 3 -thiazine...|$|E
