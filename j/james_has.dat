5|$|<b>James</b> <b>has</b> {{been the}} {{recipient}} of numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies he does business with are Audemars Piguet, Coca-Cola, Dunkin' Brands, McDonald's, Nike, State Farm, and Samsung. Coming out of high school, he {{was the target of}} a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas, eventually signing with Nike for approximately $90 million. His signature shoes have performed well for Nike. In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, he was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool FC, who he has claimed his support for. As a result of James' endorsement money and NBA salary, he has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes. In 2013, he surpassed Kobe Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million. In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones. In 2015, he was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson, and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi). <b>James</b> <b>has</b> stated that we would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.|$|E

5|$|Many {{basketball}} analysts, coaches, fans, {{and current}} and former players consider James {{to be one of}} the greatest players of all-time, often ranking him as the best small forward and in the top five overall. He has earned All-NBA honors every season since his sophomore year, All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014, and was named Rookie of the Year in his debut season. With four MVP awards, he is part of a select group of players who have won the award four times, including Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jordan, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only two players who have won four MVP awards in a five-year span. While <b>James</b> <b>has</b> never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals. <b>James</b> <b>has</b> appeared in the Finals eight times and won three championships. Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have defended him, arguing that James usually performed well but was defeated by superior competition.|$|E

5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence <b>James</b> <b>has</b> the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E

5|$|The Fabulous Moolah's first reign is {{the longest}} reign, and is officially {{recognized}} to be 10,170 days, due to WWE not recognizing title changes between 1956 and 1984 (her first reign's real number is 3,651 days, which is still the longest reign). Moolah technically also has the most reigns at 8, but since the WWE does not recognize the title changes between 1956 and 1984, Moolah only has 4 reigns and Trish Stratus has the most reigns with 7. Mickie <b>James</b> <b>has</b> the shortest reign with 1 hour. Wendi Richter is the youngest champion {{at the age of}} 22 years and 10 months, and Moolah is the oldest at the age of 76 years and 106 days. Bertha Faye is the heaviest champion and The Kat is the lightest champion. Chyna is the only undefeated champion. The final champion was Layla, in her first and only reign.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, <b>James</b> <b>has</b> been {{ranked by}} Forbes {{as one of}} the world's most {{influential}} athletes, and in 2017, he was listed by Time {{as one of the}} 100 most influential people in the world. During his first stint with the Cavaliers, he was adored by local fans, with Sherwin-Williams displaying a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters. Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games versus the New York Yankees sporting a Yankees hat. Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and, more specifically, The Decision, he was listed as one of the world's most disliked athletes. By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA {{for the second time in}} his career. In 2014, he was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll. He has led the league in jersey sales six times.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, <b>James</b> <b>has</b> taken {{a unique}} {{approach}} to his playing contracts, usually opting to sign shorter term deals {{in order to}} maximize his earnings potential and flexibility; for example, in 2006, he and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season. This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign with the Heat together. During his second stint in Cleveland, he began opting out and re-signing on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap. In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal, becoming the highest-paid player in the league {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E

James qualified for the NFR 19 times with five different horses prior to her retirement in 2003, and was also a gold medalist at the 1988 Calgary Olympics Rodeo. <b>James</b> <b>has</b> a hall of fame career but could not be inducted into the ProRodeo Hall of Fame except into the Notables category until 2017.
