50|$|It {{has been}} {{recorded}} as being a parasitoid of Apanteles rubripes which is a parasitoid of the geometrid moth Semiothisa pumila and of the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly</b> Gilpinia hercyniae. However, it is most associated with outbreaks of Neodiprion certifer and Diprion similis. In some areas this species is an important control on the populations of N. sertifer but in areas where both N. serifer and Neodiprion pini cocoons are numerous then the cocoons of the latter species are preferred. The wasps detect the hosts' prepupae by detecting volatile chemicals which diffuse through the prepupal integument and the cocoon. When the wasp detects these chemicals it drums its antennae, a sign that it has recognised a potential host.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the study of {{essential}} oil extracted from the roots of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce</b> (Lat. Picea abies). The aim is to establish the component composition of the essential oil and the peculiarities of its localization in the roots of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce.</b> Materials and methods. The objects of the study are the roots of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce</b> not longer than two centimeters in diameter, peeled and dried. The study of their anatomical signs was carried out according to the methodology of the State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation (the XIII-th edition) with the”Biomed- 6 ” microscope using the DCN 510 nozzle. The essential oil was obtained by hydrodistillation of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce</b> roots using the device of Clevenger by Method 2 of the State Pharmacopoeia of the Russian Federation (the XIII-th edition). The component composition of the essential oil was determined by an Agilent 7890 A gas-liquid chromatograph with an Agilent 5975 C mass-selective detector. Results and discussion. As a result of the microscopic examination of the roots of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce,</b> it was established that the essential oil is localized mainly in resinous courses located in the wood of the root. In {{the central part of the}} root, resin moves are of a larger diameter. More than 18 components were found in the essential oil of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce</b> roots, 14 of them were identifi ed. The main component of the essential oil is sesquiterpene lactone – tanbergol. Conclusion. The essential oil of <b>European</b> <b>Spruce</b> roots has a unique component composition that includes components not characteristic for the essential oil of spruce greenery. The difference in the component composition indicates the difference in properties and pharmacological activity. Further studies are of interest for determining the prospects of using <b>European</b> <b>Spruce</b> roots. </p...|$|R
50|$|Gilpinia hercyniae, the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly,</b> {{was first}} found in North America near Hull, Quebec, in 1922 (Rose and Lindquist 1985).

Population levels exploded, and further damage subsequently occurred in New Brunswick and the northeastern United States (Balch 1936a, b, 1937; Blais 1961). Loss of wood from spruce mortality was estimated at 10 million cubic metres (Rose and Lindquist 1985), but by the mid-1980s pest numbers on all species of spruce in Canada from Manitoba to the Atlantic Ocean and in adjacent parts of the United States had become relatively low {{under the influence of}} spontaneous virus disease and introduced parasites. In Newfoundland, control was helped by the introduction of the masked shrew, a cocoon-hunting insectivore.|$|E
50|$|Defoliation {{of trees}} reduces their {{photosynthetic}} capacity and therefore curtails growth. In conifers, reduction in radial growth does not normally {{coincide with the}} first year of defoliation. For instance, the ring width of white spruce defoliation by the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Gilpinia hercyniae Htg.) showed reduced growth beginning in the year after defoliation; the reduction occurred throughout the stem but was greatest in the lower part (Reeks and Barter 1951). In a preliminary study, repeated severe defoliation of white spruce by the spruce budworm was not reflected in reduced radial increment at breast height during the first 3 or 4 years (Blais 1954). But in the Lac Seul infestation in northwestern Ontario, apparent radial growth suppression at breast height in white spruce first occurred in the 2nd year of severe defoliation in 2 plots and in the 3rd year in 1 plot (Blais 1958a).|$|E

In the thirties a noted researcher J.G. Wright conducted the first studies into controlled forest burns as a technique of forest management, an activity which generated considerable controversy at the time. W.E.D.

This project arose out or {{studies of the}} <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Gilpinia hercyniae (Htg.) in {{connection}} with the Canadian Forest Insect Survey at the Dominion Entomological Laboratories, Fredericton, N·B· As an introduction to the subject a brief account is here presented of the outbreak of the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly.</b> Gilpinia hercyniae was first discovered in America in the fall of 1930 in the Gaspe Peninsula. How long it had been active in this country has not been determined, but at that time it had already severely defoliated spruce over some 2, 500 square miles in the interior of the Gaspe Peninsula. The spruce sawfiy is presumed to have been introduced at least several decades ago (6). Like many organisms introduced without their native enemies, it increased rapidly in population and by 1939 had spread eastward throughout the Maritime Provinces, westward through the Province of Quebec into eastern Ontario. By this time it was also present in the New England States, as far south as Connecticut and west as New York. In 1941 the first sample of the species was received from Newroundland(6). The peak of the infestation was reached about 1938 when an estimated 12, 000 square miles were heavily infested (9). Tallies in 1942 in the Gaspe peninsula showed about 75 % by volume of the white spruce dead, and about 45 % of the black (8). The decline ot the outbreak coincided with the appearance of diseased larvae. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Diprion polytomum, {{was first}} {{discovered}} in America in an active outbreak in the Gaspé Peninsula {{in the fall}} of 1930. The population density and wide distribution of the insect, as well as the ring pattern of spruce trees, indicated that the insect had been present in large numbers for several years prior to 1930. SubseQuently, museum specimens taken near Ottawa in 1922 and in New Hampshire in 1929 were identified as D. polytomum, showing that the species had a wide distribution throughout eastern North America before its discovery in the relatively inaccessible interior of the Gaspé Peninsula. Balch (1939) has summarized the evidence that the insect is an introduction from Europe which was probably effected before the twentieth century. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} {{the study of}} insect {{pathogens}} was not {{regarded as one of}} the duties of the entomologist. When insects became numerous and caused economic damage, they were combatted either with insecticides or by the introduction of parasitic or predaceous insects. The use of insecticides in the forest is not economical. Forest entomologists therefore resorted largely to the introduction and propagation of parasitic insects. Unfortunately, experience has shown, in many cases, that introduced parasites multiply too slowly to check current insect infestations. Insect pathogens multiply rapidly and at times contribute more to the control of insect pests than all other combined control factors. The control of the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>sawfly</b> by disease created new interest in the possible use of insect pathogens in biological control. Relatively few insect diseases have been discovered. Those which are now known are the obvious cases. A study of any insect population probably would reveal one or more pathogens affecting it. This is being demonstrated as the result of the newly created interest and research in insect pathology. The discovery of an organism pathogenic to insects does not necessarily imply that it can be propagated and immediately disseminated in nature and effect control. This has been attempted too often in the past with disappointing results. Any program of artificial dissemination must be based on a thorough knowledge of the nature of the organism [ [...] . ...|$|E
