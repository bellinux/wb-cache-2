And then my father died and I sort of {{realized}} that he had certainly lived his life through my golf game. I really hadn't probably given him the best of that. So I sort of <b>got</b> <b>myself</b> back to work. So '70 was an emotional one for me from that standpoint.... It was a big boost.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1993–94 Sheffield Shield season, Ponting spoke of his goals for the summer. [...] "I've <b>got</b> <b>myself</b> the goal of making 1,000 runs in the season. Hopefully, I can stay in the middle long enough or do that. You can't worry about other people's expectation. I don't care at all what is written in the press. I like to read it but it doesn't go too far into my head." [...] In Tasmania's final {{round-robin}} match of the season, they needed to defeat South Australia outright to qualify for the final. Set 366 runs to win in 102 overs, Ponting joined Dene Hills at the crease with the score at 2/35. Ponting scored 161 in a 290-run partnership that ended with Tasmania needing just 41 runs for victory. Despite Tasmania losing four quick wickets after his dismissal, they won with four wickets in hand. Disappointingly for Ponting, he could not repeat the performance in the final against New South Wales. He scored just one and 28, as Tasmania were defeated by an innings and 61 runs. The season saw Ponting score 965 runs at 48.25, close to his 1,000 run goal.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to most of}} {{the songs}} from Light Years, [...] "Spinning Around" [...] is a [...] "string-laden" [...] dance-pop track with {{prominent}} influences from disco music. According to the sheet music of the song published by BMG Rights Management at Musicnotes.com, it is composed in the key of F minor and features a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. Minogue's vocal range spans from the low note of F3 to the high note of C5. Addressing the theme of reinvention, the lyrics declare that Minogue has changed and learned from her past mistakes; it contains lines like [...] "I'm spinning around/Move out of my way... I'm not the same" [...] and [...] "Mistakes that I made have given me the strength to really believe." [...] In an analysis of the lyrics of the song, Pom Avoledo from Blogcritics wrote that Minogue demands attention in the chorus towards the changes in her personality and asserts that people appreciate them, in the line [...] "I know you're feelin me cause you like it like this." [...] The first verse deals with Minogue ridding herself of items and symbols from her past and starting afresh, evidenced in lines like [...] "Threw away my old clothes, <b>got</b> <b>myself</b> a better wardrobe." [...] The critic felt that in the second verse Minogue faces her mistakes and accepts herself as she is. The bridge of the song features the repetition of the hook [...] "You know you like it like this," [...] with Minogue's voice being vocoded. Chris True from AllMusic felt that through the lyrics, Minogue was admitting that releasing Impossible Princess in 1997 was not the best decision.|$|E

2500|$|New members Ralph Johnson and Reggie Torian {{replaced}} Hutson, and the Impressions {{had three}} R Top 5 singles in 19741975: the #1 [...] "Finally <b>Got</b> <b>Myself</b> Together (I'm a Changed Man)" [...] (which also reached the Pop top 20) and the #3 singles [...] "Same Thing it Took" [...] and [...] "Sooner or Later". [...] In 1976, the Impressions left Curtom and Mayfield behind for Cotillion Records and had their final major hit with [...] "Loving Power". [...] The same year, Ralph Johnson {{was replaced by}} Nate Evans, who remained in the group for three years, during which time the Impressions switched to 20th Century Records. [...] Singles and albums sales continued to slip, and Evans left in 1979, reducing the group to a trio. [...] The album Fan the Flames was released in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Early in 1977, Terry Nation was {{commissioned}} to write four more episodes for Series One and five episodes for Series Two. Nation was now contracted to write all thirteen episodes {{of the first}} series. The BBC had expanded Nation's writing commitment in order that Nation's high profile would help {{the promotion of the}} series. Providing a large amount of material in a short time would prove difficult for Nation. Admitting that he had agreed to write every episode out of [...] "ego and supreme confidence", Nation later recalled that he returned home following the commission and told his wife, [...] "I think I've <b>got</b> <b>myself</b> into deep trouble!". Nation informed Boucher that he would only be able to deliver the first draft of each script, telling Boucher, [...] "...you can have rewrites or you can have the next episode: which do you want?”. As a result, while Nation created the plots, Boucher provided a great deal of input into the characters and dialogue. According to Boucher, [...] "Terry came up with the characters, he came up with thirteen good stories, but he didn't come up with the dialogue. I remember saying, and I think it's pretty close to the truth, that for a long time, Paul Darrow [...] never spoke a line that I hadn't written or altered to make the lines sharper".|$|E

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Live Your Life" [...] was filmed in October 2008 in Los Angeles and was {{directed}} by Anthony Mandler. The video, using the radio edit of the song, stars T.I. and Rihanna. It plays backwards, starting {{with the end of}} T.I.'s day. In the opening scene T.I. is shown walking with bloody wounds culminating in the song beginning. It then goes from a series of underground shots of him with interspersed scenes of Rihanna in a dressing room. T.I. is then shown being thrown out of a car, being kicked by a large man. The video then cuts again to the day with T.I. wearing the same suit seen earlier in the video, but undamaged. He then encounters a group of thugs whom he brawls with. The video then begins a different story arc, showing T.I. before he made his fortune, singing in a recording studio and in front of a house playing dice and dominoes with friends. This portion of the video is interspersed with clips of the other story arc, such as showing T.I. with a briefcase full of money. He is then shown in the bathroom of a bar, before walking out into the bar passing Rihanna who has exited her dressing room. Rihanna performs on stage with a microphone while T.I. talks to a man saying [...] " [...] want out."; the man replies by explaining that there is no getting out, not for him nor for the character that Rihanna plays. T.I slams the money briefcase down on the table and shows it to the man saying that [...] "I'm done. I <b>got</b> <b>myself</b> here, I'll get myself out". Then he is seen walking into that same bar, in a flashback, with a CD in his hand. The man that T.I. spoke to earlier calls him over. This is a flashback showing T.I. trying to get a record deal. The last shot of the video takes place at around {{the same time as the}} first shot of the video. T.I. is walking down the Los Angeles River, raising his hands triumphantly in the air with a bloodied and scarred face. The song's producer, Just Blaze, is briefly seen playing pool in the bar during the second verse and final chorus.|$|E
