5|$|One day Narendra {{requested}} Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali {{for their}} family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested {{him to go}} to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed for true knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce <b>everything</b> <b>for</b> the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E

All happens <b>for</b> a reason, <b>everything</b> is <b>for</b> my mom, <b>everything</b> is <b>for</b> my fans. <b>Everything</b> is <b>for</b> myself to prove that I can do it. <b>Everything</b> is <b>for</b> the future. I could go on, but in the end the meaning is [...] "Everything happens for a reason". Then there is also the meaning of the number 4: a chair has four legs, a table even. They are also 4 seasons, representing change. So 4 is a number that follows us everywhere. 4 is symmetrical. Then, Everything is 4." ...|$|R

5|$|To begin with, {{the number}} of the party members is {{extremely}} large. Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual thinking was switched off, and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in <b>everything</b> <b>for</b> them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who were ready to use brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.|$|E
5|$|No. There’s {{always going}} to be two sides to <b>{{everything}}.</b> <b>For</b> me, everything that I did with the Harajuku Girls was just a pure compliment and being a fan. You can’t be a fan of somebody else? Or another culture? Of course you can. Of course you can celebrate other cultures. That’s what Japanese culture and American culture have done. It’s like I say in the song: it’s a ping-pong match. We do something American, they take it and they flip it and make it so Japanese and so cool. And we take it back and go, “Whoa, that’s so cool!” That’s so beautiful. It’s a beautiful thing in the world, how our cultures come together. I don’t feel like I did anything but share that love. You can look at it from a negative point of view if you want to, but get off my cloud. Because, seriously, that was all meant out of love.|$|E
5|$|After {{agreeing on}} an initial idea, Bushnell and Dabney {{began trying to}} design a {{prototype}} based on a Data General Nova. Initially {{they were joined by}} Larry Bryan, a computer programmer who also worked at Ampex. Bushnell and Dabney put US$100 each into a partnership, named Syzygy by Bryan. They soon ran into difficulties with their planned design; the computer was not powerful enough to refresh the monitors as fast as was needed to make the game playable. Bryan realized this early on, when trying to design the code needed to run the games, and left the project before Syzygy was formed without ever contributing any money, but Bushnell and Dabney continued working on the design for several more months. The pair attempted to reduce the load on the computer by replacing subroutines—such as displaying the background stars—with specialized hardware, but it proved insufficient; even reducing the number of monitors was not enough. By the end of November 1970, Bushnell decided to abandon the project as untenable, while Dabney had stopped working on the design a while before. It is unclear if the pair were aware that Data General had demonstrated a more powerful variant of the Nova, sold for US$8,000, running a single game of Spacewar at the Fall Joint Computer Conference in December 1968, though that solution would have been too expensive for an arcade game, which typically cost US$1,000 at the time. Unable to put the game idea out of his mind, however, Bushnell soon thought of a way to manipulate the video signal on the screen without a computer controlling it, and from there Syzygy {{came up with the idea}} of removing the computer altogether and building specialized hardware to handle <b>everything</b> <b>for</b> the game instead.|$|E

25|$|Lund University {{library was}} {{established}} in 1668 {{at the same time}} as the university and is one of Sweden's oldest and largest libraries.

Swedish imprints make up half of the collections, which amount to 170,000 linear metres of shelving (2006).

25|$|Though Sarah is more deferential than Nancy, {{she does}} assert herself to Leslie when an {{experience}} is important.

Like Leslie, Sarah does not grasp many human concepts like emotions and nonaquatic animals, though she tries.|$|E

25|$|A similar defense {{comes from}} Australian philosopher Frank Jackson (born 1943) who revived {{the theory of}} epiphenomenalism which argues that mental states do not {{play a role in}} {{physical}} states. Jackson argues that {{there are two kinds of}} dualism. The first is substance dualism that assumes there is second, non-corporeal form of reality. In this form, body and soul are two different substances. The second form is property dualism that says that body and soul are different properties of the same body. He claims that functions of the mind/soul are internal, very private experiences that are not accessible to observation by others, and therefore not accessible by science (at least not yet). We can know <b>everything,</b> <b>for</b> example, about a bat's facility for echolocation, but we will never know how the bat experiences that phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Advaita also posits {{the fourth}} state of Turiya, which some {{describe}} as pure consciousness, the background that underlies and transcends these three common states of consciousness. Turiya {{is the state}} of liberation, where states Advaita school, one experiences the infinite (ananta) and non-different (advaita/abheda), that is free from the dualistic experience, the state in which ajativada, non-origination, is apprehended. According to Candradhara Sarma, Turiya state is where the foundational Self is realized, it is measureless, neither cause nor effect, all prevading, without suffering, blissful, changeless, self-luminous, real, immanent in all things and transcendent. Those who have experienced the Turiya stage of self-consciousness have reached the pure awareness of their own non-dual Self as one with everyone and <b>everything,</b> <b>for</b> them the knowledge, the knower, the known becomes one, they are the Jivanmukta.|$|E
25|$|The {{mosaic of}} the victorious charioteer is younger than these works. It {{dates from the}} second half of the 4th century CE, and {{features}} the phrase Eros omnia per te (Eros <b>everything</b> <b>for</b> you). The depiction of the charioteer shows great attention to realism, as do the depictions of the horses, two of which are named Amandus and Frunitus after their characters. The horses are arranged symmetrically; such symmetries were very popular at the time. The charioteer is holding a whip, a crown made of branches and a palm branch. The starting blocks of the circus can be seen in the background. This work of art was found in a private residence and it appears that it must be interpreted as a monument donated by the owner celebrating the victory of a charioteer named Eros.|$|E
