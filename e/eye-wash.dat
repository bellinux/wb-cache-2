Millions read these leaders and feel a {{momentary}} benefit, en route for the more actual portions of the paper. He asks: [...] "Why are all men gamblers?" [...] He discusses our Longing for Immortal Imperfection, and [...] "Did we once live on the moon?" [...] He recommends the substitution of whisky and soda for neat whisky, drawing an illustration from the comparative effect of the diluted and of the undiluted liquid as an <b>eye-wash</b> ("Try whisky on your friend's eyeball!" [...] is the heading), sleep ("The man who loses sleep will make a failure of his life, or at least diminish greatly his chances of success"), and {{the education of the}} feminine intelligence ("The cow that kicks her weaned calf is all heart"). He makes identically the same confident appeal to the moral motive which was for so long the salvation of the Puritan individualism from which the American tradition derives.

Also in this school year plans were created to refurbish the 30-year-old school laboratories to modern standards; among the new features are key-operated gas pressure systems and <b>eye-wash</b> stations.

Some of these words were created {{for the purpose of}} deceiving the supervision of the metropolis in the days when cachaça was banned in Brazil; the beverage was competing with the European distillate grappa. There are more than two thousand (2,000) words to refer to the Brazilian national distillate. Some of these nicknames are: abre-coração (heart-opener), água-benta (holy water), bafo-de-tigre (tiger breath), and limpa-olho (<b>eye-wash).</b>|$|E

Materials of the battery room must resist corrosion and contain any accidental spills. Plant personnel must be protected from spilled electrolyte. In some jurisdictions, large battery systems may contain reportable amounts of sulfuric acid, a concern for fire departments. [...] Battery rooms in industrial and utility installations typically have an <b>eye-wash</b> station or decontamination showers nearby, so that workers who are accidentally splashed with electrolyte can immediately wash {{it away from the}} eyes and skin.|$|E

Kubera assigns them important tasks like delivering a magic <b>eye-wash</b> to the god and epic-hero Rama, to aid him in war. They also serve as messengers and are sent to witness battles. In other instances, they {{are described}} as residing on Hemakuta or on Mount Gandhamandana, in the palace of Kubera. They also live on earth and in hills. They {{are described as}} half-bird or half-equine in nature. They have glowing forms in heaven, take demonic forms during war, and look like gnomes on earth.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To {{report the}} {{development}} of a new apparatus for non-invasive collection of human corneal epithelial cells. Methods. Previous methods of non-invasive, irrigative corneal cell collection resulted in low cell yields limiting potential analysis. A new ocular surface cell collection apparatus (OSCCA) was designed to collect more epithelial cells from direct irrigation of the corneal surface to allow for clinical comparisons. Forty-five samples were obtained (unilateral or bilateral over seven visits) from five human participants. Cell yield, size, phenotype, and corneal staining (prior and post eye wash) were examined. Results. On average 364 ± 230 epithelial cells were collected from the cornea per eye. Epithelial cell sizes ranged from 8. 21 to 51. 69 μm in diameter, and 67. 30 to 2098. 85 μm 2 area. The proportion of corneal specific cells collected per sample was 75 ± 14 % as determined by positive K 3 expression with AE 5. On average, 77 ± 0. 2 % of epithelial cells harvested were nucleated, the remainder were non-nucleated ghost cells. Corneal staining was reduced in the OSCCA-washed vs. contralateral non-washed eyes (p = 0. 02). Conclusions. The OSCCA allows collection of human corneal epithelial cells with significantly higher yields, and greater specificity than previously reported. Reduced corneal staining observed post <b>eye-wash</b> demonstrated the safety of the technique, and its ability to remove cells directly from the corneal surface. The OSCCA could provide an objective non-invasive method of investigating pathological changes, effects of topical therapeutics, and impact of contact lenses and care-solutions of the cells of the ocular surface. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the expression of}} MUC 16 protein in tears and conjunctival cell membranes and MUC 16 mRNA in conjunctival cells of Sjogren’s syndrome (SS), keratoconjunctivitus sicca (KCS) and non-dry eyed (NDE) subjects. The relationship of tear flow and soluble MUC 16 concentration was also measured. Methods: Seventy-six subjects were recruited for this study: 25 SS (confirmed via American-European Consensus Criteria 2002), 25 KCS (confirmed by symptoms and Schirmer scores ≤ 10 mm) and 26 NDE. Tear flow {{was measured by the}} Schirmer test without anesthesia for 5 min. Tears were collected using an <b>eye-wash</b> technique. Protein and mRNA were isolated from conjunctival epithelial cells collected via impression cytology. Soluble and membrane bound MUC 16 were quantified via western blotting and MUC 16 mRNA was quantified by real time qPCR. Results: The SS group demonstrated significantly higher concentrations of soluble MUC 16 (7. 28 [SS]± 3. 97 versus 3. 35 [KCS]± 4. 54 [p= 0. 004] and versus 1. 61 [NDE]± 1. 22 [p< 0. 001]) and MUC 16 mRNA (4. 66 [SS]± 5. 06 versus 1. 84 [KCS] ± 2. 26 [p= 0. 01] and 1. 52 [NDE]± 1. 04 [p= 0. 003]) compared to both KCS and NDE groups, respectively. No differences in soluble MUC 16 or MUC 16 mRNA were found between the KCS and NDE groups. Membrane bound MUC 16 was similar in all three groups. No significant correlation was found between mean Schirmer values and any measure of MUC 16 expression. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that SS subjects display a significant increase in both soluble MUC 16 and MUC 1...|$|E
40|$|Emergency {{planning}} and preparedness are sometime {{omitted from the}} management of a dyeing factory. Since different processes are operating in a dyeing factory involving use of large machinery, use of hot steam and large amount of chemicals, etc. Failure in the operation may lead to explosion of machinery and spillage of toxic chemical, etc. Therefore, the emergency {{planning and}} preparedness are vital to the dyeing factory because when an emergency does occur, a quick and correct response is necessary to reduce injuries, illness, property damage, environment harm and public concern. Management should identify the types of emergencies the dyeing factory needs to plan, organise, practise and prepare for. A good emergency planning and preparedness could introduce the following:• Fewer claims, resulting in lower insurance premiums;• Less absenteeism and sickness;• Fewer injury and damage accidents;• Better levels of health (both occupational and general);• Higher productivity and efficiency;• Better utilisation of plant and equipment because of less down time;• Higher levels of quality and product safety;• Better legislative compliance;• Higher employee morale and motivation;• Better cost control and reduction; and• Better enterprise image. It could be seen that emergency planning and preparedness means considerably more than providing a first-aid kit, stretcher, emergency shower and <b>eye-wash</b> fountain, or fire blanket. Instead, {{there should be a}} written plan of action for every facility detailing the actions to be taken when an emergency occurs. This ensures appropriate responses when facing extraordinary circumstances. The effectiveness of any of these plans usually is proportionate to the thoroughness and soundness of the planning effort. This paper will introduce the methods of emergency planning and preparedness to be implement in a dyeing factory. Institute of Textiles and ClothingRefereed conference pape...|$|E
