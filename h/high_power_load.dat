Ex situ analysis of the samples was performed by means of ion beam diagnostics. Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) technique was applied using the D(3 He,p) 4 He reaction to quantify the fuel retention on the samples. In this work the deuterium retention is compared between pure Sn and Li–Sn alloy samples in both liquid and solid states. All the samples were found to have retention ratios smaller than 0. 1  at. %. This low retention ratio is expected for pure tin given its high mass and the instability of tin hydrides. However the retention was unexpectedly low for the case of Li–Sn which was thought to be dominated by the lithium fraction in the alloy.

40|$|An {{improved}} flexible solar-aided {{power generation}} system (SAPG) for enhancing both selective catalytic reduction (SCR) de-NOx efficiency and coal-based energy efficiency of coal-fired power plants is proposed. In the proposed concept, the solar energy injection point is changed for different power plant loads, bringing about different benefits for coal-fired power generation. For partial/low load, solar energy is beneficially used to increase the flue gas temperature to guarantee the SCR de-NOx effectiveness as well as increase the boiler energy input by reheating the combustion air. For <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>load,</b> solar energy is used for saving steam bleeds from turbines by heating the feed water.

Discussion with the faculty involved {{in the operation of}} the room indicated that some power quality issues such as periodic outages and brownouts posed serious potential damage to computer equipment, and solving these issues would save the university money and lost time. The senior design team used Eagle Power Quality Meters to monitor and record voltage waveforms on multiple 120 V AC phases for three months and also collected real-time data of current and consumed power from the room. Based on the collected data, the team did power quality analysis, recognized some single phase contingency conditions, and determined that isolation via a large battery backed UPS inverter would be most ideal. The biggest constraint of the design was cost. UPS inverters designed to carry a <b>high</b> <b>power</b> <b>load</b> such as the clean room, are highly expensive to design and build. This was countered by producing a low cost, demonstration platform that the school can use to justify expenditure to upgrade. A literature research of IEEE papers as well as observations of residential grade inverters is performed to design the circuit, and the microcontroller logic as developed by the team as an ideal, low cost control solution. The team has designed the inverter topology, programmed the logic controller, and designed a load center to test the inverter’s capabilities. However, cleaning of the fundamental frequency can still be addressed. This would require an altered topology to allow additional transistors in each phase’s network, as well as a reprogrammed microprocessor {{to take advantage of the}} change in topology.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} a {{universal}} power module for microsystems. This module should provide power conditioning, energy storage, and load matching for a variety of energy sources and loads such as microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and wireless sensors and micro-robots. There are a variety of potential ambient and human powered energy sources, which can supply some of the power needs of the military. The challenge is to capture these available sources of electrical energy and condition them to meet the voltage, current, and overall power demands of field-deployable microelectronics and MEMs-based devices such as wireless sensors and micro-robots. Most natural and man-made energy sources found in the environment have a low specific power and are not generally available on a continuous basis. Likewise, human-based energy sources must be optimally managed to meet the power needs in the field. Therefore, a power supply must have the ability to capture the available energy and store it in such a manner to be useful to meet the mission requirements of the device that is connected to the source. It must continuously monitor the status of energy stored and determine the expected demands of the device. A microelectronics-based power management chip can be developed to meet these objectives.
