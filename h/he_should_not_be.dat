5|$|Archimedes {{died during}} the Siege of Syracuse {{when he was killed}} by a Roman soldier despite orders that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> harmed. Cicero {{describes}} visiting the tomb of Archimedes, which was surmounted by a sphere and a cylinder, which Archimedes had requested to be placed on his tomb, representing his mathematical discoveries.|$|E
5|$|He {{should be}} neat and tidy, {{with a good}} head of hair, well-combed, short at the back and sides; he should have clean hands, his fingernails should be trimmed, he should wear a white apron; <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> quarrelsome, he should be sober, submissive, brisk; he should have a good {{understanding}} of flavor, a sound knowledge of ingredients and utensils, together with a willingness to serve everyone.|$|E
5|$|By now the Ordainers {{had drawn}} up their Ordinances for reform and Edward had little {{political}} {{choice but to}} give way and accept them in October. The Ordinances of 1311 contained clauses limiting the King's right {{to go to war}} or to grant land without parliament's approval, giving parliament control over the royal administration, abolishing the system of prises, excluding the Frescobaldi bankers, and introducing a system to monitor the adherence to the Ordinances. In addition, the Ordinances exiled Gaveston once again, this time with instructions that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> allowed to live anywhere within Edward's lands, including Gascony and Ireland, and that he should be stripped of his titles. Edward retreated to his estates at Windsor and Kings Langley; Gaveston left England, possibly for northern France or Flanders.|$|E

5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> held personally responsible for its content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed {{by many of the}} groups attending, who argued that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the annual conference of a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan blogosphere.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to act similar to the mythological dragon: {{as soon as he}} saw bad weather approaching, which he knew was brought by an ala, he would leave whatever he was doing, and fly up to confront the demon. This he did by falling into a deep sleep, or entering a state similar to death, usually at the very spot where he happened to be at that time. His soul then left his body in the form of a snake or a lizard, and soared skywards. It was claimed that he was not breathing as long as his soul was absent from his body. The battle could last for a whole day, or even for several days, during which time the man lay unconscious, sweating profusely from the exertion of the fight. There was a danger that, during the course of the battle, the ala might approach the man's body and harm him, which could be prevented by someone swinging a blade above him, or by sticking the blade at the lying man's head. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> pushed or moved while in this state: if he was not in the same position as when he fell asleep, his soul would not be able to return into his body, and he would die. When he woke up after the battle with the ala, he was very tired. Apart from these characteristics, the dragon man was seen as an ordinary human.|$|E
50|$|Walker's {{conviction}} was upheld on appeal, but {{the sentence}} was shortened to 27 years as Walker successfully argued in 2002 that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> treated more harshly than other murderers.|$|R
60|$|No answer came. Naturally <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> {{surprised}} at this; {{and yet he}} felt a little checked, {{even though she had}} only refrained from volunteering a reply that <b>was</b> <b>not</b> demanded.|$|R

50|$|The Roberts Court {{held that}} Sarausad was tried with due process by the State of Washington, and that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> granted habeas corpus relief. In doing so, the federal {{government}} overstepped its bounds.|$|R
50|$|Where, however, {{an accused}} faces a charge {{as serious as}} that of rape, with a {{possible}} life sentence, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> only <b>be</b> advised of his right to a legal representative, but encouraged to exercise it.|$|R

25|$|Moses was {{supposed}} to receive the priesthood along with {{the leadership of the}} Jewish people, but when he argued with God that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the leader, God then chose Aaron as the recipient of the priesthood.|$|E
25|$|Sir William Young GCB (16 August 1751 – 25 October 1821) was {{an officer}} of the Royal Navy who saw service during the American War of Independence, and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} with his namesake and near contemporary Admiral William Young. William Young (1761-1847).|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> amused just then. He was too low. Directly {{before him}} was a {{hillside}} crowned with trees. He shot above the trees, cold in the stomach, muttering, [...] "Gee! that was careless!" ...|$|R
60|$|While Rollo {{was eating}} it {{he asked his}} uncle George whether, in case he had gone down the river to Boppard, and had not got back until dark, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> anxious about him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have <b>been</b> here {{to welcome}} you, {{and that your}} stay is for so brief a time. It seems so strange that after having talked of you for years, we should see you only for hours.' ...|$|R
25|$|According to {{some analysts}} and {{campaign}} aides, Davis' {{town hall meetings}} and conversations with voters were softening his image. Many political insiders remarked that Davis had made several comebacks and that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> counted {{out of the race}} despite poll numbers that showed over 50% planning to vote yes on the recall.|$|E
25|$|The {{reactions}} on Riis's admission {{have been}} mixed. Some critics have {{called him a}} cheater, and that the results he achieved in his career were worthless. Others have labelled him {{as a victim of}} the doping culture that was rampant in professional road cycling, and have insisted that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> scapegoated for a wider problem.|$|E
25|$|Sir Hugh Calveley (died 23 April 1394) was an English {{knight and}} commander, {{who took part}} in the Hundred Years' War, gaining fame during the War of the Breton Succession and the Castilian Civil War.

6000|$|... "Say {{nothing to}} the Saxons of his absence," [...] said this bold leader, when the {{diminution}} of his force was reported to him. [...] "The false Lowland tongues might {{say that one of}} Clan Chattan was a coward, and perhaps that the rest favoured his escape, {{in order to have a}} pretence to avoid the battle. I am sure that Ferquhard Day will be found in the ranks ere we are ready for battle; or, if <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not,</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> I man enough for two of the Clan Quhele? or would we not fight them fifteen to thirty, rather than lose the renown that this day will bring us?" ...|$|R
50|$|A 6th century hero called Eidol is {{mentioned}} in The Gododdin but {{is unlikely to}} be the source for Geoffrey's Eldol. <b>He</b> <b>should</b> also <b>not</b> <b>be</b> confused with Eldol, Consul of Gloucester who lives generations later in Geoffrey's work.|$|R

25|$|His {{nightmare}} {{year was}} further compounded in May 2007, when in a reserve game for his club, he suffered an eye injury, that required eight stitches. It {{has been confirmed}} that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> included in the Tyrone panel for their Ulster Championship campaign. While there were fears that the eye injury may lead to serious long-term damage to his eyesight, McGuigan has reportedly been making good progress as of September 2007, and made a substitution comeback during the 2008 National League against Laois.|$|E
25|$|Wain {{was born}} with a cleft lip and the doctor gave his parents the orders that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sent to school or taught until he was ten years old. As a youth, he was often truant from school, and spent much of his {{childhood}} wandering around London. Following this period, Louis studied at the West London School of Art and eventually became a teacher there for a short period. At the age of 20, Wain was left to support his mother and his five sisters after his father's death.|$|E
25|$|Days {{after the}} match, Afridi posted a video on Twitter, {{in which he}} apologised to all his fans for the teams disappointing performance. He said he didn't care about what others were saying about him and only wanted to answer to his fans and wanted to apologise for letting them and Pakistan down. Despite earlier criticism, many fans commented and {{circulated}} that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> sorry, with many from India supporting him.

50|$|Garwood {{insists he}} saw other American {{prisoner}}s of war after 1973 and insists he himself had been held prisoner for 14 years, though there are inconsistencies in his story.
