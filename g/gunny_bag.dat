5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the <b>gunny</b> <b>bag</b> weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

40|$|The {{frequency}} of fungal infection of sorghum grain samples taken from 5 storage systems (<b>gunny</b> <b>bags,</b> mud-lined baskets (MB), polypropylene bags (PB), an MB/PB mix and open storage {{in the corner}} of a room), involving 26 different varieties, hybrids or local cultivars, 2 seasons (1996 rainy and 1996 / 97 post-rainy) and 4 fungicide treatments (surface sterilization with 1 % sodium hypochlorite plus benomyl treatment, sodium hypochlorite or benomyl alone, and an untreated control) was recorded from rural areas of India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra) in 1997. The major fungi recorded in the samples were Alternaria alternata, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus niger, Bipolaris australiensis [Cochliobolus australiensis], Curvularia lunata [Cochliobolus lunatus], C. lunata var. aeria, Fusarium moniliforme [Gibberella fujikuroi], Lisea fujikuroi [Gibberella fujikuroi], Penicillium citrinum, Phoma sorghina and Rhizopus stolonifer. Full results are tabulated. Grain germination was better in samples collected after the rainy season and from grain stored in <b>gunny</b> <b>bags</b> and mud-lined baskets. Local cultivars tended to germinate better than hybrids and have lower fungal infection. Grains surface-sterilized with 1 % sodium hypochlorite and treated with benomyl (0. 05 %) had the highest germination (81 %), but sterilization did not eliminate all fungal contamination. It is suggested that grain be stored in <b>gunny</b> <b>bags</b> or jute bags to minimize damage from Fusarium spp. and that mould tolerant/resistant genotypes are grown during the rainy season...|$|R
50|$|To {{create the}} liqueur the Laraha peel is dried, {{bringing}} out the sweetly fragranced oils. After soaking in a still with alcohol and water for several days, the peel is removed and other spices are added. The company Senior & Co uses a 120-year-old copper kettle for the distilling process. They put the peels in a <b>gunny</b> <b>bag,</b> spices are added and then hung in a heated copper still with 96% pure and kosher alcohol (derived from sugar cane) for 3 days. After 1 day cooling, water is added and distillation takes place for another 3 days. The liqueur has an orange-like flavor {{with varying degrees of}} bitterness. It is naturally colorless but is often given artificial coloring, most commonly blue or orange, which confers an exotic appearance to cocktails and other mixed drinks. The blue color is achieved by adding a food colorant, most often E133 Brilliant Blue.|$|E

The aflatoxin levels in stored seed were low and not significantly different between the two storage systems. The levels of O 2 in PICS bags artificially infested with C. maculatus dropped rapidly during {{the first month of}} storage while the levels of CO 2 increased. Even in absence of bruchids (noninfested seed) PICS bags preserved seed germination for extended periods of time better than gunny bags; possibly due to the higher and more stable relative humidity inside the PICS bags. Higher seed germination would result in improved plant stands in the field and subsequent higher yields and increased productivity. Thus, PICS bags have shown potential to positively impact the economy of pigeonpea farmers in the semi-arid tropics...|$|R
50|$|As the {{brothers}} feel cornered, Dabloo, {{out of desperation}} makes the mistake of kidnapping an orphaned teenage girl Sunita (Vega Tamotia), who and her younger brother Nagesh (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) refuse to give away the land. After the kidnapping, Dabloo rapes and kills the girl and hangs her from a tree showing this as a suicide just as her father had committed suicide too under pressure of selling the land. Singh comes to his senses after seeing this brutal crime and tries to arrest Dabloo Pandey, which starts a riot in the town inducing Nagesh, the younger brother of the murdered girl to use his belt throttle Dabloo's neck and killing him, seeing which the villagers gather around some more goons and the corrupt Sarpanch and kill them and hang them on the tree claiming it to be suicides. This also starts a chain reaction where corrupt people are killed in similar manner elsewhere. Abha is frustrated and is unable to control these illegal killings. She tries her best to control the law and order. Singh is attacked by Babloo and his goons and gets injured. Babloo frantically searches for Nagesh, who has killed Dabloo and is now hidden away by Singh from Babloo. Babloo's goons locate Nagesh and take him in a <b>gunny</b> <b>bag</b> to Babloo, who wants to eliminate him by hanging. But in a final showdown, Babloo Pandey gets arrested and the reign of corruption, terror, and anarchy comes to an end.|$|E
5000|$|The 19th century {{brought about}} the {{so-called}} [...] "backward classes movement", {{a direct result of}} the hegemony in employment (in educational and government sectors) by the wealthy few and the loss of jobs across southern India due to the Industrial Revolution in England. This movement was heralded first by the Lingayats followed by the Vokkaligas and the Kurubas. The economic revolution in England and the tariff policies of the British caused massive deindustrialization in India, especially in the textile sector. For example, Bangalore was known to have had a flourishing textile industry prior to 1800 and the <b>gunny</b> <b>bag</b> weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, a state of events that changed significantly when the British began ruling the area. The import of a chemical substitute of saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. The import of kerosene affected the Ganiga community who supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business and the mill made blankets replaced the country made kambli. This economic fallout led to the formation of community based social welfare organizations such as the Lingayat Vidyavardhakara Sangha in Dharwad in 1883, the Vokkaligara Sanga in Bangalore in 1906 and the Praja Mitra Mandali in Mysore in 1917. The goal of these organizations was to help those within the community to cope better with a new economic situation.
