40|$|In the {{production}} of garments, embroidery carries out decorative, informative, data trans-fer and other functions. The features of textiles, stitch density, filling type, area and other factors have a direct influence on embroidery quality. The objective of the paper {{was to investigate the}} influence of <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> on the accuracy of embroidery pattern di-mensions. For the investigations, <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> with a different linear density, fibre composition, structure, and purpose were selected. Test samples were embroidered by two different filling types, with an embroidery width of 7, 6, 4, 3 and 2 mm, in warp and weft directions and in the bias direction. In all the cases analysed, the width and area of the embroidery pattern was established to decrease the width and area of the digital design. The greatest elongation values were observed during the embroidery process in the bias direction of the fabric.

5000|$|Embroidery floss or {{stranded}} cotton is a loosely twisted, slightly glossy 6-strand thread, usually {{of cotton}} but also manufactured in silk, linen, and rayon.

Vectran fibers are thinner than human hair, and relatively inexpensive. Vectran is lightweight, flexible, and high in tensile strength, the stress at which material deforms (five times stronger than steel), which makes it an ideal component for synthetic fibers. Vectran has also been used by NASA and in bicycle tires, among other things..|$|R

40|$|A {{chasuble}} {{from the}} textile {{collection of the}} Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga underwent a laboratorial study prior to the conservation treatment. The analyses gave vegetable fibres for the support layers used in the embroidered strips (orphreys), in the applied embroidered figures, in the volume in-filling threads of those applied embroidered figures, and the intermediate linning support layer. The patterned silk, the back linning, and the <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> of the orphreys are made of ungummed silk. Through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry {{the main component of}} the metallic <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> was found to be silver, although other metals were also detected. These results together with the observations made using a metallographic microscope and a scanning electron microscope suggest that the golden threads should be gold plated silver, which was commonly used between the 15 th and 17 th Centuries. This paper also presents a description of the condition survey and treatment intervention, which includes the application of a nylon support as a consolidation method on the embroidered figures, opposed to the traditional method, which was thought to be inadequate for the present case...|$|R

The <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> of the original are z-twisted (right laid) and are sewn exclusively in backstitch while the replica uses looser s-twisted yarn and a variety of different stitches.

40|$|Embroidery {{technologies}} are widely applied for developing decorative elements of original design in garments, for integrating threads intended for protection into garments and other articles. Nonconformity of {{the shape and}} dimensions of the embroidered element with the designed digital image is influenced by properties of <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> and fibres, by the filling type, density of stitches and other technological parameters. The objective of the paper is to explore the influence made by properties of fabrics and by the direction of stitches of the actual embroidered element on conformity of the shape with one of the designed digital image. For the research, <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> of different purpose as well as three woven fabrics have been selected. For preparation of test samples, round digital images have been designed filling the embroidery area in different stitch directions. Analysis {{of the results of the}} investigations has demonstrated that {{the shape and dimensions}} of the embroidered element failed to conform to the shape and dimensions of the designed digital image in most cases. In certain cases, e. g. when the stitch direction goes towards the middle of the embroidered element, a defect, i. e. hole, is observed due to considerable concentration of stitches in the centre of the element.

5000|$|Doubling is {{a textile}} {{industry}} term synonymous with combining. It {{can be used}} for various processes during spinning. During the carding stage, several sources of roving are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. [...] It is used for <b>embroidery</b> <b>threads</b> and sewing threads, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun 60s cotton are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is mercerised, gassed (AKA flamed) and wound onto a bobbin.|$|R
