However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of me but I didn't want to be killed off. I am never going to go back but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay". Franco added, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that I’m gay in my art and straight in my life".|$|E

500|$|After {{speaking}} with her friend, Swift became deeply fixated {{on the idea}} of how tragic it would be for the person one loved to wed someone else. That night, Swift experienced a dream where one of her own ex-boyfriends married another girl. To her, this signaled that she had to compose a song about interrupting a wedding. In retrospect, she concluded, [...] "For me, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it as good versus evil. And this girl is just completely – just the evil one." [...] Swift entitled the album after [...] "Speak Now" [...] because it fit the album's concept, with each song being a different confession to a person. [...] "It's called Speak Now, and that pertains to the album as a concept and as an entire theme of the record more than I can even tell you," [...] she said. The song was released as a promotional single on October 5, 2010, as part of Countdown to Speak Now, an exclusive campaign launched by the iTunes Store. During the opening week of Speak Now, Swift performed [...] "Speak Now" [...] on the Late Show with David Letterman.|$|E
500|$|Heskey {{played as}} a forward, being a {{powerful}} targetman gifted with pace and physical strength; {{he is also}} a hard working player. His play has been likened to [...] "a blunt instrument with which to bludgeon defences". His main contributions to the team lie in the way he holds the ball up and draws defenders out, leaving space behind him for another player to score. He has been credited as being an unselfish player who allows other forwards to benefit. He is not a prolific goalscorer but is able to provide a significant number of assists as a second striker. He has been quoted as saying [...] "Forwards are judged on their goalscoring. But <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> I bring a lot more to the game and I do get pleasure from assisting". He impressed the England staff with his versatility, as he can also play down the left wing. However, he has been criticised by the media for his lack of goals; lapses in his goalscoring have been described as being [...] "hardly uncommon". In 2008 it was stated that [...] "It is only the perception of his talents that changes" [...] after Heskey stated he was no better or worse than before.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

500|$|MacDermot {{has claimed}} that the songs [...] "can't all be the same. [...] You've got to get {{different}} styles.... <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> they're all a little different." [...] As such, the music in Hair runs the gamut of rock: from the rockabilly sensibilities of [...] "Don't Put it Down" [...] to the folk rock rhythms of [...] "Frank Mills" [...] and [...] "What a Piece of Work is Man". [...] "Easy to Be Hard" [...] is pure rhythm and blues, and protest rock anthems abound: [...] "Ain't Got No" [...] and [...] "The Flesh Failures". [...] The acid rock of [...] "Walking in Space" [...] and [...] "Aquarius" [...] are balanced by the mainstream pop of [...] "Good Morning Starshine". [...] Scott Miller ties the music of Hair to the hippies' political themes: [...] "The hippies... were determined to create art {{of the people and}} their chosen art form, rock/folk music was by its definition, populist. ...he hippies' music was often very angry, its anger directed at those who would prostitute the Constitution, who would sell America out, who would betray what America stood for; in other words, directed at their parents and the government."

She had been a sister of my grandfather, and people told me that I resembled her slightly. Perhaps that was why old Mr. Lawrence had always made such a pet of me.|$|R
2500|$|In January 2013 on web-based publication, Tone Deaf, Kevin {{described}} the songwriting process with his [...] "best mates" [...] as [...] "a real democratic process, it's {{like trying to}} pass legislation".

During the 2000s he issued three more albums, One More Time – Live at St Andrews (2001), Highlights of Bob Barnard's Jazz Party (2003) and Mine & Some I Adopted (2005). Tilders {{described}} his concept {{for the latter}} album, [...] "he idea was to show-case what I love to do best, playing solo, without the restrictions of an ensemble".

2500|$|The {{one thing}} these two {{different}} women share is their name: Holly Solomon. Solomon the art dealer {{was one of}} Nelson’s major influences, helping him find his style, which often features shapes, patterns, and words. His 2013 exhibition title “Polka Dots for Holly Solomon," [...] is fitting. Based heavily on pattern and decoration, Nelson uses the polka dot as both object and non-object, while incorporating “affirmations” as text jargon and a nod to society’s obsession with the pursuit of happiness. Taking its cue from its name, Polka Dots For Holly Solomon is a large-scale installation of polka dot patterns and subliminal messages presented across an array of two-dimensional and three-dimensional surfaces. Nelson says that the intention behind his new work is to “mean something and mean nothing at all. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it as ‘non-conceptualism’.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Ryan's {{poems are}} often quite short. In {{one of the}} first essays on Ryan, Dana Gioia wrote about this aspect of her poetry. [...] "Ryan reminds us of the suggestive power of poetry–how it elicits and rewards the reader’s intellect, imagination, and emotions. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> that Ryan’s magnificently {{compressed}} poetry – along with the emergence of other new masters of the short poem like Timothy Murphy and H.L. Hix and the veteran maestri like Ted Kooser and Dick Davis – signals a return to concision and intensity." [...] Ryan tends to avoid using the personal [...] "I" [...] in her poetry, claiming that she [...] "didn’t want confession. [...] didn’t want to be Anne Sexton." [...] Though distanced, her work is often deeply introspective, analyzing both the nature of the mind [...] and the ability of language to mold reality.|$|E

2500|$|Haldane (1957 [...] ) drew {{attention}} to the fact that in the process of the evolutionary substitution of one allele for another, at any intensity of selection and no matter how slight the importance of the locus, a substantial number of individuals would usually be lost because they did not already possess the new allele. Kimura (1960, 1961) has referred to this loss as the substitutional (or evolutional) load, but because it necessarily involves either a completely new mutation or (more usually) previous change in the environment or the genome, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it as a dilemma for the population: for most organisms, rapid turnover in a few genes precludes rapid turnover in the others. A corollary of this is that, if an environmental change occurs that necessitates the rather rapid replacement of several genes if a population is to survive, the population becomes extinct.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Richie {{revealed}} that viewers dislike seeing Kat and Alfie happy. Speaking to Inside Soap Richie commented: [...] "People don't {{like it when}} Kat and Alfie are really happy. I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{of it is that}} there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but we think they do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E

[...] During this time, Irwin won the Farber Invitational stand-up competition at the Punchline comedy club in Atlanta. [...] However, Irwin came {{to see that the}} days of storytelling comedians had passed. Irwin also realized that his style of performance was at odds with the main venue available to comedians today: comedy clubs. (Irwin joking refers to comedy clubs as [...] "evil, smelly places".) [...] Some of his stories are an hour in length, and Irwin notes, [...] "here was a time when comedians could do that but they can't anymore because the clubs give them three minutes, and they are timing the laughs per minute." [...] Using storytelling as a theatrical form allows Irwin to create more fully drawn characters and to explore darker subject matters as well. [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of my storytelling as funny, I can have these serious moments. I’m not depending on the audience to laugh the whole time...
