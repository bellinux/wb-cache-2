The network announced on May 27, 2010, that it would air the two episodes back-to-back on June 17, 2010, contingent on the 2010 NBA Finals not requiring a seventh game. Ultimately, however, a seventh game was needed, and thus ABC did not air the final two episodes of the series.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} word planet, though it <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> defined, had become a working term applied only to a small set of objects in the Solar System. After 1992, however, astronomers began to {{discover}} many additional objects beyond the orbit of Neptune, as well as hundreds of objects orbiting other stars. These discoveries not only increased the number of potential planets, but also expanded their variety and peculiarity. Some were nearly large enough to be stars, while others were smaller than Earth's moon. These discoveries challenged long-perceived notions of what a planet could be.|$|E

5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, Destination Moon was produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel – a feat that <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> achieved – with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. During the story's serialisation, Hergé established Studios Hergé, a Brussels-based team of cartoonists to aid him on the project. Hergé concluded the story arc begun in this volume with Explorers on the Moon, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative detail of the book, but have expressed mixed views of the narrative.|$|E
5|$|NY47 {{began at}} an {{interchange}} with NY104 (now the interchange between NY390 and NY104) in Greece one mile (1.6km) {{west of the}} Rochester city limits.

NY47 followed the modern NY390 alignment south to I-490, where NY47 continued onto what is now I-390. The routings of NY47 and current I-390 were identical to NY383 (Scottsville Road) in Chili, where NY47 was forced to grade level via a partially constructed interchange, as modern I-390 <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> constructed in the area southeast of NY383.|$|E

Beginning with Kumba in 1993, friction brakes have also been used as trim brakes that regulate the speed of the train while it is still navigating the course.|$|E

5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site. The gravity dam design was dropped, and a relatively new, cheaper and improved but controversial design was adopted: the multiple-arch buttress dam. In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died. His son, Robert took direction of the project along with Pleasant. In early 1926, Pleasant eventually sold the needed bonds to the New York firm Brandon, Gordon and Waddell. The firm sent Donald Ware Waddell to oversee construction.|$|E
5|$|After {{the move}} to Stoney Lane, Albion held four {{exhibition}} games to help {{cover the cost of}} the ground. The first of these was a 4–1 win against Third Lanarkshire Rifle Volunteers on 5 September 1885, in front of 2,122 spectators. Tommy Green scored a hat-trick, including the first goal to be scored at Stoney Lane. As league football <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> established, the club also played {{in a number of other}} friendly matches throughout the season. Their 31 friendly matches included 21 wins and 9 defeats, while one match against Bolton Wanderers was abandoned with the game still scoreless. Albion's joint biggest friendly victories of the season were their 7–0 wins against Small Heath Alliance, Aston Unity and Halliwell. The season's heaviest friendly defeat was the 0–7 reverse at home to Preston North End. Albion also took part in the Walsall Senior Cup and Birmingham Charity Cup, but entered a reserve team for both competitions.|$|E

On 18 March, 33 P-39s, 92 P-40s and 52 P-400s were on hand. While there were three USAAF pursuit groups in Australia, the 8th, 35th and 49th, Wurtsmith's was the only one considered combat ready. Of the 102 pilots in his group, only Wurtsmith, with 4,800 hours of pursuit time, and his executive officer, Major Donald R. Hutchinson, with 2,600 hours, were veteran pilots. Five others had more than 600 hours and nine had about 15 hours. The remaining 89 pilots had no pursuit time at all.|$|E
5|$|Beyond the XIII games, Lightning has {{appeared}} in several spin-offs within the Final Fantasy franchise. In the fighting game Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, Lightning {{is one of the}} warriors summoned by the goddess Cosmos. She was meant to debut in Dissidia Final Fantasy, but the idea was scrapped as Final Fantasy XIII <b>had</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released and Square Enix did not want to reveal her abilities ahead of time. During Dissidia 012, Lightning's group is confronted by beings called Manikins, which inflict permanent death on those they defeat, thereby threatening the world's cycle of rebirth. She leads an expedition to the portal from which the Manikins are emerging, and the group sacrifice their lives to close it. Lightning has three alternate outfits in the game. She again appeared as a playable character in the 2015 arcade title, and its home console version Dissidia Final Fantasy NT.|$|E
