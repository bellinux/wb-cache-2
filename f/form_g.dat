40|$|The {{relative}} {{amount and}} distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) molecular forms were studied in slow soleus and (less extensively) in fast extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles of the rat before and after denervation and direct stimulation. Normal EDL muscles showed higher total and specific AChE activity than normal soleus muscles and contained essentially three different molecular AChE <b>forms</b> (<b>G,,</b> Gq, and A,*) as opposed to six <b>forms</b> (<b>G,,</b> GP, G.,, A.,, As, and A 12) in the soleus. Denervation reduced AChE activity in both muscles. In the soleus direct stimulation starting 2 to 3 weeks after denervation increased the specific AChE activity markedly. The increase started 12 to 24 hr after the onset of stimulation, reached 3 to 5 times normal values after 2 to 7 days, and then declined gradually toward normal values ove...|$|R

2500|$|The modern {{lowercase}} 'g' has two typographic variants: the single-storey (sometimes opentail) '' and the double-storey (sometimes looptail) ''. The single-storey form {{derives from}} the majuscule (uppercase) form by raising the serif that distinguishes it from 'c' {{to the top of}} the loop, thus closing the loop, and extending the vertical stroke downward and to the left. The double-storey <b>form</b> (<b>g)</b> had developed similarly, except that some ornate forms then extended the tail back to the right, and to the left again, forming a closed bowl or loop. The initial extension to the left was absorbed into the upper closed bowl. The double-storey version became popular when printing switched to [...] "Roman type" [...] because the tail was effectively shorter, making it possible to put more lines on a page. In the double-storey version, a small top stroke in the upper-right, often terminating in an orb shape, is called an [...] "ear".|$|E

Then the assignment [...] extends uniquely to an algebra homomorphism [...] by sending the monomial [...] in the Clifford algebra to the product [...] of matrices and extending linearly. The space [...] on which the gamma matrices act is now a space of spinors. One needs to construct such matrices explicitly, however. In dimension 3, defining the gamma matrices to be the Pauli sigma matrices gives rise to the familiar two component spinors used in non relativistic quantum mechanics. Likewise using the [...] Dirac gamma matrices gives rise to the 4 component Dirac spinors used in 3+1 dimensional relativistic quantum field theory. In general, in order to define gamma matrices of the required kind, one can use the Weyl–Brauer matrices.|$|E

2500|$|In detail, let V be a finite-dimensional complex {{vector space}} with nondegenerate {{bilinear}} <b>form</b> <b>g.</b> The Clifford algebra [...] is the algebra generated by V {{along with the}} anticommutation relation [...] It is an abstract version of the algebra generated by the gamma or Pauli matrices. If V = Cn, with the standard form [...] we denote the Clifford algebra by Cℓn(C). Since by the choice of an orthonormal basis every complex vectorspace with non-degenerate form is isomorphic to this standard example, this notation is abused more generally if [...] If [...] is even, Cℓn(C) is isomorphic as an algebra (in a non-unique way) to the algebra [...] of [...] complex matrices (by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem and the easy to prove fact that the Clifford algebra is central simple).

Therefore, in either case [...] has a unique (up to isomorphism) irreducible representation (also called simple Clifford module), commonly denoted by Δ, of dimension 2. Since the Lie algebra [...] is embedded as a Lie subalgebra in [...] equipped with the Clifford algebra commutator as Lie bracket, the space Δ is also a Lie algebra representation of [...] called a spin representation. If n is odd, this Lie algebra representation is irreducible. If n is even, it splits further into two irreducible representations [...] called the Weyl or half-spin representations.|$|E
