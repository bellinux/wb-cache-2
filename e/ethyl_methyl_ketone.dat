40|$|Landﬁll bound {{waste from}} the oil palm industry, spent {{bleaching}} clay (SBC) containing significant amounts of adsorbed crude palm oil (CPO) {{has the potential to}} be used for biodiesel production. In this study, SBC was subjected to ultrasound-aided in situ transesteriﬁcation with a co-solvent to convert the oil into methyl esters (biodiesel).

40|$|Abstract. Auto-ignition {{temperature}} (AIT) {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} lowest temperature at which a substance will produce hot-flame ignition in air at atmospheric pressure {{without the aid of}} an external energy source such as spark or flame. Its principal applications include: defining the maximum acceptable surface temperature in a particular area, usually for electrical classification purpose, to prevent fire and explosion hazards; determining the possible hazardous consequence associated with leakage of flammable chemicals in risk assessment methods. Although AIT is indispensable for safely handling and operating flammable substance, the AITs data are, however, very much diverse in different data compilations. In present work the AITs of three ketones are measured in compliance with the ASTM E 659 test method. The measured AITs are (461. 7 ± 9. 2) ℃, (397. 8 ± 8. 0) ℃ and (399. 0 ± 8. 0) ℃ for <b>Methyl</b> <b>Ethyl</b> <b>Ketone,</b> <b>Methyl</b> Isoamyl <b>Ketone</b> and 2 -Heptanone, respectively.

The studies were supported by histopathological examination of liver sections. In vitro activity was assessed by determining the change in hepatocyte viability and other parameters such as GOT, GPT and TPTN. Materials and Methods: The ME of the roots of Baliospermum montanum was prepared and fractionated with chloroform and methanol to get activity guided fraction. The bio-active guided methanol fraction was further fractionated with <b>ethyl</b> <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> and methanol. Both the fractions were evaluated for hepatoprotective activity against paracetamol-induced toxicity. Statistical Analysis: For determining the significant intergroup difference each parameter was analyzed separately, and {{one-way analysis of variance}} was carried out and the individual comparisons of the group mean values were done using Dunnet′s test.
