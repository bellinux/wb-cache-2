5|$|In the break, {{a number}} of Central Europeans, {{including}} Vuilleumier and Bruno Trojani, asked for top speed. This was protested by the Scandinavian and United States jumpers, and a 40-minute discussion broke out. At one point, one of the facilitators at the in-run received a telephone call confirming top speed. The <b>facilitator</b> was skeptical, and chose to call back to the judges, who could confirm {{that they had not}} given such a go-ahead. In the end, the judges chose to allow higher speeds, with a compromise of 5.0meters more distance. However, the <b>facilitator</b> only moved the rope 4.5meters. This made the Swiss furious, and they used their knives to cut the rope. They then accused the participants who were opposed to full speed of being cowards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractNowadays, <b>facilitators</b> {{often can}} be seen in risk {{communication}}. And the ability of <b>facilitators</b> highly affects whether risk communication succeeds or not. Many previous studies summarized requirements for <b>facilitators</b> in the risk communication. However, these requirements are based on empirical rules of <b>facilitators</b> and qualitative analysis. Therefore, other people cannot follow and reuse the knowledge of the <b>facilitators.</b> To solve these problems, this study set an objective as clarifying functions of competent <b>facilitators</b> with both quantitative and qualitative analysis. The functions mean how <b>facilitators</b> recognize a situation of risk communication, how <b>facilitators</b> select ways to intervene communications and how the situation change is changed by the intervention. In this presentation, we propose an idea of this study...|$|R

30|$|This article {{shows the}} role of social <b>facilitators</b> in project success and failure and {{provides}} implications of how such social <b>facilitators</b> may be accelerated by direct contact. Trust, commitment, and congruence are three interrelated <b>facilitators,</b> which stimulate a relational bond between the collaborating partners that facilitates productive collaborations. However, if the <b>facilitators</b> are weak, the collaboration may be in jeopardy and risks failure. Our findings imply that if the partners that are selected {{to be involved in}} the collaboration have appropriate competences, significant opportunities will be provided for direct contact. A lack of competence inhibits the ability to exchange and prevents social <b>facilitators</b> from working efficiently in the exchange, whereas the presence of competence enables exchange, which the social <b>facilitators</b> enable and the direct contacts accelerate.|$|R

40|$|While problem-based {{learning}} (PBL) {{has been}} widely implemented in medical education, it has been acknowledged to be resource-intensive, particularly in terms of academics’ time. In some institutions, such as Bond University (Australia), casual <b>facilitators</b> have been employed (paid hourly) to oversee the PBL tutorials. Apart from considerable experience as PBL <b>facilitators,</b> they also have expertise as allied health professionals or biomedical scientists. Several <b>facilitators</b> have educational qualifications. Recognising that their roles have expanded beyond the PBL tutorial room, we canvassed PBL <b>facilitators</b> {{in terms of their}} contributions to Bond University’s medical programme. We can report that our <b>facilitators</b> have contributed to the renewal of Bond’s medical programme, from design (e. g. curriculum structure, case-writing) to PBL case reviews. They are also involved in formative and summative assessment. <b>Facilitators</b> identified that, because of their prolonged involvement with the students in small groups, they consider themselves more than <b>facilitators</b> of student learning. They are role models and personal guides. Recognising the value these casually employed <b>facilitators</b> have added to our medical programme, we will continue to develop their skills in, for example, reviewing cases and assessment. We recommend that if institutions do employ casual <b>facilitators,</b> their expertise and experience can add value to the curriculum and to students’ experience...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that questioning is a key strategy that <b>facilitators</b> use to promote discussion in Problem-Based Learning (PBL).

In this study we examined different types of questions that experienced <b>facilitators</b> asked to promote discussion of teaching problems in professional development for science teachers. We videotaped six PBL sessions facilitated by three pairs of experienced <b>facilitators.</b> Data analysis showed that <b>facilitators</b> asked a set of questions to initiate and advance PBL discourse, including questions to solicit ideas, to reframe ideas, to clarify ideas, to push for elaboration, to check for interpretation, and to connect to teachers’ classroom practice.

5|$|Years later, due to Betances' {{experience}} as a logistics <b>facilitator</b> of armed revolts, a fund raiser for the Cuban independence cause, and as a diplomat, José Martí asked Betances to become the leader of Cuban revolutionaries in France. Betances never met Martí personally, but Martí did know Betances' younger sister, Eduviges, who lived in New York City and shared her brother's revolutionary ideals. Martí assisted her financially in her final days, out of admiration for the Betances' family. Betances accepted the assignment out of gratitude towards Martí. Soon after, Martí died in battle in Cuba in 1895, an event that brought Tomás Estrada Palma to {{the leadership of the}} Cuban insurrection movement.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} cluster <b>facilitators</b> and their efforts in facilitating the {{development}} of clusters.

Thus, the aim {{of this paper is to}} explore how the roles and purposes of cluster <b>facilitators</b> change when facilitating various cluster types, and the impact of those changes on the cluster facilitation performed. The findings show that cluster <b>facilitators</b> in Marshallian/Italian industrial district type of clusters play the role of match makers and organisers; in the Hub-and-spoke district type of clusters, the cluster <b>facilitators</b> perform the roles of developer and organiser; cluster <b>facilitators</b> in the Satellite industrial platform type of clusters are promoters and organisers; and in the State-anchored industrial district type of clusters, the cluster <b>facilitators</b> fulfil the roles of integrator and organiser. This conclusion is based on a multiple case study as well as on a selection of literature on clusters and cluster facilitation...|$|R

After twice visiting Cambodia, while filming Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) and on a UNHCR field mission, Jolie {{returned}} in November 2001 with her husband, Billy Bob Thornton, where they met Maddox and subsequently applied to adopt him. The adoption process was halted the following month when the U.S. government banned adoptions from Cambodia amid allegations of child trafficking. Although Jolie's adoption <b>facilitator</b> was later convicted of visa fraud and money laundering, her adoption of Maddox was deemed lawful. Once the process was finalized, she took custody of him in Namibia, where she was filming Beyond Borders (2003). Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption together, but she adopted Maddox alone, and raised him as a single parent following their separation three months later.|$|E
5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a <b>facilitator</b> in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was punched in the face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E
5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a <b>facilitator</b> of growth for the economy as a whole. One study predicts that the government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} in developing a high quality educational system requires constant research of the variables involved in the teaching-learning process. Among these variables, social and academic <b>facilitators</b> are important because there is empirical evidence about their positive relationship with engagement, commitment, self-efficacy, happiness and satisfaction in the academic context. Moreover, the psychological well-being of university students (i. e., engagement) showed to positively affect future academic success. In line, {{the aim of this}} study is twofold. First, the relevance of social and university academic <b>facilitators</b> was analyzed depending on the faculty of belonging. Second, the effect of social (e. g., Good relationship with classmates) and academic <b>facilitators</b> (e. g., Updated website with new information and easily accessible) as well as academic engagement on academic performance (i. e., GPA) was tested. The sample consisted of 965 University students. The ANOVAs’ results showed the existence of statistically significant differences in social and university academic <b>facilitators</b> among the different faculties.   Regression analyses demonstrated that social (but not university’s) <b>facilitators</b> and academic engagement were positively related to academic performance. Additionally, the interaction between social <b>facilitators</b> and academic engagement was positively related to academic performance.   The effect was also significant when controlling for gender and faculty. The identification of different <b>facilitators</b> allows to develop different activities depending on the faculty, as well as leading to the optimization of teaching-learning process. Moreover, academic <b>facilitators</b> do not affect academic performance. From a practical view, it means that specific interventions can be implemented during the course so that students’ social <b>facilitators</b> and engagement increase...|$|R

25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a <b>facilitator</b> helps the learner to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario the learner plays a passive role and in the latter scenario the learner plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards the learner (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a <b>facilitator</b> needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a <b>facilitator</b> asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a <b>facilitator</b> supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a <b>facilitator</b> provides guidelines and creates the environment for the learner to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a <b>facilitator</b> is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A <b>facilitator</b> should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E
25|$|Endowments are {{transferred}} with special tools called forcibles. A forcible is cast {{of a rare}} material called blood metal into the rune corresponding to the endowment to be transferred. Files and other tools refine the rune. The finished forcible resembles more than anything a small branding iron. The method of creating forcibles, and the supervision of their creation, {{is part of the}} duties of a special class of magician called a <b>facilitator.</b> When the forcible is ready, the <b>facilitator</b> invokes its power, which causes the instrument to glow. The <b>facilitator</b> touches the forcible to the dedicate, who experiences a brief burst of excruciating pain. The instrument glows more brightly, and leaves trails of light when moved through the air. An expert <b>facilitator</b> can tell whether the endowment worked properly by examining the forcible and the light trails. If satisfied, he touches the instrument to the recipient, who receives the attribute and is marked with the rune. The dedicate experiences the corresponding loss of that attribute. The forcible is expended by this process and may not be reused.|$|E

However, SISP {{is not a very}} straight forward task as it entails simultaneous multiple planning views as well as changing environmental and organisational issues. Although SISP has been widely studied, to date theory on SISP <b>facilitators</b> remain sparse. Therefore the aim {{of this study is to}} explore SISP <b>facilitators</b> for sustainable organisational performance and a competitive advantage. This study explores the relationship between SISP <b>facilitators,</b> SISP success and the outcome of SISP in organisations. This study proposes a model indicating the relationship between <b>facilitators</b> of SISP success and organizational outcomes. By surveying a random sample of SISP experts in large South Korean organisations, and via SEM analysis, the relationship between SISP <b>facilitators</b> and outcomes has been determined.

A <b>facilitator</b> meets separately with the supervisor and with the subordinate to prepare three lists. What employees do well, where the employee has improved in recently, and areas where the employee still needs to improve. Because the subordinate will present his or her lists first during the joint session, this reduces defensive behaviors. Furthermore, the subordinate comes to the joint session not only prepared to share areas of needed improvement, but also brings concrete ideas as to how these improvements can be made. The NPA also focuses very strongly on what employees are doing well, and involves a minimum of twenty minutes of praise when discussing what the employee does well.
