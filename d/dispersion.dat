The rheological behavior of the <b>dispersions</b> was determined by steady shear and dynamic shear rheology. Dynamic shear rheological techniques are scarcely used for the characterization of ceramic powder <b>dispersions</b> contrary to polymers. The flow behaviors of the submicron and nano <b>dispersions</b> {{were found to be}} dependent on the solids content and fructose concentration. The submicron alumina, nano alumina, and nano titania <b>dispersions</b> in fructose solution showed shear thinning behavior and were fitted to the Herschel-Bulkley model. The dynamic shear rheology measurements showed that the solid part of the <b>dispersions</b> was dominant over the liquid part for both submicron and nano powder <b>dispersions.</b> The elastic modulus was higher than the viscous modulus in stress and frequency sweep measurements. The elastic moduli of the <b>dispersions</b> with solids content lower than 40 vol% were dependent on the angular frequency which indicated a gel-like behavior. However, the elastic moduli of the <b>dispersions</b> with 40 vol% solids were independent of angular frequency which indicated a solid like behavior.

The properties of solid <b>dispersions</b> were studied by diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), hotstage microscopy (HSM), radiograph powder diffraction (XRPD), and dissolution studies. The absence of etoricoxib peaks in XRPD profiles of solid <b>dispersions</b> suggests the transformation of crystalline etoricoxib into an amorphous form. In the HSM examination of solid <b>dispersions,</b> the dissolution of drug in the lipid carriers was observed, which was also confirmed by the absence of etoricoxib peak in DSC curves of solid <b>dispersions.</b> The DRIFTS spectra revealed the presence of hydrogen bonding in solid <b>dispersions.</b> The in vitro dissolution rate of solid <b>dispersions</b> as compared with pure etoricoxib, spray-dried etoricoxib, and physical mixtures of drug with lipid carriers.

25|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{construct}} compressors and stretchers. However, a typical Ti:sapphire-based chirped-pulse amplifier requires that the pulses are stretched to several hundred picoseconds, which means that the different wavelength components must experience about 10cm difference in path length. The most practical way to achieve this is with grating-based stretchers and compressors. Stretchers and compressors are characterized by their <b>dispersion.</b> With negative <b>dispersion,</b> light with higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) takes less time to travel through the device than light with lower frequencies (longer wavelengths). With positive <b>dispersion,</b> it is the other way around. In a CPA, the dispersions of the stretcher and compressor should cancel out. Because of practical considerations, the stretcher is usually designed with positive <b>dispersion</b> and the compressor with negative <b>dispersion.</b>|$|E

This would allow understanding the phase behavior of these solid <b>dispersions</b> upon {{application of a}} different kind of stress (other than humidity and temperature) and ultimately lead to mechanistic perception of the phase changes taking place. Methods Miconazole and PVP VA 64 were chosen as a model drug and polymer, respectively and solid <b>dispersions</b> were prepared by spray drying. Dried solid <b>dispersions</b> were compressed using different compression pressure but constant dwell time. MDSC and XRPD were used to characterize and study the effect of compression on the system. Results The solid <b>dispersions</b> showed a single Tg till 20 % drug loading after which two Tg’s were observed. Application of compression to the phase separated 30 and 40 % compositions induced mixing resulting in only a single Tg. This reduction in number of Tg’s upon compression is a result of mixing which can be attributed to polymer flow resulting in reduction of the domain size of different phases in the solid <b>dispersions.</b> Conclusions Application of compression can influence the phase behavior of Miconazole-PVP VA 64 solid <b>dispersions.</b> This observation may have drastic impact on the formulation development approach for solid <b>dispersions</b> to be administered as tablets.
