40|$|AIM [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} the <b>immediate</b> <b>response</b> to surfactant treatment and morbidity and mortality in infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome. METHODS [...] The response to surfactant {{was defined as the}} difference in the arterial:alveolar (delta a:A) ratio before and one hour after the first surfactant dose. Measurements were obtained from 253 Israeli infants participating in the multi-centre Curosurf 4 trial of surfactant replacement therapy. RESULTS [...] Delta a:A ratios ranged from - 0. 115 to 0. 8 and were significantly related to both birth weight and gestational age. Among infants weighing 1001 - 1500 g mortality decreased from 40 % among very bad responders to zero among good responders. The incidence of pneumothorax decreased with better response. Logistic regression analysis showed a hierarchy of predictive power for mortality: birth weight or gestational age; <b>immediate</b> <b>response</b> to surfactant; severity of initial disease. CONCLUSION [...] The <b>immediate</b> <b>response</b> to surfactant treatment is a significant prognostic indicator for mortality and morbidity...|$|R
