25|$|The current {{recommendations}} for residential exposure (not including amalgam fillings already accounted <b>for)</b> <b>are</b> as follows: The ATSDR Action Level for indoor mercury vapor in residential settings is 1µg/m3 and the ATSDR MRL (Minimal Risk Level) for chronic exposure is 0.2µg/m3 According to the ATSDR, the MRL(Minimal Risk Level) is {{an estimate of}} the level of daily exposure to a substance that is unlikely to cause adverse non-cancerous health effects. The Action Level is defined as an indoor air concentration of mercury that would prompt officials to consider implementing response actions. It is a recommendation and does not necessarily imply toxicity or health risks. Breathing air with a concentration of 0.2µg mercury/m3 would lead to an inhaled amount of approximately 4µg/day (respiratory volume of 20m3/day). About 80% of inhaled mercury vapor would be absorbed.|$|E
