6000|$|Carley gazed around her. Only one of {{the cabins}} was in sight from this position. Evidently it was a home {{for some of these}} men. On one side the peaked rough roof had been built out beyond the wall, evidently to serve as a kind of porch. On that wall hung the motliest {{assortment}} of things Carley had ever seen--utensils, sheep and cow hides, saddles, <b>harness,</b> <b>leather</b> clothes, ropes, old sombreros, shovels, stove pipe, and many other articles for which she could find no name. The most striking characteristic manifest in this collection was that of service. How they had been used! They had enabled people to live under primitive conditions. Somehow this fact inhibited Carley's sense of repulsion at their rude and uncouth appearance. Had any of her forefathers ever been pioneers? Carley did not know, but the thought was disturbing. It was thought-provoking. Many times at home, when she was dressing for dinner, she had gazed into the mirror at the graceful lines of her throat and arms, at the proud poise of her head, at the alabaster whiteness of her skin, and wonderingly she had asked of her image: [...] "Can it be possible that I am a descendant of cavemen?" [...] She {{had never been able to}} realize it, yet she knew it was true. Perhaps somewhere not far back along her line there had been a great-great-grandmother who had lived some kind of a primitive life, using such implements and necessaries as hung on this cabin wall, and thereby helped some man to conquer the wilderness, to live in it, and reproduce his kind. Like flashes Glenn's words came back to Carley--"Work and children!" ...|$|E
60|$|A hot {{afternoon}} on the plains. A dusty cavalcade of United States cavalry and commissary wagons, which from a distance preserved a certain military precision of movement, but on nearer view resolved itself into straggling troopers in twos and fours interspersed between the wagons, two noncommissioned officers and a guide riding ahead, who had already fallen into the cavalry slouch, but off to the right, smartly erect and cadet-like, the young lieutenant in command. A wide road that had the appearance of being at once well traveled and yet deserted, and that, although well defined under foot, still seemed to disappear and lose itself a hundred feet ahead in the monotonous level. A horizon that in that clear, dry, hazeless atmosphere never mocked you, yet never changed, but kept its eternal rim of mountains {{at the same height}} and distance from hour to hour and day to day. Dust--a parching alkaline powder that cracked the skin--everywhere, clinging to the hubs and spokes of the wheels, without being disturbed by movement, incrusting the cavalryman from his high boots to the crossed sabres of his cap; going off in small puffs like explosions under the plunging hoofs of the horses, but too heavy to rise and follow them. A reeking smell of horse sweat and boot leather that lingered in the road long after the train had passed. An external silence broken only by the cough of a jaded horse in the suffocating dust, or the cracking of <b>harness</b> <b>leather.</b> Within one of the wagons that seemed a miracle of military neatness and methodical stowage, a lazy conversation carried on by a grizzled driver and sunbrowned farrier.|$|E
50|$|Show {{harnesses}} {{for light}} cart driving have a breastcollar {{instead of a}} horse collar and are made with strong but refined-looking leather throughout, usually black and highly polished. In draft horse showing and combined driving, horse collars are seen, but <b>harness</b> <b>leather</b> is still highly polished and well-finished.|$|E
50|$|Numerous smaller {{factories}} in Richmond produced tents, uniforms, <b>harnesses</b> and <b>leather</b> goods, swords and bayonets, and other war material. As the war progressed, the city's warehouses became the supply and logistical center {{for much of}} the Confederate forces within the Eastern Theater.|$|R

25|$|Richmond was {{the only}} {{large-scale}} industrial city controlled by the Confederacy {{during most of the}} Civil War. The city's warehouses were the supply and logistical center for Confederate forces. The city's Tredegar Iron Works, the 3rd largest foundry in the United States {{at the start of the}} war, produced most of the Confederate artillery, including a number of giant rail-mounted siege cannons. The company also manufactured railroad locomotives, boxcars and rails, as well as steam propulsion plants and iron plating for warships. Richmond's factories also produced guns, bullets, tents, uniforms, <b>harnesses,</b> <b>leather</b> goods, swords, bayonets, and other war materiel. A number of textile plants, flour mills, brick factories, newspapers and book publishers were located in Richmond. Richmond had shipyards too, although they were smaller than the shipyards controlled by the Union in Norfolk, Virginia.|$|R
50|$|Although {{gold was}} widely {{used by the}} ruling elite of the various Scythian tribes, the {{predominant}} material for the various animal forms was bronze. The bulk of these items were used to decorate horse <b>harness,</b> <b>leather</b> belts & personal clothing. In some cases these bronze animal figures when sewn onto stiff leather jerkins & belts, helped to act as armour.|$|E
50|$|The {{store was}} {{originally}} located in Showmakers Row, but eventually moved to Market Street, with the store selling haberdashery, linens and drapery, some hardware and an Oil shop supplying oils for lighting, heating and treating <b>harness</b> <b>leather.</b> In 1879, {{the store was}} damaged by a severe storm, with over three inches of rain falling within 6 hours and the cost run into several thousand pounds.|$|E

50|$|Bullocks {{were less}} excitable and more {{dependable}} {{when faced with}} difficulties than horses. Furthermore, bullocks were cheaper to purchase, equip and feed. Horses also required complex, expensive <b>leather</b> <b>harness</b> that frequently needed repair. Bullock gear was simple and the yokes were sometimes made by the bullocky from different kinds of timber.|$|R

60|$|Among the {{ornaments}} of Tars Tarkas' <b>leather</b> <b>harness,</b> {{which is}} the only manner of clothing worn by Martians other than silk capes and robes of silk and fur for protection from the cold after dark, was a small mirror, about the bigness of a lady's hand glass, which hung midway between his shoulders and his waist against his broad back.|$|R

2500|$|Some entertainers {{have used}} stereotypical {{references}} to homosexuality {{to increase their}} profile. Masaki Sumitani a.k.a. Hard Gay (HG), a comedian, shot to fame after he {{began to appear in}} public wearing a <b>leather</b> <b>harness,</b> hot pants and cap. [...] His outfit, name, and trademark pelvis thrusting and squeals earned him the adoration of fans and the scorn of many in the Japanese gay community.|$|R
50|$|The collection, {{assembled}} by Marc Chappuis and his wife, and {{housed in a}} barn, consists of housewares, farm tools, devotional items, and other objects used in farm life, local crafts, and religious worship {{over a period of}} three hundred years. There are cast iron skillets, ceramic pots, wooden toys, and <b>leather</b> <b>harnesses,</b> many of them purchases from local second hand shops or gifts of nearby farmers.|$|R
50|$|To {{reach the}} canopies, he uses an arrow {{to set a}} {{climbing}} line, then ascends using a modified arborist-style safety swing involving ropes, <b>leather</b> <b>harnesses,</b> and pulleys. Once in the canopy, Sillett and his research crew move about in a style known as skywalking using motion lanyards on a web of climbing ropes. To reach outlying branches, Sillett deploys a Tyrolean traverse between adjacent trees.|$|R
5000|$|Barclay was {{credited}} with inventing the first-ever football helmet in 1894, with the intention that it would prevent cauliflower ears. [...] The helmet was constructed by a saddle-maker from nearby Easton with strips of <b>leather</b> <b>harness</b> padding. It attracted national attention in a Lafayette game against Penn on Oct. 24, 1896. The NCAA and the National Football League made helmets mandatory in 1939 and in 1941, respectively.|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} some new brands that are being created just based on the Fetish {{clothing}} luxury market. For example Zana Bayne a NYC-based Post-Fetish Leather Brand. Founded by Zana Bayne in 2010, their work is mostly recognized for its focus on quality craftsmanship and for their unique take on S&M/punk-inspired <b>harnesses.</b> Their <b>leather</b> works have been worn by celebrities such as Beyonce and Lady Gaga. They have also collaborated with brands such as Marc Jacobs and Comme des Garcons, were Todd Pendu start working for the brand. In 2012 he became a full-time creative partner for the company. Another example of a brand purely influenced by Fetish Fashion is Atsuko Kudo, they design and manufacture ladies wear entirely in latex rubber.|$|R
50|$|Agriculture was the {{principal}} business, and on October 5, 1869 the North Knox Agricultural & Horticultural Society opened the first annual Union Fair. The town had mills operated by water power at the outlets of ponds. Factories at Union produced carriages, cultivators, <b>leather,</b> <b>harness,</b> boots and shoes. South Union had a cabinet and musical instrument factory, an iron foundry, a machine shop and a coffin factory. East Union had a lumbermill, {{in addition to a}} chair and table factory.|$|R
5000|$|Barge Haulers on the Volga shows a row {{of eleven}} male burlaks {{dragging}} a barge on the Volga River that must be pulled upstream against the current. The men are dressed in rags and bound with <b>leather</b> <b>harnesses.</b> They are rendered as mostly stoical, although in obvious physical discomfort, with their bodies bowed in toil. The scene is rendered in a white, silvery light which {{has been described as}} [...] "almost Venetian". In earlier studies, it was dominated by blue tones.|$|R
25|$|By 1900 the Dallas {{population}} reached 38,000 as {{banking and}} insurance became major {{activities in the}} increasingly white-collar city, which was now the world's leading cotton center. It was also the world's center of <b>harness</b> making and <b>leather</b> goods. Businessmen took control of civic affairs; with little municipal patronage, {{there was only a}} small role for the Democratic Party to play. The predominantly black Republican Party was essentially closed out of politics by the disenfranchisement in 1901 of most blacks through imposition of a poll tax (see below).|$|R
50|$|In 2011, the Smithsonian’s National Postal Museum {{restored}} its beloved “Owney”, the canine mascot of the Railway Mail Service. Owney was taxidermied in 1987 and {{had undergone}} previous restoration attempts. Using new methods and treatments, conservators removed dust, built-up wax, paint, and traces of arsenic. They also reshaped {{his face to}} be more accurate based on photographic evidence, as well as replaced his vest with a more accurate <b>leather</b> <b>harness.</b> As {{a result of the}} restoration, Owney’s fur is fuller, his tail is fluffier, and he has a more historically accurate appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface of}} the town is uneven, but has deep, dark soil that yielded good crops of grain, corn and apples. The east and west {{branches}} of the Nezinscot River join at Buckfield Village, supplying water power for mills. Products included lumber, roof shingles, barrel staves, box boards, shovel handles, snow-shovels, handsleds, drag-rakes, brushes, brush blocks, powder-kegs, <b>leather</b> <b>harness,</b> cutting-blocks and men's boots. In 1870, {{the population of the}} town was 1,494. The Rumford Falls and Buckfield Railroad passed through the town. Its depot was at Buckfield Village, the business center for the area.|$|R
5000|$|Mayne Connell {{taught her}} {{daughter}} to ride a horse {{at the age of}} two. To keep up with the child, she designed a <b>leather</b> <b>harness</b> and tied it to a tree near the house to anchor Georgie so that she would be in view. By the time she was five, Georgie had her own horse, [...] "Buster," [...] whom she could mount by feeding the animal a biscuit. As Buster lowered his head to eat the biscuit, Georgie would climb on his head and neck and ease down to his back.|$|R
5000|$|Lillian Gish {{described}} Walthall as [...] "a slight man, {{about five}} feet six, fine-boned, {{with the face of}} a poet and a dreamer." [...] She recalled his patience while Griffith grappled with technical problems filming the epilogue of Home, Sweet Home (1914), a scene in which Gish, as an angel, lifts Walthall's character out of hell. [...] "There was a long discussion while Walthall and I, encased in <b>leather</b> <b>harness,</b> hung on the guide wires. Wally, a true southern gentleman, didn't raise his voice, didn't complain; he simply fainted and hung there limply." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Des Moines Saddlery Company Building is an {{historic}} building located in downtown Des Moines, Iowa, United States. It {{was built in}} 1881 by J. Rubelman of Muscatine, Iowa. [...] He choose to move his operation to Des Moines because of its location on two rivers and the 13 railroads that served the city. Rubelman’s company made saddles, <b>harnesses</b> and <b>leather</b> works for 20 years. In the years since it has housed a shoe maker, rubber company, stove manufacturer, glove company, the Krispy Kone Company and the Kaplan Hat Company. [...] The later was also {{the name of the}} restaurant that was located on the first floor. The building was flooded with 19 ft of water during the Des Moines River flood of 1993. The building remained empty until the Court Avenue Restaurant & Brewing Company moved in its equipment. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985.|$|R
5000|$|Glíma, the {{national}} sport of Iceland, originating from Norway, and traces its {{history to the}} Vikings and the Norse. It is a standing style with rules similar to Shuai-Jiao and Bukh, and consists of three forms: 1) Hryggtök, the Backhold Grip; 2) Brokartök or the Pant-and-belt Grip that utilises a <b>leather</b> <b>harness</b> around the waist and thighs, which the wrestlers hold (making it a form of belt-wrestling similar to Swiss Schwingen), and 3) Lausatök or Free-Grip is the most aggressive form of glima and contestants can use the holds they wish. It is practised both outdoors and indoors.|$|R
60|$|It was {{attached}} to a wickerwork vehicle which resembled a large clothes-basket on small wheels. We do not mean, of course, that the pony was affectionately attached to it. No; the attachment was involuntary and unavoidable, by reason of a brand-new yellow <b>leather</b> <b>harness</b> with brass buckles. It objected to the attachment, obviously, for it sidled this way, and straddled that way, and whisked its enormous little tail, and tossed its rotund little head, and stamped its ridiculously small feet; and champed its miniature bit, {{as if it had}} been a war-horse of the largest size, fit to carry a Wallace, a Bruce, or a Richard of the Lion-heart, into the midst of raging battle.|$|R
50|$|Castro's work {{move beyond}} mere artistic characteristics, however, and captures the sexual fetishism of BDSM as well. The {{transgressive}} nature of leather fetishism—harkening back to 'bad-boy' filmic images made popular by James Dean and Marlon Brando—intersects with the transgressive nature of homosexual sex and promiscuity {{in the era}} of AIDS. Castro's images have power because they are those of the true fetishist. These are not images produced by 'just any' photographer who can hire a handsome model and buy a <b>leather</b> <b>harness</b> off the rack at a local sex shop. Castro's images reflect the imagination and variety of BDSM and leather fetishists; they create and lead, rather than follow, popular culture and sexual fashion.|$|R
