The key idea of this method is to reconstruct motion fields for regions of missing data by exploring both temporal and spatial information.

To handle general scenes, we employ dense optical flow as our motion model. To compute flow without correspondence (due to missing pixels), we propose an effective multi-resolution, multi-frame flow method. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method using real images. ...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{studies have}} found that the opening of trade results in the price-decreasing {{competition}} among horizontally differentiated goods and the quality upgrade <b>of</b> vertically differentiated <b>goods,</b> which results in the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> low-quality <b>goods</b> by high-quality goods. This paper spotlights what existing studies have overlooked and challenges these conventional results. First, this paper challenges the price decreasing competition by focusing on the heterogeneity of consumers. If each consumer has his own ideal good and the price elasticity of demand decreases with the distance from his ideal <b>good,</b> the opening <b>of</b> trade followed by {{the increase in the number}} <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> gives firms a chance to sell its product intensively to closer and less price elastic consumers. Facing lower price elastic consumers, firms will raise their prices after trade, and the price increasing competition is a result. In these days, we sometimes observe that high-quality goods from developed countries are replaced by low-quality goods from developing countries, which contradicts with predictions of conventional studies <b>of</b> vertically differentiated <b>goods.</b> One reason why conventional studies cannot show the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> high-quality <b>goods</b> is because most studies use a Unit-Demand (UD) model. The model implicitly assumes that consumers care the quality <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> but not the quantity of it. Without the volume effect, it less likely that inexpensive low-quality goods, which attract consumers with quantity rater than quality beat high-quality goods. This paper uses a new Non UD model, which relaxes the assumption of the UD and shows that producers <b>of</b> low-quality <b>goods</b> steal consumers from producers <b>of</b> high-quality <b>goods</b> if the income gap between two countries is large enough. Besides the UD assumption, another reason why existing studies predict the quality upgrade after trade is because they assume that consumers value quality so much that the utility value of the added quality always exceeds the cost of it. This paper relaxes the assumption and considers a case where the utility increases with quality at a decreasing rate. With severe concave utility function, numerical examples show that expensive high-quality goods from a developed country are replaced by inexpensive low-quality goods from a developing country...|$|R

Unfortunately there is not yet sufficiently long data from the recent Great Recession that enable researchers to study fully its long-term consequences for the labor market structure. To this end, we examine Japan's Lost Decade, the original Great Recession that occurred two decades ago. First, insofar as male workers are concerned, we find evidence against the popular narrative that during Japan's Lost Decade there was a significant shift of the composition of employment toward bad jobs. Second, we find that the composition of female workers shifted significantly toward bad jobs and that such a shift occurred primarily through an increased use of a hybrid employment contract of nonstandard employment with indefinite contracts. Third, young women in Japan made considerable progress in shifting the composition of their employment toward good jobs during Japan's growth decade preceding the Lost Decade. We find that such progress was entirely undone during the Great Recession. Obviously the Great Recession affects the quantity of jobs and policy makers ought to pay immediate attention to such quantity effects. However, the Great Recession may also have more long-term structural effects on the quality of jobs...|$|R

The dominant economic system behaves as a linear system and based on the rapid use, disposal, and <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> (Benyus, 1997). The global capitalist economic system has poorly prepared to deal with unexpected events such as climate change and its impacts. To deal with global impending and complex issues, we propose a renewed model of an economic system that closely integrates Biomimicry principles. Biomimicry is the study of how nature’s systems and processes function to solve the problems of survival. Nature’s dynamics are then applied human innovation (Benyus, 1997). The environmental technologies and societal innovations we need are often already present the core of nature’s design since nature has, through evolution, already found the most energy-efficient solution for many problems. Biomimicry therefore promises to be a cogent design tool for the near future (Passino, 2004). Our GIGAmap, Reimagining the Future: The Biomimetic Economy, isan exploration of the nature of economic systems in relation to ecological systems – resilience, optimization, adaptability, systems based, value based and life supporting – through the design principals of biomimicry.

5000|$|To {{overcome}} the durability problem, durable good manufacturers must persuade consumers to replace functioning products with new ones or {{to pay them}} money in other ways. <b>Replacement</b> <b>of</b> functioning <b>goods</b> refers to business strategies that persuade or force consumers to purchase new products. One category of strategies is contrived durability that refers to product design that intentionally shortens the product lifetime before it is released onto the market. In most instances, durability is built into a product by the manufacturer through its choices of inputs and production procedures. Another category of strategies refers is planned obsolescence that refers to shortening the lifetime of a product after it is released onto the market. Under this strategy, the manufacturer “convinces” the consumer to replace an old product with a new one, thereby rendering the lifetime of the old product shorter than its actual useful lifetime. Annual style changes of cars and revised editions of textbooks are prime examples of planned obsolescence. Although contrived durability and planned obsolescence are different in many ways, they are often confused, which is not surprising considering the article on planned obsolescence defines planned obsolescence as a [...] "policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life", which would be prior {{to the release of}} said product barring the existence of a time warp machine.|$|R

[...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Counseling, Educational Leadership, Education and School PsychologyPhysical {{destruction}} of a school and loss of material resources in a natural disaster are potentially traumatic experiences for students and school personnel (Ainsworth & Parkes, 1991). As {{a result of such}} destruction, emotional bonds to objects, people, places, and routines are frequently interrupted. When disaster occurs and students cannot immediately return to the pre-disaster learning environment, their academic progress may be compromised. Disaster relief efforts may be largely focused on physiological needs and the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> material <b>goods,</b> food, and clothing. There may be minimal focus on the psychological needs of those affected. Students who demonstrate symptoms of mal-coping may be at risk of academic underachievement and not graduating from high school (Cook-Cottone, 2004). This study uses narrative inquiry to investigate the education recovery of teachers, administrators, and students in a rural Midwestern town seven years after an EF 5 tornado destroyed the schools and much of the community. The stories of their educational recoveries are examined through the theoretical lens of place attachment theory. Findings indicated a strong need for students to be reconnected with peers as soon as possible and for school staff members to reestablish daily routines. Recreating the physical environments in which social interactions occurred was instrumental to healing the psychosocial trauma of loss and displacement experienced by students and staff.

40|$|Has MERCOSUR's trade {{performance}} to date provided {{strong evidence that}} it has encouraged inefficient trade flows between its members? This paper evaluates the methodology suggested by Yeats (1997, 1998) to study trade flows within MERCOSUR. Yeats was motivated by the traditional concern of economists that regional trading arrangements can be welfare-reducing by fostering trade diversion (the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> efficiently produced <b>goods</b> from outside the arrangement by inefficiently produced goods from inside). His methodology was based on comparing shifts in intra-regional exports {{with a measure of}} relative efficiency in production. This paper argues that Yeats should have instead focused on imports. There has been a strong growth in intra-regional imports, but imports from third countries have also grown impressively. This reflects the increased multilateral openness of the MERCOSUR economies. If Yeats' methodology is adapted to examine trends in imports, the evidence for significant trade diversion is less clear-cut than he suggested. It is difficult to have a clear idea about whether MERCOSUR producers are efficient suppliers <b>of</b> different <b>goods.</b> However, even for the cases where one may have some doubts, the growth in intra-MERCOSUR imports has been accompanied by growing trade {{with the rest of the}} world.
