50|$|Chronologically {{the next}} machine {{dating from the}} late 1960s and early 1970s was the Alpha 8, an eight bit machine, and Alpha 16 which merely doubled up this concept to make a 16-bit machine. Both were built using DTL and TTL devices. The {{processor}} for the Alpha 8 and Alpha 16 each comprised three full sized circuit boards about 18 inches square, {{then there were the}} memory options, 4k, 8k and rarely 16k magnetic core full cards. There were number of options for data <b>input,</b> <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> via a board called the utility controller which could also be used to drive other devices such as printers, etc. There was a magnetic tape controller which was a full card and a Winchester interface disk controller which was two full cards with a circuit board jumper which interlinked the two cards. The programmers console had a row of toggle switches for data entry of bootstrap routines, etc. Two chassis were available, standard and jumbo with separate power supplies. There was a variety of other cards are available for various forms of input output and process control, relay cards, dual teletype cards, etc.|$|E

25|$|Computers {{manufactured}} {{until the}} 1970s had front-panel switches for programming. The computer program {{was written on}} paper for reference. An instruction was represented by a configuration of on/off settings. After setting the configuration, an execute button was pressed. This process was then repeated. Computer programs also were manually <b>input</b> via <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or punched cards. After the medium was loaded, the starting address was set via switches and the execute button pressed.|$|R
50|$|The only <b>input</b> was a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{reader and}} the only outputs were the console printer and <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch. As the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch was much faster than the printer, most output was punched, and then listed on an {{off-line}} printer.

50|$|TELCOMP {{programs}} were normally <b>input</b> via a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader on a Teletype Model 33, {{which would be}} connected to a PDP via a modem and acoustic telephone line. Data could be read from the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader or from the Teletype keyboard. Output was either printed to the Teletype or sent to the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch. Early versions had no facility for on-line storage of programs or data.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Paper</b> <b>tapes</b> {{constructed}} from punched cards were widely {{used throughout the}} 19th century for controlling looms. Perforated <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> were first used by Basile Bouchon in 1725 to control looms. However, the <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> were expensive to create, fragile, and difficult to repair. By 1801 Joseph Marie Jacquard had developed machines to create <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> by tying punched cards in a sequence. The resulting <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> also called a [...] "chain of cards", was stronger and simpler both to create and to repair. (See Jacquard loom).|$|R
50|$|The BRPE tape punches {{operate at}} 110 {{characters}} per second, with two adjustable-level versions for reading either 5 or 8-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> or 6, 7 or 8-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> A fixed-level 6-level <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch was also available. All BRPE version <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punches were packaged for table-top use {{and have a}} parallel contact interface which is wired directly to the punch electromagnetic coils.|$|R
50|$|The {{system used}} both a 512-word mercury delay line and {{magnetic}} tape for memory, and for data input, {{the system was}} equipped to process Flexowriter <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (at a rate of 1 word/second), magnetic wire (40 words/second), Raytheon magnetic tape (250 words/second), and <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (150 characters/second). The system could output to Flexowriter <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (at a rate of 1 word/second), magnetic wire (20 words/second), or <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> (180 characters/second).|$|R

The 1054 (reader) and 1055 (punch), which were carried forward (like the 1052 console typewriter) from the IBM 1050 Teleprocessing System. All these devices operated at a maximum of 15.5 characters per second. The <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punch from the IBM 1080 System was also available by RPQ, but at a prohibitively expensive price.|$|R
5000|$|Punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{was used}} by the {{newspaper}} industry until the mid-1970s or later. Newspapers were typically set in hot lead by devices such as a linotype. With the wire services coming into a device that would punch <b>paper</b> <b>tape,</b> rather than the linotype operator having to retype all the incoming wire stories, the <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> could be put into a <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader on the linotype and it would create the lead slugs without the operator re-typing the stories. This also allowed newspapers to use devices, such as the Friden Flexowriter, to convert typing to lead type via tape. Even after the demise of the Linotype/hot lead, many early [...] "offset" [...] devices had <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers on them to produce the news-story copy.|$|R

50|$|In the 1970s, {{computer-aided}} manufacturing equipment often used <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> <b>Paper</b> <b>tape</b> {{was a very}} important storage medium for computer-controlled wire-wrap machines, for example. A <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> reader was smaller and much less expensive than hollerith card or magnetic tape readers. Premium black waxed and lubricated long-fiber papers, and Mylar film tape were invented so that production tapes for these machines would last longer.|$|R
50|$|The DX <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers {{operate at}} any speed up to 360 {{characters}} per second via external timing, except EIA. EIA tape readers operate at 120 {{characters per second}} if internal timing is used, and up to 314 characters per second if external timing is used. All of the DX <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers are adjustable-level, reading 5, 6, 7 or 8-level fully punched or chadless <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> The DX series of <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers were available in table-top and rack mount models, with an optional verifier data output for use by an external verifier logic to guarantee the accuracy of each character read.|$|R
50|$|Vernam ciphers {{were invented}} in 1917 to encrypt {{teleprinter}} communications using a key stored on <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> During {{the last third}} of the 20th century, the National Security Agency used punched <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> to distribute cryptographic keys. The eight-level <b>paper</b> <b>tapes</b> were distributed under strict accounting controls and read by a fill device, such as the hand held KOI-18, that was temporarily connected to each security device that needed new keys. NSA has been trying to replace this method with a more secure electronic key management system (EKMS), but as of 2016, <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> is apparently still being employed.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, Western Union {{introduced}} Plan 55-A, {{the first}} automatic electromechanical {{store and forward}} message switching system. All message storage was performed by <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> punches paired with <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> readers, with a bin in between.|$|R

5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used fanfold <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> rather than rolled <b>paper</b> <b>tape.</b> In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy supply reel, takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in <b>paper</b> <b>tape</b> format.|$|R
