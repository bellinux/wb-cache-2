50|$|A {{previous}} system was utilised in the United Kingdom, called the Advance Corporation Tax (ACT). When a company paid a dividend, it {{was required to}} pay an amount of ACT, which it then used to offset its own taxes. The ACT was included in income by the shareholder resident in the United Kingdom or certain treaty countries, and treated as a payment of tax by the shareholder. To the extent that <b>deemed</b> tax <b>payment</b> exceeded taxes otherwise due, it was refundable to the shareholder.|$|R

They were also ordered to pay a settlement of $1.5 million. [...] On June 26, 2007 the FTC issued final approval of the settlement: [...] "No portion of the <b>payment</b> shall be <b>deemed</b> a <b>payment</b> of any fine, penalty, or punitive assessment".

50|$|In the mid-1920s, various record {{companies}} sent representatives to southern Appalachia to hold auditions {{in hopes of}} finding new talents. Around late 1926 or early 1927, Boggs tried out at one such audition, held by Brunswick Records at the Norton Hotel. Although he played on a banjo borrowed from a local music store and needed whiskey to calm his nerves, he played well enough to gain a contract to record several sides in New York later that year. He recorded only eight sides for Brunswick, however, as he <b>deemed</b> their <b>payment</b> sufficient for only that number.|$|R
5000|$|... "What We Believe" [...] expands on {{the first}} section, making demands {{of what will be}} <b>deemed</b> {{sufficient}} <b>payment</b> for the injustices committed against the Black Community. For example, one section states that, [...] "We believe that this racist government has robbed us and now we are demanding the overdue debt of forty acres and two mules. Forty acres and two mules was promised 100 years ago as a restitution for slave labor and mass murder of black people". It continues to state that [...] "We will accept this payment in currency which will be distributed to our many communities." [...] Newton and Seale believed that the Black community had been deprived of these benefits over the years, and {{that the only way to}} correct this injustice was in repayment of assets that had been lost to them over many years of slavery.|$|R
50|$|Knnn, {{the third}} methane {{breathing}} species, multi-legged tangles of wiry black hair, {{are the most}} technologically advanced in the Compact. Unlike other known species, they can maneuver in hyperspace and carry other ships with them. Only tc'a can communicate with them (or claim they can); the knnn are incomprehensible and therefore deemed dangerous by the other species, not to be provoked. They trade by taking whatever they want and leaving whatever they <b>deem</b> sufficient as <b>payment</b> behind; it is an improvement over their prior habit of just taking trader ships apart.|$|R
30|$|Perceived {{risk was}} {{unremarkable}} {{to the path}} coefficient of use intention. This discovery {{was consistent with the}} research conclusion drawn by Zhou et al. (2009). However, the average value of consumers’ perceived risk was 5.06, indicating that consumers were still willing to make online payments and try online financial products even if the perceived risk existed. In tandem with the rapid development of online transaction and payment systems and the increased popularity of online payments, our respondents also indicated a higher frequency of use of online payments. In addition, most respondents were young people aged 20 – 30 years who are more prone to be impulsive and willing to try new financial management options of online financial products. Finally, the security risk of online financial products was mainly reflected in payment, account, and privacy security. Perceived risk is less important today for consumers already accustomed to the use of online and mobile payment methods and who have <b>deemed</b> online <b>payments</b> as an essential part of their lives.|$|R

25|$|On December 15, 1539, another Spanish captain {{coming from}} the south after conquering Peru and the Kingdom of Quito {{as part of the}} {{expedition}} by De Belalcázar, Baltasar Maldonado, entered the territories of Tundama and offered him a peace proposal if he would surrender. Tundama, informed by the Spanish murders of zipa Tisquesusa and zaque Quemuenchatocha, did not accept and Maldonado attacked Tundama and his army on the island in Vargas Swamp, where 280 years later the Vargas Swamp Battle by Simón Bolívar would be fought. Maldonado, enforced with 2000 yanakunas; indigenous prisoners of war from Peru and submitted people from Bacatá and Ramiriquí, was accompanied by the Muisca whose ears and hand had been cut off by Tundama. The Spanish conquistador with his superior weapons, cavalry and the inside knowledge of the earless Muisca killed 4000 guecha warriors of Tundama. Seeing this battle was fruitless, Tundama fled to Cerinza to ally with the cacique from there and prepared a new attack on the Spanish and indigenous troops, losing again. The caciques of northern Boyacá convinced Tundama to not fight anymore and Tundama surrendered to the Spanish troops. Maldonado demanded huge quantities of gold and emeralds to pay his loss to the Spanish. When handing over the valuables, Maldonado <b>deemed</b> the <b>payments</b> not enough and {{before the end of the}} year Maldonado killed Tundama with a large hammer.|$|R

50|$|After Shumaker's {{departure}} from the University of Tennessee, {{all three of the}} universities where he had been president undertook audits of his spending during his presidencies. The University of Tennessee found that Shumaker had incurred $165,000 in expenses for football-related entertainment and $73,000 in expenses for holiday receptions. He also ordered $493,000 in renovations and new furnishings for his official residence, which had been remodeled at a cost of $787,597 less than a year earlier. His unauthorized purchases for the home included $97,350 for a new sun room and closet, $77,270 to create two bedrooms for his sons, a new telecommunications system that cost $64,000, a $7,000 Persian rug, two $7,400 entertainment systems, and a $4,822 gas grill. Officials in Connecticut <b>deemed</b> the Hyundai <b>payments</b> to be a violation of the state's ethics laws, but could not prosecute because of the statute of limitations.|$|R
50|$|The second {{alliance}} is formed between Merry and Kurag, King of the Goblins. This occurs when Merry is bled by the roses {{that line the}} entrance to the throne room of the Unseelie Court. She passes out from blood loss and opens her eyes to see one of the goblins drinking from her open wound, (to goblins bodily fluids are sacred). She has the goblin detained and bargains with Kurag for a 6-month alliance in return for Merry taking a goblin (Kitto) into her bed. She <b>deems</b> this acceptable <b>payment</b> for the theft of her blood. Later Merry bargains for an extended alliance of 1 month for each sidhe-sided goblin that she brings into power. Also, Merry brings the Red Caps back to their full original power because she is the only Sidhe who possesses the full Hand of Blood. By doing so, the Red Caps owe her their own alliance outside of the one formed between Merry and Kurag.|$|R
40|$|Tax {{on income}} of {{previous}} year is usually paid {{in the assessment}} year. To avoid tax evasion, the Income Tax Act has made provisions to collect tax by way of Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) and Tax Collection at Source (TCS). Tax deducted at source {{is one of the}} modes of collecting Income-tax from the assessee in India. TDS is an indirect method of collecting tax from the tax payer or deductor by the income tax department. TDS is pre-paid payment of tax in previous year in which incomes received or accrued. The tax so deducted from the income of the payee is <b>deemed</b> to be <b>payment</b> of Income-tax by the recipient {{at the time of his}} assessment. Such amount of tax (TDS) will be deducted from Tax Liability at the time of assessment in the assessment year. E-governance is becoming increasingly more important in today due to its effectiveness and applicability in various fields. Since financial year 2003 - 04, all corporate deductors made file Income tax returns for deduction of tax at source (TDS) only in electronic form. Further, from the financial year 2004 - 05, in addition to corporate deductors, filing of TDS returns in electronic form is made mandatory for government deductors also. Annual e-TDS/TCS return is the TDS return under section 206 of the Income Tax Act (prepared in Form Nos. 24, 26 or 27) or TCS return under section 206 C of the Income Tax Act (prepared in Form No. 27 E), which is prepared in electronic media as per prescribed data structure. Such returns furnished in a CD/Pen Drive should be accompanied by a signed verification in Form No. 27 Ain case of Annual TDS returns and Form No. 27 B in case of Annual TCS return. From financial year 2005 - 06 onwards, TDS/TCS returns have to be filed every quarter. In e-TDS system of filing returns, even a simple error can result in multiple notices, including penalties, from tax department's computerized system. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{classical}} ruin theory, ruin quantities (e. g. ruin probability {{and the time of}} ruin) are studied separately. It was not until the publication of the seminal paper by Gerber and Shiu (1998) that researchers began to focus on the joint analysis of several ruin quantities. Gerber and Shiu (1998) proposed the well-known Gerber-Shiu expected discounted penalty function or Gerber-Shiu function which unifies the study of three key ruin quantities, namely the time of ruin, the surplus just before ruin and the deficit at ruin. In this thesis, we further incorporate the discounted aggregate claim costs until ruin as well as the discounted aggregate dividends until ruin if any dividend strategy is implemented into the Gerber-Shiu function. The generalized Gerber-Shiu function is examined under the compound Poisson model with a barrier dividend strategy or a threshold dividend strategy and a risk model with 2 -sided jumps. In a risk model with a barrier dividend strategy or a threshold dividend strategy, dividends are paid to shareholder whenever the surplus reaches a predetermined level. The dividends and the claims can be <b>deemed</b> as the <b>payments</b> to the shareholders and policyholders, respectively. As it will be seen in this thesis, if the cost function is specified, the generalized Gerber-Shiu function allows us study the time of ruin, the discounted total dividends until ruin and the discounted aggregate claims until ruin at the same time. Numerical examples are also provided to illustrate the relationship between these quantities. In traditional risk models, insurance companies are assumed to receive premiums at a constant rate. However, some premiums are paid in lump sums, such as insurances of traveling art collections. The assumptions in a risk model with 2 -sided jumps are more realistic in this regard since the upward jumps represent the random premiums. To separate the contributions of random gains and losses, both the discounted aggregate downward jump `costs' until ruin and the discounted aggregate upward jump `costs' until ruin are incorporated into the Gerber-Shiu function. Aside from the general analysis of the generalized Gerber-Shiu function, explicit solutions of two special cases under specific downward jump distribution assumptions are derived along with numerical illustrations related to the first case. published_or_final_versionStatistics and Actuarial ScienceMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R
