5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> of US dollars per year – including {{a wide range of}} transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some not. These flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E

Critics complained that [...] "not a single analyst at either Moody's of S lost {{his job as a}} result of missing the Enron fraud" [...] and [...] "management stayed the same". During the subprime crisis, when <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billion</b> <b>of</b> dollars' worth of triple-A-rated mortgage-backed securities were abruptly downgraded from triple-A to [...] "junk" [...] status within two years of issue, the CRAs' ratings were characterized by critics as [...] "catastrophically misleading" [...] and [...] "provided little or no value". Ratings of preferred stocks also fared poorly. Despite over a year of rising mortgage deliquencies, Moody's continued to rate Freddie Mac's preferred stock triple-A until mid-2008, when it was downgraded to one tick above the junk bond level. Some empirical studies have also found that rather than a downgrade lowering the market price and raising the interest rates of corporate bonds, the cause and effect are reversed. Expanding yield spreads (i.e., declining value and quality) of corporate bonds precedes downgrades by agencies, suggesting it is the market that alerts the CRAs of trouble and not vice versa.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTo reduce {{monitoring}} cost, {{the number}} of monitors {{that are to be}} deployed has to be minimized and the overhead of monitoring flows on the underlying network has to be reduced. In a recent work, we demonstrated, using ILP formulations, that there is a trade-off between these two minimization objectives. However, we have shown that the trade-off could be efficiently balanced by optimizing monitor location and anomaly detection costs jointly. The problem is NP-complete, hence ILPs could not deliver solutions for large networks. In this paper, we address the scalability issues. We propose two greedy algorithms that optimize monitor location cost and anomaly detection cost jointly. The first algorithm is based on an exhaustive heuristic that explores all paths that are candidate to be monitored, in order to select a subset of paths that reduces the total monitoring cost. On the opposite, the second algorithm is based on a selective heuristic that avoids exploring all the candidate paths to further improve scalability. The main challenge of this heuristic is to not degrade the solution quality. The two algorithms have been evaluated through extensive simulations on networks <b>of</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> paths. The comparison of the solutions delivered by the two algorithms {{to each other and to}} the solutions delivered by the ILP demonstrates that the selective algorithm provides near-optimal solutions, while achieving a desirable scalability with respect to the network size and significant reduction of the computation time...|$|R
25|$|If global {{oil prices}} remain high, {{it is likely}} that Canada will become one of the largest oil {{producers}} in the world in the next few decades. If so, there will be environmental issues, resulting more from the vast scale of the operations rather than the toxicity of the products.

In addition, concerns have been raised about water supplies, since the mines and steam projects would use {{a large portion of the}} flow of several major rivers. The most serious problem in the short term is an acute labor and housing shortage which has driven vacancy rates in the oil sands area to zero and wages to extremely high levels.

25|$|Circumstellar {{habitable}} zones {{change over}} time with stellar evolution. For example, hot O-type stars, which may remain on the main sequence for fewer than 10 million years, would have rapidly changing habitable zones not conducive {{to the development of}} life. Red dwarf stars, on the other hand, which can live for <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billions</b> of years on the main sequence, would have planets with ample time for life to develop and evolve. Even while stars are on the main sequence, though, their energy output steadily increases, pushing their habitable zones farther out; our Sun, for example, was 75% as bright in the Archaean as it is now, and in the future, continued increases in energy output will put Earth outside the Sun's habitable zone, even before it reaches the red giant phase. In order to deal with this increase in luminosity, the concept of a continuously habitable zone has been introduced. As the name suggests, the continuously habitable zone is a region around a star in which planetary-mass bodies can sustain liquid water for a given period of time. Like the general circumstellar habitable zone, the continuously habitable zone of a star is divided into a conservative and extended region.|$|E

The brightest quasar in the sky is 3C273 in the constellation of Virgo. It has an average apparent magnitude of 12.8 (bright enough to be seen through a medium-size amateur telescope), but it has an absolute magnitude of −26.7. From {{a distance of about}} 33 light-years, this object would shine in the sky about as brightly as our sun.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{radar sensor}} systems demand high {{performance}} front-end signal processing. The high processing throughput {{is driven by}} the fast analog-to-digital conversion sampling rate, the large number of sensor channels, and stringent requirements on the filter design leading to a large number of filter taps. The computational demands range from tens to <b>hundreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>billion</b> operations per second (GOPS). Fortunately, this processing is very regular, highly parallel, and well suited to VLSI hardware. We recently fielded a system consisting of 100 GOPS designed using custom VLSI chips. The system can adapt to different filter coefficients as a function of changes in the transmitted radar pulse. Although the computation is performed on custom VLSI chips, there are important reasons to attempt to solve this problem using adaptive computing devices. As feature size shrinks and field programmable gate arrays become more capable, the same filtering operation will be feasible using reconfigurable electronics. In this paper we describe the hardware architecture of this high performance radar signal processor, technology trends in reconfigurable computing, and present an alternate implementation using emerging reconfigurable technologies. We investigate the suitability of a Xilinx Virtex chip (XCV 1000) to this application. Results of simulating and implementing the application on the Xilinx chip is also discussed...|$|R
