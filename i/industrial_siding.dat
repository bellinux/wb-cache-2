25|$|The Essendine {{line was}} built single track with {{provision}} for double tracking, {{and at one}} time it was double tracked, but the signalling arrangements did not meet with Board of Trade approval. Rather than make the necessary alterations, it was single tracked again except for the section between Stamford East and the Martin's Cultivators works. This section was left as two tracks but was operated as two single track lines, with one a running line and the other an <b>industrial</b> <b>siding.</b> This siding, known as Priory Siding, also served Priory Lime Works and the Blackstone & Company Limited works.|$|E

2500|$|The {{line has}} been known by several names, {{including}} Hutt Park Line (1937), Hutt Industrial Line (1937), Gracefield Branch (1986), Gracefield Industrial Line (2001) and Gracefield <b>Industrial</b> <b>Siding</b> (2006). [...] Its 1937 name led to confusion with the earlier Hutt Park Railway.|$|E
2500|$|The Hutt Park Railway was {{a private}} railway in Petone at the {{southern}} end of the Hutt Valley in New Zealand's North Island. [...] It operated from 1885 as a branch from the Hutt Valley section of the Wairarapa Line, from 1915 truncated as an <b>industrial</b> <b>siding.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Four {{branch lines}} diverge from the Wairarapa Line: the Melling Branch, and the Gracefield Branch to Hutt Workshops, both still open; and the Greytown Branch, closed in 1953, and the Hutt Park Railway, which ceased serving its {{intended}} purpose in 1906 but survived in truncated form as an <b>industrial</b> <b>siding</b> until 1982. [...] It was also proposed {{to build a}} branch line to Martinborough but this line never eventuated.|$|E

2500|$|Local freight stops include Marval Industries in Mamaroneck, NY, which {{includes}} two [...] "exempt" [...] rail crossings on Fenimore Road (school buses and trucks {{are not required}} to stop) and some minor [...] "street running" [...] of rails along Railroad Way. This siding is served by a CSX local approximately once a week at night. Other sidings served by CSX are Ring's End Lumber in Darien, CT, and a long <b>industrial</b> <b>siding</b> east of Milford, CT. Providence & Worcester trains can be seen running a seasonal stone train along the New Haven Line bound for Long Island.|$|E
2500|$|Freight trains {{initially}} operated out of Lumsden and ran {{five days}} a week until 1956. [...] Services were re-organised to operate from Gore in 1959 and operated thrice-weekly. [...] In 1930 and 1952, the line was not considered to be a branch and thus was not assessed in the branch line commissions of those two years, but in 1967, it was announced that its future was under review. [...] The district negotiated a reprieve for three years, promising extra traffic, and DJ class diesel locomotives replaced steam locomotives on the line in January 1969, but less than 24,000 tonnes were carried annually and through trains ceased running in October 1970, replaced with two shunting services, one from Gore to Riversdale and the other from Lumsden to Kingston Crossing, leaving a 9km gap of line unused, although the tracks were still in place and closure of most of the line came on 1 April 1971. A number of excursion trains ran on the line in its final weeks. Demolition of the line from Balfour back to Gore began in the later part of 1971. Although there were proposals to retain the line from Gore to Mandeville as an <b>industrial</b> <b>siding</b> to serve a proposed freezing works in the area, this proposal never eventuated and the line was lifted from Balfour {{all the way back to}} Gore. The last 2km section of line from the junction points at Gore to the Gore Gravel and Crushing Company's plant was retained as an <b>industrial</b> <b>siding</b> until it too was closed on 1 October 1972. The 16 kilometres from Lumsden to a silo at Balfour remained open for the transport of wheat, but the quantity was not enough to justify the continued existence even of the truncated portion of the line, and it closed on 15 January 1978.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906 the WRC {{relocated}} {{to a new}} track near Trentham Railway Station and the Hutt Park Railway fell into disuse. [...] The company went into liquidation in 1918. [...] The railway from Victoria Street to the Hutt River was lifted, while the remaining portion passed into the possession of the Gear Meat Preserving and Freezing Company as an <b>industrial</b> <b>siding.</b> Gear owned its own small locomotives to perform shunting duties. [...] Two have been saved for preservation: former Railways Department D 137 and a Barclay 4-4-0. [...] In November 1963 they were sold to another company and subsequently passed into the possession of the Silver Stream Railway. [...] In 1982 Gear ceased operations and the last remnants of the Hutt Park Railway were removed. [...] Some of the track and sleepers were used at the Silver Stream Railway.|$|E
