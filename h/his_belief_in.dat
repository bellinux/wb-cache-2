He {{said that he}} never personally signed the cheques for the film's expenditure. He transferred money into Sarkar's bank account and the cheques were eventually signed by Sarkar and his spouse.|$|E
5|$|Wallace was {{strongly}} attracted to unconventional ideas (such as evolution).

5|$|In his magisterial three-volume Institutes of Natural and Revealed Religion (1772–74), Priestley {{outlined}} {{his theories}} of religious instruction. More importantly, {{he laid out}} <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> Socinianism. The doctrines he explicated would become the standards for Unitarians in Britain. This work marked a change in Priestley's theological thinking that is critical to understanding his later writings—it {{paved the way for}} his materialism and necessitarianism (the belief that a divine being acts in accordance with necessary metaphysical laws).|$|E
5|$|James Morris {{notes that}} Hick's eschatological {{verification}} {{theory has been}} criticised for being inconsistent with <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> religious pluralism. Morris argues that such criticism can be overcome by modifying Hick's parable to include multiple travellers, all with different beliefs, on the road. He argues that even if some beliefs about life after death are unverifiable, Hick's belief in bodily resurrection can still be verified.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{released}} his book, , in March 2010, and undertook an 18-state book tour {{to promote the}} work. In the book, Romney writes of <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> American exceptionalism, and presents his economic and geopolitical views rather than anecdotes about his personal or political life. It debuted atop The New York Times Best Seller list. Romney donated his earnings from the book to charity.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the closure}} of the X-Files, the FBI has reassigned Mulder to a {{low-level}} wiretap while his former partner, Dana Scully, has returned to teaching at the FBI Academy. The two have a discreet meeting at {{the parking lot of the}} Watergate Hotel, where Mulder admits that he has been doubting <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the paranormal since Deep Throat's assassination.

5|$|The Swahili Utendi wa Tambuka, an epic poem {{composed}} in 1728 at Pate Island (off {{the shore of}} present-day Kenya) and depicting the wars between the Muslims and Byzantines from the former's point of view, {{is also known as}} Kyuo kya Hereḳali ("The book of Heraclius"). In that work, Heraclius is portrayed as declining the Prophet's command to renounce <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> Christianity; he is therefore defeated by the Muslim forces.|$|E
5|$|The federal Conservatives {{proposed}} {{remedial legislation}} to override Manitoba, {{but they were}} blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the remedial legislation because of <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes {{at the end of}} the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution.

5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism {{and became one of}} the leaders of the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E
5|$|Calloway {{enters the}} church {{wielding}} explosives, taking the congregation hostage. The building is quickly surrounded by police and reporters as Calloway gives a sermon to his hostages {{about the loss}} of faith. Black believes he can connect with Calloway, and is allowed to enter the church. Calloway is initially hostile, but Black is able to talk him down, convincing Calloway that his faith has not been lost, but simply tested—despite all that has happened, Calloway has never lost <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> God. Realizing the truth of this, Calloway surrenders.|$|E
5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E

50|$|After Bulgaria's {{successful}} coup on 9 September 1944, the new {{communist government}} offered to send Hadzhiivanov to study literature in Moscow.

When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E

5|$|Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena {{state that}} even though Gandhi often and {{publicly}} expressed <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> the equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.|$|E
