2500|$|Wray's early {{friendship}} with Dalton Trumbo, and her acquaintance with others at RKO (Edward Dmytryk, Adrian Scott, et al.) made her an easy mark -- studio bosses freely employed 'guilt by association' {{and the threat}} of blacklisting to coerce cooperation in ridding Hollywood of Communists -- but what Paramount or Goddard would gain from Wray pointing at some names on their list seemed to be a puzzle, even to the person who <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] In recounting the experience to her daughter years later, Wray described that person as obviously embarrassed by what they were doing, at one point offering whispered advice that [...] "they've already been named, dear - you won't be hurting anyone." ...|$|E
60|$|Aileen's countenance {{assumed a}} troubled look a she <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> father.|$|E
60|$|Ashe gave in. He {{produced}} a coin and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> gloomily.|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head and held out her hand for the shot-gun. He started <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> then hesitated.|$|R
6000|$|GEOFFREY [He takes {{from the}} table the letter and <b>hands</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in silence. He seats himself on the settee and watches her.] ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I should {{advise you}} to write your note before you start; {{it may be that}} some {{unexpected}} opportunity for <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> may present itself." ...|$|R
60|$|The ill-favoured native below grinned, and, {{picking the}} paper up, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with {{trembling}} hands. She {{put it on}} the table.|$|E
60|$|I {{took from}} my breast pocket Barbara's photograph, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> in silence.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{not quite}} empty," [...] rejoined the young wife, drawing a very business-looking {{envelope}} from <b>her</b> pocket and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband. [...] "Read that, Tom." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Go on, Mr. Chalmers," [...] said he, [...] "and {{tell the}} lady what's the proper caper. That's what I told her--you'd <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> straight. Spiel up." ...|$|R
6000|$|LADY CICELY (with vivid curiosity). Oh, let me see. (He <b>hands</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Before she {{can control}} herself, <b>her</b> {{expression}} changes <b>to</b> one of unmistakable disappointment and repulsion.) ...|$|R
60|$|He hastened up {{and dipped}} a cup {{into the water}} and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{man took}} a card {{from his pocket}} and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with a bow.|$|E
60|$|He <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and she drained its contents. Then {{she smiled}} up at him weakly.|$|E
6000|$|... "There," [...] he said, <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "the first {{woodcock}} of the season. We got four, and I {{really only}} accepted {{one in the}} hope that you would like it. I shall leave it with the estimable Mills, on my return." ...|$|R
6000|$|Though Denbigh {{appeared}} a little abstracted during the ride, his questions concerning Sir Edward {{and her friends}} kind and affectionate. As they approached the house he suffered his horse to walk, and, after some hesitation, he took a letter from his pocket, and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only {{watch for}} me to-night, Citoyenne St. Just," [...] he said eagerly. [...] "Listen: among the papers which were found {{about the person}} of Sir Andrew Ffoulkes there was a tiny note. See!" [...] he added, taking a tiny scrap of paper from his pocket-book and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{sought for}} the seal {{among the many}} costly objects which {{littered}} his table and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} her thoughtfully a moment. Then he {{selected}} a paper from his mail and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|The girl {{pointed to}} the table, on which stood writing materials. Stephen wrote his fatherâ€™s address upon it and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|RICHARD. No; {{but plenty}} of milk. Let me give you some toast. (He puts some on the second plate, and <b>hands</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> with the knife. The action shows quietly how well he knows that she has avoided her usual place {{so as to be}} as far from him as possible.) ...|$|R
60|$|Aaron saw at {{once that}} his little gift was not to go down smoothly. He was, however, in for it now, so he picked it out from among the other {{papers in the case}} and brought <b>it</b> over <b>to</b> Susan. He endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>hand</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with an air of indifference, but I cannot say that he succeeded.|$|R
60|$|Before Mrs Jo could answer, Dan {{pulled a}} shabby little volume {{from under his}} pillow, and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> said: 'Please read the third one; it's short and pretty--I'm fond of it.' The book opened at the right place, as if the third story had been often read, and Bess smiled as she saw the name.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught up}} {{the pen and}} wrote a few hurried lines. The smile with which he <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> was not {{altogether}} successful.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Mould, thus encouraged, took {{a little}} more of the punch, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> daughters, who dutifully {{followed}} the example of their mother.|$|E
60|$|He {{took it out}} and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> with {{a little}} smile which he could not help, though he rather blamed himself for indulging in it.|$|E
5|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} <b>hands</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates. After looking out for another few seconds she clasps his neck lightly and they step back inside.|$|R
50|$|Once Frankie is revived, {{he draws}} a {{map to the}} {{location}} of the buried loot for Margot, but on <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> keeps half of the map for himself. Now that Vincent and Margot have the location, Margot encourages Vincent to shoot Frankie and take his half of the map. With Frankie truly dead, Margot, Vincent, and Dr. Craig now must {{be able to get out}} of the city.|$|R
50|$|The {{woman is}} perched against an armoire, the man {{approaches}} and covers her naked {{body with the}} yellow bathrobe, and the two move towards the window. After they step out on the balcony, the man draws a toothpick {{from his pocket and}} <b>hands</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> with an upwards nod, which she reciprocates.

60|$|He {{ran with}} it {{quickly into the}} tent {{occupied}} by the thin man and fat woman, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> with a profusion of thanks for her kindness.|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} the key. He took it, opened the desk, searched amongst the little pile of papers, drew out the {{half-sheet}} of notepaper, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The 15th," [...] she said; and {{he wrote}} under the sketch, Lydia Blood. Ship Aroostook, August 15, 1874, and <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> with a bow surcharged with gravity.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{ought to}} be whipped for his impudence,' said the Captain; 'but never fear, Miss Brady, I shall not touch him; your FAVOURITE is safe from me.' So saying, he stooped {{down and picked up}} the bunch of ribands which had fallen at Nora's feet, and <b>handing</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> said in a sarcastic tone, 'When ladies make {{presents}} <b>to</b> gentlemen, <b>it</b> is time for OTHER gentlemen to retire.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Jobson took a {{book from}} his pocket, and opening it at a certain page, <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|The pretty old lady, {{after reading}} it, had just laid it {{down upon the}} breakfast-cloth. She <b>handed</b> <b>it</b> over <b>to</b> <b>her</b> son.|$|R
