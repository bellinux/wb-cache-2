50|$|Today, <b>Hippology</b> is {{the title}} of an Equine Veterinary and Management Knowledge Contest that is used in 4-H, FFA and many horse breed contests. <b>Hippology</b> {{consists}} of four phases: Horse Judging, Written Examination and Slide Identification, ID Stations and Team Problem Solving.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hippology</b> (from Greek: , hippos, [...] "horse"; and λόγος, logos, [...] "study") is {{the study}} of the horse.|$|E
5000|$|Many youth {{across the}} United States, {{and in other}} {{countries}} compete in <b>Hippology</b> annually, showing their knowledge of all things [...] "horse".|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hippology</b> Service - {{training}} of horses and mounted policemen mainly for patrolling in natural reserve areas and for riot duty (mounted policemen themselves {{are part of}} the above-mentioned units) ...|$|E
50|$|The courses {{focused on}} {{instruction}} on civility, Colombian geography, Colombian constitution, Police code, Penal code and proceedings, typing, topography, Forensics, organisation and documentation, leadership school, military doctrine, Equestrianism and <b>Hippology.</b>|$|E
50|$|Tourism is {{concentrated}} on Seč dam and historical architecture. Of note is historical centre of Chrudim, <b>hippology</b> museum in Slatiňany, castles Košumberk, Lichnice, Rychmburk and Oheb, war memorial in Ležáky and Skansen Veselý Kopec.|$|E
50|$|Nâçerî is {{a famous}} {{treatise}} of <b>hippology</b> drafted {{about the year}} 1333, by Abou Bakr Ibn Badr Eddîn Ibn It Moundir The Baïtar, ordered by the Mamluk sultan An-Nasir Muhammad, also called sultan Ennâcer (victorieux), whence the name of Naceri (relative to Nacer).|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in 1046 in Lahore to wealthy parents from Hamadan, present-day Iran. his father Sa'd bin Salman was a great Persian {{ambassador}} who was sent to India by Ghaznavids.Masud was born there and he was highly learned in astrology, <b>hippology,</b> calligraphy, literature and also in Arabic and Indian languages.|$|E
50|$|The National Equestrian Centre was {{established}} in 1989 in renovated buildings and newly built riding halls, exhibition halls, outdoor tracks and a restaurant. The centre is managed non-profit by Aarhus Municipality, Aarhus Riding Club and Dansk Varmblod and Prince Henrik is the official protector. The centre offers large venues for international competitions, <b>hippology</b> studies and conferences.|$|E
5000|$|The horse judging phase {{generally}} includes judging both a halter {{class and}} an [...] "under saddle" [...] class (such as western pleasure, hunter under saddle, etc.). The classes involve 4 horses and contestants {{are given a}} judging card to place the horses. Unlike the Horse Judging competitions, <b>Hippology</b> competitors {{are not expected to}} give reasons, but only place the classes.|$|E
50|$|In 4-H, <b>hippology</b> teams {{consist of}} 3 or 4 members. (In {{the case of}} a team with 4 members, the lowest score is dropped.) Teams compete at a {{regional}} level, where the first place team advances to compete against the other region winners at a state level. The winner of the state level then advances to either Eastern Nationals in Kentucky, or Western Nationals in Colorado, depending on the state.|$|E
50|$|Of all the treatises of <b>hippology,</b> the Nâçerî is {{probably}} the best known, {{as a result of the}} attention devoted to it by the French doctor Nicolas Perron who published, between 1852 and 1960, three volumes of comments on the translation of the manuscript n° 2814 of the Bibliothèque nationale de France. This work has given to the scholars studying that period the necessary elements to strengthen the already existing belief of the high quality of the Arab Veterinarians of that era.|$|E
5000|$|Information for the <b>hippology</b> {{competitions}} {{is taken}} from multiple sources. These include [...] "The Horse" [...] by Evans et al, [...] "Illustrated Dictionary of Equine Terms" [...] by New Horizons Equine Education Center Inc., [...] "Horse Industry Handbook" [...] by American Youth Horse Council, [...] "Youth Leaders' Manual" [...] by American Youth Horse Council, [...] "Horse Anatomy: A Coloring Atlas" [...] by Kainer and McCracken, [...] "Feeding and Care of the Horse" [...] by Lewis, and [...] "Equine Science" [...] by Griffiths.|$|E
5000|$|The Chinese {{historically}} used bronze {{scale models}} of horses as <b>hippology</b> reference guides {{to the ideal}} horse (Harrist 1997:149-150). The Book of the Later Han records two early examples. The horse expert Dongmeng Jing presented Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) with a cast-bronze horse and written instructions for using the model to judge horses. General Ma Yuan (a renowned equestrian surnamed [...] "horse") presented Emperor Guangwu of Han (r. 25-57 CE) a bronze model of a horse designed to clarify the points to observe in equine judging. The inscription, which listed four generations of Ma's horse teachers, said (tr. Creel 1965:659), [...] "Horses are the foundation of military might, the great resource of the state." [...] Some Chinese scholars propose that the famous [...] "Flying Horse" [...] discovered in a Han tomb in Gansu was a physiognomic model for a superior horse in motion.|$|E
40|$|The SIUC College of Agricultural Science {{has hosted}} the Southern Regional 4 -H <b>Hippology</b> and Horse Bowl contest {{for the past}} two years. During the competition, a short survey will be offered to contestants and leaders to obtain {{accurate}} and anonymous feedback regarding the contest and the impact of this event on the regional 4 -H members who participate. Specifically, the survey will focus on how the SIUC hosted <b>Hippology</b> and Horse Bowl contest prepares 4 -H members for further competitions and if the contest encourages students to pursue an agricultural field, particularly at SIUC. During the organization of the event, number of contestants and 4 -H clubs present will be recorded. On March 25 th, one survey will be given to contestants to determine effectiveness of the contest in preparation for future competitions in addition to the impact SIUC College of Agricultural Science has on determining future educational paths. The second survey will be directed towards 4 -H leaders to gather opinions on content and organization. Both surveys will offer information which the SIUC College of Agricultural Science will utilize for future contests. The results will also illustrate the importance of the College’s activity in the community and the impact of such activities in 4 -H youth looking into their educational future. The results will reveal if hosting youth activities is an effective means to bring new students to Southern Illinois University Carbondale and ways to improve the event. Data will be collect on March 25 th. The findings will be presented at the Undergraduate Research Foru...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject matter}} of the present {{research}} is mediaeval Arabic literature in the 8 th to 15 th centuries, dealing with horses and <b>hippology.</b> Numerous descriptions of horses have been left to us from this period, the most renowned authors being Abū ‘Ubayda, al-Aṣma‘ī, Ibn Sīda and Ibn Qutayba. The present article has made extensive use of these works and subjected the explanations found therein to a comparison with dialectical variants of the various body parts of a horse, for instance, the different sections of the forehead, the croup, the side or the hoof. The classical meanings of these body parts have sometimes radically changed by now, in other instances the meanings have been extended, and part of the classical vocabulary has simply disappeared, or survived but in a completely altered new sense...|$|E
40|$|Extracts: Turning to {{the text}} of The Boke of Marchalsi (Item 3), modern {{descriptions}} of MS G have hitherto given the impression that this consists of a single continuous extract. 15 Closer examination reveals, however, that there are in fact three discontinuous but otherwise complete fragments, which discuss in turn: (a) the condition of pursiness (short-windedness) with appropriate cures; (b) the condition of ‘enchafing of the neck’ (a type of mange) with suitable cures; and (c) a solitary recipe for a poultice for the hoof of a horse suffering from lameness. [...] . In {{terms of what they}} have to say, it must be admitted that these three fragments will not alter our understanding of medieval <b>hippology</b> to any great extent, but they are important nonetheless in that they are essential for anyone wishing to undertake a fully collated scholarly edition of The Boke of Marchalsi...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays {{breeding}} {{has become}} the problem often solved in European states {{and it has been}} paid much attention by breeding organizations. In terms of <b>hippology</b> as well as some urgent requirements from the side of nonius breeders we have focussed on this particular breed especially from the reason of its further survival and development in Slovakia. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the growth indicators as well as the achievement level of the stallions since 1927 to the present. Based on our research of the nonius body lines we can state that at present there are 3 stallions that are followers of the N VIII horse line founder. In general, there are 12 stallions that are active within this breed in Slovakia. It was statistically confirmed that this particular breed grew much stronger through the goal-directed breeding work, improved nutrition as well as the immediate breeding site. It was quite complicated to evaluate the performance tests because the individual indicators were significantly influenced by the subjective views of the commitee members performing the evaluation. The next factor which prevents the objective evaluation is {{the fact that in the}} period up to 1979, the performance tests were valued by the 100 point system and from the year 1980 by the 10 point system. That is why we take the performance test results into account only as supplemental ones, which can provide a kind of amendment to the observed biological parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{historical}} and evolutionary perspectives of equine laminitis {{were placed in}} a contemporary context of <b>hippology.</b> A survey revealed 3 % of the equine population in the UK {{to be affected by}} laminitis. Physiological aspects affecting pedal blood flow, namely endocrine and haemodynamic relationships, were considered under controlled management. Pedal haemodynamics, investigated non-invasively using Near Infrared Spectroscopy, detected changes in concentrations of oxyhaemoglobin, deoxyhaemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase, indicating tissue utilisation of oxygen and hence perfusion. Responses of chronic larninitics suggested attenuated blood flow and local hypoxia. Haemostasis was shown to occur in acute larninitis The role of nitric oxide was investigated by assessment of the effects of concentrations of substrate, synthetic nitric oxide donors, and endogenous and exogenous, inhibitors of nitric oxide synthesis. Reperfusion of ischaernic laminal tissue during acute laminitis was initiated by iv administration of I-arginine, a substrate of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis; this also increased blood flow in laminal tissues of a normal horse, but had little effect on blood pressure. Grass induced acute laminitis was successfully treated with transdermal application of glyceryl trinitrate paste to the pasterns. A competitive inhibitor of I-arginine synthesis increased blood pressure of normal horses but did not induce acute laminitis. Plasma I-arginine increased when normal and chronically laminitic horses went to grass. Plasma asymmetric dimethyl-l-arginine (ADMA) was lower in chronic laminitics than normal ponies; ADMA decreased when at grass from 1. 2 [tmol/L to 0. 7 [tmol/L in normal horses and from 0. 8 tLmol/L to 0. 47 [tmol /L in chronically laminitic ponies. Radioimmunoassays for angiotensin II, atrial natriuretic peptide and endothelin were validated and basal values for the horse established as 24 ± 2 pg/ml, 34 ± 2 pg/ml and 1. 78 ± 0. 2 pg/ml respectively. Seasonal differences in AII and ANP were observed. Endocrine changes, observed during acute laminitis, were neither large nor sustained. Blood pressures and heart rate were significantly raised at the acute stage but otherwise unremarkable. Although transient hypertension occurs during acute laminitis, chronic laminitics are not hypertensive. Moderate hypertension accompanies refractory laminitis but this {{does not appear to be}} mediated by angiotensin II or endothelin. Electrolyte concentrations were largely unaffected but slight seasonal differences were seen alongside sodium retention in refractory and some chronic cases. Digestive disturbances of acute laminitis were reflected in decreased urinary contents of hippuric: acid. Seasonal changes in ingested electrolytes and water soluble carbohydrates are part of the complex pathogenesis of acute laminitis. An hypothesis outlines potential and actual relationships between dietary factors, endotoxaemia and the vasoactive hormones whose interplay may adversely influence pedal haemodynamics in developmental and acute equine laminitis...|$|E
