25|$|On {{the other}} hand, many skulls {{evidence}} facial features or dimensions of Cro-magnon man. The latter type prevailed in Late Paleolithic times in Europe, supplanting Neanderthal man there. The Cro-magnon skull is dolichocephalic (long), the jaw prognathous (protruding), the nose flat and the supraorbital ridges (brow ridges) pronounced. Genetic analysis by {{scientists from the}} University of Ferrara (Italy) indicates that the Cro-magnons were ancestral to the current population of Europe. There {{is no evidence of}} superficial features such as coloration or details of <b>facial</b> <b>tissue,</b> and nothing to suggest that the Cro-magnons of Europe were the only ancestors of Europeans or that features considered Europoid were not found elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|In New Nightmare, Freddy's {{appearance}} is updated considerably, {{giving him a}} green fedora that matched his sweater stripes, skin-tight leather pants, knee-high black boots, a turtleneck version of his trademark sweater, a dark blue trench coat, and a fifth claw on his glove, which also has a far more organic appearance, resembling the exposed muscle tissue of an actual hand. Freddy also has fewer burns on his face, though these are more severe, with his muscle tissue exposed in numerous places. Compared to his other incarnations, this Freddy's injuries are more like those of an actual burn victim. For the 2010 remake, Freddy is returned to his iconic attire, but the burns on his face are intensified with further bleaching of the skin and exposed <b>facial</b> <b>tissue</b> on the left cheek, more reminiscent of actual third degree burns than in the original series.|$|E
25|$|An {{examination}} of the four bodies which were found in May shifted the narrative as to what had occurred during the incident. Three of the ski hikers had fatal injuries: Thibeaux-Brignolles had major skull damage, and both Dubinina and Zolotaryov had major chest fractures. According to Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high, comparing it to {{the force of a}} car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds related to the bone fractures, {{as if they had been}} subjected to a high level of pressure. However, major external injuries were found on Dubinina, who was missing her tongue, eyes, part of the lips, as well as <b>facial</b> <b>tissue</b> and a fragment of skullbone; she also had extensive skin maceration on the hands. It was claimed that Dubinina was found lying face down in a small stream that ran under the snow and that her external injuries were in line with putrefaction in a wet environment, and were unlikely to be related to her death.|$|E

2500|$|The most {{pressing}} issue {{relates to the}} data used to average <b>facial</b> <b>tissue</b> thickness.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Different facial {{reconstruction}} methods rely on {{the average}} <b>facial</b> soft <b>tissue</b> thickness values provided in previous studies. <b>Facial</b> soft <b>tissue</b> thickness {{is influenced by the}} age, sex, and ethnicity of the individual. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine <b>facial</b> soft <b>tissue</b> thickness of adult Pakistani subjects with different facial morphology. A total of 166 subjects were categorized into three skeletal classes (based on convex, straight, or concave facial profile) employing the classification system used in orthodontics. <b>Facial</b> soft <b>tissue</b> thick- ness was determined at ten midline points on lateral cephalograms. Significant differences in <b>facial</b> soft <b>tissue</b> thickness were present at glabella, labrale superius, stomion, and labiomentale in males and at labrale superius, labrale inferius, labiomentale, and pogonion in females among dif- ferent skeletal classes. The current study suggests that the skull morphology-related variations in <b>facial</b> soft <b>tissue</b> thickness should be consid- ered during facial reconstruction to achieve accurate results...|$|R

Some opponents dubbed it the [...] "Kleenex contract", implying that the CPE would allow employers to discard young people like <b>facial</b> <b>tissue.</b> According to them, the law will only encourage the growth of the working poor and the precarity phenomena, and violates a requirement of French labor law introduced in 1973, as well as article 24 of the European social charter, which states that the employer must provide a motive for dismissal of employees.|$|E

40|$|The {{anatomy of}} the craniofacial {{skeleton}} has been described through the aid of dissection identifying hard and soft tissue structures. Although the macro and microscopic investigation of internal <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> have provided invaluable information on constitution of the tissues {{it is important to}} inspect and model <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> in the living individual. Detailing the form and function of <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> will be invaluable in clinical diagnoses and planned corrective surgical interventions such as management of facial palsies and craniofacial disharmony/anomalies. Recent advances in lower-cost, non-invasive imaging and computing power (surface scanning, Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) and Magnetic Resonance (MRI)) has enabled the ability to capture and process surface and internal structures to a high resolution. The three-dimensional surface facial capture has enabled characterization of facial features all of which will influence subtleties in facial movement and surgical planning. This chapter will describe the factors that influence facial morphology in terms of gender and age differences, facial movement—surface and underlying structures, modeling based on average structures, orientation of facial muscle fibers, biomechanics of movement—proof of principle and surgical intervention...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how market behavior {{changed in the}} <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> category, following the 1995 / 1996 Kimberly-Clark merger with Scott Paper Products in the paper products industry. The <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> category is of interest because the US Department of Justice (DOJ), anticipating reduced competition after the merger, imposed a consent decree, requiring that Scotts’ <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> brands be licensed out to a third party. We utilize a two-stage budgeting demand system developed by Deaton and Muellbauer (1980 a), coupled with general form supply-side first order conditions to compare demand and competitive behavior {{before and after the}} merger. Our findings indicate that the merger coincides with substantial impacts on the substitution rates across different <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> brands, with the biggest changes for the Scott brand. We measure competitive conduct at a weekly level, using a Conjectural Variations approach. Our results indicate that before the merger, Procter and Gamble exhibited mild Stackelberg leadership in its pricing. In the year following the 1995 merger, however, we find evidence consistent with a switch in the pricing leadership role to Kimberly-Clark. Our findings are corroborated by an estimation approach that allows us to study how the parameters of the supply and demand system vary over time (see e. g. Sudhir, Chintagunta and Kadiyali 2003). Our study shows that brand ownership changes resulting from the merger can affect competitive conduct; in particular it can affect the Stackelberg price leadership position of the firms in an affected industry. We also show that competitive conduct and pricing behavior changed, despite the DOJ requirement that the Scotts brand be licensed out ensuring that the number of brands on the market remained unchanged after the merger...|$|R

It is of a great {{importance}} mainly for forensic practice, but it {{plays an important role in}} other fields, for example aesthetic surgery. Defining the thickness of <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> for different sexes, age and ethnic groups is an important aspect of forensic anthropology. The thesis specialises in finding out the thickness of soft <b>facial</b> <b>tissues</b> in modern czech population, it takes into consideration the sex, age and assymetry. The main source of information are the CT scans of the heads of 46 adult women and 56 adult men of czech nationality ranging between ages 21 to 83. 80 landmarks are defined in each scan, therefore 40 linear measurements between corresponding points have been evaluated. Data were analysed using the PCA, Hotelling test, linear discrimination analysis, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, MANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test and Wilcoxon paired test. Retrieved thicknesses of soft tissues will serve as the standards for the current czech population. Sexual dimorphism has been proven regarding the whole face, as well as both upper and lower parts of the face. The success of classification on the upper part of the face decresases significantly.
