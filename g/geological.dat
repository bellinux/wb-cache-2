5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the United States, Georgia geology has been included in maps produced for the entire country. The first <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. was produced in 1809 by William Maclure. In 1807, Maclure undertook the self-imposed task of making a <b>geological</b> survey of the United States. He traversed and mapped nearly every state in the Union. During the rigorous two-year period of his survey, he crossed and recrossed the Allegheny Mountains some 50 times. The results of his unaided endeavor were submitted to the American Philosophical Society in a memoir entitled Observations on the Geology of the United States explanatory of a <b>Geological</b> Map, together with the nation's first <b>geological</b> map, which were published in the Society's journal Transactions, This precedes William Smith's <b>geological</b> map of England by six years, although Smith's map was constructed using a different classification of rocks. Several reports used Maclure’s <b>geological</b> map to accompany their description of the geology of the U.S. (Beaujour, 1814 and Marcou, 1858). In 1816, within an elementary treatise of mineralogy and geology, Parker Cleaveland produced a <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. In 1843, Charles Moxon produced a small-scale geologic map of the U.S., where Ami Boué produced a <b>geological</b> structure map of the globe. In 1853, Marcou produced a <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. and the British provinces of North America. In 1856, Henry Darwin Rogers created a similar map of the geology of the U.S. and British North America. There was a short description of the geologic map of the U.S. by Charles Henry Hitchcock in 1872, which had small-scale <b>geological</b> maps included. Hitchcock and William P. Blake published a general geologic map of the U.S. in R.W. Raymond’s Statistics of mines and mining. In 1874, they published a <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. and territories in the U.S. Census 9th Statistical Atlas. Hitchcock and Blake published a summary of this map in the <b>Geological</b> Magazine in 1873. Gray’s <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. was published in the National Atlas special edition at a scale of about 1inch to 300 miles in 1876 and reprinted in 1886 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers. A <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. east of the Rocky Mountains was produced at the scale of 1inch to 105.5 miles by Frank H. Bradley. In the 1880s several <b>geological</b> maps of the U.S. were produced. William John McGee offered a detailed description for the U.S. <b>Geological</b> Survey in 1884. In 1887, Hitchcock produced a <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. and parts of Canada that was at the scale of 1inch to 200 miles, with a review of the various maps of the U.S. that accompanied the <b>geological</b> map of the U.S. In 1895, McGee and J.B. Tolbert produced a 1:15,000,000 scale map of the geology of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The {{geologic}} map of Georgia (a state within the United States) is a special-purpose map made to show <b>geological</b> features. Rock units or geologic strata are shown by colors or symbols to indicate {{where they are}} exposed at the surface. Structural features such as faults and shear zones are also shown. Since the first national <b>geological</b> map, in 1809, {{there have been numerous}} maps which included the geology of Georgia. The first Georgia specific {{geologic map}} was created in 1825. The most recent state-produced geologic map of Georgia, by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources is 1:500,000 scale, and was created in 1976 by the department's Georgia <b>Geological</b> Survey. It was generated from a base map produced by the United States <b>Geological</b> Survey. The state geologist and Director of the <b>Geological</b> Survey of Georgia was Sam M. Pickering, Jr. Since 1976, several <b>geological</b> maps of Georgia, featuring the state's five distinct geologic regions, have been produced by the federal government.|$|E
