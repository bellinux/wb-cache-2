40|$|As {{the online}} channel matures, many firms {{are finding that}} an {{understanding}} of how their online customers' preferences and choices vary across <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> can be very useful. In this paper, we propose a spatial multinomial model of customer choice and illustrate how spatial modeling of choices of online customers across <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> provides useful insights {{in the context of a}} product mix and pricing decision of an online book publisher. The spatial multinomial model specifically accounts for the spatial correlations among customer choices among different product forms—print and PDF. The estimation results obtained using data generated from an online experiment show that the spatial model accounts for the geographical variation in many of the unobserved effects possibly due to locational differences and price sensitivities. The resultant spatial decision maps provide useful predictions as to how purchase rates vary across <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> as a function of the price differential between product forms, with implications for targeting customers through local market advertising, direct marketing, and cross-channel promotion. spatial model, mixed multinomial logit, pricing, digital products, Internet...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: With {{more and}} more firms contemplating {{expansion}} in the international market, {{the question of how}} a firm estimates its sales potential in a given country takes on increasing importance. Certainly one vital piece of information in estimating sales potential would be the size of the total current market in that country. This article considers the various ways in which firms might estimate market size by country, with particular consideration given to the use of econometric models. The article aims at three related questions. First, what has happened over the past thirty years in the use of econometric models for measuring <b>geographical</b> <b>markets?</b> Second, is it possible to demonstrate that currently available econometric techniques lead to “improved” measurement of geographical markets—and, in particular, for international markets?

40|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{has created an}} interdependent market that allows companies to transcend traditional national boundaries to conduct business overseas. In the international construction market, companies often adopt diversification as a strategy for growth, for risk management or for both. However, the diversification patterns of international construction companies (ICCs) as a group are barely clear. The primary aim {{of this research is}} to cover this knowledge void by mapping ICCs’ diversification patterns in both business sectors and geographical dispersal. It starts from a literature review of diversification theories. Based on the review, a series of hypotheses relating to ICCs’ diversification are proposed. Data are gleaned from Engineering News-Record, i. e. Bloomberg and Capital IQ, ranging from 2001 to 2015. By testing the hypotheses, it is found that larger ICCs prefer to diversify than their smaller counterparts. Most of the ICCs tend to diversify to <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> with similar cultural or institutional environment. Market demands drive ICCs to diversify to different <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> while they are more prudential in venturing into new business sectors. The research provides not only valuable insights into diversification patterns of ICCs, but also a solid point of departure for future theoretical and empirical studies...|$|R

There were times in which two different May's stores had operated in the same <b>geographical</b> <b>market,</b> but were aimed at different customers.

50|$|Revenue {{management}} {{to this point}} had been utilized in the pricing of perishable products. In the 1990s, however, the Ford Motor Company began adopting revenue {{management to}} maximize profitability of its vehicles by segmenting customers into micro-markets and creating a differentiated and targeted price structure. Pricing for vehicles and options packages had been set based upon annual volume estimates and profitability projections. The company found that certain products were overpriced and some were underpriced. Understanding the range of customer preferences across a product line and <b>geographical</b> <b>market,</b> Ford leadership created a Revenue management organization to measure the price-responsiveness of different customer segments for each incentive type and to develop an approach that would target the optimal incentive by product and region. By {{the end of the}} decade, Ford estimated that roughly $3 billion in additional profits came from revenue management initiatives.|$|E

To gain a share of that <b>geographical</b> <b>market,</b> Dana connected with Alvin Sajewski to help the label get Chicago talent. Recording sessions took place in Chicago, but Walter Dana continued to supervise the sessions, often re-arranging the music to fit the abilities and talent of the musicians in the studio. Dana's sales percentage of 78rpm records was stronger than the industry's average. It was not until 1957 that sales of 45rpm discs equaled that of the 78s. Dana started pressing the 78rpm discs in vinyl, similar to the 45's, but switched back to selling the 78rpm format in shellac because of dealers' demands.|$|E
