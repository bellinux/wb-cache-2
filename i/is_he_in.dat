When <b>is</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> fact to have those full civil rights which have so long been his in law? When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? â€¦ in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2008, Rush Hour {{director}} Brett Ratner {{was officially}} named director, who promised the film would return under the series' standard [...] "R" [...] rating, {{rather than as}} a rumored watered down PG-13. Michael Brandt and Derek Haas were hired as screenwriters to improve on the existing script in July 2008 and completed a new script, under the working title Beverly Hills Cop 2009, which would see Foley return to Beverly Hills to investigate the murder of his friend Billy Rosewood. The script was eventually rejected, leaving Ratner to work on a new idea. In an interview with Empire magazine, Ratner stated [...] "I'm working very hard on the fourth. It's very difficult, especially since there were three before. We're trying to figure out some important things, like where do we start? Is Axel retired? <b>Is</b> <b>he</b> <b>in</b> Beverly Hills? Is he on vacation? Does Judge Reinhold return as the loveable Billy Rosewood? Many questions to figure out, but I'm hoping to have a script before film disappears from our existence." [...] Although Murphy himself committed to the project, it was unconfirmed whether the series' other principal actors, Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, Ronny Cox or Bronson Pinchot would also return, though Ratner stated in late 2009 {{that he was trying to}} convince Reinhold and Ashton to reprise their roles. Harold Faltermeyer's [...] "Axel F", however, would definitely be returning for the proposed fourth installment, with Ratner quoted as saying [...] "It'll be back but it'll be a whole new interpretation." [...] On November 15, 2010, Ratner stated in an interview with MTV that there was still a possibility that they will make a fourth film, but that it wouldn't be [...] "anytime soon." ...|$|E
