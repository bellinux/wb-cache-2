2500|$|The poem is {{different}} in style and form from other poems composed by Coleridge. While incomplete and subtitled a [...] "fragment", its language is highly stylised with {{a strong emphasis on}} sound devices that change between the poem's original two stanzas. The first stanza of the poem describes Khan's pleasure dome built alongside a sacred river fed by a powerful fountain. The second stanza of the poem is the narrator's response to the power and effects of an Abyssinian maid's song, which enraptures him but leaves him unable to act on her inspiration unless <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> once again. Together, they form a comparison of creative power that does not work with nature and creative power that is harmonious with nature.|$|E
2500|$|Paul Weitz {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the story of Grandma long before he began writing the script. He never completed the story until he had met and worked with Tomlin on the 2013 film Admission, saying that [...] "After meeting Lily, the voice and the character really clicked, I had thought about it for years, so I had a lot of it worked out in my head, and then I just went to a coffee shop and wrote it longhand." [...] He said that, as he wrote, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> [...] "performing it in [...] head". After writing the script, he was afraid to present it to Tomlin in case she turned down the lead role. Tomlin said that she immediately connected with the character and the story; she and Weitz then spent several months editing the script together. The film marked Tomlin's first leading role in 27 years, after co-starring with Bette Midler in the 1988 comedy film Big Business.|$|E
60|$|Her {{face was}} very close to his, and he fancied that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> teeth chattering. She was {{obviously}} terrified.|$|E
60|$|He stood {{watching}} her, fearing to move. He listened hard {{and his face}} was very white. Even now <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breathing.|$|R
60|$|When {{the door}} of No.62 was opened <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{distinctly}} <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> singing, and said so at once, to prevent any chance of being denied entrance.|$|R
50|$|In another case, {{a lawyer}} {{dressed in a}} niqab was told by an {{immigration}} judge {{that she could not}} represent a client because, <b>he</b> said, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before Lemuel {{knew what}} she was doing, she flew out of the door, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> flying down the stairs.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't {{make out}} what's gittin' into Johnny," [...] <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> say. [...] "He didn't {{used to be}} this way. He was a patient little angel.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned into}} his own room. Before he had quite undressed, Mrs. Abel rapped at the door; he opened it an inch, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> speak low.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen rose {{slowly from}} the mound. A hopeless depression, a sullen despair, showed itself in her look and manner. She refused the captain's offered hand; and her tones, when she {{answered}} him, were {{so low that}} <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He {{heard her}} hang up, and was surprised, the next moment, that somehow he was {{reluctant}} to yield to the happiness that he had claimed was his. Rather, did it seem that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice and Graham's recklessly singing the [...] "Gypsy Trail." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{hurried down}} to the lawn, {{staggering}} as she ran--stopped, {{and looked back at}} the house--hastened onward toward the trees--stopped again, looking backward and forward, uncertain which way to turn next--and then advanced once more. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> now <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> heavily gasping for breath. As she came nearer, the starlight showed a panic-stricken face--the face of Mrs. Ellmother.|$|R
60|$|She {{struggled}} to recover possession of herself. A faint light began {{to soften the}} dull cold stare of her eyes. In a moment more she spoke so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Lucia turned away: {{but she was}} vexed. Campbell {{could see}} that a strange fancy for the plant had seized her. As she walked from the spot, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> talking about its beauty to Valencia.|$|E
60|$|Amyas, fully {{expecting her}} to jump overboard, {{followed}} {{as fast as}} he could. But she had locked herself in with Lucy, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> violent sobs, and Lucy's faint voice entreating to know what was the matter.|$|E
40|$|In 2006, {{a lawyer}} named Shabnam Mughal {{represented}} a client at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal in England. Ms Mughal is a Muslim {{and wore a}} niqab 2 or full-face veil in public places. During her submissions, she was told by Judge George Glossop to remove her niqab because <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her.</b> Perhaps a more appropriate response t...|$|R
60|$|Alice {{watched the}} White King as he slowly {{struggled}} up from bar to bar, till {{at last she}} said, 'Why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I'd far better help you, hadn't I?' But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> neither <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> nor see her.|$|R
60|$|Next {{morning they}} made the experiment. It failed. Other {{experiments}} followed at intervals, {{most of which were}} fiascos, although some were partially successful. Thus, at times Mary <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> what <b>he</b> said. But except for a word or two, and now and then a sentence, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> whom, when she was still a child and his playmate, once he had heard so clearly.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young person}} {{was taking her}} leave. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> sympathetic--"Well--good night! I hope she'll be no worse. Good night Mrs. Sisson!" [...] She was gone--he heard the windy bang of the street-gate. Presently Millicent emerged again, flitting indoors.|$|E
6000|$|He {{must have}} drifted into a dream--and an extravagant one--for he was master of Charleroi and Ad√®le was his wife. She {{was coming out}} to him now; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> steps; {{he could feel her}} hand upon his shoulder-- ...|$|E
60|$|Even for Frank's truly fraternal {{indifference}} the radiance and derision of {{his sister}} still seemed to sparkle and ring; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> laughter still from the garden of the hotel, and he stared at his sombre adviser in puzzledom.|$|E
60|$|He {{took off}} his shoes, and stole upstairs to Carmina's door. The {{faithful}} Teresa was astir, earnestly persuading her to take some nourishment. The little that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> of <b>her</b> voice, as she answered, made his heart ache--it was so faint and so low. Still she could speak; and still there was the old saying to remember, which has comforted so many and deceived so many: While there's life, there's hope.|$|R
5000|$|According to Vertue, Steven Moffat {{wrote on}} the top floor of their family home. Once he {{finished}} a script, she read it two floors away so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> laughing. The producer says that his first drafts were [...] "pretty much ready to shoot". She did not give him many notes; she would tick all of the places where she laughed, and then he revised the script accordingly.|$|R
60|$|Arraigned for {{conspiracy}} {{against the}} Republic, she was liable to secret trial, {{to be brought}} up, condemned, and executed before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> even <b>hear</b> of <b>her</b> whereabouts, before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> throw himself before her judges and take all guilt upon himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> {{drawing on}} her gloves {{and rose to}} say good-bye. She passed behind him, kissed him audaciously {{on the back of}} the neck, and ran away as swiftly as on the day when she had {{destroyed}} the Melancolia.|$|E
6000|$|It {{seemed to}} young Jolyon that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> saying: [...] "But, darling, it would ruin you!" [...] For {{he himself had}} {{experienced}} to the full the gnawing fear {{at the bottom of}} each woman's heart that she is a drag on the man she loves.|$|E
60|$|She glared malevolently {{at him and}} hobbled on. Several minutes afterward, {{coming back}} {{from a trip to}} where a squad of groaning {{patients}} was gathering spruce-boughs, Smoke saw the seeress entering Amos Wentworth's cabin and followed after her. At the door <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice, whimpering and pleading.|$|E
6000|$|Bathsheba said nothing; but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{distinctly}} <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> rhythmical pants, and the recurrent {{rustle of}} the sheaf beside her {{in response to}} her frightened pulsations. She descended the ladder, and, on second thoughts, he followed her. The darkness was now impenetrable by the sharpest vision. They both stood still at the bottom, side by side. Bathsheba appeared to think only of the weather--Oak thought only of her just then. At last he said-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She proved, however, but a poor substitute. The {{spirit was}} willing but the flesh was weak. She had neither that command of {{language}} nor of wind that had distinguished her rival. From his favourite {{seat at the}} bottom of the garden <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> at all, so he had his chair brought up into the conservatory. It was all right for him there so long as she continued to abuse him; but every now and again, just as he was getting comfortably settled down with his pipe and his newspaper, she would suddenly stop.|$|R
60|$|Prince Golden-rod {{had found}} it {{impossible}} to turn his back entirely upon her Majesty, for he was a gentleman with a really noble heart under his yellow cloak; so he {{was among the first to}} see, admire, and love the modest faithful flower who grew so near him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not help <b>hearing</b> <b>her</b> words of comfort or reproof to those who came to her for advice. He saw the daily acts of charity which no one else discovered; he knew how many trials came to her, and how bravely she bore them; how humbly she asked help, and how sweetly she confessed her shortcomings to the wise rock and the stately tree.|$|R
60|$|He came to {{the first}} landing. There he stood, {{scarcely}} breathing. Again, corresponding to the door below, there was a door again. That would be the mother's room. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> moving about in the candlelight. She would be expecting her husband to come up. He looked along the dark landing.|$|E
60|$|His manner seemed, to her quick apprehension, {{instantly}} to stiffen. Nevertheless, he was expectant. He {{was willing}} to go through a good deal if only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice for once falter, if even her tone would lose its half-wearied, half-insolent note, if she would raise her eyes and speak to him as woman to man.|$|E
60|$|With a {{shock of}} dismay so abrupt and {{overwhelming}} {{that it was like}} a physical injury, George became aware that something was wrong. Even as he gripped her, Maud had stiffened with a sharp cry; and now she was struggling, trying to wrench herself free. She broke away from him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breathing hard.|$|E
6000|$|There was a faint {{stir in the}} hammock, but no answer. He {{stood over}} her, but even then <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not see her face; he only, {{had a sense of}} {{something}} breathing and alive within a yard of him--of something warm and soft. He whispered again, [...] "Antonia!" [...] but again there came no answer, and a sort of fear and frenzy seized on him. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> no longer <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> breathe; the creaking of the branch had ceased. What was passing in that silent, living creature there so close? And then he heard again the sound of breathing, quick and scared, like the fluttering of a bird; in a moment he was staring in the dark at an empty hammock.|$|R
6000|$|And Kate {{meanwhile}} {{had her own}} views. And {{when all}} the good-byes were over, and she sat by {{the window of the}} railway carriage, watching the fields rush by, reduced to silence, because [...] "Papa" [...] had told <b>her</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice, and had made a peremptory sign to her when she screamed her loudest, and caused their fellow- travellers to look up amazed, she wove a web in her brain something like this:- [...] "I know what my aunts will be like: they will be just like ladies in a book. They will be dreadfully fashionable! Let me see--Aunt Barbara will have a turban on her head, and a bird of paradise, like the bad old lady in Armyn's book that Mary took away from me; and they will do nothing all day long but try on flounced gowns, and count their jewels, and go out to balls and operas--and they will want me to do the same--and play at cards all Sunday! 'Lady Caergwent,' they will say, 'it is becoming to your position!' And then the young countess presented a remarkable contrast in her ingenuous simplicity," [...] continued Kate, not quite knowing whether she was making a story or thinking of herself--for indeed she did not feel as if she were herself, but somebody in a story. [...] "Her waving hair was only confined by an azure ribbon, (Kate loved a fine word when Charlie did not hear it to laugh at her;) and her dress was of the simplest muslin, with one diamond aigrette of priceless value!" ...|$|R
6000|$|This last exclamation was wrung from Jeekie's lips by {{a sudden}} {{development}} of [...] "forces of Nature" [...] which astonished even him. Instead of a silver lining the [...] "black chap" [...] exhibited one of gold. In an instant it seemed to turn to acres of flame; {{it was as though}} the heavens had taken fire. A flash or a thunderbolt struck the water within ten yards of their canoe, causing the boatmen to throw themselves upon their faces through shock or terror. Then came the hurricane, which fortunately was so strong that it permitted no more rain to fall. The tall reeds were beaten flat beneath its breath; the canoe was seized in its grip and whirled round and round, then driven forward like an arrow. Only the weight of the men and the water in it prevented it from oversetting. Dense darkness fell upon them and although they could see no star, they knew that it must be night. On they rushed, driven by that shrieking gale, and all about and around them this wall of darkness. No one spoke, for hope was abandoned, and if they had, their voices could not have been heard. The last thing that Alan remembered was feeling Jeekie dragging a grass mat over him to protect him a little if <b>he</b> <b>could.</b> Then his senses wavered, as does a dying lamp. He thought that he was back in what Jeekie had rudely called [...] "City bucket shop," [...] bargaining across the telephone wire, upon which came all the sounds of the infernal regions, with a financial paper for an article on a Little Bonsa Syndicate that he proposed to float. He thought he was in The Court woods with Barbara, only the birds in the trees sang so unnaturally loud that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>hear</b> <b>her</b> voice, and she wore Little Bonsa on her head as a bonnet. Then she departed in flame, leaving him and Death alone.|$|R
