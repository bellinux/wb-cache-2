500|$|Carey's {{performance}} was recorded on March 16, 1992 at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, New York. The show featured {{a number of}} musicians, back-up vocalists and just a crew of ten, for filming and recording. Directed by Larry Jordan, who previously worked with Carey on the music video for [...] "Someday". Dana Jon Chapelle {{was chosen as the}} sound mixer, having worked with Carey on her previous two studio albums. The show began with the song [...] "Emotions" [...] Carey entered the studio dressed in a black jacket and matching pants and boots. Prior to the song's studio introduction, Carey opened the song with an impromptu gospel and a cappella number, eventually leading to the song's chorus led by David Cole. After the song, Carey introduced the band and staff; to her left was a four-piece string section with Belinda Whitney Barnett, Cecilia Hobbs-Gardner, Wince Garvey and Laura Corcos, while San Shea played the harpsichord and harmonium. The show's rhythm section was led by Gigi Conway on the drums, Randy Jackson on bass, Vernon Black on guitar, and Sammy Figueroa and Ren Klyce, both percussionists. Additionally, Carey had ten background singers on stage, led by Trey Lorenz and Patrique McMillan. The next song on the set-list was [...] "If It's Over", a collaboration with Carole King. Walter Afanasieff replaced Cole on the piano, during which time a set of five male musicians were brought on stage. They were Lew Delgado, baritone saxophone; Lenny Pickett, tenor saxophone; George Young, alto saxophone; Earl Gardner, trumpet; and Steve Turre, trombone. They had been present during Carey's live performance of the song on Saturday Night Live a few months prior. As Carey introduced the song, she said [...] "this next song I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King", beginning the performance shortly after. For [...] "Someday", Cole returned to the stage, replacing Afanasieff on the keyboard. During the song, Carey would often place <b>her</b> <b>index</b> <b>finger</b> over her left ear, especially while using the whistle register. She later explained to the audience that it would help her in hearing herself more precisely, something needed to properly execute a higher ranged note. Once again, as Carey began [...] "Vision of Love", her [...] "first single ever", Afansieff swapped positions with Cole. The performance varied heavily from the studio version, as it was more low key and only used voices in a cappella form, without any heavy instrumentation. Prior to beginning the fifth song on the set-list, [...] "Make It Happen", Afanasieff shared the organ with Cole, playing the bass while the latter handled the treble. After the song began, the back-up began [...] "piling their vocals" [...] over Carey's, according to author Chris Nickson, and allowed the song to attain a more [...] "churchy feel". He felt the song was superior to the studio version, due to its stripped performance and vocals: ...|$|E
