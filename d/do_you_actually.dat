[...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] was written about the feelings a club's environment can lead one to believe. Cyrus depicted the club scene to be very sexy, which she thought was primarily composed by the music playing and intense lighting, and thought that it might trigger fake emotions with the person one is dancing with.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} individual trade union membership on vacation leave, we use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The SOEP is a nationally representative survey conducted each year since 1984 with about 20, 000 participants belonging to approximately 11, 000 households in recent waves. 6 The (retrospective) question on vacation days has been asked from 1985 to 1990, {{as well as in}} the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 and reads as follows: “How many days of vacation <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> take last year?”. 7 Accordingly, the SOEP provides data on paid vacation from 1984 to 1989 and for the years 1999, 2004 and 2009. Information on individual trade union membership is available for 1985, 1989, 1993, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2011. Table  5 in the Appendix summarises this temporal aspect of the data.|$|R

40|$|How do we {{navigate}} {{a deeply}} structured world? Why are you reading this sentence first – and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> {{look at the}} fifth word? This review offers some answers by appealing to active inference based on deep temporal models. It builds on previous formulations of active inference to simulate behavioural and electrophysiological responses under hierarchical generative models of state transitions. Inverting these models corresponds to sequential inference, such that the state at any hierarchical level entails a sequence of transitions in the level below. The deep temporal aspect of these models means that evidence is accumulated over nested time scales, enabling inferences about narratives (i. e., temporal scenes). We illustrate this behaviour with Bayesian belief updating – and neuronal process theories – to simulate the epistemic foraging seen in reading. These simulations reproduce perisaccadic delay period activity and local field potentials seen empirically. Finally, we exploit the deep structure of these models to simulate responses to local (e. g., font type) and global (e. g., semantic) violations; reproducing mismatch negativity and P 300 responses respectively...|$|R

Hewitt also revealed that he consciously {{made a decision to}} write about experiences outside the personal nature prevalent on the debut album, saying [...] "it's a difficult thing to do and a huge departure mentally and it's something I find exciting. There are still personal songs on the record, but it's more about the human condition rather than what's being inflicted by others". Closing track [...] "Oh God" [...] was written by Hewitt as a reaction to the shock of hearing the news of the death of his friend Stuart Cable in 2010. [...] "Modern War Song" [...] deals with the subject of Western imperialism and how [...] "revolting soldiers are treated when their service finishes after signing up and fighting for their country".

5000|$|Paulo Coelho {{was born}} in Brazil and {{attended}} a Jesuit school. As a teenager, Coelho {{wanted to become a}} writer. Upon telling his mother this, she responded, [...] "My dear, your father is an engineer. He's a logical, reasonable man with a very clear vision of the world. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> {{know what it means to}} be a writer?" [...] At 17, Coelho's introversion and opposition to following a traditional path led to his parents committing him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20. Born into a Catholic family, his parents were strict about the religion and faith. Coelho later remarked that [...] "It wasn't that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn't know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me."At his parents' wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, traveling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using drugs in the 1960s. Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs. In 1974, Coelho was arrested for [...] "subversive" [...] activities by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous. Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist, and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.|$|E

5000|$|Early February 2011: Decided to make {{an album}} {{inspired}} by the Japanese post-war economic miracle. While searching for more information I found an old photo of the Mihama nuclear plant. The fact that this futuristic-looking plant was situated in such a beautiful spot {{so close to the}} sea made me curious. Are they safe when it comes to earthquakes and tsunamis? Further reading revealed that many of these plants are situated in earthquake-prone areas, some of them are even located next to shores that had been hit in the past by tsunamis.A photo of Mihama made me narrow down my focus only to Japanese nuclear plants. I wanted to make a soundtrack to some of them, concentrating on the architecture, design and localizations, but also questioning the potential radiation danger (a cooling system being destroyed by a landslide or earthquake, etc). As the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said: [...] "the plants were so well designed that 'such a situation is practically impossible'.The album was finished on February 13th. On March 17th I received the following message from a Facebook friend: 'Geir, some time ago you asked people for a photo of a Japanese nuclear powerplant.
