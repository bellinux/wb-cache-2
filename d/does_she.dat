5|$|Zoe Tapper as Dr. Anya Raczynski. Anya was {{a doctor}} in a busy city {{hospital}} when the virus struck and watched hundreds of patients die of the virus, including her friend and lover Patricia Kelly, and Patricia's flatmate Jenny Walsh. After treating a badly wounded Tom on the road, she joins the group. She privately discloses that, {{in the face of}} the pandemic, her faith in practicing medicine was deeply shaken, and she had initially sought to kill herself. Only later <b>does</b> <b>she</b> regain her confidence to successfully deliver a breech birth infant.|$|E
5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally <b>does,</b> <b>she</b> answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E
5|$|When Locke {{leaves the}} island to bring the {{survivors}} back to the island, Ben tracks him down. He gets Locke to reveal what he knows about returning to the island, then kills him and stages it as a suicide. Ben visits Jack in the funeral home housing Locke's body, telling Jack he will help him return to the island, {{but the only way}} to get back is to bring everyone who had left it, including Locke's corpse. Ben boards Ajira Airways Flight 316 with the rest of survivors, which then crashes on the island. Jack, Kate, Hurley, and Sayid are transported to 1977, while Sun and Ben remain in 2007 with a resurrected Locke. The plane crash lands on the Hydra Island, so Ben attempts to take a boat to the main island. Sun strikes him in the back of the head and takes the boat with Frank, so Ben is left in the care of the other survivors, including Locke. After Ben regains consciousness and finds Locke to be alive, he convinces Locke he knew bringing him to the island would resurrect him, and he stopped Locke's suicide attempt merely to gain information. Locke travels with Ben, who is to be judged by the Monster. After they fail to find the Monster at the Barracks, they head to the Temple. As Ben and Locke travel through a series of tunnels beneath the Temple, Ben falls through the floor, so Locke leaves to get something that he can pull him up with. The Monster flows out of a grate below and surrounds Ben, showing flashes of decisions he made in his life involving Alex. The Monster takes the form of Alex and pushes Ben against a wall. She says she knows Ben is planning to kill Locke again, and if he <b>does</b> <b>she</b> will hunt him down and destroy him. She orders him to follow Locke and do whatever he asks, then disappears. They return to the Others' camp, where Locke gathers the group together and announces he is taking them to see Jacob. As they are walking, Ben relates his experience with the Monster and his promise to do whatever Locke asks, so Locke convinces Ben to kill Jacob. Richard leads them to the base of the statue, where Jacob lives. Within, they are met by Jacob (Mark Pellegrino). Jacob greets Locke and observes Locke has found a loophole. It is revealed that Locke was not resurrected, and is instead the Monster taking the form of Locke. Ben confronts Jacob about why he never revealed himself at any time during Ben's tenure as leader, but when Jacob is dismissive towards him, he stabs Jacob twice, killing him - and in doing so, binds his destiny to the island, sealing his own fate.|$|E
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>did</b> not groan, <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not fall, [...] <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not shed a tear, [...] Nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> cry, 'Oh! mother, why [...] May I {{not enter}} here?' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Golden was a {{mistress}} of graceful forgetting. Almost never <b>did</b> <b>she</b> remember to <b>do</b> anything <b>she</b> didn't want to <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not lie about it; she really and quite beautifully did forget.|$|R
6000|$|... "What I {{should like}} to know is this: <b>did</b> <b>she</b> or <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not tell Lady Ongar what she was to do--about you, I mean? I dare say <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> after all." ...|$|R
25|$|ARMITAGE: It — It's perfect. This is {{what she}} <b>does</b> <b>she</b> is a WMD analyst out there.|$|E
25|$|Another {{friend of}} Alice. She also harasses Lain, {{but not as}} {{severely}} as Reika <b>does.</b> <b>She</b> is sometimes insensitive to other people's feelings.|$|E
25|$|Emin {{does not}} overtly {{appear as a}} feminist artist, nor <b>does</b> <b>she</b> believe so herself. In an {{interview}} with Schirn Kunsthalle Frankfurt, Emin stated {{that she is a}} feminist, but not a feminist artist.|$|E
6000|$|VALENTINE (rising in {{the wildest}} agitation). What! What! (Beginning to speak very fast.) When <b>did</b> <b>she</b> say that? Who <b>did</b> <b>she</b> say that to? ...|$|R
6000|$|Who was <b>she?</b> What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> want? Whence <b>did</b> <b>she</b> come? What was {{the horror}} she {{revealed}} to {{the night in the}} bower of Christabel? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she--what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> say? How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> bear it?" [...] asked Jean, {{feeling in}} her own woman's heart how deeply Lucia's must have been wounded by that avowal.|$|R
25|$|Word {{order in}} questions: Why they ain't growing? ("Why aren't they growing?") and Who the hell she think she is? ("Who the hell <b>does</b> <b>she</b> think she is?") lack the {{inversion}} {{of most other}} forms of English. Because of this, {{there is also no}} need for the auxiliary DO.|$|E
25|$|Honesty differs {{greatly from}} Jaya's two {{previous}} major albums {{released in the}} Philippines, 1996's Jaya and 1997's In the Raw. Though, as before, Honesty contains mostly passionate, easy-listening love songs, this time out her approach is more intimate. She doesn't add many soulful flourishes as before, nor <b>does</b> <b>she</b> allow herself to soar passionately to the heavens, which she often did on her previous albums.|$|E
25|$|Not {{until he}} is injured in a horseback riding {{accident}} that seriously cripples him <b>does</b> <b>she</b> return to his side, willing to forgive but still finding difficulty in coping with his extramarital affairs. Eventually Linda is diagnosed with emphysema, and as she prepares them both for her impending death, she introduces him to her decorator and estate advisor, {{in an attempt to}} give Cole a new partner once she's gone. The match is successful.|$|E
6000|$|Quoth Christabel, So let it be! [...] 235 [...] And as {{the lady}} bade, <b>did</b> <b>she.</b> [...] Her gentle limbs <b>did</b> <b>she</b> undress, [...] And {{lay down in}} her loveliness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what {{on earth}} <b>did</b> <b>she</b> expect? She didn't think {{to have it all}} sunshine, <b>did</b> <b>she?</b> When she married the man, she knew she didn't care for him; and now she determines to leave him because he won't pick up her pocket-handkerchief! If she wanted that kind of thing, why <b>did</b> not <b>she</b> marry my nephew?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Quoth Christabel, [...] "So let it be!" [...] 235 [...] And as {{the lady}} bade, <b>did</b> <b>she.</b> [...] Her gentle limbs <b>did</b> <b>she</b> undress, [...] And {{lay down in}} her loveliness.|$|R
25|$|She is {{the title}} {{character}} of Alan Gordon's mystery novel, The Widow of Jerusalem (2003), which paints a more sympathetic portrait of her marriage to Conrad. She is introduced as a spoilt, vain young woman, but she matures {{in the course of}} the story. Only when it is too late <b>does</b> <b>she</b> realise that her husband loves her. His murder, and the later death of Henry, are investigated by the hero, the fool Theophilos (Feste).|$|E
25|$|At the betrothal {{celebrations}} Nikiya {{performs a}} somber dance while playing her veena. She is then given {{a basket of}} flowers which she believes are from Solor, and begins a frenzied and joyous dance. Little <b>does</b> <b>she</b> know that the basket is from Gamzatti, who has concealed beneath the flowers a venomous snake. The bayadère then holds the basket too close and the serpent bites her on the neck. The High Brahmin offers Nikiya {{an antidote to the}} poison, but she chooses death rather than life without her beloved Solor.|$|E
25|$|Originally from Czechoslovakia, she was {{stripped}} of her citizenship when, in 1975 at age 18, she asked the United States for political asylum and was granted temporary residency. At the time, Navratilova {{was told by the}} Czechoslovak Sports Federation that she was becoming too Americanised, and she should go back to school and make tennis secondary. Navratilova became a US citizen in 1981, and on January 9, 2008, she reacquired Czech citizenship. She stated she has not renounced her U.S. citizenship nor <b>does</b> <b>she</b> plan to do so, and that reclaiming Czech nationality was not politically motivated.|$|E
6000|$|What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> mean? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> mean? [...] 180 [...] For {{with a smile}} she cried: [...] 'Unblest ye {{shall not}} pass my door, [...] The bride-groom and his bride.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall see!" [...] {{she cried}} fiercely. [...] "You can't frighten me! If {{the paper is}} of no value, why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> steal it, why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> carry it sewn in her clothes? If you--" ...|$|R
6000|$|Again; {{whenever}} {{our conversation}} turned on Clara, if I began by describing her kindness, her gentleness and goodness, her simple winning manners--I {{was sure to}} be led insensibly into a digression about her height, figure, complexion, and style of dress. The latter subject especially interested Margaret; she could question me on it, over and over again. What was Clara's usual morning dress? How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> wear her hair? What was her evening dress? Did she make a difference between a dinner party and a ball? What colours <b>did</b> <b>she</b> prefer? What dressmaker <b>did</b> <b>she</b> employ? Did she wear much jewellery? Which <b>did</b> <b>she</b> like best in her hair, and which were most fashionable, flowers or pearls? How many new dresses <b>did</b> <b>she</b> have in a year; and was there more than one maid especially to attend on her? ...|$|R
25|$|Once {{she started}} experimenting with the gum-bichromate process, Hahn started {{stitching}} into her photographs. Printing onto canvas and other fabrics {{allowed her to}} use thread to highlight {{certain aspects of the}} photograph. In combining her photographs with conventional practices, Hahn successfully intertwines formal and conceptual aspects. Not only <b>does</b> <b>she</b> speak to the mundane tasks of everyday life, but also about routine and normativity. In highlighting the ordinary in her work, Hahn elevates and revives that which has been lost in the practice of daily life. Embroidery references femininity, as Hahn underlines the feminist issue of the anonymity of women's handicraft. Her embroidery often emphasized flowers with its three-dimensionality, furthering the idea of femininity; she later on pursued this as a symbol and incorporated it in several of her other series.|$|E
25|$|On 1 February 2008, Clare {{returns to}} Albert Square; she is thrown {{from the back}} seat of a car. Nigel's former landlady, Dot Branning, persuades her to stay. Clare moves in with Dot and gets a job as {{receptionist}} at Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner)'s beauty parlour. Preferring rich men, Clare tries to attract the attention of the wealthy men in Albert Square. Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and his brother Max (Jake Wood) show no interest; however, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt) is more susceptible despite being married to Jane (Laurie Brett). Clare flirts with Ian, wears revealing clothes and talks suggestively but she is playing a game and has no intention of taking things further, acting shocked when Ian suggests that she <b>does.</b> <b>She</b> blackmails Ian, threatening to inform Jane of his dishonourable intentions unless he pays to keep quiet but Ian tells Jane himself so she confronts Clare, warning her to stay away from Ian.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{inspired}} by observing white children {{pretending to be}} ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the Ku Klux Klan. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a freedman and soldier {{who is now a}} captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he <b>does,</b> <b>she</b> leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and lynches him.|$|E
50|$|Hayden Carruth {{wrote about}} The Everyday Uncommon: “It’s {{clear to me}} that she knows what <b>she’s</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>she’s</b> <b>doing</b> what <b>she</b> wants to <b>do,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>does</b> it well.” The book has also {{received}} critical praise from Rhina Espaillat, R. S. Gwynn, David Mason, and Deborah Warren, among others.|$|R
6000|$|... "But before I go," [...] I said, [...] "tell me this: Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> {{not send}} me some word from Lisbon? Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> not give Captain Stearns {{a line on}} a piece of paper or some message?" ...|$|R
60|$|When Osborne {{heard that}} his friend had found her, he made hot and anxious {{inquiries}} regarding the poor child. How was <b>she?</b> How <b>did</b> <b>she</b> look? What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> say? His comrade took his hand, and {{looked him in}} the face.|$|R
25|$|A drunken Raoul {{is sitting}} alone in a forlorn bar, contemplating the {{evolution}} {{of his relationship with}} Christine ("Why <b>Does</b> <b>She</b> Love Me?"). Meg enters and warns him that New York isn't a suitable place for his family, and she urges them to abandon Christine's performance contract and leave that night. Raoul refuses, citing their need for the money; he boasts that he is not afraid of the Phantom, unaware that his rival has since slipped in and replaced the barman behind the counter. When Meg leaves, the Phantom confronts Raoul and intimidates him with veiled remarks that cause him to question his paternity of Gustave. The Phantom also offers Raoul a bet: if Christine fails to perform tonight, the Phantom will pay off all their debts and allow them to leave together, but if she sings the aria he has written for her, Raoul must go back to France alone. Raoul accepts the Phantom's dare and then experiences a moment of panic at what he has done ("Devil Take The Hindmost").|$|E
25|$|Robin's mother {{comes back}} on a leave from her spy duties to help care for Robin until {{the birth of her}} grandchild. Patrick realizes what Robin and this baby truly mean to him and knows that he wants them to be a family {{in every sense of the}} word, but Robin still has concerns. Although Robin states that Patrick could see his child as much as he wants, she does not believe he is fully {{committed}} or prepared to give up his bachelorhood for a family. He takes her to court and only after his moving testimony <b>does</b> <b>she</b> realize Patrick truly wants this, her and their child, their family. They wait for their baby as a happy, loving committed couple. On August 12, 2008, Patrick and Robin learn their baby is a girl. As Patrick goes into full panicked father mode, Robin tries to calm him down. Later, when Patrick sees Robin with Jason, he expresses his concern that he does not want his child to be around such a dangerous target and Robin agrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{a gloomy}} bar, Raoul contemplates his {{relationship}} with Christine. He is joined by Meg, who tells him she swims each day to wash away the stress of working. She tells Raoul that he must leave with Christine and Gustave and {{runs out of the}} bar ("Why <b>Does</b> <b>She</b> Love Me?"). Raoul says he is not afraid of the Phantom. Suddenly, the Phantom reveals himself to Raoul and they make a bet that if Christine sings, the Phantom wins and if she doesn't, Raoul wins. If Raoul wins the bet, the Phantom will pay his debts and Raoul can leave with Christine and Gustave. However, if The Phantom wins, Christine and Gustave will remain in America with him and Raoul must return to Paris alone. The Phantom also leads Raoul to question Gustave's paternity ("Devil Take the Hindmost"). Fleck, Squelch and Gangle appear to advertise Christine's appearance at Phantasma ("Invitation to the Concert"). That night, Meg performs a strip-tease about her choice of swimming costumes ("Bathing Beauty"). She successfully impresses the audience, but Madame Giry reveals to Meg that the Phantom did not watch the performance, saying it was for nothing ("Mother, Did You Watch?").|$|E
6000|$|What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> Was <b>she</b> {{grateful}} {{to me for}} my plain speaking? Did she ponder upon my words and determine to profit by them and to lead from that hour a better and nobler life? ...|$|R
6000|$|What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> mean?--what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> expect?--what <b>did</b> <b>she</b> {{think of}} <b>doing?</b> <b>She</b> must be {{got rid of}} before Kelly's arrival, and yet he found himself {{wavering}} under her potent and yet scarcely exerted influence. The desperation of weakness is apt to be more brutal than the determination of strength. He remembered why he had come upstairs, and blurted out: [...] "But you can't stay here. The rules are very stringent in regard to--to strangers like yourself. It will be known who you really are and what people say of you. Even your divorce will tell against you. It's all wrong, I know--but what can I do? I didn't make the rules. I am only a servant of the landlord, and must carry them out." ...|$|R
60|$|The haughty {{young lady}} also blushed. <b>She</b> <b>did</b> not often blush; when <b>she</b> <b>did,</b> <b>she</b> felt angry with herself.|$|R
