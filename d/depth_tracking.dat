40|$|The <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> {{issue of}} {{underactuated}} {{autonomous underwater vehicle}} (AUV) in vertical plane is addressed in this paper. Considering the complicated dynamics and kinematics model for underactuated AUV, a more simplified model is obtained based on assumptions. Then a nonlinear disturbance observer (NDO) is presented to estimate the external disturbance acting on AUV, and an adaptive terminal sliding mode control (ATSMC) based on NDO is applied to enhance the <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> performance of underactuated AUV considering {{both internal and external}} disturbance. Compared with the traditional sliding mode controller, the static error and chattering problem of the <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> process have been clearly improved by adopting NDO-based ATSMC. The stability of control system is proven to be guaranteed according to Lyapunov theory. In the end, simulation results imply that the proposed controller owns strong robustness and satisfied control effectiveness in comparison with the traditional controller...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Conventional optical {{coherence}} tomography (OCT) systems {{generally have}} a limited imaging range within a depth of only 1 - 2 mm and suffers from unwanted noise such as speckle, ghost or mirror noise. To overcome these limitations, we developed a motorized-stage-based OCT system with an extended imaging range, using a common-path Fourier-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (CP-FD-OCT) configuration. Using this OCT systems, OCT image was obtained from an onion, and their subsurface structure were observed. The result showed that the OCT images obtained using our motorized-stage-based system had a significantly extended imaging range due to its real-time accurate <b>depth</b> <b>tracking.</b> Consequently, the devised CP-FD-OCT systems and algorithms have good potential for the further development of endoscopic OCT for microsurgery.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} sophistication of both manned and unmanned systems for remote ocean exploration, {{a wealth of}} knowledge about heretofore-unknown oceanic processes has become available. However, no technologies currently exist to observe organisms and processes without disturbing them, as they move with the natural motion of the oceans.

40|$|Based on the {{attractive}} manifold design approach, a noncertainty-equivalent adaptive autopilot for the dive-plane control of submersibles, equipped with {{bow and stern}} hydroplanes, is developed. The parameters of the model are unknown and disturbance inputs {{are assumed to be}} present. The objective is to control the depth and pitch angle of the vehicle. For the vehicle in the presence of disturbance input and parameter uncertainties, it is shown that in the closed-loop system with σ-modification, the pitch angle and <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Also it is proven that for the disturbance-free submarine model with unknown parameters, precise asymptotic tracking of the reference trajectories is accomplished. Furthermore the control system accomplishes regulation of the system trajectories to a manifold, and asymptotically achieves the performance of a deterministic controller. Simulation results are presented which show that the submarine performs the specified dive-plane maneuvers in spite of large parameter uncertainties and random disturbance forces...|$|E
40|$|The {{technology}} of today, {{such as the}} Oculus Rift, can provide immersion {{in ways that were}} unachievable in the past. The Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset that allows the user to see the three-dimensional world without the use of a traditional monitor. Unlike television, computer and mobile screens, a virtual reality headset digitally transports the user into the environment. Functionality such as <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> and rotational head tracking provides immersion unlike anything experienced to date. My interest is to investigate interactive storytelling in combination with the Oculus Rift, to determine if virtual reality headsets can enrich storytelling experiences. This will be achieved by developing an application where interactive storytelling is compatible with the Oculus Rift, and testing that application with participants. Finally, a conclusion will be drawn from the data collected by participants. Alongside the written thesis, a digital application will be produced in Unreal Engine 4 (Video game engine). The application will be an Oculus Rift driven experience, meaning that users can only experience it through an Oculus Rift. The application will have an interactive plot, which allows the user to influence the storyline. The design will be iterative and will be refined after each user testing session. The application hopes to strengthen the theories and concepts found in the written section of the thesis...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{treats the}} {{question}} of suboptimal dive plane control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) using the state-dependent Riccati equation (SDRE) technique. The SDRE method provides an effective mean of designing nonlinear control systems for minimum as well as nonminimum phase AUV models. It is assumed that the hydrodynamic parameters of the nonlinear vehicle model are imprecisely known, {{and in order to}} obtain a practical design, a hard constraint on control fin deflection is imposed. The problem of depth control is treated as a robust nonlinear output (depth) regulation problem with constant disturbance and reference exogenous signals. As such an internal model of first-order fed by the tracking error is constructed. A quadratic performance index is chosen for optimization and the algebraic Riccati equation is solved to obtain a suboptimal control law for the model with unconstrained input. For the design of model with fin angle constraints, a slack variable is introduced to transform the constrained control input problem into an unconstrained problem, and a suboptimal control law is designed for the augmented system using a modified performance index. Using the center manifold theorem, it is shown that in the closed-loop system, the system trajectories are regulated to a manifold (called output zeroing manifold) on which the <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> error is zero and the equilibrium state is asymptotically stable. Simulation results are presented which show that effective depth control is accomplished in spite of the uncertainties in the system parameters and control fin deflection constraints...|$|E
40|$|A visual {{tracking}} {{system is essential}} {{as a basis for}} visual servoing, autonomous navigation, path planning, robot-human interaction and other robotic functions. To execute various tasks in diverse and ever-changing environments, a mobile robot requires high levels of robustness, precision, environmental adaptability and real-time performance of the visual {{tracking system}}. In keeping with the application characteristics of our amphibious spherical robot, which was proposed for flexible and economical underwater exploration in 2012, an improved RGB-D visual tracking algorithm is proposed and implemented. Given the limited power source and computational capabilities of mobile robots, compressive tracking (CT), which is the effective and efficient algorithm that was proposed in 2012, was selected as the basis of the proposed algorithm to process colour images. A Kalman filter with a second-order motion model was implemented to predict the state of the target and select candidate patches or samples for the CT tracker. In addition, a variance ratio features shift (VR-V) tracker with a Kalman estimation mechanism was used to process depth images. Using a feedback strategy, the <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> results were used to assist the CT tracker in updating classifier parameters at an adaptive rate. In this way, most of the deficiencies of CT, including drift and poor robustness to occlusion and high-speed target motion, were partly solved. To evaluate the proposed algorithm, a Microsoft Kinect sensor, which combines colour and infrared depth cameras, was adopted for use in a prototype of the robotic tracking system. The experimental results with various image sequences demonstrated the effectiveness, robustness and real-time performance of the tracking system...|$|E
40|$|The vastly {{increasing}} {{computing power}} {{combined with the}} camera, touchscreen, and {{a wide variety of}} sensors make smartphones and tablets a perfect platform for Augmented Reality (AR). Current AR applications are targeted at displaying interactive virtual objects, but do not provide the interface for creating or editing them. This project examined the feasibility and usability of using a mobile device for creating virtual 3 D models in AR itself. In this project the user input is provided by tracking the position of colored markers. Interpreting the tracking based input proved to be challenging {{because of a lack of}} state information, imprecise <b>depth</b> <b>tracking</b> and (partial) occlusion of the markers. These problems were addressed during this project. The concept of the virtual grid was introduced to guide the user input and ease the drawing process. An early feasibility study proved the feasibility of constructing simple 3 D objects in augmented reality using a 3 D tracking input device. Participants liked the concept of using a tracked marker, but had troubles using it. As a result the prototype was altered to address these issues. A more formal evaluation was held to evaluate both the improved concepts and to get a better understanding of the influence of the virtual grid. During this evaluation, the results used to determine the usability improved from bad towards very positive when the virtual grid was used. The ratings of the drawings created with the virtual grid are between 'Good' and 'Very Good', while this was not the case when the virtual grid was not functional. Both a tablet and a smartphone proved to be suitable devices for an AR drawing application. The differences between the devices were small and mostly not significant. The trend is that a smartphone scores slightly better in terms of ergonomics while a tablet provides a slightly better usability...|$|E
