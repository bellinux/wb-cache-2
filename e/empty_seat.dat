Gillibrand was required to run in a special election in 2010 for the permanent position, which she won with 63% of the vote. She was re-elected to a full six-year term in 2012 with 72% of the vote, the highest margin for any statewide candidate in New York.|$|E

25|$|Sometime {{between the}} 2nd century BC and the 1st century AD, the first {{anthropomorphic}} {{representations of the}} Buddha were developed.

500|$|Through this passage, Bryan {{maintained}} {{the contrast between}} the common man and the city-dwelling elite. It was clear to listeners as he worked his way through the comparisons that he would refer to the farmer, and when he did, the hall exploded with sound. His sympathetic comparison contrasted the hardworking farmer with the city businessman, whom Bryan cast as a gambler. The galleries were filled with white as spectators waved handkerchiefs, and it was several minutes before he could continue. The police in the convention hall, not sharing the enthusiasm for silver, were described by the press (some of whose members were caught up in the frenzy) as standing as if they thought the audience was about to turn on them. When Bryan resumed, his comparison of miner with miser again electrified the audience; the uproar prevented him from continuing for several minutes. One farmer in the gallery had been about to leave rather than listen to Bryan, whom he deemed a Populist; he had been persuaded to stay. At Bryan's words, he threw his hat into the air, slapped the <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> in front of him with his coat, and shouted, [...] "My God! My God! My God!" ...|$|E

In [...] "The Cost of Living", Eko awakens to find Yemi in his tent, telling him he needs to confess before finding [...] his tent is on fire. Searching for Yemi, he soon decides to follow Locke, Desmond, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews), Nikki and Paulo (Kiele Sanchez, and Rodrigo Santoro) to the Pearl station. While waiting outside, he sees Yemi again, and follows the {{apparition}} to give his confession. Upon learning it is merely a deception, Eko grows angry and chases Yemi into the jungle, where he confronts the [...] "Monster". After being thrown about by the Monster, Eko is finally thrown to the ground. Fatally wounded, he whispers [...] "I saw the Devil" [...] to Locke before dying, although Locke, for whatever reason, decides to tell Sayid he said, [...] "We're next." [...] As he dies, we see an image of Eko and Yemi as happy children, walking into the distance.

2500|$|The prose {{cycles of}} the 13th century, the Lancelot-Grail cycle and the Post-Vulgate Cycle, further adapt the chivalric {{attributes}} of the Round Table.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{explores the}} correlation between <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> for the Swedish Democrats in Swedish municipality councils, during the 2010 - 2014 length of office. First I investigate why these <b>seats</b> are left <b>empty</b> and {{show that they are}} almost exclusively due to the withdrawals from the seat rather than the seats not being filled to begin with. Based on previous research on withdrawals from council seats I draw four hypotheses. These are tested to investigate the relationship between the seats by using linear regression alongside with a multiple linear regression including all the explanatory variables. The only significant correlation in the analysis concerns the commissioners’ stance to immigration and its consequences. A leadership of coalition has the strongest correlation between <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> in the municipality, although not significant, increasing the share of <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> caused by withdrawals from the Swedish democrats compared to where there wasn’t a leadership of coalition. ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{working all}} day, Parks boarded the Cleveland Avenue bus, a General Motors Old Look bus {{belonging}} to the Montgomery City Lines, around 6p.m., Thursday, December 1, 1955, in downtown Montgomery. She paid her fare and sat in an <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> {{in the first row}} of back seats reserved for blacks in the [...] "colored" [...] section. Near the middle of the bus, her row was directly behind the ten seats reserved for white passengers. Initially, she did not notice that the bus driver was the same man, James F. Blake, who had left her in the rain in 1943. As the bus traveled along its regular route, all of the white-only seats in the bus filled up. The bus reached the third stop in front of the Empire Theater, and several white passengers boarded.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} narrates the awkwardness {{that takes place}} between two people after they break up. Chris Willman of Yahoo!

[...] In a {{different}} perspective, Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly considered these couplets from the song, ("I used to know my place was the spot next to you / Now I’m searching the room for an <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> / ‘Cause lately I don’t even know what page you’re on"), {{as one of the}} best couplets from Speak Now sheet.

2500|$|During the Second World War, many {{professional}} musicians enlisted {{and served}} in military bands. As a result, there were occasional openings in established commercial bands. Thus, at just 18 years of age, Hambro auditioned for an <b>empty</b> <b>seat</b> in Gene Krupa's band. His audition included playing [...] "American Bolero", a piece written in 5/4 time, a complex meter that was quite progressive in Western music at the time. Although initially skeptical, Krupa and trumpeter Roy Eldridge were impressed and called Hambro at home {{the next day to}} tell him that he had secured the job and to schedule him for a tuxedo fitting. On October28,1942, two weeks after his 19th birthday, Hambro was on stage with the Gene Krupa Band at the Times Square Paramount Theater. However, he left the band in December of that year for the Army and joined Ivan Mogul, Shorty Rogers and approximately 40 other musicians from the Bronx who had agreed to man the 379th Army Service Forces (ASF) Band in Newport News, Virginia, where he stayed for three years. From 1946 to 1947, Hambro was a featured soloist with Billy Butterfield and his orchestra. In 1947, he played with Bobby Byrne before rejoining Gene Krupa as lead alto sax and featured jazz soloist through 1950. (Hambro, along with tenor saxophonist Buddy Wise and trombonist Frank Rosolino, is featured in a 15-minute film short, Deep Purple, directed by Will Cowan in 1949, which focused on Gene Krupa and His Orchestra.) In addition to playing with Krupa, Hambro simultaneously played in other bands, including the Latin jazz ensembles of Vincent Lopez and Pupi Campo. In 1948, Hambro toured with Machito and his Afro-Cuban Orchestra where he was featured as a soloist on alto sax. From 1951 to 1952, Hambro played with and managed the Ray McKinley Band. From 1951 to 1954, he also played and recorded with Chico O'Farrill's orchestra, with a year off (1952) to tour with The Gene Krupa Orchestra. From 1948 until 1954, he recorded with all of these artists as well as with Charlie Ventura's orchestra and Joe Loco's band. During this period (1951–1956), Hambro also accompanied vocalists at the Paramount Theater, did studio work, worked as a music copyist, and taught private lessons. He continued to hone his own skills by studying clarinet with Leon Russianoff and flute with Henry Zlotnick, both of the Manhattan School of Music.|$|E

2500|$|According to the Beijing Olympic Organising Committee (BOCOG), the 6.8million {{tickets to}} the Games were sold out. The {{prevalence}} of <b>empty</b> <b>seats</b> at many events caused journalists and visitors to be suspicious about these claims. Beijing Olympic organisers {{were said to have}} given some 2.7million tickets to officials and corporate sponsors, many of whom did not attend the events. A mainland journal suggested that the day-tickets without right of re-entry was also part of the problem. In one instance, people in the audience left the stadium after the Chinese women's volleyball match, but they were not allowed back when they found out there was another game. A senior BOCOG official expressed concern about the <b>empty</b> <b>seats,</b> saying that the hot, humid weather could have caused the poor turnout.
