[...] Eventually, the school outgrew its facilities in Savage and was moved to Fort Snelling. [...] Fort Snelling itself served a major role as a reception center for newly drafted recruits after the Selective Service Act was passed in 1940. [...] New recruits were given a physical exam and the Army General Qualification Test to determine their fitness for service in a particular branch.

[...] Recruits were also issued uniforms and sent from the fort to other training centers. [...] Over 300,000 recruits were processed through Fort Snelling during the World War II years.|$|E

Various other problems, nature of these problems, sources of these problems and some pedagogical suggestion to overcome these problems are also some of the central topics of discussion in the paper...|$|R
