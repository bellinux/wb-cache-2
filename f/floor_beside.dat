5|$|Black {{and several}} former colleagues of his from the Federal Bureau of Investigation decide to taunt the killer into coming forward, giving {{a press release}} {{describing}} him as cowardly. A furious Dion calls the police to rebut this, betraying his identity. Police arrive at his home to arrest him, finding him sitting, covered in blood, on the kitchen <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> his mother's body. He is apprehended, clearing Malcom Hunziger of wrongdoing. Black and his family return home to Seattle. Black carries his daughter {{from the airport to}} their car, while Catherine waits to collect their luggage. The man who had helped Dion stands to one side, watching the family. As Black returns to help Catherine with the suitcases, she has disappeared, leaving behind only an origami dove given to her by her mother.|$|E
5|$|Internally, {{the ground}} floor of the west wing housed the dining room, service areas and led through to the kitchen and bakehouse. The service area was fitted with a {{mezzanine}} floor to provide sleeping facilities for male servants; the sleeping quarters for female servants were {{on the top floor of}} the mansion to keep the two sexes a good distance away from each other. On the same level, the east wing had a study with ante-room set in the northwest corner, a boudoir, two drawing rooms and a billiard room. An expansive library, divided into sections by pillars, was between the boudoir and study, beside the large bay window. The first floor, accessed via the main staircase positioned within the entrance hall, had all the family bedrooms, and featured balconies. Hip baths were carried to the bedrooms each evening as no bathrooms were incorporated. Cubitt had furniture workshops in London where the majority of the mansion's furnishings and fittings were crafted from mahogany. Nurseries were on the top <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the female servant accommodation. Around thirty rooms made up the basement, among them a smoking room where editions of Punch and The Illustrated London News were supplied as reading material. The remaining rooms on the basement level were workshops, wine cellars and individual parlours for the butler, housekeeper and other principal servants, together with general storerooms.|$|E

One of the memorials is a large slate plate in the <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the pulpit to the memory of Hawker's first wife, Charlotte, who died in 1863. At the west end of the church is a 17th-century communion table. In the south aisle is the Hawker memorial window by Lavers and Westlake which was erected in 1904. It depicts Parson Hawker and his dog, the church and various other features associated with him.|$|E
25|$|On October 4, 1970, {{producer}} Paul Rothchild {{became concerned}} when Joplin {{failed to show}} up at Sunset Sound Recorders for a recording session. Full Tilt Boogie's road manager John Cooke drove to the Landmark Motor Hotel in Hollywood where Joplin was staying. He saw Joplin's psychedelically painted Porsche 356 C Cabriolet in the parking lot. Upon entering Joplin's room (#105), he found her dead on the <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> her bed. The official cause of death was a heroin overdose, possibly compounded by alcohol. Cooke believes Joplin had been given heroin that was much more potent than normal, as several of her dealer's other customers also overdosed that week.|$|E
25|$|Once the ore {{had been}} brought out of the mine {{it had to be}} {{separated}} from rock and other vein minerals (gangue). The surface survey found evidence of an early dressing <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the marsh on the valley floor, at 550metres AOD, where a little stream provided a small source of water. In that area were found many pieces of very weathered galena. It also found the washings had later been moved to another area beside the marsh, which could be supplied with a more reliable water supply. A leat had collected water from the original stream, 36metres above the old dressing floor, and conducted it to some small storage ponds further east, which could collect from other sources as well. However the site of the new washing floor had been destroyed by a later mine building. After the ore had been dressed it was taken by packhorses over Sticks Pass to a smelter at Stoneycroft in the Newlands Valley, near Keswick.|$|E

2500|$|The Palace of Westminster {{as a whole}} {{began to}} see {{significant}} alterations from the 18th century onwards, as Parliament struggled {{to carry out its}} business in the limited available space and ageing buildings. Calls for an entirely new palace went unheeded as instead more buildings of varying quality and style were added. A new west façade, known as the Stone Building, facing onto St Margaret's Street was designed by John Vardy built in the Palladian style between 1755 and 1770, providing more space for document storage and committee rooms. The House of Commons Engrossing Office of Robert Gunnell (1724-1794) and Edward Barwell was on the lower <b>floor</b> <b>beside</b> the corner tower at the west side of Vardy's western façade. A new official residence for the Speaker of the House of Commons was built adjoining St Stephen's Chapel and completed in 1795. The neo-Gothic architect James Wyatt also carried out works on both the House of Lords and Commons between 1799 and 1801, including alterations to the exterior of St Stephen's Chapel and a much-derided new neo-Gothic building, referred to by Wyatt's critics as [...] "The Cotton Mill" [...] adjoining the House of Lords and facing onto Old Palace Yard.|$|E

By August 1877 Barnes and Lavers had moved out, but two grocery shops as well as the Medical Hall were operating on the ground floor from August 1877 to March-April 1878.|$|R
5000|$|Manual {{elevators}} {{were often}} {{controlled by a}} large lever which would cause the elevator to stop or run and sometimes also regulate speed, and typically required some skill or sense of timing {{to be able to}} consistently stop the elevator level with the doorway of a <b>floor.</b> <b>Besides</b> their training in operation and safety, later, department stores extended the roles of operators as combination greeters and tour guides, announcing product departments, floor-by-floor, and occasionally mentioning special price offers.|$|R
25|$|The Walter Burnett Building was {{designed}} by architects Hulme and Webster and is adjacent the Frank Nicklin Pavilion (honouring Queensland Premier Frank Nicklin) which accommodates fine arts exhibitions. The auditorium of the Walter Burnett Building seats 1000 people and {{is equipped with a}} stage and dance <b>floor.</b> <b>Besides</b> its importance to the annual Exhibition, the building is in constant use for all sorts of activities, including expositions, balls and conferences. It was also the venue for the first public airing of the Fitzgerald Inquiry Report on corruption in Queensland, on 3 July 1989.|$|R

25|$|During office hours, {{most of the}} {{exterior}} and the remaining grounds are accessible to the public. Spring Hall is a large, three-storey, cellared building which was originally set in its own grounds. It has pitched roofs, gables and tall, Elizabethan-style chimneys. There is a four-storey, octagonal, pinnacled tower and a ground-floor entrance-porch at the south-east corner (pictured below). The west side, which faces the drive and the Huddersfield Road, has two non-functioning gargoyles representing a dog and fox on the outer corners of the central bay of the first <b>floor.</b> <b>Besides</b> being evident from outside, these gargoyles can be seen through adjacent windows, from inside the building. The lintel above the ground floor window on the same bay is carved with a frieze of stylised flower motifs separated by a zigzag line, and the window below contains stone frames with double ogee curves along the top edges. Above the south-east entrance porch is the Holdsworth family crest carved in stone: a lion rampant, holding an opened scroll.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the first estimations on the resonance frequency time depending {{and the influence}} of a pre-load in dynamic stiffness measurement. A resilient layer in a floating floor could suffer deflection under the slab weight: pliability or fibres breakage in a resilient layer induces a static deflection decrease (thus a relative resonance frequency increase) and, as a consequence, deteriorates the acoustical properties of the insulation layer. Dynamic stiffness is the most important parameter for assessing the acoustical properties of insulation of layers used in floating floors; dynamic stiffness influences the reduction in impact sound pressure level in a floating <b>floor.</b> <b>Besides,</b> the correlation between the elasticity (or the internal damping) of the insulation layers and the insulation curve slope has been examined. This quantity, depending on mass-spring (plateresilient layer) resonance frequency, offers possibilities to estimate empirically the reduction in normalized impact sound pressure level, or the single number DLw, in function of concrete slab weighting...|$|R
