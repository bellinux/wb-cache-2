5|$|Naughty Dog based Drake's {{appearance}} and personality on daredevil Johnny Knoxville, actor Harrison Ford, and {{the heroes of}} pulp magazines, novels and films. To make him relatable, the character was dressed <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> T-shirt, and given an everyman persona; he is strong-willed, and often jokes and quips. The designers focused on giving him realistic reactions to his environment; for example, he stumbles while running, barely clears objects during leaps, and recognizes the absurdity of the situations in which he finds himself.|$|E

Lowell had {{described}} becoming a Bond girl as [...] "huge shoes to fill", as {{she did not see}} herself as a [...] "glamour girl", even coming to audition <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leather jacket. While Lowell wore a wig for the scenes set in the United States, a scene where Bouvier is given money and told by Bond to go and buy some new clothes (and, going off and doing so, also has her hair cut) was added so that Lowell's own short hair style could be used.|$|E

500|$|Carey {{performed}} [...] "Obsessed" [...] {{on several}} televised appearances since its release. On August 5, 2009, Carey performed the song {{live for the}} first time on the fourth season of the talent competition, America's Got Talent. Carey, appearing <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> black top, was accompanied by several male dancers and three back-up singers. As she performed the song, the dancers hoisted her into the air several times, and carried her to several areas on the stage. During the performance, several white lights flashed, while monitors behind the dancers showed images of Carey and the video. Breanne Heldman from E! Entertainment Television criticized several aspects of the performance. She described the lighting as [...] "anxiety inducing", and wrote, [...] "That said, no one is doubting the singer's impressive set of pipes, but—frighteningly jarring lighting and quick edits aside—did she actually utilize them on 'America's Got Talent' last night?" [...] Aside from questioning the singers live vocals, she also felt Carey seemed [...] "robotic", and didn't show effort or interest in the performance. A reviewer from Idolator also was critical on the performance, asking if there was [...] "anything good about [...] ". He claimed Carey was lip-syncing, and described it as [...] "lackadaisical", and wrote, [...] "the backup dancers’ moves would have probably received a big red 'X' from at least one of the judges." ...|$|E

2500|$|Carl's first episode, {{broadcast}} on 20 June at 7.30pm on BBC One, received overnight ratings of 6.64million, an audience share of 33.7%, while the BBC Three repeat, shown at 1am on 21 June, was watched by 210,000 people, 8.3% {{of the total}} viewing audience at that time. Jim Shelley from the Daily Mail reviewed Carl's first two episodes, and called him [...] "a fairly undistinguished presence <b>in</b> <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> grey hoodie." [...] Shelley sarcastically wrote that [...] "He was also (you'll never guess) a menacing villain. EastEnders hasn't had a new one of those for, ooh, weeks." [...] On making his way around Albert Square to discover Ian stole his cash, Shelley wrote, [...] "Perhaps surprisingly, Carl was also such expert psychologist {{he should have been}} a master criminal rather than the petty criminal he really is, or working in Harley Street. Within 24 hours, this led him directly to his money and allowed him to negotiate an extortion rate from Ian of £500 a week plus all the free portions of Jean's Sausage Surprise he can eat. [...] It was pretty impressive for two episodes. [...] It turned out Carl was Bad News. What other kind is there in EastEnders? [...] Carl worked his magic on Ian, assessing his character and weakness, and manipulating him to get what he wanted with the skill of The Mentalist." [...] He went on to comment on Kirsty's line, [...] "He's someone you don't want in your life", saying, [...] "Or in your TV show." ...|$|E

Artist Jack Bridges used a {{photograph}} of his own face, a photograph of rancher Doc Simmons <b>and</b> <b>a</b> photograph of Will Rogers to create the new look. After the fair, his appearance was slightly altered to straighten his nose <b>and</b> correct <b>an</b> odd wink. It was in 1953 that Big Tex also began speaking. Using <b>a</b> custom-built recipromotor <b>and</b> <b>a</b> 75-watt speaker system housed in the figure's head, Jack Bridges devised a way {{to create the illusion}} of natural speech with a swinging jaw.

5000|$|Sexual {{fields are}} {{themselves}} distinguished by distinct [...] "currencies of erotic capital" [...] (Green 2005, 2008), the latter which are quite variable, acquiring dominance {{in relation to}} the collective preferences of players. For example, Green (2005, 2008) argues that the characteristics which confer sexual capital in one field may not in another. Thus, in a gay leather bar, a bearded, stocky white man in his late-thirties dressed <b>in</b> Levi's <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leather jacket will possess an optimal form of sexual capital, whereas the same man in a swanky Martini bar catering to a twenty-something, high-fashion, urban gay customer base will face a sexual capital deficit. This variation in power and status occurs because a gay leather bar <b>and</b> <b>a</b> gay Martini bar are physical sites organized by the logic of two distinct sexual fields with contrasting currencies of sexual capital (Green 2005, 2008) - i.e., distinct [...] "hegemonic systems of judgment" [...] (Martin and George 2006).|$|R
5000|$|Sapundus are {{traditionally}} made of ironwood, although today a lighter more common wood {{are increasingly being}} used. It is usually about 1.5 - 3 meter height, <b>and</b> has <b>a</b> diameter of between 15-25 cm. Sapundus are carved into different figures e.g. {{a man or a}} woman, or sometimes of animals. A sapundu represent a figure that would escort the soul of the dead into the paradise during the tiwah. The type of figures represented by the sapundu is usually a figure that is deemed appropriate to accompany the deceased during their final journey into the paradise. For example, if the deceased was a female, a sacrificial post representing a man is usually prepared for her tiwah, and vice versa. Contemporary sapundu can be very creative. For example, there is a sapundu depicting a young woman <b>in</b> blue <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> sleeveless T-shirt wearing a Sony Walkman. Some sapundus contain English inscriptions, e.g. [...] "Tiwah Party" [...] or [...] "God Save Our Soul". Notches inscribed onto the post are intended to serve as reminders to the souls of the animals, rice, and other goods donated by survivors to ensure the deceased's comfort in the afterlife.|$|R

5000|$|In early 1981 she {{returned}} to the Sanremo Music Festival with the song [...] "Per Elisa", composed by Bissi herself, Franco Battiato and his longtime co-writer, classical violinist Giusto Pio. The song was both lyrically <b>and</b> musically <b>a</b> modern paraphrase of Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Für Elise" [...] but it was by no means an archetypal sentimental Sanremo ballad. The rough rock track had lyrics which dealt with jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge. For the live performance at the contest Bissi made full use of her vocal strength and range; one of the singer's trademarks is the exceptionally low register of her contralto voice, [...] "Per Elisa" [...] is also partly sung in falsetto and thus covers close to four octaves. The unorthodox Sanremo entry and Bissi's delivery of the song dressed <b>in</b> tight <b>jeans</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> leather jacket made a strong impression on both the juries and the TV audiences; [...] "Per Elisa" [...] won the contest, becoming one of the very first up-tempo rock tracks to do so and it became Bissi's commercial breakthrough not only in Italy but also in the rest of Continental Europe, becoming a Top 10 hit also in Switzerland and Austria and most other parts of Western Europe, including Scandinavia. An album titled Alice followed a few months later (released as Per Elisa outside Italy) including follow-up single [...] "Una notte speciale" [...] ("A Special Night") and the same year Bissi set out on her first European tour.|$|R
