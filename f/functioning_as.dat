5|$|In 1907, the Chulkhurst Charity was amalgamated {{with other}} local {{charities}} with similar purposes, {{to form the}} Biddenden Consolidated Charity, still <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> a registered charity. The Bread and Cheese Lands were sold for housing, expanding the charity significantly to provide Biddenden pensioners and widows with bread, cheese, and tea at Easter, a cash payment at Christmas, and distribute Biddenden cakes. (During the food rationing of the 1940s and early 1950s, the cheese was replaced by cocoa. Distribution of cheese resumed in 1951.) A wrought iron village sign showing the Biddenden Maids was erected on Biddenden village green in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would not stand for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E

40|$|The tumor {{suppressor}} p 53 homologues, TA-p 73, and p 63 {{have been}} shown to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> tumor suppressors. However, how they <b>function</b> <b>as</b> tumor suppressors remains elusive. Expression of p 63 is controlled by two distinct promoters. Consequently, this results in two different gene products such as TA-(transactivation domain containing NH 2 terminus) p 63 and &#x 2206;N-(lacks NH 2 terminus) p 63. It is generally thought that the TA-p 63 <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> a tumor suppressor, while the &#x 2206;N-p 73 <b>functions</b> <b>as</b> a proto-oncogene. However, careful interpretation of the data concerning &#x 2206;N-p 63 suggests that it could <b>function</b> <b>as</b> an invasion and metastasis/tumor suppressor in a cell context dependent manner...|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the evolution of the tetrapod limb from fins in lobe-finned fishes is related to expression of the HOXD13 gene or the loss of the proteins actinodin 1 and actinodin 2, which are involved in fish fin development. Robot simulations suggest that the necessary nervous circuitry for walking evolved from the nerves governing swimming, utilizing the sideways oscillation of the body with the limbs primarily <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> anchoring points and providing limited thrust. This type of movement, as well as changes to the pectoral girdle are similar to those seen in the fossil record can be induced in bichirs by raising then out of water.|$|E
5|$|Key figures {{mentioned}} in inscriptions {{from rural areas}} were the Gavundas (officials) or Goudas. The Gavundas belonged to two levels of economic strata, the Praja Gavunda (people's Gavunda) and the Prabhu Gavunda (lord of Gavundas).

5|$|Satisfied {{with their}} {{performance}} in Poland, Hitler allowed further {{expansion of the}} armed SS formations, but insisted new units remain under the operational control of the army. While the SS-Leibstandarte remained an independent regiment <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> Hitler's personal bodyguards, the other regiments—SS-Deutschland, SS-Germania, and SS-Der Führer—were combined to form the SS-Verfügungs-Division. A second SS division, the SS-Totenkopf, was formed from SS-TV concentration camp guards, and a third, the SS-Polizei, was created from police volunteers. The SS gained control over its own recruitment, logistics, and supply systems for its armed formations at this time. The SS, Gestapo, and SD {{were in charge of}} the provisional military administration in Poland until the appointment of Hans Frank as Governor-General on 26 October 1939.|$|E
5|$|Sodium and {{potassium}} occur in all known biological systems, generally <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> electrolytes {{inside and outside}} cells. Sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500milligrams per day. Sodium chloride (also known as common salt) is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative, such as for pickling and jerky; most of it comes from processed foods. The Dietary Reference Intake for sodium is 1.5grams per day, but {{most people in the}} United States consume more than 2.3grams per day, the minimum amount that promotes hypertension; this in turn causes 7.6 million premature deaths worldwide.|$|E
40|$|Social stimuli that <b>function</b> <b>as</b> {{reinforcers}} {{for most}} children {{generally do not}} <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. These important social stimuli include smiles, head nods, thumb-ups, and okay signs. It should be an important goal of therapy for children with autism to condition these neutral social stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. There is empirical evidence to support both a pairing procedure (classical conditioning) and a discriminative stimulus procedure to condition neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence as to the superiority of effectiveness for either procedure. Despite this most textbooks and curriculum guides for children with autism state only the pairing procedure to condition neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers. Recent studies suggest that the discriminative stimulus procedure may in fact be more effective in conditioning neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children diagnosed with autism. The present research is a further comparison of these two procedures. Results from one participant support recent findings that suggest the discriminative stimulus procedure is more effective in conditioning neutral stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers. But the results from the other participant show no effects from either procedure, suggesting future research into conditions necessary to condition neutral social stimuli to <b>function</b> <b>as</b> reinforcers for children with autism...|$|R

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|Termites {{going through}} {{incomplete}} metamorphosis {{on the path}} to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, <b>functioning</b> <b>as</b> potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.|$|E
