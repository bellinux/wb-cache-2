5|$|The {{concept of}} <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>potential</b> is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that of <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description of <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} field was formally {{defined as the}} force exerted per unit charge, but the concept of potential allows for a more useful and equivalent definition: the {{electric field}} is the local gradient of the <b>electric</b> <b>potential.</b> Usually expressed in voltspermetre, the vector direction of the field is the line of greatest slope of potential, and where the equipotentials lie closest together.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>potentials</b> {{occurring}} in the oral cavity deserve attention as they may cause various diseases and subjective feelings, which {{are very difficult to}} treat. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> within the oral cavity in patients with metal fillings and metal prosthetic restorations, after using a pulsed electromagnetic field. The study was carried out on 84 patients. The Viofor JPS Classic device was used in the treatment. It generates a pulsed electromagnetic field with low induction of the extremely low frequency (ELF) range. Average values of <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> in the preliminary test were about the same in both groups; they were 148. 8 mV and 145. 5 mV. After another appliance of ELF fields there was found a steady decline in the average value of <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> in the study group. This decrease was statistically highly significant, while mean values of <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> in the control group were characterized by a slightly upward tendency. The obtained statistically significant reduction of <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> in the oral cavity of patients having metal fillings and metal prosthetic restorations, after application of the Viofor JPS Classic device, implies a huge impact of ELF pulsed electromagnetic field on inhibition of electrochemical processes, as well as on inhibition of dental alloy corrosion. ...|$|R

Examples of <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> satisfying these assumptions are given...|$|R
5|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>potential</b> is a scalar quantity, that is, it {{has only}} {{magnitude}} and not direction. It {{may be viewed as}} analogous to height: just as a released object will fall through a difference in heights caused by a gravitational field, so a charge will 'fall' across the voltage caused by an electric field. As relief maps show contour lines marking points of equal height, a set of lines marking points of equal potential (known as equipotentials) may be drawn around an electrostatically charged object. The equipotentials cross all lines of force at right angles. They must also lie parallel to a conductor's surface, otherwise this would produce a force that will move the charge carriers to even the potential of the surface.|$|E
5|$|The German-born British {{physicist}} Arthur Schuster expanded upon Crookes' experiments {{by placing}} metal plates {{parallel to the}} cathode rays and applying an <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> between the plates. The field deflected the rays toward the positively charged plate, providing further evidence that the rays carried negative charge. By measuring the amount of deflection for a given level of current, in 1890 Schuster was able to estimate the charge-to-mass ratio of the ray components. However, this produced a value {{that was more than}} a thousand times greater than what was expected, so little credence was given to his calculations at the time.|$|E
5|$|When {{a charge}} {{is placed in}} a {{location}} with a non-zero electric field, a force will act on it. The magnitude of this force is given by Coulomb's law. Thus, if that charge were to move, the electric field would be doing work on the electric charge. Thus we can speak of <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> {{at a certain point}} in space, which is equal to the work done by an external agent in carrying a unit of positive charge from an arbitrarily chosen reference point to that point without any acceleration and is typically measured in volts.|$|E

5|$|At a given temperature, each {{material}} has an electrical conductivity that determines {{the value of}} electric current when an <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> is applied. Examples of good conductors include metals such as copper and gold, whereas glass and Teflon are poor conductors. In any dielectric material, the electrons remain bound to their respective atoms and the material behaves as an insulator. Most semiconductors have a variable level of conductivity that lies between the extremes of conduction and insulation. On the other hand, metals have an electronic band structure containing partially filled electronic bands. The presence of such bands allows electrons in metals to behave {{as if they were}} free or delocalized electrons. These electrons are not associated with specific atoms, so when an electric field is applied, they are free to move like a gas (called Fermi gas) through the material much like free electrons.|$|E
5|$|Small scale {{can be done}} on a local X-ray tube source, {{typically}} {{coupled with}} an image plate detector. These {{have the advantage of}} being (relatively) inexpensive and easy to maintain, and allow for quick screening and collection of samples. However, the wavelength light produced is limited by anode material, typically copper. Further, intensity is limited by the power applied and cooling capacity available to avoid melting the anode. In such systems, electrons are boiled off of a cathode and accelerated through a strong <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> of ~50 kV; having reached a high speed, the electrons collide with a metal plate, emitting bremsstrahlung and some strong spectral lines corresponding to the excitation of inner-shell electrons of the metal. The most common metal used is copper, which can be kept cool easily, due to its high thermal conductivity, and which produces strong Kα and Kβ lines. The Kβ line is sometimes suppressed with a thin (~10 µm) nickel foil. The simplest and cheapest variety of sealed X-ray tube has a stationary anode (the Crookes tube) and run with ~2 kW of electron beam power. The more expensive variety has a rotating-anode type source that run with ~14 kW of e-beam power.|$|E
5|$|The main ovals are the {{dominant}} {{part of the}} Jovian aurorae. They have stable shapes and locations, but their intensities are strongly modulated by the solar wind pressure—the stronger solar wind, the weaker the aurorae. As mentioned above, the main ovals are maintained by the strong influx of electrons accelerated by the <b>electric</b> <b>potential</b> drops between the magnetodisk plasma and the Jovian ionosphere. These electrons carry field aligned currents, which maintain the plasma's co-rotation in the magnetodisk. The potential drops develop because the sparse plasma outside the equatorial sheet can only carry a current of a limited strength without those currents. The precipitating electrons have energy in the range 10–100keV and penetrate deep into the atmosphere of Jupiter, where they ionize and excite molecular hydrogen causing ultraviolet emission. The total energy input into the ionosphere is 10–100TW. In addition, the currents flowing in the ionosphere heats it by the process known as Joule heating. This heating, which produces up to 300TW of power, {{is responsible for the}} strong infrared radiation from the Jovian aurorae and partially for the heating of the thermosphere of Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in <b>electric</b> <b>potential,</b> with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E

Separating the perturbed components from the correct solutions, the equation of current continuity of these components is considered. Then we determine the perturbed components generated by the MI coupling. Since the perturbed components of the <b>electric</b> <b>potentials</b> are associated with the reflected shear Alfven wave, we can {{describe a}} spatiotemporal development of ionospheric potential as summation of reflection processes of shear Alfven wave at the inner boundary, and then the new process is applicable to the general problems of the MI coupling...|$|R
