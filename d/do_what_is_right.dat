5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as {{she picks up a}} knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same}} time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E

'Ha, ha!' laughed Mr. Peggotty, {{sitting down}} beside us, and rubbing {{his hands in}} his sense of relief from recent trouble, and in the genuine heartiness of his nature; 'there's not a woman in the wureld, sir--as I tell her--that need to feel more easy in her mind than her! She done her dooty by the {{departed}}, and the departed know'd it; and the departed <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> by her, as she <b>done</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>right</b> by the departed;--and--and--and it's all right!' ...|$|R

25|$|The freedom {{principle}} is enjoying the desire {{and the power}} to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right.</b> Moral purity is the result of true freedom. The key to freedom is learning how to walk in the Spirit and appropriate the victory that Christ has already won through His death, burial, and resurrection.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Cranham as Pompey Magnus (Season 1) – A legendary general, {{past the}} days of his prime, who tries to {{recapture}} the glories of his youth {{as well as to}} <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> for the Republic. The real Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus was a Roman general and politician who was as ambitious as Caesar and just as unorthodox in his youth. He chose to ally himself with the optimates in opposing Caesar and supporting the traditional Roman Republic.|$|E
500|$|Even {{more trouble}} {{followed}} Parliament's {{passage of the}} 1773 Tea Act. On November 5, Hancock was elected as moderator at a Boston town meeting that resolved that anyone who supported the Tea Act was an [...] "Enemy to America". Hancock and others tried to force {{the resignation of the}} agents who had been appointed to receive the tea shipments. Unsuccessful in this, they attempted to prevent the tea from being unloaded after three tea ships had arrived in Boston Harbor. Hancock was at the fateful meeting on December 16, where he reportedly told the crowd, [...] "Let every man <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> in his own eyes." [...] Hancock did not take part in the Boston Tea Party that night, but he approved of the action, although he was careful not to publicly praise the destruction of private property.|$|E

500|$|The {{program has}} four primary aims [...] that are closely {{aligned with the}} aims of the Boy Scouts of America with the {{addition}} of leadership development. The program focuses on character development, which it defines as encouraging people to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> no matter what, and to serve themselves and others. Its second aim is personal fitness, and in its programs it encourages individuals to accept physical and mental challenges, to surpass their own expectations, expand their knowledge, skills and abilities, and strive for continuous personal improvement. Their third aim is [...] citizenship training, in which it helps individuals to develop a positive attitude, influence those around them, join in and shape their community. The paramount aim however is leadership development, in which it inspires individuals to engage life as an ongoing adventure, [...] to challenge themselves, and to lead others to pursue excellence.|$|E
500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think we know who they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

2500|$|John Thelwall, {{a democrat}} and radical, was upset by his belief that Burke assumed that {{only a portion of}} the population, the {{informed}} individuals, should be understood as the public. Thelwall also opposed Burke's descriptions of British Jacobins and believed that Burke wanted to legalize their execution. James Mackintosh believed that Burke had a strong linguistic power and agreed that war could be necessary but not with France. To restore the French monarchy, to Mackintosh, would go against France's right as a nation and remove its independence. [...] The only way for the opponents of France to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right</b> is for them to be objective and balanced. William Roscoe, a Unitarian liberal, believed that Burke misunderstood the French revolution and that the British were the aggressors in the situation.|$|E
2500|$|Julius Root {{commanded}} the reconnaissance {{branch of the}} LEP, and {{was in charge of}} all activities related to the tracking of those who leave fairy civilization, to prevent them making contact with humans. Known for his ruddy face (hence his nickname, [...] "Beetroot") and extremely short temper, he led the LEPrecon on missions until Koboi killed him using an explosive in The Opal Deception and framed Holly Short. He taught Holly to <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>right,</b> even if it means to stop being a LEP captain and instead become a major, being confined to deskwork. However, Root also {{seems to have been a}} lot like Holly Short when he was younger; a book states that Holly Short had recently beat the speed record, a speed record that had been set 500 years ago by Julius Root. Julius Root seemed to hate it when Foaly called him by his first name. Julius Root also had a brother, Turnball Root, who was the main antagonist for the seventh book.|$|E
