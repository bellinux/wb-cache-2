2500|$|Women in Arab {{societies}} experience discrimination {{from the}} western world based upon many misconceptions {{and a lack of}} knowledge about the realities of their lives. As described previously, the themes of invisibility, lacking accurate representation in media that {{other parts of the world}} absorb, and conflation of identities, be it Arab/Muslim, anti-Zionist/anti-Semite, etc. The conflict occurring Israel and Palestine is a prime example of how these misconceptions create an incorrect understanding of the circumstances and experiences that women in this area encounter in their daily lives. In the article “Arabiya Made Invisible” [...] by Noura Erakat, Ms. Erakat illustrates how the concepts of anti-zionism and antisemitism are conflated to vilify and silence Arab women who support Palestine or denounce the occupation. She says,“The equation of anti-Semitism to anti-Zionism is systematically used as a silencing tactic. Anti-Semitism refers to the historic oppression and vilification of Jews that led to such tragedies as the Nazi-engineered Holocaust. Zionism is the theoretical notion that global Jewry should have a homeland, and in its practical application, Zionism has meant the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine.”Erakat goes on to discuss one protest that was hosted by a group of women of color at the Boalt Law School at UC Berkeley, a silent vigil protesting the occupation of Palestine, Iraq, and Haiti. A Jewish student wrote an op-ed for the school paper complaining that people should not be protesting Israel because Israel is accepting of homosexuals and gives women equal rights. She pointed out that it was ironic that women and gay men were at this vigil, while the places they were showing support of do not respect their rights as much as Israel does. At this point, Erkat gets to the meat of her argument. She says, “This student asserts that misogyny and gender inequality are inherent to Arabs in general and Palestinians in particular. According to her, “the Israeli occupation has nothing to do with Arab oppression of women and gays.” She fails to consider that structural violence waged on women in the context of war and occupation is the most extreme of its form. Moreover, she swiftly disregards the nexus of colonial occupation and patriarchy....when a nationalist movement becomes militarized [...] [...] [...] male privilege in the community usually becomes more entrenched...”The denial of the reality that the occupation and the threat it poses to women and gender equality in this opinion shows a prime example of how the incorrect characterization of Arab women can lead to further misconceptions and false justifications for situations of oppression. In a critique of Erakat's Students for Justice in Palestine group, a fellow student claims to be concerned as to whether his Palestinian peers at Berkeley would be comfortable exercising the freedoms they enjoy in Berkeley on the streets of Ramallah or Jerico. Erakat illustrates how this critique uses false concern to invalidate the real concerns that Palestinians living outside the occupied territories hold for their homeland, despite their differences in living situations and freedoms. She writes in response, “whereas the author wonders whether I would be able to comfortably walk around in tight jeans in Palestine, I wonder, if this man is truly concerned with my personal freedom, then why isn’t he protesting the twenty-five-foot Apartheid Wall built between my village of Abu-Dis and Jerusalem? If he really cares whether <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>read</b> Lolita comfortably, then shouldn’t he be more concerned that Palestinian children are denied a roof over their heads because of consistent home demolitions? His concern with my personal liberation seems disingenuous in light of the fact that he fails to mention Israeli military occupation as a significant, if not the most significant, factor contributing to the subjugation of Palestinian women’s rights. Instead, he uses the lack of gender equality in Palestine as a justification for its continued colonization.” ...|$|E
