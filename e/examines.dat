5000|$|The typical {{criminal}} proceeding {{in the civil}} law world {{can be thought of}} as divided into three basic parts: the investigative phase, the <b>examining</b> phase (the instruction), and the trial.

The <b>examining</b> phase is primarily written and is not public. The <b>examining</b> judge controls the nature and scope of this phase of the proceeding. The <b>examining</b> judge is expected to investigate the matter thoroughly and to prepare a complete written record, so that by the time the <b>examining</b> stage is complete, all the relevant evidence is in the record. If the <b>examining</b> judge concludes that a crime was committed and that the accused is the perpetrator, the case then goes to trial. If the judge decides that no crime was committed or was that the crime was not committed by the accused, the matter does not go to trial.|$|R
