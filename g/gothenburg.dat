5|$|The {{company was}} {{introduced}} by NSB and SJ on 12 May 2000. The stated plans were {{to start with the}} service from <b>Gothenburg</b> to Copenhagen in January 2001, from Oslo to <b>Gothenburg</b> in June, and from Oslo to Stockholm in January 2002. The company would have its head office in <b>Gothenburg</b> and would lease rolling stock from SJ. NSB's chief executive officer, Osmund Ueland, became the company's first chair. The company had a share capital of 10 million Swedish krona (SEK) and was owned in equal shares by NSB and SJ. The company's first train ran on 7 January, from <b>Gothenburg</b> to Copenhagen. Service from Oslo to <b>Gothenburg</b> started on 17 June.|$|E
5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and <b>Gothenburg</b> {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the <b>Gothenburg</b> trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to <b>Gothenburg</b> and disturbing a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E
5|$|IFK Göteborg {{was founded}} at Café Olivedal—a café in the Annedal {{district}} of Linnéstaden—in the central parts of <b>Gothenburg,</b> on October 4, 1904. It was the third, but only lasting, IFK association in <b>Gothenburg,</b> becoming the 39th overall. A committee for football was created {{at the historic}} first meeting; the association's first football match ended in a 4–1 victory against a club from the local area, IK Viking. The foundation of IFK Göteborg was important {{for the development of}} football in the city, as until that point, Örgryte IS, the largest of <b>Gothenburg</b> clubs, were dominant. IFK Göteborg represented some needed competition.|$|E
5|$|Travel {{time from}} Oslo to <b>Gothenburg</b> was {{slightly}} more than four hours. Prices varied from NOK633 for a business class ticket, NOK355 for a second class ticket to NOK187 for pre-booked tickets. X2 trains were never introduced on the section from Oslo to <b>Gothenburg.</b> Instead, conventional Swedish trains from the 1960s hauled by Rc locomotives were used. Passengers traveling from Oslo to Copenhagen had to change train in <b>Gothenburg.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{memorial}} to Wallenberg {{was installed in}} <b>Gothenburg,</b> near Hagakyrkan (Haga Church). Kofi Annan attended the unveiling ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna Göteborg, {{commonly}} known as IFK Göteborg, is a Swedish professional football club based in <b>Gothenburg.</b> Founded on 4 October 1904, {{it is the only}} club in the Nordic countries that has won a pan-European competition, as the club won the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987. IFK is affiliated with Göteborgs Fotbollförbund and play their home games at Gamla Ullevi. The club colours are blue and white, colours shared both with the sports society—Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna—which the club originated from, and with the home town of <b>Gothenburg.</b>|$|E
5|$|In late 1998 {{and early}} 1999, KLM and Braathens {{introduced}} direct flights from Sandefjord and Kristiansand to Amsterdam. Braathens also started flights from Sandefjord to Stavanger and Bergen. On 1 May 1999, Northwest Airlines started flights to its hub at Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport in the United States. This service was terminated in October. The Northwest service had {{a connection to}} Stockholm {{as well as a}} new route from Oslo to <b>Gothenburg,</b> operated by Braathens. After Northwest announced the withdrawal of their service, the <b>Gothenburg</b> service was also terminated.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of the final for the 2012 Contest, the chief {{executive}} of SVT, Eva Hamilton, stated to the Swedish media that various venues in Stockholm, <b>Gothenburg</b> and Malmö were being considered for hosting the 2013 Contest. One alternative put forward in the Expressen, was to hold the competition at three different venues – the semi-finals in <b>Gothenburg</b> and Malmö, and the final in Stockholm. This proposal was dismissed as unfeasible by SVT, which declared that the contest would be hosted in only one city.|$|E
5|$|Starting on December 15, NSB {{took over}} {{three of the}} daily {{services}} from Oslo to <b>Gothenburg,</b> by extending three of the InterCity services along the Østfold Line onwards from Halden Station to <b>Gothenburg.</b> On 24 January 2004, a Linx train derailed at Vestby Station on the Østfold Line. None of the 50 passengers were hurt in the incident.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} Darwin {{suburb of}} Millner {{was named after}} Dr James Millner who, together with his family, lost their lives on <b>Gothenburg.</b> Most streets in the northern Darwin suburb of Coconut Grove and some in the adjacent suburb of Millner, were named after local Darwin residents, interstate visitors and crew {{who lost their lives}} during the shipwreck. <b>Gothenburg</b> Crescent, in the inner Darwin suburb of Stuart Park, was named after the ship.|$|E
5|$|X2 trains {{were never}} {{introduced}} on the section from <b>Gothenburg</b> to Oslo. Linx stated that investments for NOK2 billion were {{needed on the}} Østfold Line to reach a travel time from Oslo to <b>Gothenburg</b> of 3 hours and 30 minutes, rather than the more than 4 hours at the time. In contrast, the Norway/Vänern Line on the Swedish {{side of the border}} meets the necessary standards.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{foundation}} of IFK Göteborg, the dominant club in the <b>Gothenburg</b> area was Örgryte IS, which was considered a middle and upper class club. IFK became popular amongst the working class, creating a fierce rivalry based upon both local pride and social class. In the early 20th century, supporters were supposed to act as gentlemen, applauding and supporting both their own team, and the opponents. However, this proved a hard task for supporters of the <b>Gothenburg</b> teams. Local patriotism and class differences sometimes resulted in fights and pitch invasions, making the Swedish press view IFK and Örgryte fans as the scum of Swedish football.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s, {{the main}} {{customers}} for charter flights had been Norwegian shipping companies, who flew their crew home from ports in Central Europe. In 1959, Saga Tours was created {{as the first}} travel agency for Mediterranean charter trips, and the company started a cooperation with Braathens SAFE. The first DC-4 flew to Mallorca that year. In 1961, the company's first Douglas DC-6B was bought. It had a capacity of 96 passengers, and cooperation was also started with Metro and Paddan in <b>Gothenburg.</b> Other charter destinations were London, Alicante and Málaga, both in Spain. That year, Braathens SAFE bought 50% of Saga Tours in a private placement. Braathens SAFE established an office in <b>Gothenburg</b> in 1965. After Vingresor had been bought by SAS and moved to Stockholm three years later, three employees started Atlas Resor in <b>Gothenburg,</b> and started using Braathens SAFE as their airline. By 1966, Braathens SAFE was operating seven DC-6s.|$|E
5|$|His {{most notable}} legacy is the notes, correspondence, accounts, cargo lists and books he kept during his life. They are {{preserved}} in the Godegård Archive and in the <b>Gothenburg</b> University Library.|$|E
5|$|In November or December 1889 Van Gogh {{worked on}} Olive Orchard, MoMA (F708). Another {{painting}} {{from this time}} is Olive Grove: Orange Sky (F586) which resides at the Göteborgs Museum of Art, <b>Gothenburg,</b> Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered <b>Gothenburg</b> to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected <b>Gothenburg</b> to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that the engine room was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, <b>Gothenburg</b> was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|In summer 1857, Smetana {{came home}} to Prague and found Kateřina in failing health. In June, Smetana's father František died. That autumn Smetana {{returned}} to <b>Gothenburg,</b> with Kateřina and their surviving daughter Žofie, but before doing so he visited Liszt in Weimar. The occasion was the Karl August Goethe-Schiller Jubilee celebrations; Smetana attended performances of Liszt's Faust Symphony and the symphonic poem Die Ideale, which invigorated and inspired him. Liszt was Smetana's principal teacher throughout the latter's creative life, and at this time was crucially able to revive his spirits and rescue him from the relative artistic isolation of <b>Gothenburg.</b>|$|E
5|$|Linx AB was {{a railway}} company which {{operated}} inter-Scandinavian passenger trains between 2001 and 2004. Established as {{a joint venture}} between the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) and the Swedish state-owned SJ, Linx operated the routes from Oslo, Norway, to Stockholm, Sweden, and from Oslo via <b>Gothenburg,</b> Sweden, to Copenhagen, Denmark. Services were provided up to ten times per day. However, slow speeds caused by curvy infrastructure in Norway, combined with competition from low-cost airlines, caused the company to lose money, and eventually grounded operations. The services were taken over by NSB and SJ. The main rolling stock were eleven X2 electric multiple units, although it used SJ Rc-hauled trains on the Gothenburg–Oslo service. The company was based in <b>Gothenburg.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 1 April 1942, 10 Norwegian ships at <b>Gothenburg</b> made {{an attempt}} to escape into Allied-controlled waters, {{where they would be}} met and {{protected}} by a group of British warships. However, Sweden would not allow the Norwegian ships to use their neutral waters for this, and Swedish ships steered the escapees towards waiting German warships. Of the 10, two made it through to the British, six were sunk by the Germans or scuttled by their crew, of which Skytteren was one, two turned back to <b>Gothenburg.</b> Skytteren was scuttled in the waters off Måseskär, Sweden. Her crew were taken as prisoners of war. The wreck of Skytteren remains in those waters, with her bow facing to the west.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of Natural History in <b>Gothenburg,</b> Sweden, {{contains}} the only stuffed blue whale in the world, with its skeleton mounted beside it. Two skeletons {{are held in}} Ukraine in Odessa and Kherson.|$|E
5|$|To {{engage in}} these negotiations, Wollstonecraft {{travelled}} first to <b>Gothenburg,</b> where she remained for two weeks. Leaving Fanny and her nurse Marguerite behind, she embarked for Strömstad, Sweden, where {{she took a}} short detour to visit the fortress of Fredriksten, and then proceeded to Larvik, Norway. From there she travelled to Tønsberg, Norway, where she spent three weeks. She also visited Helgeroa, Risør, and Kristiania (now Oslo) and returned by way of Strömstad and <b>Gothenburg,</b> where she picked up Fanny and Marguerite again. She returned to England by way of Copenhagen and Hamburg, finally landing at Dover in September1795, three months after she had left her home country.|$|E
5|$|At Bowen, twelve {{survivors}} {{left with}} Captain Lake {{on the ship}} Victoria headed for Sydney. They all got free passage from McMerkan, Blackwood and Co, the owners of <b>Gothenburg.</b> The four survivors from the second port lifeboat that were {{picked up by the}} steamer Leichhardt, remained with that ship and subsequently made way for Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} long {{association}} with humans, cockroaches are frequently {{referred to in}} popular culture. In Western culture, cockroaches are often depicted as dirty pests. In a 1750–1752 journal, Peter Osbeck noted that cockroaches were frequently seen and {{found their way to}} the bakeries, after the sailing ship <b>Gothenburg</b> ran aground and was destroyed by rocks.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{was born}} in the Stockholm Palace Tre Kronor in November 1655. His father, Charles X of Sweden, left Sweden in July to fight in the war against Poland. After several years of warfare, the king {{returned}} in the winter of 1659 and gathered his family and the Riksdag of the Estates in <b>Gothenburg.</b> In mid-January 1660 he fell ill and one month later he wrote his last will and died.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, {{the company}} {{won the first}} public service {{obligation}} tender that was issued by the Ministry of Transport and Communications. Starting 1August, Teddy Air started serving Fagernes Airport, Leirin, with routes to Oslo and Bergen. The contract gave a subsidy of NOK23.7 million for three years, and was 15 percent lower than what Coast Air had been receiving. On 20May 1997, Teddy Air started its first international route, from Stavanger to <b>Gothenburg</b> in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In January 1968, the Experience {{travelled}} to Sweden for {{a one-week}} tour of Europe. During {{the early morning}} hours of the first day, Hendrix became engaged in a drunken brawl in the Hotel Opalen, in <b>Gothenburg,</b> smashing a plate-glass window and injuring his right hand, for which he received medical treatment. The incident culminated in his arrest and release, pending a court appearance that resulted in a large fine.|$|E
5|$|Johan Björnsson Printz, who it {{had been}} ennobled, was {{appointed}} {{to be the first}} royal governor of New Sweden, arriving in the colony on 15 February 1643. Under his ten-year rule, the administrative center of New Sweden was moved north to Tinicum Island (to the immediate SW of today's Philadelphia), where he built Fort New <b>Gothenburg</b> and his own manor house which he called the Printzhof.|$|E
5|$|Melodifestivalen is {{broadcast}} on television, {{radio and the}} internet. It is {{broadcast on}} SVT1 with international coverage on SVT World. Until 1987, the competition was broadcast on SverigesRadioTV, later known as TV1. Between 1988 and 2000, the event was broadcast on different channels depending on where it was held. Finals in Stockholm were broadcast on Kanal1 (formerly TV1) while finals in <b>Gothenburg</b> or Malmö were broadcast on TV2. Sveriges Radio has broadcast the event on P1, P3 and P4, where is currently broadcast.|$|E
5|$|PewDiePie {{was born}} and raised in <b>Gothenburg,</b> Sweden. He was born to Lotta Kristine Johanna (born 7 May 1958) and Ulf Christian Kjellberg (born 8 January 1957), and grew up with his sister Fanny. His mother, a former KappAhl CIO, was named the 2010 CIO of the Year in Sweden. His father is also a Chief Executive of another company.|$|E
5|$|The Jönköpings läns museum owns over 1,000 paintings, {{drawings}} and sketches by Bauer, {{which is the}} world's largest collection of his artwork. He is also represented at the Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, the <b>Gothenburg</b> Museum of Art and the Malmö konstmuseum. The John Bauer Museum in Ebenhausen, Germany is a museum dedicated to the life and works of Bauer.|$|E
5|$|The club {{were also}} {{successful}} in Europe, reaching the European Cup semi-finals in 1984 and the 1987 UEFA Cup Final, the latter featuring another elimination of Barcelona. Despite losing to IFK <b>Gothenburg</b> in the final, the club won a FIFA Fair Play Award. McLean retired as manager in 1993, but remained as club chairman.|$|E
5|$|The event spent {{its early}} years at one venue: Cirkus in Stockholm, which hosted the first ten competitions. It has hosted the final of Melodifestivalen {{seventeen}} times in total. The Stockholm Globe Arena has hosted seven finals, and SVT's headquarters in Stockholm has staged five. The competition first took place outside Stockholm in 1975 {{as part of a}} decentralisation policy at SR. Stockholm has hosted thirty-seven finals in total, including the first fourteen. <b>Gothenburg</b> has hosted eight, and Malmö seven. The competition's final has never been held outside these cities. Before the expansion, the host of the previous year's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest {{in the event of a}} Swedish victory. Hence, the 1985 Eurovision was held in <b>Gothenburg,</b> and the 1992 contest in Malmö. Since 2002, the only venue that has hosted more than three semifinals is Gothenburg's Scandinavium, which has hosted one every year since 2003. In 2008, Andra Chansen was held in Kiruna, north of the Arctic Circle. The finals have since 2013 been hosted in Friends Arena.|$|E
5|$|The first European emigrants {{travelled}} in the holds {{of sailing}} cargo ships. With {{the advent of}} the age of steam, an efficient transatlantic passenger transport mechanism was established {{at the end of the}} 1860s. It was based on huge ocean liners run by international shipping lines, most prominently Cunard, White Star, and Inman. The speed and capacity of the large steamships meant that tickets became cheaper. From the Swedish port towns of Stockholm, Malmö and <b>Gothenburg,</b> transport companies operated various routes, some of them with complex early stages and consequently a long and trying journey on the road and at sea. Thus North German transport agencies relied on the regular Stockholm—Lübeck steamship service to bring Swedish emigrants to Lübeck, and from there on German train services to take them to Hamburg or Bremen. There they would board ships to the British ports of Southampton and Liverpool and change to one of the great transatlantic liners bound for New York. The majority of Swedish emigrants, however, travelled from <b>Gothenburg</b> to Hull, UK, on dedicated boats run by the Wilson Line, then by train across Britain to Liverpool and the big ships.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} heroes {{identified}} that tragic night, all attested to {{by all the}} other survivors, for their attempts to save other passengers. In recognition of their bravery, on 26 July 1875, the Governor of South Australia, Sir Anthony Musgrave, presented passengers James Fitzgerald and John Cleland and crewman Robert Brazil with gold medals and a gold watch. The <b>Gothenburg</b> Relief Fund Committee also presented each of them with a gold chain.|$|E
5|$|Those {{still on}} board <b>Gothenburg</b> tried {{to cling to}} the rigging, but {{throughout}} the early morning of 25 February, several more people were drowned after they were swept overboard by large broadside waves. Many passengers associated with the gold diggings were unwilling {{to let go of}} their gold and money belts, as it was probably their life savings; these individuals insisted on keeping them tied and once overboard reportedly drowned very quickly.|$|E
5|$|To produce {{accurate}} illustrations for the Ramona, Hergé and {{his assistant}} Bob de Moor traveled aboard a Swedish cargo vessel, the MS Reine Astrid, from Antwerp to <b>Gothenburg</b> and back, during which they took photographs and drew sketches. Hergé had also collected press clippings depicting the Christina, a motor yaught owned by the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, and used them {{as the basis for}} his depiction of Rastapopoulos' ship, the Sheherezade.|$|E
