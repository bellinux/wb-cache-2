40|$|Romania has {{inherited}} a social welfare {{system from the}} 80 s providing good coverage for different types of risks specific to that type of society. Meanwhile, intervention forms have been diversified {{under the pressure of}} both economic changes and international tendencies. A brief overview of these, presented forthwith in order to fix the framework within the adequacy of the welfare state system in Romania, will be discussed. The third way is focused on the characteristic of the minimum income <b>guarantee</b> <b>benefit</b> (MIG) with special attention paid to it as a mechanism of promoting social inclusion. A. INTERNATIONAL CONTEXT Within a post-industrial context, European countries have experienced the transition from a Keynesian welfare state model to a Schumpeterian workfare one. Gradually the previous ‘passive’ measures supporting the unemployed were retrenched in favour of ‘active ’ ones based on education and training. Simultaneously, the American model prescribed the practice of providing social assistance benefits under the condition of work requirement aimed at individuals. (Benner, Barbier, 2001) The end of the “golden era ” of the welfare state was accompanied by an enforcement of liberal values. A more restrictive access to social benefits in both financial terms and eligibilit...|$|E
40|$|According to the Severance Pay Reform Plan 2003, {{employers}} and employees can covert SP (Severance Pay) to RP (Retirement Pension).

As conversion to RP is entrusted to the employer and employees, Ref orm Plan 2003 does not seem to expand substantially the second tier of Korean old-age income security system, and correct substantially non-performance of SP unless incentive structure of both Corporate Tax Act and Revenue Tax Act are reformed so that many firms and employees will find incentives to adopt RP. However, the initiative of universal coverage will level up the low-coverage and contribute to protection of non-regular workers. Once incentive structure of tax system is reformed, it will imply less marge de manoevre to employers in using SP reserves, and firms {{would not be able to}} simply book-keep SP and enjoy tax reduction or exemption, which will likely to contract firms’ investment as well as demand for labor, and thus aggregate growth of the economy...|$|E

The proponents' argument is that projected returns (higher than those individuals currently receive from Social Security) and ownership of the private accounts would allow lower spending on the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>benefit,</b> but possibly without any net loss of income to beneficiaries.|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} are discussing how to reform their pension systems {{in order to}} meet the demands of an aging society. A trend in these reform discussions is to introduce individual accounts as part of both public and occupational schemes. Sweden was an early mover in this process. In 1998, Sweden introduced a second tier of mandatory individual accounts ó the Premium Pension ó in the public system. The individual account component in the public pension system was designed as a ìcarve-outî and constitutes a relatively small portion of the new system. The contribution rate to the overall system is 18. 5 percent: 16 percent is paid to the first tier, which is financed on a pay-as-you-go basis and pays a benefit determined by a workerís lifetime earnings, while 2. 5 percent is credited to a funded individual account. In addition, a means-tested <b>guarantee</b> <b>benefit</b> provides a minimum pension for workers with low earnings. The individual accounts are self-directed and participants can invest in a broad array of domestic and international funds. For individuals who do not wish to make an active investment decision, the government has established a default fund. The first investment elections in the Premium Pension plan took place in the fall of 2000 when all Swedes born after 1938 were able to choose how to invest their contributions from a menu of about 500 mutual funds. This brief evaluates the Swedish experience with individual accounts to date and discusses the lessons that can be learned from the first four years [...] . ...|$|E

40|$|If {{the intent}} of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, ERISA, was to assure that {{beneficiaries}} of insolvent pension plans receive adequate pension benefits, sharp increases in nominal rates of interest have blunted that purpose. Without an increase in these rates, the Pension <b>Benefit</b> <b>Guarantee</b> Corporation, PBGC, the insurance agency established to <b>guarantee</b> <b>benefits,</b> faced large liabilities on the terminations of pension plans. We examine the economics of pension funds and the funding of pension funds before and after the enactment of ERISA. The Act changed the economics of pension funds. The PBGC, the employer, and the employees have interests in the assets of the pension plan. The PBGC can tax corporations to pay off liabilities and to fund guaranteed benefits; employers can terminate pension plans or overfund them; employees can ask for more benefits or claim the assets in the fund. Although the PBGC insures benefits, the insurance agent forbears, not acting quickly to protect its own interests. To prevent potential huge increases in its liabilities, the PBGC could require that employers hedge the <b>guaranteed</b> <b>benefits,</b> and fund their increases in promised benefits.

40|$|The Danish ATP (Arbejdmarkedets TillaegsPension or Labor Market Supplementary Pension) fund is {{a public}} pension fund that was created in 1964 to {{complement}} the universal pension benefit that is financed from general tax revenues and is paid to all old-age residents.

Contribution amounts are set in absolute terms, but are low relative to earnings (less than 1 percent of average earnings). ATP has benefited from scale economies and compulsory worker participation and has been able to operate with high efficiency and low costs. Its investment performance has been uneven over the years, reflecting the applied investment policies and rules as well as prevailing financial conditions.

In addition, it has long offered deferred group annuities with <b>guaranteed</b> <b>benefits</b> and periodic bonuses (with profits policies).
