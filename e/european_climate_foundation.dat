40|$|Loyola de Palacio Programme on Energy PolicyIf Europe {{is serious}} about climate change, it has to reduce its overall {{greenhouse}} gas emissions by 80 % by 2050, thereby effectively going to a (near-) zero carbon energy and thus, electricity system. The <b>European</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Foundation,</b> Eurelectric, and the International Energy Agency have consequently published a study elaborating on the final goal of this transition. The studies project scenarios of how such a (near-) zero electricity system would look like and provide recommendations on the policies needed to guide the transition. In this paper, we observe that these studies tell a tale with many similarities. In spite of increased energy efficiency, the electricity demand is projected to increase substantially, with up to 50 % from today towards 2050, due to shifts from other sectors towards electricity. This demand will be supplied by a minimum of 40 % electricity generation by RES, with the remainder being filled up with nuclear and fossils with CCS. The importance of grid reinforcement, expansion, and planning {{in this context is}} emphasized in all three studies. While all three studies further recommend relying on the EU ETS for the transition, the <b>European</b> <b>Climate</b> <b>Foundation</b> and the International Energy Agency consider continuing with targets for RES in combination with a more harmonized EU RES support scheme...|$|E

This strategy is the outcome of their collaboration and, at the same time, it is what makes up the collaboration.

40|$|Climate {{science is}} coming under {{increasing}} pressure to deliver projections of future climate change at spatial scales {{as small as}} a few kilometres for use in impacts studies. But is our understanding and modelling of the climate system advanced enough to offer such predictions? Here we focus on the Atlantic–European sector, and on the effects of greenhouse gas forcing on the atmospheric and, to a lesser extent, oceanic circulations. We review the dynamical processes which shape <b>European</b> <b>climate</b> and then consider how each of these leads to uncertainty in the future <b>climate.</b> <b>European</b> <b>climate</b> is unique in many regards, and as such it poses a unique challenge for <b>climate</b> prediction. Future <b>European</b> <b>climate</b> must be considered particularly uncertain because (i) the spread between the predictions of current climate models is still considerable and (ii) Europe is particularly strongly affected by several processes which are known to be poorly represented in current models. ...|$|R
