40|$|The {{number of}} <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> in academia is growing {{due to the}} {{increasing}} proportion of women with a doctoral degree and the greater propensity of women to choose another academic as their partner.

These couples have daily issues that constantly arise and cause conflict between the <b>couples.</b> Iranian <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> also face the same daily issues in balancing work and family life. But, for this particular population the collectivist cultural component in the Iranian culture intensifies these daily issues. This project is designed to assist second generation Iranian <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> in working through three particular issues that <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> face {{on a daily}} basis. These issues include: gender roles, lack of communication skills, and values within social and economic class statues. As a collectivist culture the Iranian culture {{plays an important role in}} identifying gender roles between males and females. The Iranian culture also influences the way people communicate. Based on cultural components, Iranians tend to talk in a way that is unclear to listeners. They tend to fear saying exactly what they mean. These communication barriers lead to unresolved conflict between Iranian <b>dual</b> career <b>couples.</b> And finally within the Iranian culture, social and economic class has become a value embedded in the daily values of the Iranian <b>dual</b> career <b>couple.</b> Understanding to what extent social and economic class status influences their life and their values will allow Iranian <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> to understand how to balance is issue within their daily values. ??? This project is designed in a way to allow couples to look at the roles they play, understand how they communicate, and be able to evaluate their values and conflict resolution styles.

50|$|Packard's {{successful}} {{development of}} its own automatic transmission was unique; no other independent (non-Big Three) automaker managed such a feat. The company's worsening situation throughout the 1950s, however, did not permit sufficient funds {{to keep up with}} the transmission development of the larger companies; Packard's attempts to update the Ultramatic were not sufficiently tested to iron out the problems, and those problems did damage to the company's reputation. Some automotive historians have argued that Packard should have dropped the Ultramatic after 1954, and purchased a more modern transmission design from another manufacturer but such opinions prove worthless when considering Packard's use of a locking torque converter was not only up to date but ahead of its time. In addition, the only true new modern transmission to appear was the <b>Dual</b> <b>Coupling</b> Hydra-Matic but that did not appear until 1956 and had serious teething problems {{of its own}}. In retrospect Packard's Twin Ultramatic's most serious design flaw was during the low to high shift transition where a poorly timed high clutch application and low band release over much of the allowable upshift range resulted in many premature high clutch failures. This situation resulted in an unusual sensitivity to individual driving habits determining useful clutch life. Therefore, while this transmission was certainly designed to physically accept a high torque V8, its control system likely needed another year of development.|$|E

This shift {{arrangement with the}} [...] "S" [...] only applies to floor shift Pontiacs and all Pontiacs in 1964. In previous Pontiacs including 1963 models with column shift the shift quadrant read 'DR' which refers {{back to the old}} Dual Range nomenclature which means drive left is fourth range and drive right is 3rd range. In the earlier four-speed Hydra-Matic, the [...] "S" [...] or [...] "Super" [...] quadrant (only used by Oldsmobile and floor shift Pontiacs and all 1964 Pontiacs) was actually third gear, allowing 1-2-3 shifts. This nomenclature was also used by Mercedes-Benz with the introduction of the four-speed type-3 automatic transmission. As with the Hydra-Matic, the [...] "L" [...] position was actually 1st and 2nd gears, holding the transmissions from shifting above 2nd gear. In Roto the L position meant 3.50 as first range, changing due to 2.93. Roto engineers consider this two driving ranges.On Pontiac's with the exception 1964 model and all floor shift automatics, the shift indicator reads the same for Roto or the Super HydraMatic (<b>dual</b> <b>coupling)</b> and that is; 'DR' drive left and drive right or fourth range left and drive right 3rd range. Remember Roto HydraMatic is considered by HydraMatic Division as a three speed four range automatic and that is why the shift quadrant is the same between the 4 speed Super HydraMatic and the Four range Roto HydraMatic.|$|E
5000|$|Roto Hydramatic (sometimes spelled Roto Hydra-Matic or Roto-Hydramatic) was an {{automatic}} transmission built by General Motors and used on some Oldsmobile and Pontiac and Holden models from 1961 - 1965. It {{was based on}} the earlier, four-speed Hydramatic, but was more compact, providing only three forward speeds plus a small 8" [...] fluid coupling with a stator inside of the fluid coupling. Oldsmobile, one of the users of this transmission, called the fluid couplings stator the [...] "Accel-A-Rotor." [...] The lightweight, aluminum-cased transmission was sometimes nicknamed the [...] "Slim Jim." [...] HydraMatic Division calls the Roto a four range, three gear HydraMatic. It counts the stator multiplication @ 3.50 to one as a first gear, and when road speed and the two coupling halves speed match, it counts the same gear with fluid now passing straight through the stator as 2nd gear at 2.93 to one. 2nd gear or third range has a ratio of 1.56 and because the fluid coupling is drained for this gear ratio making the front clutch apply makes this a rare automatic that is in FULL mechanical lock-up (coupling drained) in second gear. Fourth range the coupling fills releasing the front clutch makes a ratio of 1 to 1. This transmission, like single and dual range, and <b>dual</b> <b>coupling</b> hydramatics also have the feature of split torque in the transmission whereby in fourth or high gear only 40-to 50% depending on transmission, 40% in Roto's case, but because of the design the coupling is only required to carry 40% of the engine torque. The rest is (60%) is in full mechanical connection making these hydramatics the most efficient automatic until the wide spread use of the lock-up torque converter.|$|E

ANTECEDENTS AND OUTCOMES OF WORK-FAMILY INTERFACE Work and family conflicts have emerged as an increasingly important research topic in the last few decades.

Not exempt from it, {{it is possible to}} understand the need for management models of people who are in harmony with the desires of <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> who are part of organizations. If in the 1980 s the existence of <b>dual</b> career <b>couples</b> was not so common in Brazil, nowadays organizations increasingly receive these couples, which impacts the need for people management models to keep up with these social changes. Therefore, the model recognizes that the personal dimension (impacts) on the organizational context cannot be avoided, and also that other factors affect both spheres (personal and organizational) when referring to the normative roles that permeate these areas. The main intention of this essay is to construct a theoretical model of dual career to consider the factor - organization, as vital to understand (and accept) the need to consider other dimensions on the dual career analytical perspective. The first evidences of dual career studies in Brazil revealed that the look at this movement only from the individual's margin is limited.
