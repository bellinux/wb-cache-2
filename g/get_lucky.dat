25|$|British {{engineers}} quickly began {{digging in}} batteries on the hornwork hill, the first battery was finished on 22 September but hoping to <b>get</b> <b>lucky</b> again, Wellington ordered {{an attack on}} the night of 22/23 September before his guns had fired a shot. Men of the 1st and 6th Divisions rushed forward against the palisades with axes, followed by men with just five ladders to scale the 24 foot wall, they failed to receive the support of other troops and were easily repelled with 150 of the 400 men killed and wounded. The engineers then began digging a mine 60 feet to get under the fort's west wall. When this was detonated {{in the early hours of}} the 29 September, part of the wall collapsed, the advanced party of British dashed forward but were not supported and were soon driven back from the defences. It turned out that the mine was run under an ancient buried wall that was in front of the modern wall. Consequently, the main French defenses were unscathed by the explosion.|$|E
25|$|The Jolson Story {{had been}} a huge hit in the United Kingdom, and Garrett and husband Larry Parks decided to {{capitalize}} on its popularity by appearing at the London Palladium and then touring the UK with their nightclub act. Its success prompted them {{to return to the}} country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. Garrett was then cast opposite Janet Leigh and Jack Lemmon in My Sister Eileen, a 1955 musical remake of a 1942 film starring Rosalind Russell, when Judy Holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. The following year she and Parks replaced Holliday and Sydney Chaplin in the Broadway production of Bells Are Ringing during their vacation from the show. Over the next two decades she worked sporadically, appearing on Broadway in two short-lived plays (Beg, Borrow or Steal with Parks and A Girl Could <b>Get</b> <b>Lucky</b> with Pat Hingle) and a musical adaptation of Spoon River Anthology, and making guest appearances on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Lloyd Bridges Show, and The Fugitive.|$|E

25|$|At the 1973 US Open, Evert {{started off}} hot {{by winning the}} first two games, but Court quickly stormed back to win the next five games, which allowed her to fend off Evert in a narrow win of the first set 57. Evert made many passing shots against Court in the second set, which was due to poor tactics by her {{opponent}} by coming into net, and this made Court’s error total go up allowing Evert to string together five straight games in a 62 set. Conversely, Court {{went back to the}} game plan she used to win the first set in the final and decisive third set. During the set Court won the first game and Evert took the next, which Court would win three games in a row breaking Evert’s serve in the four game and going out to a lead of 41, which during one game in the Court fell behind 1540, but would <b>get</b> <b>lucky</b> when Evert missed a smash and the next point was won by Court win an ace. The set and the finals appearance eventually went to Court, who defeated Evert 26 in the set.|$|E
500|$|The {{crews were}} bound to <b>get</b> <b>lucky</b> eventually, and this came {{to pass on the}} night of 22/23 July 1940, when a Blenheim IF of the FIU {{received}} direction from the Poling CH station and picked up the target at [...] range.

2500|$|In {{order for}} the EMH defence to make sense, [...] would {{have to show that}} [...] small number of investors that beat the market in the long-run are not doing so because they are skilled but rather that they are lucky. How would they show this? Frankly, it is {{impossible}} to prove either way. But it strikes me as a very silly argument. We could just as easily apply it to [...] poker players. We could say [...] "Oh, they are not really skilled, they are just lucky. They are just a statistical anomaly." [...] Moving on from this, we could say this about anything and everything. We could say this about professional football players, master chefs and seminal guitar players. None of these people, by EMH logic, should be seen as skilled. Rather, they are just <b>getting</b> <b>lucky</b> over and over again. The professional football players are just <b>getting</b> <b>lucky</b> every time they play well; the master chef is <b>getting</b> <b>lucky</b> every time he cooks a fabulous meal; and the seminal guitar player is just fortunate that his hands move {{in the way that they}} do.

2500|$|The {{success of}} [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] led CBS Records to renew Jones' {{recording}} contract and sparked {{new interest in}} the singer. He {{was the subject of}} an hour-and-a-quarter-long HBO television special entitled George Jones: With a Little Help from His Friends, which saw him performing songs with Waylon Jennings, Elvis Costello, Tanya Tucker, and Tammy Wynette, among others. Jones continued drinking and using cocaine, appearing at various awards shows to accept honors for [...] "He Stopped Loving Her Today" [...] arguably inebriated, like when he performed [...] "I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool" [...] with Barbara Mandrell at the 1981 Country Music Association Awards. [...] He was involved in several high-speed car chases with police, which were reported on the national news, and one arrest was filmed by a local TV crew; the video, which is widely available online, offers a glimpse into Jones' alter ego when drinking, as he argues with the police officer and lunges at the camera man. Conversely, when sober, Jones was known to be friendly and down to earth, even shy. [...] In a 1994 article on Jones, Nick Tosches remarked that when he first interviewed the singer in April 1976, [...] "One could readily believe the accounts by those who had known him for years: that he had not changed much at all and that he had been impervious to fame and fortune." [...] In an unusually unguarded self-appraisal in 1981, the singer told Mark Rose of The Village Voice, [...] "I don't show a lot of affection. [...] I have probably been a very unliked person among family, like somebody who was heartless. [...] I saved it all for the songs. [...] I didn't know you were supposed to show that love person to person. [...] I guess I always wanted to, but I didn't know how. [...] The only way I could would be {{to do it in a}} song." [...] Years later he commented to The Christian Broadcasting Network's Scott Ross about himself, [...] "I think you're mad at yourself, I think that you're sayin' to yourself 'You don't deserve this. [...] You don't deserve those fans. [...] You don't deserve makin' this money.' [...] And you're mad at yourself. [...] And you beat up on yourself by drinkin' and losing friends that won't put up with that...It's just one terrible big mess you make out of your life." [...] In 1982, Jones recorded the album A Taste of Yesterday's Wine with Merle Haggard; [...] while Jones, in the wake of his condition, appeared underweight on the album cover, his singing was flawless. [...] His run of hits also continued in the early 1980s, with the singer charting [...] "I'm Not Ready Yet", [...] "Same Ole Me" [...] (backed by the Oak Ridge Boys)", [...] "Still Doin' Time", [...] "Tennessee Whiskey", [...] "We Didn't See a Thing" [...] (a duet with Ray Charles), and [...] "I Always <b>Get</b> <b>Lucky</b> with You", which was Jones' last number one in 1984.|$|E
