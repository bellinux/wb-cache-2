5|$|By 1986, Angola {{began to}} assume a more central role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War, with the Soviet Union, Cuba and other Eastern bloc nations {{enhancing}} support for the MPLA government, and American conservatives beginning to elevate their support for Savimbi's UNITA. Savimbi developed close relations with influential American conservatives, who saw Savimbi as a key ally in the U.S. effort to oppose and rollback Soviet-backed, undemocratic governments around the world. The conflict quickly escalated, with both Washington and Moscow seeing it as a critical strategic conflict <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cold</b> War.|$|E
