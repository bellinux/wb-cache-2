40|$|Objectives: The {{current study}} was {{designed}} to see how hearing-impaired individuals <b>judge</b> <b>level</b> differences between speech sounds with and without hearing amplification. It was hypothesized that hearing aid compression should adversely affect the user's ability to <b>judge</b> <b>level</b> differences. Design: Thirty-eight hearing-impaired participants performed an adaptive tracking procedure to determine their level-discrimination thresholds for different word and sentence tokens, as well as speech-spectrum noise, with and without their hearing aids. Eight normal-hearing participants performed the same task for comparison. Results: Level discrimination for different word and sentence tokens was more difficult than the discrimination of stationary noises. Word level discrimination was significantly more difficult than sentence level discrimination. There were no significant differences, however, between mean performance with and without hearing aids and no correlations between performance and various hearing aid measurements. Conclusions: There is a clear difficulty in judging the level differences between words or sentences relative to differences between broadband noises, but this difficulty was found for both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals and had no relation to hearing aid compression measures. The lack of a clear adverse effect of hearing aid compression on level discrimination is suggested to be due to the low effective compression ratios of currently fit hearing aids...|$|E

DECISION MAKING ON ABORTION ISSUES: THE ATTITUDINAL AND INTEGRATED MODELS by Wanqing Wang Master of Arts in Political Science California State University, Chico Fall 2011 For {{half of a}} century, {{scholars}} have paid considerable attention to the Supreme Court justices??? voting behavior. Previous research has suggested three ways to explain and predict Supreme Court justices??? decision making: the Legal Model, the Attitudinal Model, and the Integrated Model. Because state supreme courts are usually the court of last resort for most cases and they handle {{the vast majority of}} cases heard in the United States, to study state supreme courts judges??? decision making has substantial outcomes. In this study, using data from Brace and Hall???s <b>Judge</b> <b>Level</b> State Supreme Court Database, I estimate and evaluate state supreme court judges??? decisions on cases involving abortion from 1995 to 1998. Based on past research, I chose the four most important independent variables, namely judge???s ideology, judge???s gender, state ideology and judge???s term length, and I adopted two models in order to do comparative research. The first model is the Attitudinal Model, which includes the judge???s ideology and gender. The other one is the Integrated Model, which also considers state ideology and judge???s term length. The dependent variable in my study is state supreme court judges??? decisions on abortion issues. At the level of state supreme courts, judges who decide that a minor can get a bypass to obtain an abortion without parental involvement and that government funding should cover abortions are characterized as pro-choice advocates. Alternatively, if judges favored parental control and denied public abortion funding, their votes are coded as pro-life. Therefore, I coded 0 if the judge voted in a pro-life direction and 1 if the judge voted in the pro-choice position. Since the dependent variable is binary in nature, I use the Classification and Regression Tree analysis and logistic regression to examine the judges??? decisions. I found that based on the data, the four variables do not have a strong and direct impact on state supreme court judges??? votes and neither the Attitudinal Model nor the Integrated Model is a significant improvement over the other. Despite these results, this study is still useful for future research. Since a stable logistic regression usually requires more data, the insignificant logistic regression fit at a 5...|$|E

5|$|When {{taking an}} audition, a judge evaluates the idol over a 30-second period. The <b>judge's</b> {{interest}} <b>level</b> continuously decreases in 10% increments, but {{this can be}} increased with another minigame. The heart points obtained up to the audition {{are used in the}} minigame as the number of times the player is given to successfully appeal to the judge until all the points are exhausted. For instance, three heart points indicates the player will have three chances to increase a <b>judge's</b> interest <b>level.</b> At the end of the audition, a <b>judge's</b> interest <b>level</b> determines if the idol passes or not. If an idol passes the audition, he or she is chosen to do a televised performance of the song previously chosen. A performance serves to increase an idol's number of fans, which in turn can increase an idol's rank if enough fans have been obtained for a given rank. For example, an idol starts at rank F with below 10,000 fans, and the next level up is a rank E with between 10,001 and 99,999 fans. The ranks continue from D to C, B, A and finally S.|$|R

40|$|Issue: Every use of {{recycled}} glass, from container manufacturing through construction aggregate, requires specifications that include definitions of acceptable levels of contamination. For {{the development of}} reasonable yet effective specifications, {{an understanding of the}} nature of typical contaminants in glass is critical. This Best Practice describes some procedures for <b>judging</b> <b>levels</b> of contaminants in recycled glass and presents some of the issues to be considered when developing contaminant guidelines. Best Practice: Visual Classification. A visual classification procedure has been developed to <b>judge</b> the <b>level</b> of contaminants in recycled glass to be used as a construction aggregate. See Visual Inspection for Glass Construction Aggregate Best Practice. The classification procedure was developed during the Glass Feedstock Study (1) conducted by Dames & Moore consulting engineers in Seattle. The classification method facilitates a judgment of the percentage of contaminants in a two-dimensional area covered by a sample. Model specifications developed in that same study recommended applications for glass in construction aggregate allowing up to 10 % contaminants by visual classification. While 10 % may sound like a large percentage of contaminants, most of the contamination in recycled glass is usually paper labels, which actually constitute a very small percentage of the mass of a recycled glass stockpile...|$|R

In this further {{analysis of the data}} we ask the question “Can the effort required to converse in noise be used to estimate the experienced A-weighted noise level?” Design: The noise levels experienced during specific activities were obtained from the analysis of dosimetry results from personal noise exposure meters worn by study participants. The measured noise levels from particular events were compared to a subjectively judged ‘loudness rating’ reported by the person wearing the dosimeter during the measured event. Study sample: Volunteers (females = 20, males = 22) between 18 and 35 years (average age = 26. 8) willing to wear dosimeters and keep a simple activity log. Results: The relation between the objectively measured and the subjectively <b>judged</b> <b>levels</b> was consistent for the group over a large number of events.
