5000|$|Chemical {{engineering}} as {{a discipline}} that was developed out of those practising [...] "industrial chemistry" [...] in the late 19th century. Before the Industrial Revolution (18th century), industrial chemicals and other consumer products such as soap were mainly produced through batch processing. Batch processing is labour-intensive and individuals mix predetermined amounts of ingredients in a vessel, heat, cool or pressurize the mixture for a predetermined length of time. The product may then be isolated, purified and tested to achieve a saleable product. Batch processes are still performed today on higher value products, such as pharmaceutical intermediates, speciality and <b>formulated</b> <b>products</b> such as perfumes and paints, or in food manufacture such as pure maple syrups, where a profit can still be made despite batch methods being slower and inefficient in terms of labour and equipment usage. Due to the application of Chemical Engineering techniques during manufacturing process development, larger volume chemicals are now produced through a continuous [...] "assembly line" [...] chemical processes. The Industrial Revolution was when a shift from batch to more continuous processing began to occur. Today commodity chemicals and petrochemicals are predominantly made using continuous manufacturing processes whereas speciality chemicals, fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals are made using batch processes.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Environmental safety {{assessments}} {{for exposure}} of birds require {{the provision of}} acute avian toxicity data for both the pesticidal active substance and <b>formulated</b> <b>products.</b> As an example, testing on the formulated product is waived in Europe using an assessment of data for the constituent active substance(s). This is often not the case globally, because some countries require acute toxicity tests with every formulated product, thereby triggering animal welfare concerns through unnecessary testing. A database of 383 <b>formulated</b> <b>products</b> was compiled from acute toxicity studies conducted with northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) or Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) (unpublished regulatory literature). Of the 383 <b>formulated</b> <b>products</b> studied, 159 contained only active substances considered functionally nontoxic (median lethal dose [LD 50]> highest dose tested). Of these, 97 % had formulated product LD 50 values of> 2000 mg formulated product/kg (limit dose), indicating that no new information was obtained in the formulated product study. Furthermore, defined (point estimated) LD 50 values for <b>formulated</b> <b>products</b> were compared with LD 50 values predicted from toxicity of the active substance(s). This demonstrated that predicted LD 50 values were within 2 -fold and 5 -fold of the measured formulated product LD 50 values in 90 % and 98 % of cases, respectively. This analysis demonstrates that avian acute toxicity testing of <b>formulated</b> <b>products</b> is largely unnecessary {{and should not be}} routinely required to assess avian acute toxicity. In particular, when active substances are known to be functionally nontoxic, further formulated product testing adds no further information and unnecessarily increases bird usage in testing. A further analysis highlights the fact that significant reductions (61 % in this dataset) could be achieved by using a sequential testing design (Organisation for Economi...|$|E
