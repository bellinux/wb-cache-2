40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the results of a}} simulation study performed to elucidate the robustness of the Lindstrom and Bates (1990) approximation method under non-normality of the residuals, under different situations. Concerning the fixed effects, the observed coverage probabilities and the true bias and mean square error values, show that some aspects of this inferential approach are not completely reliable. When the true distribution of the residuals is asymmetrical, the true coverage is markedly lower than the nominal one. The best results are obtained for the skew <b>normal</b> <b>distribution,</b> and <b>not</b> <b>for</b> the <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> On the other hand, the results are partially reversed concerning the random effects.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to check if the {{implementation}} of the institutional in-vivo dosimetry protocol improved the accuracy of the dose delivery in Radiotherapy. Material and MethodsThe dose evaluation was performed for the two groups of patients. First group consisted 812 patients treated from January 1 st until June 30 th, 2001. Composition of targets was: head and neck – 285 patients, breast – 138, gynaecology – 251 and the lung – 26. The second group consisted 1571 patients irradiated from February 1 st, 2002 and included respectively: head and neck – 407, breast – 309, gynaecology – 681 and the lung – 309. Doses were calculated with the use of the Cadplan planning system and measured with semiconductor detectors: PTW Freiberg for photons 6 – 12 MV, Sun Nuclear Insured for photons 1 – 4 MV and 15 – 20 MV. The detectors were placed in a central axis at the entry. The institutional protocol implemented during the period between two evaluated groups of patients required that doses had to be measured during the first week of the treatment. The next measurement was performed in the middle of the radiotherapy course. Additional dose checks were done after any modification of the fields and on the request of the clinician or physicist. All fields were measured excluding the certain specific procedures. Measured doses were recalculated to the reference ICRU point using standard formulas. The following parameters were evaluated: N – the mean number of dose checks per patients, mean difference (in the groups) between measured Dm and calculated Dc doses: R=(Dm-Dc) /Dc* 100 % and SD – standard deviation (for one measurement). ResultsN= 4. 9 vs. 6. 0 (for the Ist vs. IInd group). The Mean R was respectively: − 1. 5 % vs. − 0. 5 % for head and neck; 3. 4 % vs. 2. 2 % for breast; 3. 4 % vs. 2. 2 % for gynaecology and − 2. 1 % vs. 2. 5 % for the lung. The SD was respectively: 6. 1 % vs. 5. 6 % for head and neck; 5. 8 % vs. 5. 4 % for breast; 7. 4 % vs. 6. 8 % for gynaecology and 6. 9 % vs. 9. 0 % for the lung. The Shapiro-Wilk and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests shoved <b>for</b> <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions.</b> Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Mann-Whitney U tests detected a significant difference between 1 st and the IInd groups on the p= 0. 005 for head and neck, gynaecology and the lung while only at p= 0. 05 for the breast respectively.

40|$|Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) {{refers to}} a group of rare genetic {{disorders}} characterized by cutaneous and extracutaneous fragility, blistering and subsequent scaring even after a mild mechanical stress. The hallmark feature of inherited EB is mechanical fragility. The illness is chronic, degenerative, difficult to treat and lethal. Although the most common symptom of EB is bullae of skin epithelium, blisters may arise on virtually any mucosal surface. Bullae usually heal, leaving atrophic scars. Digital fusion following scar formation is common, rendering the hands useless. 	Traditionally, EB is divided into three major types based on phenotype, mode of inheritance and genotype: EB-Simplex, Junctional-EB and Dystrophic-EB. More recently, a fourth form, Hemidesmosomal-EB, was introduced to describe EB in which blisters emerge in the dermal-epidermal circuit. Each major EB type has subtypes. Two major subtypes of Dystrophic EB are Dominant Dystrophic EB and Recessive Dystrophic EB. Dystrophic EB is probably {{the most common form of}} surgically treated EB. 	EB has become recognized as a multisystem disorder that poses a number of pre-, peri-, and postoperative challenges. Scars, strictures and stenoses are some of the problems that require surgical treatment. In addition, EB affects the oral-gastrointestinal system, creating the need for operative treatment and significantly affecting perioperative care. Patients with EB are a high-risk group for anesthesiology because of malnutrition, anemia, hypoproteinemia, dilated cardiomyopathy, and limited mouth opening. 	A multidisciplinary team approach to EB treatment is recommended. Preoperative preparation must be individualized, with special attention given to the potential anesthetic problems of patients with EB. When procedures under anesthesia are planned, it is best to coordinate as many surgical procedures as possible to avoid repeated anesthesia. 	Surgical care for EB patients at the Children's Hospital of Zagreb was for many years quite basic and was not codified into a uniform and standard procedure. In January 2005, the hospital adopted a team approach to treating EB, which led to implementation of a procedural consolidation concept (PCC). The standard approach of repeated sessions of anesthesia with no more than two surgical procedures performed each time was replaced by PCC, which involved scheduling multiple surgical approaches and procedures during the same session of anesthesia. PCC is based on multidisciplinary team-based treatment planning aimed at reducing the number of times that patients with EB are subjected to general anesthesia. 	In this study we analyzed whether PCC has been successful at reducing the number of anesthesia sessions without increasing complications or length of hospitalization. Records of 53 children with EB surgically treated at Children's Hospital of Zagreb between April 1999 and December 2007 were examined. Descriptive statistics, including average ±SD and range for number of surgical procedures, were used. Frequencies of complications were presented as absolute values and percentages. <b>For</b> <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions</b> of variables under considerations the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to test the significance of pre- and post-intervention outcomes. Results show that introduction of PCC reduced the number of general anesthesia sessions and the number of hospitalizations. It did not affect the range of complications and although it did increase the mean number of complications per anesthesia session, it did not affect the total hospitalization time. PCC should be considered an option in the treatment of children with EB...|$|R
40|$|A {{common problem}} in the older {{population}} is the risk of falling {{that might lead to}} injury, immobility, and reduced survival. Age-related neuronal changes, e. g. decline in grey- and white-matter, affect neuronal, cognitive, and motor functioning. The improvement of these factors might decrease fall events in elderly. Studies showed that the sole administration of video game-based physical exercise, a so-called exergame, or omega- 3 fatty acid (FA) may improve motor and/or cognitive functioning through neuronal changes in the brain of older adults. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the effects of a combination of exergame training with omega- 3 FA supplementation on the elderly brain. We hypothesize that an intervention using a combination approach differently effects on the neuronal structure and function of the elderly’s brain as compared to the sole administration of exergame training. The study is a parallel, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial lasting 26 weeks. Sixty autonomous living, non-smoking, and right-handed healthy older (> 65 years) adults who live independently or in a senior residency are included, randomized, and allocated to one of two study groups. The experimental group receives a daily amount of 13. 5 ml fish oil (including 2. 9 g of omega- 3 FA), whereas the control group receives a daily amount of 13. 5 ml olive oil for 26 weeks. After 16 weeks, both groups start with an exergame training program three times per week. Measurements are performed on three time-points by treatment blinded investigators: pre-intervention measurement, blood sample after 16 week, and post-intervention measurements. The main outcomes are motor evoked potentials of the right M. tibialis anterior (transcranial magnetic stimulation) and response-related potentials (electroencephalography) during a cognitive test. For secondary outcomes, reaction times during cognitive tests and spatio-temporal parameters during gait performance are measured. Statistics will include effects sizes and a 2 x 2 -ANOVA with normally distributed data or the non-parametric equivalent <b>for</b> data <b>not</b> fulfilling <b>normal</b> <b>distribution.</b> The randomized controlled study is the first to investigate the effectiveness of exergame training combined with omega- 3 FA in counteracting age- and behavioural-dependent neuronal changes in the brain.

40|$|Aims. To {{describe}} {{and explore the}} distribution of ocular biometric parameters of adult cataract patients in rural China. Methods. Three Lifeline Express Hospital Eye-Train missions of Peking University People’s Hospital in China were chosen. 3828 adult cataract patients aged 29 to 88 years with axial length (AL) less than 27. 0 [*]mm were enrolled. The ocular biometry including visual acuity (VA), intraocular pressure, AL, corneal power (K 1 and K 2), and corneal endothelial counting (CEC) were collected and analysis. Corneal radius (CR) was calculated from the corneal power. Results. The participants in Zhoukou of these three missions had the worse preoperative VA (p< 0. 001), the lowest K 1 (p< 0. 001), K 2 (p< 0. 001), and K (p< 0. 001) and the highest K 1 -K 2 (p< 0. 001), moreover AL/CR more closely to 3. 0. The AL, K 1 -K 2, and AL/CR were normally distributed. But the K 1, K 2, K, and CEC were <b>not</b> <b>normal</b> <b>distributions.</b> Except K 1, all parameters were positively skewed and peaked. Conclusion. Our study provides normative ocular biometry in a large, representative rural Chinese population. The AL is normally distributed with a positive skew and big kurtosis.
