5000|$|The F2000 is a gas operated, fully {{automatic}} and ambidextrous bullpup rifle. Both the safety system and trigger mechanism were adopted from the P90 personal defense weapon; the selector toggle is a rotating disc located below the trigger. The fire selector doubles as the weapon’s manual safety and secures the firearm against accidental discharge (the selector/safety disc has 3 settings: [...] "S"—safe, [...] "1"—semi-automatic mode, [...] "A"—{{fully automatic}} fire). The [...] "safe" [...] setting disables the trigger. The <b>hammers,</b> group <b>pins,</b> and springs are steel while all other components are nylon injection molding. The {{shell of the}} rifle is made of composite materials.|$|R
50|$|A {{firing pin}} is a {{lightweight}} part, which serves to {{transfer energy from}} a spring-loaded hammer to the primer, while a striker is usually heavier, and is directly connected to the spring providing the energy to impact the primer. Striker mechanisms are generally simpler, since they combine the functions of <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin</b> in one.|$|R
5000|$|Rumble {{is similar}} to Puzzle Bobble; players launch multicolored balls {{in order to make}} groups of three or more.

As they can for sword fighting, players can purchase weapons to enhance their rumbling. Players start with their only hands, but can purchase bludgeons which send different, more complex patterns of balls to their opponents. Bludgeons include gaffs, brass knuckles, <b>hammers,</b> belaying <b>pins,</b> and chains, among others. There is a variant of Rumble called Boxing that is played with only one ball instead of the usual two, but is otherwise identical.|$|R
40|$|Ten {{kinds of}} rice flours were {{prepared}} by several milling methods including <b>hammer</b> mill, <b>pin</b> mill and blade mill. The rice flours were mixed with vital gluten (8 : 2) {{and used for}} bread making. Mean particle size of the rice flours ranged from 40. 9 μm to 407. 2 μm and damaged starch content from 6. 1 % to 27. 1 %. Specific volume of the breads ranged from 1. 98 mL/g to 3. 82 mL/g. Correlation of rice flour properties and bread qualities were analyzed. Negative correlation was found between amount of damaged starch and specific volume (r=− 0. 670, p< 0. 05). Mean particle size of the flour was not correlated with specific volume. ...|$|R
50|$|The most {{utilized}} grinding mills include <b>pin,</b> <b>hammer,</b> and disk mills, {{but many}} machines are utilized for more specific processes. To maintain a high starch extraction, the grains {{will go through}} a degermination process. This process removes the germ and fiber (pericarp) first, and the endosperm is recovered in several sizes: grits, cones, meal, and flow. It {{is important to note}} that the gluten protein matrix is not separated from the starch.|$|R
50|$|To load this weapon {{the hammer}} is cocked. As the hammer rotates on its axis pin, it acts upon the trigger, and the sear snaps into the cocking notch, holding the hammer. The <b>hammer</b> axis <b>pin</b> also {{supports}} the center {{arm of the}} barrel holding lever, which arm emerges and is raised high enough by its spring to press into a slot under the barrel. The rising thumbpiece {{on top of the}} barrel over the breech is then pushed forward. The barrel moves forward until its muzzle emerges from the barrel housing, compressing the recoil spring. The barrel holding lever is snapped into the locking notch in the underside of the barrel, thereby holding it in forward position for charging as shown in the drawing from Mannlicher Rifles and Pistols, Smith, 1947, page 189.|$|R
25|$|The {{mechanism}} of semi-automatic (or autoloading) firearms is usually {{what is known}} as a closed-bolt firing system. In a closed-bolt system, a round must first be chambered manually before the weapon can fire. When the trigger is pulled, only the <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin</b> move, striking and firing the cartridge. The bolt then recoils far enough rearward to extract and load a new cartridge from the magazine into the firearm's chamber, ready to fire again once the trigger is pulled.|$|R
50|$|Each string {{is wound}} around a tuning pin, {{normally}} {{at the end}} of the string closer to the player. When rotated with a wrench or tuning <b>hammer,</b> the tuning <b>pin</b> adjusts the tension so that the string sounds the correct pitch. Tuning pins are held tightly in holes drilled in the pinblock or wrestplank, an oblong hardwood plank. Proceeding from the tuning pin, a string next passes over the nut, a sharp edge that is made of hardwood and is normally attached to the wrestplank. The section of the string beyond the nut forms its vibrating length, which is plucked and creates sound.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACTCassava flour has a {{wide range}} of uses and its product {{stability}} is a major advantage in exploiting its potentials for opening into new markets beyond the normal use of fresh roots and traditional food products. This study therefore examined appropriate processing methods to meet consumer needs. Dry cassava chips were obtained from the cassava breeding unit of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Ibadan, Nigeria. 1 kg sample of chips was milled in each of <b>pin,</b> <b>hammer,</b> attrition and mortar mills. The flour recovered from each mill was weighed and sieved with 0. 55 mm and 0. 05 mm sieve apertures to compare the level of losses and final recovery percentage for each mill. The flour obtained, using the sieves for the different mills, was cooked for 5 min by mixing 200 ml of cassava flour with 400 ml of water. Sensory evaluation was conducted to assess the taste, texture, colour, plasticity and general acceptability of the cooked flours. The percentage flour recoveries were 96, 87, 75 and 62 respectively for <b>pin,</b> <b>hammer,</b> attrition and mortar mills. The results from sensory evaluation showed preference for the quality of cooked cassava flour from pin mill followed by those from hammer, attrition and mortar mills. There were significant differences (p< 0. 05) in the quality of the cassava flour from the various milling machines. These results therefore suggest that products from the pin mill may be a better alternative to the popular hammer mill...|$|R
5|$|In the {{smelting}} {{process of}} using huge bellows driven by waterwheels, {{massive amounts of}} charcoal {{were used in the}} production process, leading {{to a wide range of}} deforestation in northern China. However, by the end of the 11th century the Chinese discovered that using bituminous coke could replace the role of charcoal, hence many acres of forested land in northern China were spared from the steel and iron industry with this switch of resources. Iron and steel of this period were used to mass-produce ploughs, <b>hammers,</b> needles, <b>pins,</b> nails for ships, musical cymbals, chains for suspension bridges, Buddhist statues, and other routine items for an indigenous mass market. Iron was also a necessary manufacturing component for the production processes of salt and copper. Many newly constructed canals linked the major iron and steel production centers to the capital city's main market. This was also extended to trade with the outside world, which greatly expanded with the high level of Chinese maritime activity abroad during the Southern Song period.|$|R
50|$|The first {{physicians}} to devote entirely to neurology were Moritz Heinrich Romberg, William A. Hammond, Duchenne de Boulogne, Jean-Martin Charcot and John Hughlings Jackson. Physicians {{could use the}} ideas of neurology in practice only if they developed proper tools and procedures for clinical investigation. This happened step by step in the 19th century - tendon <b>hammer,</b> ophthalmoscope, <b>pin</b> and tuning fork, syringe and lumbar puncture. X rays, the electro-encephalography, angiography, and CAT scans were to follow. The clinical neurologists correlated their findings after death {{with those of the}} neuropathologist. The best known was W.R. Gowers (1845-1915) who owned a major text in two volumes, of a cerebrospinal tract.By {{the end of the nineteenth}} century, the connection was established between stroke and hemiplegia, between trauma and paraplegia, between the spirochaete and the paralysed demency people who filled the mental hospitals. The first chemotherapeutic cure of a serious infection was salvarsan for syphilis, followed by the induction of fever in neurosyphilis. The treatment of neurosyphilis became highly effective when antibiotics were introduced.|$|R
50|$|When {{the trigger}} is pulled, an {{electronic}} microswitch sends {{a signal to}} the marker's electronic board telling it to begin the firing sequence. The board then actuates the solenoid which is provided with air from the LPR. When the solenoid valve is actuated, air that normally holds the hammer in the full-back position is re-routed through the ram assembly and now drives the hammer forward at a rapid rate. The <b>hammer</b> then <b>pins</b> open the valve for a period of 6-16ms(this time is called the dwell). Since the marker's bolt is linked to the hammer, it travels forward at the same time carrying a paintball forward, passed the detents, into the firing position. Air travelling upwards through the, now open, valve is routed through the bolt and the paintball is shot out the barrel through a combination of air pressure and kinetic energy imparted from the bolt movement. Once the dwell time has passed, the solenoid returns the hammer (and thus the bolt) to the full-back position by routing the LPR-sourced air back through the default passage.|$|R

50|$|Lock time is {{the time}} between {{the release of the}} sear and the {{ignition}} of the cartridge. A lengthy lock time gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the lock time and reduce the window for error. Reductions in lock time are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin</b> or striker, shortening to distance parts that move as part of the firing operation have to cover, and using a more powerful spring. Further reductions in lock time, to near zero levels, can be achieved with electrical primers.|$|R

On his return he joined the Communist Party at Cambridge in 1931. There Guest became the head of a party cell that included John Cornford, Guy Burgess, Donald Maclean, Victor Kiernan and James Klugmann.

5000|$|After a full {{magazine}} is inserted, the slide is fully retracted and released. This action cocks the hammer, strips a cartridge from the magazine, and chambers it. Rotating the three-position safety lever fully downward, exposing a red warning dot between {{the receiver and}} the <b>hammer</b> pivot <b>pin,</b> renders the pistol ready to fire. Rotating the lever upward to its center position covers the red dot and engages the sear block (allowing [...] "cocked and locked" [...] carry). Finally, rotating the safety lever fully upward decocks the hammer by releasing the sear and intercepting the hammer's forward movement. This position allows safe carry of the pistol with a round in the chamber.The hammer must then be cocked manually and the safety disengaged before a round can be fired. As the trigger is pulled in this state, the trigger bar rotates the sear, a lug on the sear disengages the firing pin safety located directly above it, and {{the opposite side of}} the sear releases the hammer. The hammer then impacts the firing pin, the firing pin impacts the primer of the cartridge, and the shot is fired.|$|R
5000|$|The Sharps-Borchardt Model 1878 is a single-shot hammerless falling-block action rifle {{designed}} by Hugo Borchardt and {{made by the}} Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company. It closely resembles older Sharps Rifles but has a firing mechanism that uses a hammerless striker rather than a <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin</b> like the old Sharps Rifle. This hammerless dropping-block breech-loader {{was based on a}} patent granted to Hugo Borchardt in 1877. It was the last of the Sharps single-shot rifles, and the Borchardt did not sell very well. According to company records 22,500 rifles were made in all models from 1877 until the Sharps Rifle Co. closed down in 1881. Although it was designed for the huge black powder [...] "buffalo" [...] cartridges of the day, it came too late, {{at the very end of}} the great bison slaughter.|$|R
50|$|Probably no {{invention}} {{connected with}} firearms has wrought such {{changes in the}} principle of gun construction as those effected by the “expansive cartridge case.” This invention has completely revolutionized the art of gun making, has been successfully applied to all descriptions of firearms, and has produced a new and important industry: that of cartridge manufacture. Its essential feature is preventing gas escaping the breech when the gun is fired, {{by means of an}} expansive cartridge case containing its own means of ignition. Previous to this invention shotguns and sporting rifles were loaded by means of powder flasks and shot bags or flasks, bullets, wads and copper caps, all carried separately. One of the earliest efficient modern cartridge cases was the pinfire cartridge, developed by French gunsmith Casimir Lefaucheux in 1836. It consisted of a thin weak shell made of brass and paper that expanded from the force of the explosion. This fit perfectly in the barrel, and thus formed an efficient gas check. A small percussion cap was placed {{in the middle of the}} base of the cartridge, and was ignited by means of a brass pin projecting from the side and struck by the <b>hammer.</b> This <b>pin</b> also afforded the means of extracting the cartridge case. This cartridge was introduced in England by Lang, of Cockspur Street, London, about 1845.|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} {{the same time that}} the needle-fire system was developed, a pin-fire method was also developed. This method originally used a paper cartridge with a primer cap within a brass base, which quickly evolved into an all-brass cartridge. From the side, a stout pin was inserted into the cartridge above the cap. The gun’s <b>hammer</b> pushed the <b>pin</b> into the cap and set off the primer. A revolver using this method had a cylinder with chambers that were bored completely through with a slight channel where the pin rested. This type of cylinder was first patented in France in 1854. Loading these revolvers was accomplished by moving a loading gate that was mounted behind the cylinder. To remove the spent cartridges, a push-rod was used to back the cartridges out of the cylinder through the loading gate.|$|R
50|$|The {{firing pin}} {{mechanism}} {{was designed by}} Roger A. Hunziker. It {{is very similar to}} the system of Smith and Wesson revolvers. The firing pin is {{not a part of the}} hammer. Instead, it floats freely in the frame while under string pressure, so it does not rest against the percussion cap of any of the rounds in the cylinder. The hammer has a special feature: the trigger is not squeezed and thus will not be in contact with the firing pin. Instead, it rests a few millimeters back. There is also a transfer bar between the <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin.</b> This allows the hammer to hit the firing when the bar is up and the trigger is pulled. But when the trigger is not pulled, the firing pin cannot be hit3. This is why this system is called a transfer bar system.|$|R
5000|$|The Reising {{cost and}} weighed {{less than the}} Thompson because its metal {{components}} were mostly stampings instead of machined parts. Its low weight was due to its delayed blowback design, whereas most WW II submachine guns utilized the simple blowback principle. Simple blowback relies largely on the mass (weight) of the bolt to secure the cartridge when firing and therefore requires this component to be particularly heavy. ( [...] The 1928A1 Thomson had a more involved Blish lock system but this was similarly dependent on high bolt mass.) It was more balanced because the barrel-and-receiver-group rested concentrically within the stock. It had smoother lines because the stock was of conventional shape and the cocking handle (action bar) was placed inside the forearm. And it was more accurate because the closed-bolt only shifted the <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin</b> on firing, whereas the Thompson slammed home a heavy bolt and actuator.|$|R
50|$|The hammerless repeating rifle is {{a firearm}} that {{operates}} without any external <b>hammer</b> or firing <b>pin.</b> Hammerless firearms {{do not use}} a firing pin. This device was first introduced in 1879 with the Climax Safety Hammerless Gun, which was developed {{in order to prevent}} accidents from occurring while firing a weapon with a worn hammer/ firing pin. The hammerless rifle was further developed and Arthur Savage of the Savage Arms Company introduced a more perfected model in 1895. This rifle may be referred to as a six shooter repeating rifle, due to its capability to carry five rounds within the internal magazine as well as one round in the rifle's barrel. This modification to firearms reduces risk of injury to the operator, because of the enclosed firing pin. Older versions of the rifle had external hammers, which did not always remain cocked until the trigger was pulled. The Hammerless Rifle encloses this firing mechanism utilizes a “locking bar”, which secures not only the triggers, but also secures the “firing blocks” while the barrel is opened to discharge shells.|$|R
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{was made}} in two parts that were joined in the middle, similar to the US 3.5” Rocket Launcher. It {{was designed to be}} fired by a soldier while prone. The weapon itself had a bipod similar to the one on the Type 99 LMG (Light Machine Gun). The gunner lay with his body at approximately a 45 degree angle to the bore on the left side while the loader was similarly positioned on the other side. The pistol grip and trigger mechanism were attached to the rear half of the launcher. A cable ran from the trigger {{to the rear of the}} launcher where the hammer was located. The <b>hammer</b> and firing <b>pin</b> was mounted on an arm. The arm was above the bore and out of the way of loading the rocket when it was in the cocked position. Pulling the trigger pulled the pin holding the arm in position and the arm swung around under spring pressure, striking the primer and igniting the rocket.|$|R
5000|$|Winstone was {{not popular}} with the {{establishment}} at his secondary school, who considered him a bad influence. After some 12 months, he {{found that he was}} the only pupil not invited to the Christmas party and decided to take revenge for this slight. <b>Hammering</b> some <b>pins</b> through a piece of wood, he placed it under the wheel of his headmistress's car and blew out the tyre. For this, he was expelled. As a joke, he went up to the BBC, where his schoolmates were involved in an audition, and got one of his own by flirting with the secretary. The audition was {{for one of the most}} notorious plays in history - Alan Clarke's Scum - and, because Clarke liked Winstone's cocky, aggressive boxer's walk, he got the part, even though it had been written for a Glaswegian. The play, written by Roy Minton and directed by Clarke, was a brutal depiction of a young offender's institution. Winstone was cast in the leading role of Carlin, a young offender who struggles against both his captors and his fellow cons to become the [...] "Daddy" [...] of the institution. Hard hitting and often violent (particularly during the infamous [...] "billiards" [...] scene in which Carlin uses two billiard balls stuffed in a sock to beat one of his fellow inmates over the head) the play was judged unsuitable for broadcast by the BBC, and was not shown until 1991. The banned television play was entirely re-filmed in 1979 for cinematic release with many of the original actors playing the same roles. In a recent director's commentary for the Scum DVD, Winstone cites Clarke as a major influence on his career, and laments the director's death in 1990 from cancer.|$|R
