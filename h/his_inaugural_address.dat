5|$|By 1532, Calvin {{received}} his licentiate {{in law and}} published his first book, a commentary on Seneca's De Clementia.

25|$|Garfield's {{assassination}} {{was instrumental}} {{to the passage}} of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act on January 16, 1883. Garfield himself had called for civil service reform in <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> and supported it as President in the belief that it would make government more efficient. It was passed as something of a memorial to the fallen President. Arthur lost the Republican Party nomination in 1884 to Blaine, who went on to lose a close election to Democrat Grover Cleveland.|$|E

25|$|On Friday, {{hours before}} the {{scheduled}} Oath of Office ceremony in the Legislative Palace, the legislature erupted in a brawl. The incident was broadcast on live television.

Then, rather than deliver <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> to Congress (the traditional follow-up to the oath taking), he left through the back immediately after the National Anthem was sung, and delivered the address in the National Auditorium, filled with supporters.|$|E
25|$|Harding, in <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> <b>address</b> on March 4, 1921, {{called for}} a prompt and {{thorough}} revision of the tax system, an emergency tariff act, readjustment of war taxes, and creation of a federal budget system. These were policies Mellon wholeheartedly subscribed to, and his long experience as a banker qualified him to set about implementing these programs immediately. As a conservative Republican and a financier, Mellon was irritated by {{the manner in which}} the government's budget was maintained, with expenses due now and rising rapidly, with the failure of income or revenues to keep pace with those expense increases, and with the lack of savings.|$|E

25|$|In 1876, he {{supported}} Hayes for President, and Hayes named him Secretary of the Interior, following {{much of his}} advice in other cabinet appointments and in <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> <b>address.</b> In this department, Schurz put in force his belief that merit should be the principal consideration in appointing civil servants to jobs in the Civil Service. He was {{not in favor of}} permitting removals except for cause, and supported requiring competitive examinations for candidates for clerkships. His efforts to remove political patronage met with only limited success, however. As an early conservationist, he prosecuted land thieves and attracted public attention to the necessity of forest preservation.|$|E
25|$|He {{was sworn}} in as the President of India (25 July 1997) by Chief Justice J. S. Verma in the Central Hall of Parliament. In <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> <b>address,</b> he said: That the nation has found a {{consensus}} for its highest office in some one who has sprung from the grass-roots of our society and grown up in the dust and heat of this sacred land is symbolic {{of the fact that the}} concerns of the common man have now moved to the centre stage of our social and political life.

25|$|In <b>his</b> <b>inaugural</b> <b>address,</b> Polk {{called upon}} Congress to re-establish the Independent Treasury System under which {{government}} funds {{were held in}} the Treasury and not in banks or other financial institutions.

After personally winning the support of Senator Dixon Lewis, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Polk was able to push the Independent Treasury Act through Congress, signing it into law on August 6, 1846. The act provided that the public revenues were to be retained in the Treasury building and in sub-treasuries in various cities, separate from private or state banks, to receive all government funds. The system would remain in place until the passage of the Federal Reserve Act in 1913.|$|E
