40|$|The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) Hazardous Waste Facility Permit (HWFP) {{limits the}} {{allowable}} emissions of {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from contact handled (CH) transuranic (TRU) waste. The environmental Performance standard within the HWFP, Module IV, Table IV. D. 1, prescribes the allowed VOC emissions from the waste to ensure protection of {{human health and the}} environment. Compliance with the performance standard to ensure control of VOC emissions is based on VOC concentrations and monitoring in the underground. One of the mechanisms used to ensure compliance with the emissions standards is measuring the VOC concentration in the headspace gas of waste containers prior to disposal. Headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis is the waste characterization activity used to determine the concentration of VOCs in the headspace of waste containers. In addition to being used to demonstrate compliance with the emissions standards of Module IV, Table IV. D. 1, the results of the headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis are used to confirm the hazardous wastes identified in the acceptable knowledge (AK) process. Headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis has been an ongoing part of the CH TRU waste characterization program and therefore data are now available concerning its use and applicability. The information from approved Waste Stream Profile Forms (WSPFs) and the headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis results for over 16, 000 containers of CH TRU waste were considered as part of this study. The headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis results are based on data from the WIPP Waste Information System (WWIS).

The evaluation shows that the reliability of using the results of headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis to confirm AK information can be grouped by mixed and non-mixed waste streams. In general, for mixed waste streams due to VOCs (i. e., carrying VOC-related hazardous waste numbers), there is no reliable comparison that can be made for the detection of a particular target analyte and its associated hazardous waste number(s) based on the AK information on a compound by compound basis. However, for non-mixed waste streams, the results of headspace <b>gas</b> <b>sampling</b> and analysis show a better correlation to the AK information...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{incidents}} of hazardous accumulations of CO 2 in homes on or adjacent to reclaimed mine land {{have been shown}} to be linked to neutralization reactions between acidic mine drainage and carbonate material. An efficient and economic method is necessary to identify the presence of acid mine drainage- (AMD-) derived CO 2 on reclaimed mine land, prior to construction. One approach to identify the presence of AMD-derived CO 2 is to characterize stable carbon isotope ratios of soil CO 2. To do so, a viable method is necessary to acquire soil <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> for isotope ratio analysis. This paper presents preliminary investigations of the effectiveness of two methods of acquiring <b>gas</b> <b>samples</b> (sampling during soil flux measurements and using slam bar) for isotope analysis.

40|$|A novel inlet {{has been}} {{designed}} for selective <b>sampling</b> of <b>gas</b> and aerosol phases of volatile species from high-speed aircraft. A multistage flow system brings the flow nearly isokinetically towards the sampling port. Two small airfoil-shaped "blades" are placed close to the sample port to provide the flow conditions required for aerosol and <b>gas</b> <b>sampling.</b> Aerosols are sampled when these blades are positioned to operate the inlet as a counterflow virtual impactor (CVI). The design enables sampling of particles as small as 0. 1 w m from a high-speed aircraft under stratospheric conditions, a substantial improvement over that possible with previous CVI designs. For <b>gas</b> <b>sampling,</b> one of the blades is moved by a stepper motor to occlude the inlet opening and <b>gas</b> is <b>sampled</b> perpendicular to the bulk flow. Boundary layer suction is used to prevent the <b>sampled</b> <b>gas</b> from coming {{in contact with the}} impactor walls.
