[...] The estate was left in trust for his children, and his widow was left with an allowance of $60,000 per year. [...] He also left more than $1.5 million in life insurance, most of which went to the companies that he ran. [...] Only seven other men in the United States carried as much life insurance as Shevlin.

5000|$|Key person insurance, also {{commonly}} called <b>keyman</b> <b>insurance</b> and key man insurance, {{is an important}} form of business insurance. There is no legal definition for [...] "key person insurance". In general, it {{can be described as}} an insurance policy taken out by a business to compensate that business for financial losses that would arise from the death or extended incapacity of an important member of the business. To put it simply, <b>Keyman</b> <b>Insurance</b> is a standard life insurance, TPD insurance or trauma insurance policy that is used for business succession or business protection purposes. The policy's term does not extend beyond the period of the key personâ€™s usefulness to the business. <b>Keyman</b> <b>Insurance</b> policies are usually owned by the business and the aim is to compensate the business for losses incurred with the loss of a key income generator and facilitate business continuity. Key person insurance does not indemnify the actual losses incurred but compensates with a fixed monetary sum as specified on the insurance policy.|$|E

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with current topics of business insurance risks. The goal of thesis is to explore actual business risks {{in the world and}} ways of protection, analyze development of business insurance market in the Czech Republic, categorize business insurance risks and in conclusion describe selected insurance products in detail, which will influence the market structure of business insurance most in future I suppose. These product are Key person <b>insurance</b> (<b>Keyman),</b> Directors and Officers liability insurance (D&O) and Environmental insurance. My analysis showed that the most important global business risks currently are economic risks, business interruption risks and risks of natural disasters. Businessmen in the following period will have to deal primarily with the threat of regulation and compliance, maintain continued access to credit and recover from economic recession. The business insurance market is growing slightly and also provides great potential for growth in the future. Major trend in the field of business insurance last years is stagnation and decline of insurance rates. It can be expected that the structure of business insurance market will be affected mostly by liability insurance...|$|R

5000|$|In Australia, <b>Keyman</b> <b>Insurance</b> {{policies}} {{are generally not}} deductible unless used specifically for business revenue protection purposes. Claim proceeds in Australia if used for revenue purposes may be taxable and depending on the ownership of the policy, may trigger a Capital Gains Taxation Event. In the UK the main principles of Key Man Insurance taxation were outlined by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1944, Sir John Andersen. The [...] "Andersen Rules" [...] state [...] "Treatment for taxation purposes would depend upon {{the facts of the}} particular case and it rests with the assessing authorities and the Commissioners on appeal, if necessary, to determine the liability by reference to these facts. I am, however, advised that the general practice in dealing with insurances on the lives of employees is to treat the premiums as admissible deductions, and any sums received under a policy as trading receipts, if (i) the sole relationship is that of employer and employee; (ii) the insurance is intended to meet loss of profit resulting from the loss of services of the employee; and (iii) it is an annual or short term insurance. Cases of premiums paid by companies to insure the lives of Directors are dealt with on similar lines." ...|$|E
