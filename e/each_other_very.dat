25|$|One {{issue with}} the RNA world {{hypothesis}} is that synthesis of RNA from simple inorganic precursors is more difficult than for other organic molecules. One {{reason for this is}} that RNA precursors are very stable and react with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> slowly under ambient conditions, and it has also been proposed that living organisms consisted of other molecules before RNA. However, the successful synthesis of certain RNA molecules under the conditions that existed prior to life on Earth has been achieved by adding alternative precursors in a specified order with the precursor phosphate present throughout the reaction. This study makes the RNA world hypothesis more plausible.|$|E
25|$|Looking at the {{relationship}} between the Leslie L. Dan Pharmacy Building and its greater urban context, it is evident that this building {{plays a key role in}} the overall composition of its immediate landscape. Its stately concrete columns along with the elegant, fritted curtain wall glass, creates a strong relation between the Ontario Hydro Building to the south and the MaRS Centre diagonally opposite. The materials used throughout these three buildings are very similar and they complement <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> well in the greater scheme of things. This building serves an important role at this junction, as its ties together other buildings found on and outside of the campus, forming a harmonious composition in its downtown urban context; while gracefully establishes its presence and importance on the school campus, standing as a tall elegant, state-of-the-art facility for the Pharmacy Faculty of the University of Toronto.|$|E

25|$|Kyle Busch {{started on}} pole, and he, Matt Kenseth, and Jimmie Johnson took several turns leading {{through the first}} 70 laps as Kasey Kahne, Brad Keselowski, Kurt Busch, Austin Dillon, and others were caught up in early accidents. Joey Logano then took over the lead from Kyle Busch for a few laps, but yielded to Johnson and Kenseth. Meanwhile, Kurt Busch and Keselowski would {{continuously}} bump and race <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> hard because of an incident on pit road several laps before. This would ultimately lead to a caution for Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. running up into the wall after checking up for the ongoing battle between Busch and Keselowski. Kenseth retook the lead during pit stops under the caution, but quickly yielded to Logano after the restart. After another caution and restart, Johnson took over from Logano. Johnson, Logano, Hamlin, and Kenseth all faded soon after, and after lap 165, Greg Biffle, Marcos Ambrose, and A. J. Allmendinger became the new top-three. After another caution for a spin by Casey Mears, Ambrose won the race off of pit road to become the new leader. Kenseth and Johnson would get by Ambrose after several laps, but another caution would wave after Jamie McMurray got bumped into the wall by Dale Earnhardt, Jr.. After the restart, Kenseth would lose the lead to Johnson, then fade back to tenth after getting stuck on the outside.|$|E
500|$|During the 1990s and 2000s, Pixar {{gradually}} {{developed the}} [...] "Pixar Braintrust," [...] the studio's primary creative development process, {{in which all}} directors, writers, and lead storyboard artists at the studio look at each other's projects {{on a regular basis}} and give <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> candid [...] "notes" [...] (the industry term for constructive criticism). The Braintrust operates under a philosophy of a [...] "filmmaker-driven studio," [...] in which creatives help each other move their films forward through a process somewhat like peer review, as opposed to the traditional Hollywood approach of an [...] "executive-driven studio" [...] in which directors are micromanaged through [...] "mandatory notes" [...] from development executives ranking above the producers. According to Catmull, it evolved out of the working relationship between Lasseter, Stanton, Docter, Unkrich, and Joe Ranft on Toy Story.|$|E

Kelly, Sinatra and Munshin play three sailors on a 24-hour shore {{leave in}} New York whose romantic ambitions get {{them more than}} they bargained for. The film was a success both financially and critically. It won the Academy Award for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and screenwriters Comden and Green won the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Written American Musical. Like Orson Welles, Donen made his directorial debut at 25. Donen stated that Kelly was [...] "responsible {{for most of the}} dance movements.

500|$|From {{the middle}} of the 14th century, money that had {{previously}} been spent on luxury goods like lavish embroidery was redirected to military expenditure, and imported Italian figured silks competed with native embroidery traditions. [...] Varieties of design in textiles succeeded <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> rapidly, and they were more readily available than the more leisurely produced needlework. [...] The work produced by the London workshops was simplified {{to meet the demands of}} this deteriorating market. [...] The new techniques required less work and smaller quantities of expensive materials. [...] Surface couching replaced underside couching, and allover embroidery was replaced by individual motifs worked on linen and then applied to figured silks or silk velvets. Increasingly, designs for embroidery were derived directly from woven patterns, [...] "thus losing not only their former individuality and richness, but also their former ... story-telling interest." ...|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter John August {{identified}} with Will's character and adapted it after himself. In college, August's father died, and like Will, August {{had attempted to}} get to know him before his death, but found it difficult. Like Will, August had studied journalism and was 28 years old. In the film, Will says of Edward, [...] "I didn't see anything of myself in my father, and I don't think he saw anything of himself in me. We were like strangers who knew <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> well." [...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father. Burton also used the film to confront his thoughts and emotions concerning {{the death of his father}} in 2000: [...] "My father had been ill for a while... I tried to get in touch with him, to have, like in this film, some sort of resolution, but it was impossible." ...|$|E
500|$|Copland {{acknowledged}} that the acoustics at the premiere were [...] "shrill." [...] While Philharmonic Hall was being renovated in 1976 {{in an attempt to}} improve its sound, Harold C. Schonberg wrote, [...] "For all we know, Connotations is a masterpiece. But one thing is certain—it did not make many friends for Lincoln Center in 1962." [...] While admitting the work was [...] "written in Copland's austere, objective, abstract style," [...] he suggested that bad acoustics might have also played a part in the work's failure at the premiere. The orchestra that night had been augmented by a large chorus to perform the first movement of Gustav Mahler's Eighth Symphony, which pushed the orchestra forward, [...] "out of its normal playing position... The sound was bad, bad. The bass response was sorely deficient, the hall was plagued with echoes, the musicians on stage reported that they could not hear <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> well (just great for ensemble) and in general Philharmonic Hall sounded like a cheap hi-fi set with the bass speakers out of the circuit.|$|E

We lost half an hour there, waiting to help cord up the dead, but they finally embraced <b>each</b> <b>other</b> affectionately, and the trouble was over. The episode was interesting, but {{we could not have}} afforded all the time to it if we had known nothing was going to come of it but a reconciliation.

500|$|Curtis {{stated that}} casting an actor to play Van Gogh was done carefully, {{as he wanted}} him to feel to the {{audience}} as Van Gogh, not [...] "like a bloke they’ve seen acting lots of other parts, in an orange wig". Tony Curran was ultimately cast as the part; Curtis called him a [...] "wonderful actor" [...] who [...] "really could not look more like" [...] Van Gogh. Curran, Smith and Gillan got to know <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> well, which Gillan hoped would be evident in their chemistry in the episode. Bill Nighy appears uncredited as the Musée d'Orsay's expert on Van Gogh. Nighy was rumoured to have been considered {{for the role of}} the Ninth Doctor when the show was revived. Campbell stated that they were [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have Nighy in the role, who he believed was someone people paid attention to, and the audience needed to pay attention to his character as he said facts which would become important later in the story.|$|E
500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period when I grew up when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> well".|$|E
500|$|North of Cooma, {{the highway}} follows {{the same general}} path as the railway {{alignment}} {{as far as the}} area of Bunyan. From there, it continues along the same rough heading and crosses the Numeralla River just prior to its confluence with the Murrumbidgee River. The road then follows the Murrumbidgee downstream at some distance to its east. The highway continues on towards Bredbo and crosses the Bredbo River as it enters the village. The highway takes on the name Cooma Street through Bredbo and crosses over the railway yet again just north of the town. Further to the north, the road passes through Gungoandra Gap to the east of Round Hill. Mount Colinton is now visible to the highway's east, and a larger range known as the Clear Range is visible to west. The ridgeline of the Clear Range forms the eastern border of the ACT in this area. Heading further downstream, continuing the distant parallel of the Murrumbidgee, the road enters [...] and crosses the railway a final few times as the railway winds through the area. It does not enter the urban area of Michelago itself and instead passes {{to the west of the}} village.

She notes that one form may evolve into the other: [...] "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>very</b> much'". The distinction is comparable to that drawn by ethologists [...] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity", just as [...] "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".|$|E
