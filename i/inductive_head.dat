50|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are {{also present in}} magnetic domains in magnetic materials. A computer hard disk, for example, is made of a hard ferromagnetic material that contains regions of atoms whose magnetic moments can be realigned by an <b>inductive</b> <b>head.</b> The magnetization varies from region to region, and the misalignment between these regions forms boundaries that are key to data storage. The <b>inductive</b> <b>head</b> measures {{the orientation of the}} magnetic moments of these domain regions and reads out either a “1” or “0”. These bits are the data being read. Grain size is important in this technology because it limits the number of bits that can fit on one hard disk. The smaller the grain sizes, the more data that can be stored.|$|E
40|$|As {{the demand}} for high data rate (up to 1 Gb/s), high density (down to 1 sq micron/bit) tape {{recorder}} increases, the main investigation trend is an improvement of the well known helical scan concept. The drawbacks of this technology are also well known; sophisticated mechanics, head to tape contact, and wear problems. In our fixed head approach, the recorder mechanics is made much more simple, but the complexity is turned towards the integrated magnetic components, which have to record and reproduce hundreds of tracks in parallel. Our multiplexed write <b>inductive</b> <b>head</b> and magneto-optical readout head will be described, and the global system performances evaluated...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} silicon wafers with {{electroplated}} copper stud features were prepared using different electroplating durations. It {{was found that}} the electroplated copper studs grew in a mushroom-shaped profile. The height of the studs was approximately linear with electroplating time, as was the roughness of the crown of the studs. A new process was explored to optically view large features on a silicon wafer, based on cleaving of the wafer and examining the profile of the electroplated studs under a microscope. Keywords [...] - Copper Studs, Electroplating, Cleavage, Head Fabrication. I. Introduction T HE growth pattern of electroplated copper studs is an important issue for <b>inductive</b> <b>head</b> fabrication due to the importance of high conductivity of the studs for proper head functioning. Certain recent observations indicate that the electroplated copper studs may have a needlelike shape, while common belief would have it that the copper studs grow in a mushroom shape. In this study, we have e [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Keepered media {{refers to}} {{traditional}} magnetic media {{with the addition}} of a soft magnetic "keeper" layer adjacent to the recording layer. Numerous recent reports have shown performance improvements associated with keepered media read with <b>inductive</b> <b>heads.</b> This report examines performance changes associated with keepered media read with magneto-resistive heads. This report presents a simple model for MR head response based on imaging, and experimental data in qualitative agreement with this model. Signal and noise spectra for keepered media are also discussed at length, and an optimized keepered media is shown to screen low spatial frequencies, narrowing isolated read pulses. Lastly, substantial noise increases at low spatial frequencies for keepered media are shown, and a possible cause is briefly discussed...|$|R
5000|$|A {{write head}} magnetises a region by {{generating}} a strong local magnetic field, and a read head detects the magnetisation of the regions. Early HDDs used an electromagnet both to magnetise {{the region and}} to then read its magnetic field by using electromagnetic induction. Later versions of <b>inductive</b> <b>heads</b> included Metal In Gap (MIG) heads and thin film heads. As data density increased, read heads using magnetoresistance (MR) came into use; the electrical resistance of the head changed according {{to the strength of}} the magnetism from the platter. Later development made use of spintronics; in read heads, the magnetoresistive effect was much greater than in earlier types, and was dubbed [...] "giant" [...] magnetoresistance (GMR). In today's heads, the read and write elements are separate, but in close proximity, on the head portion of an actuator arm. The read element is typically magneto-resistive while the write element is typically thin-film inductive.|$|R
50|$|Exchange {{anisotropy}} {{was discovered}} by Meiklejohn and Bean of General Electric in 1956. The first commercial device to employ the exchange bias was IBM's anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) disk drive recording head, {{which was based on}} a design by Hunt in the 1970s but which didn't fully displace the <b>inductive</b> readback <b>head</b> until the early 1990s. By the mid-1990s, the spin valve head using an exchange-bias layer was {{well on its way to}} displacing the AMR head.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Measurements {{were made}} of {{recording}} medium noise in erased disks using an in-contact magnetoresistive element and an <b>inductive</b> <b>head</b> supported on an air bearing slider. Four types of coatings on aluminum disks were examined: thin, transition-metal al-loy film, CrO,, FeCo particle, and y-Fe,O:,. Results obtained by means of three measurement techniques are in qualitative agreement and indicate that: (1) dc-erased noi of alloy film disks is 14 to 20 dB {{lower than that of}} particulate disks measured; (2) dc-erased noise of particulate disks measured is 6 to 16 dB above their bulk-erased noise: (3) although dc noise of particulate disks increases with write current, dc noise of alloy film disks is independent of write current: (4) the shapes of the noise spectra are similar in dc-erased particulate y-Fe,O, disks and FeCo particle coated disks: and (5) significant modulation noise is detected on particulate disks but not on alloy film disks. The observed dc-erased noise spectrum is compared with the model for small particle noise and is then used to estimate the size of particle agglomerates or voids...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the study of}} digital {{information}} storage on tape takes a central place. Hereby a current {{is applied to the}} <b>inductive</b> <b>head,</b> which generates a magnetic field at the head gap. Depending on the field direction, the medium can be magnetized in a direction (anti) parallel to the tape motion. In this way it becomes possible to write a specific signal on a magnetic coating. The tendency to realize higher information storage densities in a smaller area, draws the attention of system designers strongly at the study of the parameters influencing the write and read process. In this thesis we more closely look at these parameters. The emphasis lies on the overwrite behavior. Herewith is meant the extent to which residues of the original signals, after it has been overwritten with new information, influence the new information. Further, track edges of partially overwritten tracks on a particulate and thin-film tapes have been studied. This analysis is of high importance for the understanding of the recording behavior at high track density. A limiting factor for high track density is the bad track edge definition. The thesis consists of two parts. The first part gives a recapitulation of the experimental and theoretical environment around which this research took place. In the second part (chapter 5 – chapter 9) the results are shown. After a general introduction a treatise is given of most important facets of recording theory. This is followed by a description of the experimental methods in chapter 3. Chapter 4 gives a synopsis of the model used, which is equipped with a hysteresis model, called the Moving-Preisach Stoner-Wohlfarth model. In chapter 5 a particulate tape is analyzed with respect to signal output and overwrite behavior. Modulation of the new signal (l = 0. 5 mm) by the original signal and residual signals in deeper layers of the magnetic coating are responsible for the overwrite behavior. These two effects are closely linked to each other. Applying larger currents to the <b>inductive</b> <b>head</b> result in larger write fields, which penetrate the magnetic coating more deeply. This effects in improvement of overwrite behavior. The wavelength dependence on overwrite shows that long wavelengths are more difficult to overwrite than short ones. Reduction of the (magnetic) coating thickness improves also the overwrite behavior. Furthermore, by modeling the influences of particle orientation, switching field distribution, coercivity, magnetization in the magnetic coating, the head-medium spacing, and gap length have been studied...|$|E

We used static magnetic measurements above the apparent Curie temperature of the Ferrite materials to determine the presence of such phases. High performance samples are non-magnetic at high temperature. In low performance materials, a small but non-zero spontaneous magnetization at high temperature indicates the presence of the second phase...|$|R

From inductive measurements magnetostatic parameters and the effective damping are derived and $j^{c 0 }$ {{is calculated based on}} spin transfer torque equations. The inductive values compare well to the values derived from current induced switching measurements on individual nanopillars. Using a wafer scale <b>inductive</b> probe <b>head</b> could in the future enable wafer probe station based metrology of $j^{c 0 }$...|$|R
40|$|A {{new set of}} {{constrained}} codes, {{referred to}} as (d, k/l) constrained partial response maximum likelihood (PRML) codes, is proposed. These new constrained codes combine the benefits of both (d, k) run length limited codes and (0, k/l) PRML codes, with seemingly promising applications in PRML read channels for today 2 ̆ 7 s head/media combinations, using thin-film media and <b>inductive</b> read <b>heads.</b> The rules for generating any (d, k/l) code are presented, the Shannon capacity is tabulated for the codes of practical interest with d= 1 and 2, and the encoding finite state transition diagram and state-independent decoder are designed for a rate 1 / 2, (1, 7 / 6) code. Some differences among (d, k) codes, (0, k/l) codes, (0, k/l/M) codes and (d, k/l) codes are also addressed...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} on tracking components {{throughout the entire}} manufacturing processes is to apply magnetic recording technology to storing key production data on the component itself. The system investigated uses “magnetic magnesium”, i. e. a magnesium matrix filled with hard magnetic particles. For storing the data, a classic <b>inductive</b> write <b>head,</b> consisting of a soft magnetic ring core with a write gap in the flux path and a coil for creating the magnetic flux is chosen. For an application in a machine environment, readout {{has to be done}} at a distance. On approach of such non-contact readout, an advantage of the Magneto-Optical Kerr Effect (MOKE), which senses the direction of magnetization of a reflecting surface, is to be taken. As in the case of data storage, information is encoded in the magnetization pattern of data tracks...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} an <b>inductive</b> probe <b>head</b> {{suitable for}} noninvasive {{characterization of the}} magnetostatic and dynamic parameters of magnetic thin films and multilayers on the wafer scale. The probe {{is based on a}} planar waveguide with rearward high frequency connectors that can be brought in close contact to the wafer surface. Inductive characterization of the magnetic material is carried out by vector network analyzer ferromagnetic resonance. Analysis of the field dispersion of the resonance allows the determination of key material parameters such as the saturation magnetization M-s or the effective damping parameter a(eff). Three waveguide designs are tested. The broadband frequency response is characterized and the suitability for inductive determination of Ms-s and a(eff) is compared. Integration of such probes in a wafer prober could in the future allow wafer scale in-line testing of magnetostatic and dynamic key material parameters of magnetic thin films and multilayers...|$|R
40|$|A {{castellated}} magnetoresistive {{structure has}} been fabricated and evaluated for its application as a multi-track tape replay head. It {{has a higher}} field sensitivity and is less susceptible {{to the effect of}} demagnetizing fields at its edges than a conventional 'straight' element magnetoresistor. The inherently noisy magnetoresitive response attributed to its multi-domain structure has been found to reduce substantially as its film thickness is decreased below 250 Å. The unshielded castellated structure is simple to fabricate and offers an integral tape flux guiding system. Initial simple tape tests show that its replay performance compares favourably with the Philips DCC yoke-type MR replay head. A multi-track single turn thin-film <b>inductive</b> write <b>head</b> has been fabricated and tested. The head is built from a sandwich of two substrates each having an array of thin-film permalloy poles. The lower pole array is constructed with the patterned winding and gap layers, and the upper pole array with the front and rear permalloy yoke layers. The poles are optically aligned and the substrates glued together to complete the write structure...|$|R
40|$|Active {{magnetic}} bearing (AMB) systems support rotating shafts without any physical contact, using electromagnetic forces. Each radial AMB uses {{two pairs of}} electromagnets at {{opposite sides of the}} rotor. This allows the rotor to float in the air gap, and the machine to operate without frictional losses. In active magnetic suspension, displacement sensors are necessary to detect the radial and axial movement of the suspended object. In a high-speed rotating machine equipped with an AMB, the rotor bending modes may be limited to the operating range. The natural frequencies of the rotor can cause instability. Thus, notch filters are a useful circuit for stabilizing the system. In addition, commercial displacement sensors are sometimes not suitable for AMB design, and cannot filter the noise caused by the natural frequencies of rotor. Hence, implementing displacement sensors based on the AMB structure is necessary to eliminate noises caused by natural frequency disturbances. The displacement sensor must be highly sensitive in the desired working range, and also exhibit a low interference noise, high stability, and low cost. In this study, we used the differential <b>inductive</b> sensor <b>head</b> and lock-in amplifier for synchronous demodulation. In addition, an active low-pass filter and a notch filter were used to eliminate disturbances, which caused by natural frequencies. As a consequence, the inductive displacement sensor achieved satisfactory linearity, high sensitivity, and disturbance elimination. This sensor can be easily produced for AMB applications. A prototype of these displacement sensors was built and tested...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{results from}} {{an investigation of}} a variety of thin films with particular emphasis on their suitability for use as magnetic pole materials in <b>inductive</b> recording <b>heads.</b> Initially, the magnetic and structural properties of FeTaN and FeTiN were studied, and {{it was found that the}} transition metal elements were incorporated substitutionally into the bcc #alpha#-Fe crystal structure leading to an expanded lattice constant. Nitrogen was incorporated interstitially into the crystal structure in such a way that the average grain size was reduced to a value less than the ferromagnetic exchange length, thus making the alloy magnetically soft. Other previously unreported alloys were fabricated in a similar way, namely FeWN, FeCoN and FeCoTaN and it was noted that the addition of Co increased the saturation magnetisation of the alloy to around 20 kG but also increased the coercivity. In addition to these nano-crystalline alloys it was found that adding Ta to FeCo beyond around 17 at. % effected a crystalline to amorphous phase change but the alloy retained a saturation magnetisation that was directly related to the Co content. This new alloy, FeCoTa, has not been reported previously. It was found that by depositing these alloys in a magnetic field, anisotropy could be induced in all of them. The nitrided alloys had an anisotropy due to their interstitial nitrogen and the anisotropy of FeCoTa was directly linked to the Co content. After annealing it was found that several of the alloys were thermally unstable. FeTiN and FeCoN were both severely damaged by annealing at 150 deg. C for short periods of time. FeTaN, FeWN and FeCoTaN improved with magnetic annealing up to around 200 deg. C and FeCoTa was thermally stable up to around 250 deg. C. It was found that FeCoTa was twice as resistant to cross-annealing than the nitrided alloys. The best magnetic properties (4 #pi#M_s #approx# 20 kG, H_c#approx# 3 Oe, #rho##approx# 130 #mu##OMEGA#-cm, H_k#approx# 15 - 20 Oe were seen in the amorphous FeCoTa alloy and the author recommends that this alloy be further investigated for use as pole material in the next generation high data rate inductive writer.
