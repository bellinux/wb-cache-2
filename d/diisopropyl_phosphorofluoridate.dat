40|$|The esterases of rabbit lung {{have been}} {{investigated}} from two viewpoints, the cytochemical and the biochemical. To accomplish this objective, we designed and synthesized a series of ester substrates which provide both a cytochemical indicator of {{the location of the}} enzyme and a means of following the enzymatic activity in tissue homogenates and subfractions. The substrates are p-nitrophenylthiol esters which yield, upon hydrolysis, carboxylic acid and p-nitrothiophenol. The latter can react with aurous ions to give an electron-opaque deposit; in addition, the strong absorption of p-nitrothiophenol at 410 mµ permits continuous kinetic measurements. Thus, it is possible to correlate the intracellular site of action and the biochemical behavior of the esterases. The new substrates are the thiol analogues of the p-nitrophenyl esters frequently employed as esterase substrates. The rates of hydrolysis of the two series of esters are compared in vitro. During tissue fractionation, most of the esterase activity sediments with a particulate fraction. The effects of a number of common esterase inhibitors, such as <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> and eserine sulfate, are examined, and the effects of enzyme concentration and heat inactivation are shown {{with the use of the}} partially purified preparations. The cytochemical work shows that the esterase activity is most prominent in the lamellar bodies of the giant alveolar (type II, septal, or granular pneumatocyte) cells of the lung and to a lesser extent in squamous (type I, or membranous pneumatocyte) epithelial and endothelial cells. In both the cytochemical and biochemical studies, the enzymes are inhibited by <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> and phenyl methylsulfonyl fluoride but are insensitive to eserine sulfate...|$|E

40|$|An {{alkaline}} protease {{was found}} {{to be associated with the}} granulosis virus of the Indian meal moth. Plodia interpunctella. The protease was located within the protein matrix of the occluded virus and hydrolyzed the major constituent of this matrix, a 28, 000 -dalton protein (granulin), to a mixture of polypeptides ranging in molecular weight from 10, 000 to 27, 000. A rapid, sensitive assay for the protease was developed using radioactively labeled granulosis virus as substrate. With this assay, the proteolytic activity could be detected by measuring the release of acid-soluble peptides from the labeled virus. The protease had a pH optimum of 10. 5 and a temperature optimum of 40 degrees C and was inhibited by <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate,</b> phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and L-(1 -tosylamido- 2 -phenyl) ethyl chloromethyl ketone.

The enzyme was eluted from the Sepharose column as a single but rather broad peak at a position corresponding to a molecular weight of about 190, 000. The pH optimum for hydrolysis of heat-denatured casein was about 8. 0. It was inhibited to signifi-cant extents by various reagents including <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate,</b> phenyl-methanesulfonyl fluoride, iVMosyl-L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone, iVMosyl-L-lysine chloromethyl ketone, p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate, chymostatin, EDTA, EGTA, and o-phenanthroline.

The effects {{of a number of}} esterase inhibitors such as <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> were examined in both systems. Throughout lung development there is an increase in the rates of hydrolysis of thiol esters by lung homogenates. Fetal PNTA hydrolases are most abundant in the mesoderm and are widely distributed on membranes (i. e., Golgi complexes, nuclear envelopes, lipid droplets). The major sites of endodermal PNTA hydrolysis are lamellar bodies and their proposed precursors. PNTB hydrolases are more limited in distribution. Regardless of substrate used, adult esteratic activity is most prominent in lamellar bodies of type II epithelial cells.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{exposure}} to <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> (DFP), an irreversible inhibitor of cholinesterase enzymes, on the reproductive behavior, sensory-motor functioning, 2 ̆ 6 neuroanatomy of rats was examined. ^ Aside from differences in performance attributable to generalized malaise following exposure to DFP, the only differences in male sexual behavior were generalized decrements that developed in animals receiving multiple high doses of DFP with accompanying atropine sulfate and 2 -PAM prophylaxis. This decrement developed well after exposure had terminated and was not likely due to continued inhibition of cholinesterase. ^ No long-term differences attributable to DFP were noted in female sexual behavior. There was, however, a reduction in reproductive fecundity in female rats exposed to a single moderate dose of DFP without therapeutic treatment. ^ No long-term differences were detected in general sensory-motor capabilities nor was any neural degeneration noted using a stain for degenerating myelin. ^ The presence of late developing behavioral differences {{in the absence of}} blatant neuroanatomical degeneration suggests the possibility of a diffuse but pervasive pattern of neural damage following exposure to DFP. ...|$|E
40|$|Factor B (a {{component}} of the alternative pathway of complement) is believed to contain the proteolytic site of the complex enzymes C 3 convertase (C 3 bB) and C 5 convertase (C 3 bnB). Conflicting results have been obtained {{in regard to the}} inactivation of these enzymes by <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> but {{it has been suggested that}} activated Factor B (Factor B) is a serine protease with the active site in Bb, a COOH-terminal fragment of approximately 60, 000 molecular weight. Partial amino acid sequence studies of Bb derived from human Factor B have shown that the NH 2 -terminal 40 residues have no homology with NH 2 -terminal sequences of other serine proteases. However, positioning of a further 170 residues out of approximately 290 residues in two continuous CNBr fragments from the COOH terminus has shown that there is a strong homology of sequence in this section. The active site residues histidine, aspartic acid, and serine all are present in positions corresponding with those of typical serine proteases. It is suggested that Factor B is a novel type of serine protease with a catalytic chain of molecular weight twice that of proteases previously studied and probably with a different activation mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Reelin is an {{extracellular}} matrix protein that plays {{a pivotal role}} in development of the central nervous system. Reelin is also expressed in the adult brain, notably in the cerebral cortex, where it might play a role in synaptic plasticity. The mechanism of action of reelin at the molecular level {{has been the subject of}} several hypotheses. Here we show that reelin is a serine protease and that proteolytic activity is relevant to its function, since (i) Reelin expression in HEK 293 T cells impairs their ability to adhere to fibronectin-coated surfaces, and adhesion to fibronectin is restored by micromolar concentrations of <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate,</b> a serine hydrolase inhibitor; (ii) purified Reelin binds FP-Peg-biotin, a trap probe which irreversibly binds to serine residues located in active catalytic sites of serine hydrolases; (iii) purified Reelin rapidly degrades fibronectin and laminin, while collagen IV is degraded at a much slower rate; fibronectin degradation is inhibited by inhibitors of serine proteases, and by monoclonal antibody CR- 50, an antibody known to block the function of Reelin both in vitro and in vivo. The proteolytic activity of Reelin on adhesion molecules of the {{extracellular matrix}} and/or receptors on neurons may explain how Reelin regulates neuronal migration and synaptic plasticity...|$|E
40|$|A trypsin-like {{protease}} was extracted with 1 % {{cetyltrimethylammonium bromide}} (CTAB) at pH 7. 0 from boar cauda epididymal sperm nuclei whose acrosin {{had previously been}} removed by acid extraction.

CSP is a two chain protein composed of Afr 2. 6 K and Mr 37 K chains, which are covalently cross-linked by disulfide bonds. CSP exhibited a pH optimum between pH 8. 0 and 9. 0, and was inhibited by <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate,</b> antipain, leupeptin, and l-chloro- 3 -tosylamide- 7 -amino-L- 2 -heptanone. The activity of CSP was enhanced about 1. 2 -fold with 50 mM CaCl 2, with which acrosin is enhanced 2. 0 -fold.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Substrate and {{inhibitor}} specificities {{have been}} used to classify esterases. The purpose of this work was to determine the substrate and inhibitor specificities of the esterases in an aquous extract of lyophilyzed carrots. Esterase activity was determined manometrically at 37 °C. The optimum pH of the carrot esterases with several substrates varied from 6. 8 to 7. 2, and a pH of 7. 2 was used in this study. The carrot extract hydrolyzed acetyl, propionyl and butyryl esters of phenol, 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na and glycerol. As the acyl chain length was increased, activity decreased. Long-chain naphthyl esters and triolein were not hydrolyzed, which suggested the absence of lipase in the extract. Lack of activity with choline esters indicated the absence of cholinesterases. EDTA did not exhibit appreciable activation of carrot esterases. The effect of parathion, <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> (DFP) and tetraethyl pyrophosphate (TEPP) at various concentrations on the rate of hydrolysis of the acetyl, propionyl and butyryl esters, of phenol, 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na and glycerol indicated the presence of six esterases. Inhibitor and substrate specificities of five esterases were similar to carboxylesterases (EC 3. 1. 1. 1). The sixth esterase was similar to arylester as e (EC 3. 1. 1. 2).

40|$|AbstractSenescence marker protein- 30 (SMP 30) was {{originally}} {{identified as a}} novel protein in the rat liver, the expression of which decreases androgen-independently with aging. We have now characterized a unique property of SMP 30, the hydrolysis of <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> (DFP), {{which is similar to}} the chemical warfare nerve agents sarine, soman and tabun. Hydrolysis of DFP was stimulated equally well by 1 mM MgCl 2, MnCl 2 or CoCl 2, to a lesser extent by 1 mM CdCl 2 but not at all by 1 mM CaCl 2. No 45 Ca 2 +-binding activity was detected for purified SMP 30, suggesting that SMP 30 is not a calcium-binding protein, as others previously stated. Despite the sequence similarity between SMP 30 and a serum paraoxonase (PON), the inability of SMP 30 to hydrolyze PON-specific substrates such as paraoxon, dihydrocoumarin, γ-nonalactone, and δ-dodecanolactone indicate that SMP 30 is distinct from the PON family. We previously established SMP 30 knockout mice and have now tested DFPase activity in their livers. The livers from wild-type mice contained readily detectable DFPase activity, whereas no such enzyme activity was found in livers from SMP 30 knockout mice. Moreover, the hepatocytes of SMP 30 knockout mice were far more susceptible to DFP-induced cytotoxicity than those from the wild-type. These results indicate that SMP 30 is a unique DFP hydrolyzing enzyme in the liver and has an important detoxification effect on DFP. Consequently, a reduction of SMP 30 expression might account for the age-associated deterioration of cellular functions and enhanced susceptibility to harmful stimuli in aged tissue...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Although esterases {{have been}} {{reported}} in peas, their properties have not been studied. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the substrate and inhibitor specificity of the esterases present in a water extract of lyophilized peas, and to determine if pea esterases could be classified according to the criteria established for animal esterases. Esterase activity was determined manometrically using the Gilson differential respirometer. The effect of pH on esterase activity was determined using phenyl acetate, phenyl propionate, tripropionin, and tributyrin as substrates. The pH optima appeared to lie between 6. 9 and 7. 2, and pH 7 was selected for use in this study. The acetyl, propionyl, and n-butyryl esters of phenol, 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃ Na and glycerol were hydrolyzed by the enzyme extract. Long chain esters of 2 -naphthol- 6 -SO₃Na, however, were not hydrolyzed. Cholinesterases and lipases {{did not appear to be}} present in the extract since only a very small amount of activity was observed when the choline esters and triolein were used as substrates. Using phenyl propionate and phenyl butyrate as substrates, esterase activity, based on the original extract, decreased with dilution. Later work revealed that the esterase(s) which hydrolyzed phenyl propionate were inhibited by heavy metal ions and activated by metal complexing agents. Hence, a possible explanation for the decrease in activity was inhibition by metal ions in the distilled water. The effects of the inhibitors parathion, tetraethyl pyrophosphate, and <b>diisopropyl</b> <b>phosphorofluoridate</b> at concentrations ranging from 10 ⁻¹ M to 10 ⁻¹⁰ M on esterase activity were determined. The data suggested the presence of as many as six esterases in the aqueous extract of peas, three for which the evidence was quite conclusive. On the basis of their inhibition by organophosphorus compounds, all but one of the esterases appeared to be of the B type. Physostigmine sulfate (10 ⁻⁵ M) had no effect on esterase activity with the nine substrates used indicating that the activity was not due to cholinesterases. At least one of the esterases which hydrolyzed each of the substrates was sensitive to 10 ⁻³ M p-chloromercuribenzoic acid sodium salt suggesting the importance of sulfhydryl groups for enzyme activity...|$|E
