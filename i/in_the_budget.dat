30|$|<b>In</b> practice, <b>the</b> {{design of}} <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process among {{companies}} is not homogeneous (Shastri and Stout 2008). Companies {{can choose from}} {{a broad spectrum of}} design possibilities for <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. <b>The</b> two generic design possibilities, top-down and participative, represent the two ends of this spectrum. Lately, <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process and <b>the</b> associated reporting behavior of managers has attracted considerable attention by experimental research (see Shields and Young 1993; Evans III et al. 2001; Fisher et al. 2002; Hannan et al. 2006; Matuszewski 2010; Rankin et al. 2008; Altenburger 2017). A significant part of this research has focused on the consequences of participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process and not its antecedents (a comprehensive literature review is provided by Shields and Shields 1998). However, the reasons for the use of participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process have often been neglected. This paper studies the role of participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process if company’s divisions are confronted with interdependence. <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> company’s preference for implementing a top-down or a participative budgeting process is examined.|$|R
30|$|Second, {{this paper}} {{adds to the}} {{analytical}} literature on choosing an information system and <b>the</b> manager’s participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Christensen (1982) provides an example <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> company is better off when a risk-averse manager neither obtains private decision-relevant information nor participates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process compared to obtaining the information and participating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. This is <b>in</b> line with <b>the</b> present paper’s findings. While Christensen ’s finding stems from a shift <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trade-off of risk sharing and inducing effort, the present paper illustrates {{the impact of the}} importance of coordination on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Penno (1984) highlights that enabling a manager to obtain private decision-relevant information is beneficial for the company when the company can design the information system’s characteristics. This result holds whether <b>the</b> manager participates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process or not. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present paper, the company cannot choose the information system’s characteristics. Thus, in line with Penno (1984), the company does not want the managers to obtain private information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process. This is discussed in more detail in Sect. 6. <b>In</b> addition, <b>the</b> present paper shows that participation is preferred for a high importance of coordinating the interdependent divisions’ operations, although the managers are informed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process. Given a participative budgeting process, Rajan and Saouma (2006) examine the merits of different levels of information asymmetry between the company and the manager ranging from perfectly informative, to somewhat informative, to not informative at all. They find that the company prefers an uninformed manager when the possible levels of the manager’s productivity are similar. Otherwise, a fully informed manager is preferred. The uninformed manager’s report does not convey any information, and therefore, this setting is comparable to the present paper’s top-down budgeting process. This means that Rajan and Saouma (2006) show that the similarity of the productivity levels determine whether <b>the</b> manager participates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Holding <b>the</b> productivity levels’ similarity constant, the present paper depicts the effect of the importance of coordination on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process.|$|R

The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in his budget proposal.

30|$|Budgeting {{systems are}} often criticized for centralizing {{decision}} making (for example, see Hansen et al. 2003).

The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978.

This led to an extraordinary personal intervention by Emperor Meiji in a statement dated 10 February 1893, wherein the emperor offered to fund {{the construction of the}} two battleships himself, through an annual reduction in the expenses of the Imperial Household, and asked that all government officials likewise agree to a reduction in their salaries by ten percent. The funding measure for the Fuji-class battleships was passed by the Japanese Diet soon after. Completion of the ships was originally scheduled for 1899, but the start of the First Sino-Japanese War shortly before they were laid down in 1894 caused the government to accelerate the schedule by two years.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{contributes}} to <b>the</b> literature <b>in</b> three ways. First, it complements the insights {{generated by the}} analytical literature on managers’ participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process. Given a budget-based bonus scheme, Magee (1980) establishes that a manager’s participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process is detrimental for the company, because the manager maximally misreports. Baiman and Evans III (1983) highlight that the company prefers <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process only when the manager is induced to report the private decision-relevant information truthfully. Contrary to Magee (1980) and Baiman and Evans III (1983), the present paper illustrates that <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process might be preferred by the company due to lower incentive costs, although the managers report truthfully <b>in</b> <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process. Penno (1990) finds that the company solely prefers a manager’s participation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process when <b>the</b> compensation contract can {{be based on the}} reported private information. Despite basing the compensation contract on the reported private information <b>in</b> <b>the</b> participative <b>budgeting</b> process, <b>the</b> present paper shows that <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process is preferred for a low importance of coordinating the divisions’ interdependence. Kirby et al. (1991) study participation in a setting where the manager is induced to set unbiased hurdles by a compensation scheme belonging to a class of budget-based performance evaluation schemes. Participation can reduce the manager’s informational rents and, therefore, be preferred by the company. The present paper’s finding complements this result by highlighting that <b>the</b> top-down <b>budgeting</b> process might be preferred because of lower informational rents. Heinle et al. (2014) illustrate that the company prefers a top-down <b>budgeting</b> process whenever <b>the</b> level of information asymmetry between the manager and her superior is small. The present paper adds to this finding by showing the impact of the importance of coordinating the divisions’ operations on the design of <b>the</b> <b>budgeting</b> process.|$|R
