50|$|The Learjet 45XR is an {{upgraded}} {{version of the}} Model 45, introduced in June, 2004, offering substantially higher takeoff weights, <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>faster</b> time-to-climb rates than the Model 45, chiefly through modifications to the engine.|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} the Phoenix was designed, {{emphasis}} was placed on climb performance rather than high <b>cruising</b> <b>speed,</b> with a low wing loading to optimise thermalling and a <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> (best Lift /Drag speed) achieved through careful attention to fuselage shape, wing incidence, aspect ratio and other criteria.|$|R
50|$|The RE {{series is}} more refined aerodynamically than earlier models; the wings are fully plywood-skinned, {{and instead of}} a bulky {{compression}} strut carrying lift loads, a more conventional set of streamlined flying wires completes the wing structure. It has the <b>fastest</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> {{of any of the}} Waco cabin models, with a Vne of 270 mph.|$|R
50|$|The cockpit width is 41 in, 2 in {{wider than}} the Nordic II. The Nordic VII also has a swept tail, which differentiates it from the Nordic VI. The wing has {{slightly}} greater span than the Nordic VI, but less area, giving the Nordic VII a 5 mph higher stall speed and a lower rate of climb, but a <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Learjet 40XR is an {{upgraded}} version introduced in October, 2004, offering higher takeoff weights, <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds</b> and <b>faster</b> time-to-climb rates {{as compared to}} the LJ40. The increases are due to the upgrading of the engines to the TFE731-20BR configuration. These are the [...] "BR" [...] engines. LJ40 owners can upgrade their aircraft through the incorporation of several service bulletins.|$|R
5000|$|The SJ30 {{is in the}} [...] "light" [...] jet class, and has the <b>fastest</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds</b> and longest {{range of}} any {{aircraft}} in that class. The aircraft can seat up to six passengers plus one pilot. A unique feature of this aircraft is that it maintains a 'sea level cabin' (zero cabin altitude) up to 41,000 ft (due to its 12 psi differential pressure) thereby reducing fatigue due to high cabin altitude on long journeys.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} welded aluminum with the axles made from steel. It includes a fairing to provide occupant protection and a shield to keep water and stones out of the propeller during surface operations. The aircraft is capable of taking off from water, provided the wing can be {{laid out on the}} shoreline without getting wet. The wing is a high-performance design that allows a <b>fast</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> for a powered parachute of 40 mph.|$|R
50|$|The Keystone XLB-6 {{prototype}} {{was created}} by refitting the final triple-tailed Keystone LB-5 (serial number 27-344) with an LB-5A tail unit; longer (75 foot) straight-chord, untapered and noticeably swept-back wings; and 525 hp (391 kW) Wright Cyclone R-1750-1 radial engines suspended on struts between the wings rather than mounted on the lower wing. This produced a bomber with {{twice the rate of}} climb as the LB-5 and slightly <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed.</b> Production LB-6s featured a five-foot longer fuselage.|$|R
5000|$|He {{remarked that}} the Singer was unusual {{in having a}} {{completely}} flat windscreen — less expensive to replace — and a good view through it was spoiled by unusually thick pillars, door surround and ventilator window surround. He put the car's <b>fast</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> at 67 mph. Top gear acceleration was excellent and the engine quiet beneath its plastic bonnet. The steering column year lever was [...] "rather stiff". A central old fashioned floor-mounted lever was now available.|$|R

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} composites. Its 15 m span wing is convertible to 11 m, by removing the wing tips and then re-installing shorter tips and the winglets for <b>faster</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> when flying as a microlight.

Standard engines available are the [...] Rotax 912UL, the [...] Rotax 912ULS, [...] Jabiru 2200 and the [...] HKS 700E four-stroke powerplants. With the 912S engine the aircraft can be employed as a glider tug. An electric-powered version is under development.|$|R
50|$|As an ectotherm {{living in}} a just-above-freezing {{environment}} (≈2 °C), the Greenland shark has the lowest swim speed and tail-beat frequency for its size across all fish species, which most likely correlates with its very slow metabolism and extreme longevity. It swims at a leisurely 0.76 mph with their <b>fastest</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> only reaching 1.6 mph. Because this top speed is only half that of a typical seal in their diet, biologists have wondered how the sharks are able to prey on the faster seals. It is hypothesized that they may ambush them while they sleep.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architect}} {{of the line of}} Van’s aircraft, Richard VanGrunsven, designed the RV-9 as a departure from the concepts of the earlier RV series. The earlier members of the RV series, starting with the single seat RV-3, were all designed to have light handling, aerobatic capabilities along with <b>fast</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds</b> and STOL capabilities. The RV-9 was designed from the start as a two-place, side-by-side, touring aircraft and as such it forgoes the aerobatic capabilities and the lighter handling for more stability and economy. As such the design horsepower is 118-160 and the prototype was flown with a Lycoming O-235 powerplant of [...] as a proof-of-concept for the lower horsepower.|$|R
50|$|The {{architect}} {{of the line of}} Van's aircraft, Richard VanGrunsven, designed the RV-3 in the late 1960s after experience flying the Stits Playboy amateur-built aircraft. The RV-3 started out as an attempt to maintain the Playboy's layout and concept but to improve it in every regard. The RV-3 was designed to have light handling, aerobatic capabilities, <b>fast</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speeds</b> and short field STOL capabilities. The RV-3 was also designed from the start for serious travel and as such carries 30 US gallons of fuel giving it a range of about 600 statute miles. The design horsepower is 100-150 typically using a Lycoming O-235 or Lycoming O-320 powerplant, although some builders have fitted RV-3s with more powerful engines.|$|R
25|$|In 1995, Alenia and Lockheed Martin began discussions {{to improve}} Alenia's G.222 using C-130J's glass cockpit {{and a more}} {{powerful}} version of the G.222's T64G engine and four-blade propellers. In 1996, a program began on an improved G.222, named C-27J; it used a U.S. military type designation based on the G.222's C-27A designation. In 1997, Alenia and Lockheed Martin formed Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems (LMATTS) to develop the C-27J. The design changed to use the C-130J Super Hercules's Rolls-Royce AE 2100 engine and six-blade propeller. Other changes include a fully digital MIL-STD-1553 systems and avionics architecture, and an updated cargo compartment for increased commonality. The C-27J has a 35% increase in range and a 15% <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> than the G.222.|$|R
50|$|The {{differences}} between the Panokseon and Japanese ships were significant. Japanese equivalents were the large Atakebune class and the medium Sekibune class ships. In contrast to the Panokseon, the hulls of the Japanese vessels had sharp, V-shaped bows. A sharp underside was favorable for swift or long-distance travel in the open seas because of lower water resistance (thus these ships had <b>faster</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds).</b> Since this variety of hull had a deep draft (penetrates deeper into the water), however, the ship’s turning radius was considerably large and changing direction was therefore a lengthy process. In addition, ships with larger drafts have a more difficult time of navigating narrow and shallower waters. Japanese ships were thus vastly less maneuverable than the panokseon in Korea's narrow channel waters.|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. had {{the largest}} and most {{powerful}} submarine force of all the Allied countries in the Pacific at the outbreak of war. Pre-war U.S. Navy doctrine—like that of all major navies—specified the main role of submarines was to support the surface fleet by conducting reconnaissance and attacking large enemy warships. Merchant ships were regarded as secondary targets, and the circumstances in which they could be attacked were greatly limited by prize rules set out in the London Naval Treaty, to which the U.S. was a signatory. In order to meet their role with the surface fleet the U.S. Navy built large submarines which boasted long range, a relatively <b>fast</b> <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> and a heavy armament of torpedoes. United States submarine habitability was greatly enhanced by air conditioning (which German U-boats, for instance, lacked) and water distilleries, and were more comfortable, hence better suited to long patrols in the tropics, than those of the other major powers. The submarines' commanders and crewmen were considered elite and enjoyed a strong esprit. On 7 December 1941, the USN had 55 fleet- and 18 medium-sized submarines (S-boats) in the Pacific, 38 submarines elsewhere, and 73 under construction. (By war's end, the U.S. had completed 228 submarines.) ...|$|R
40|$|Presented at the 1 st World Aviation Congress and Exposition, Los Angeles, CA, October 21 - 24, 1996. The {{desire of}} {{achieving}} <b>faster</b> <b>cruise</b> <b>speed</b> for rotorcraft vehicles {{has been around}} since the inception of the helicopter. Many unconventional concepts have been considered and researched such as the advanced tilt rotor with canards, the tilt-wing, the folding tiltrotor, the coaxial propfan/folding tiltrotor, the variable diameter tiltrotor, and the stopped rotor/wing concept, in order to fulfill this goal. The most notable program which addressed the technology challenges of accomplishing a high speed civil transport mission is the High Speed Rotorcraft Concept (HSRC) program. Among the long list of potential configurations to fulfill the HSRC intended mission, the stopped rotor/wing is the least investigated {{due to the fact that}} the existing rotorcraft synthesis codes cannot handle this type of vehicle. In order to develop such a tool, a designer must understand the physics behind this unique concept. The uniqueness of stopped rotor/wing vehicles that use reaction drive can be found in the tight coupling that is present between the rotor and the engine which in turn requires these subsystems to be sized concurrently rather than in isolation. A methodology and simulation tool capable of handling this coupling is under development at the Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL) at Georgia Institute of Technology. The development of a new design tool (TJCC) and the use of a statistical technique called Response Surface Methodology linked into the V/STOL Aircraft Sizing and Performance Computer Program (VASCOMP II) has provided the capability of sizing stopped rotor/wings. The potential success of a stopped rotor/wing configuration can only be determined through direct performance comparisons with other high speed rotorcraft concepts using analytical methods of comparable sophistication. The authors have previously presented limited results from this study detailing the rotor/wing performance during hover. In this paper the forward flight regime for both the helicopter and fixed wing modes are discussed. Representative results presented include performance characteristics such as the horsepower required curves versus forward flight for both the rotorcraft and fixed wing modes of operation. Furthermore, the mass flow requirements, and transition performance associated with this aircraft are also examined in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Speed of {{locomotion}} {{plays an}} important role in an animal’s biology and ecology and is of particular interest in aquatic animals. Determining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of shark—for which such data are scarce—may help to better understand their interactions with prey, the size of the home ranges they maintain, their energetic costs and how they interact with their environment through sensory perception. In this study, the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of a range of different shark species were measured using stereo-baited remote underwater video systems (stereo-BRUVS). The relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> and fork length, species, order, habitat, trophic level, temperature and tail shape was then modelled. Fork length and species best explained the <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> of the eight species of shark studied: Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, Carcharhinus albimarginatus, Carcharhinus obscurus, Furgaleus macki, Carcharhinus obesus, Mustelus antarcticus, Heterodontus portusjacksoni and Parascyllium variolatum. This linear model had a slope that did not differ statistically from that of the theoretical model proposed by Weihs (Scale effects in animal locomotion, Academic Press, New York, pp 333 – 338, 1977), which suggests that the relationship between <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> and length appears to be dominated by energetics. The results suggest that existing allometric estimates of <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> can be improved by defining <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> for each species as a function of length. Currently, literature presents <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> data for only a few species of shark; therefore, we provide a second, generalised model, which predicts <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> as a function of length and tail shape. The length + tail shape model was selected based on its generality and accuracy in estimating shark <b>cruising</b> <b>speeds</b> obtained from acoustic tags. This length + tail shape model was significantly better than a length only model; it explained a further 76  % of the variation in <b>cruising</b> <b>speed</b> derived from stereo-BRUVS and acoustic tagging data than a length only model. The more accurate prediction of the length + tail shape model is most likely because tail shape is correlated with a number of ecological factors. 12 page(s...|$|R
