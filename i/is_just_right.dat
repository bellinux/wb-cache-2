500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers. She goes to her uncle, Doctor Dake, for {{something}} to make her tail grow. He tries to tell her that her tail <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> for her species, but she throws a tantrum. He gives in and he tells her where she can find berries that will make her tail grow. The first berry makes her tail exactly like Lolla Lee Lou's, but greed overtakes her. Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing her tail to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out her tail feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore. Though she has only one feather left—as before—she now has [...] "enough, because now she is smarter." ...|$|E

5000|$|Lagom is {{most often}} used as an adverb, as in the {{sentence}} [...] "Han är lagom lång" [...] (literally [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>just</b> the <b>right</b> height"). Lagom {{can also be used}} as an adjective: [...] "Klänningen var lagom för henne" [...] (literally [...] "The dress <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> for her"), which would be equivalent to [...] "The dress fits her".

It turns out that Pepé's new color <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> for her. Penelope locks him up inside a perfume shop, hiding the key down her chest, and proceeds to chase the now imprisoned and effectively odorless Pepé.|$|E

An example is in The High Window, when Marlowe finally persuades the detective-lieutenant, whose [...] "solid old face was lined and grey with fatigue", {{to take a}} drink and thereby loosen up and give out. [...] "Breeze looked at me very steadily. Then he sighed. Then he picked the glass up and tasted it and sighed again {{and shook his head}} {{sideways}} with a half smile; the way a man does when you give him a drink and he needs it very badly and it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> and the first swallow is like a peek into a cleaner, sunnier, brighter world." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1958, Bazlen won the {{starring}} role in the children’s program The Blue Fairy, broadcast by the independent station WGN-TV in Chicago on Monday nights (7.30pm–8.00pm). It {{was one of the}} earliest children’s shows to be produced in color. The producer of the show had spotted Bazlen playing hopscotch outside of Bazlen's Chicago home and told Bazlen's mother that [...] "your little girl <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> for my TV series". In the show, the Blue Fairy, played by Bazlen, lived in the “Blue Forest." [...] Dressed in a blue gown and diamond tiara, she also clasped a [...] silver wand. At the beginning of each show, Bazlen, suspended by wires, would fly (as if on elfin wings) across the stage saying “I’m the Blue Fairy, I’ll grant you a wish to make all your dreams come true." [...] She would then sit on an oversized mushroom visited by creatures such as Tugnacious R. Jones, Myrtle Flower, and an old nasal voiced wizard (which were puppets designed by George Nelle and writer-director Don Kane), and introduced stories enacted by the Rufus Rose Marionettes. They also engaged in various projects which included constructing a popcorn machine that would not stop popping and making a sewing machine that turned out marbles. Bazlen won enormous critical praise for her performance (one critic describing it as “beguiling” and “mesmerising” and Hedda Hopper declared Bazlen “the Celtic Alice in Wonderland”) and the show was recognised as the top children’s program of 1958 winning a Peabody Award. Bazlen herself said of her role that she [...] "flew around and had a wonderful time." [...] Although The Blue Fairy could only be seen locally in Chicago on Channel 9, the Peabody Award it won brought it and Bazlen to national attention. Furthermore, the show also inspired Ernie Kovacs into doing one of his notorious comedy sketches where Kovacs (wearing a mustache, chewing a cigar, dressed in a blue gown and blonde wig, and holding a silver wand) flew across a stage, slammed head first into a wall on the opposite side, and was then left dangling lifelessly (in mock fashion) in mid-air.|$|E

It is glorious!" [...] Harry murmured, [...] "I could not have believed there was anything so lovely." ...|$|E

Without a quiver or a regret, the moment he's learned his error, he puts his plows into that crop, turns it under, and plants something else. He has the savve. He can look at a sprout, just poked {{up out of the}} ground, and tell how it's going to turn out--whether it will head up or won't head up; or if it's going to head up good, medium, or bad. That's one end. Take the other end. He controls his crop. He forces it or holds it back with an eye on the market.

There are pirates and Frenchmen, and there are Spaniards, whom I regard as a cross between the other two. They hide about among the islands and pop out when you least expect them. You always have to keep your eyes in your head and your cutlass handy when you go ashore. The worst of them are what they call mulattoes; they are a whity-brown sort of chaps, neither one thing nor the other, and a nice cut-throat lot they are. A sailor who drinks too much and loses his boat is as like as not to be murdered by some of them before morning. I hate them chaps like poison. There are scores of small craft manned by them which prey upon the negroes, who are an honest, merry lot, and not bad sailors either in their way. Sometimes four or five of these pirate craft will go together, {{and many of them are}} a good size and carry a lot of guns. They make some island their head-quarters. Any niggers there may be on it they turn into slaves. There are thousands of these islands, so at least I should say, scattered about, some of them mere sand-spots, others a goodish size.|$|E
