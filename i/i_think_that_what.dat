500|$|The Incredibles as {{a concept}} dates back to 1993 when Bird sketched the family during {{a period in which}} he tried to break into film. Personal issues had percolated into the story as they weighed on him in life. During this time, Bird had inked a {{production}} deal with Warner Bros. Animation and {{was in the process of}} directing his first feature, The Iron Giant. Approaching middle age and having high aspirations for his filmmaking, Bird pondered whether his career goals were attainable only at the price of his family life. He stated, [...] "Consciously, this was just a funny movie about superheroes. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> was going on in my life definitely filtered into the movie." [...] After the box office failure of The Iron Giant, Bird gravitated toward his superhero story.|$|E
2500|$|Quoting William Placher, Domestication of Transcendence, Louisville, 1996, (p.66) : [...] "In {{the famous}} extra-Calvinisticum, Calvin insisted, against Luther, that {{something}} of God's infinity remained uncaptureable in God's finite self-revelation in Jesus Christ...this does not imply, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> {{we know of}} God is false, but only that, while true {{as far as it}} goes, it is necessarily limited to our finite capacities. Calvin's real concern here seems to have been to preserve the reality of the Incarnation, which appeared to him threatened by a view in which even Christ's humanity took on divine infinity and thereby ceased to be really human."

2500|$|Although Garbo was humiliated by the {{negative}} reviews of Two-Faced Woman, {{she did not}} at first intend to retire. But her films depended on the European market and when it fell through with the war, finding a vehicle was problematic for MGM. She signed a one-picture deal in 1942 to make The Girl from Leningrad but the project quickly dissolved. She still thought she would continue when {{the war was over}} though she was ambivalent and indecisive about returning to the screen. Salka Viertel, Garbo's close friend and collaborator, said in 1945 [...] "Greta is impatient to work. But on the other side, she's afraid of it." [...] Garbo also worried about her age. [...] "Time leaves traces on our small faces and bodies. It's not the same anymore, being able to pull it off." [...] George Cukor, director of Two-Faced Woman, and often blamed for its failure, said [...] "People often glibly say that the failure of Two-Faced Woman finished Garbo's career. That's a grotesque oversimplification. It certainly threw her, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> really happened was that she just gave up. She didn’t want to go on." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was {{not very}} reverent to his cloth, or his recent tragical mood, but Glendenning was not offended; he laughed with a sheepish pleasure, and that evening he came with Miss Bentley to call upon us. The visit passed without unusual confidences until they rose to go, when she said {{abruptly}} to me: [...] "I feel that we both owe you a great deal, Mr. March. Arthur has been telling me of your talk this afternoon, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> you said was all so wise and true!

Therefore I shall rejoice to learn of any faith that {{promises}} {{to the children of}} earth a life eternal beyond the earth. Tomorrow you shall begin to teach me. Now leave me, Strangers, for I have much to do," [...] and he waved his hand towards the table.|$|E

That was a very heavy blow you struck her to-day, and she evidently felt it so. Two or three more such blows, and the victory will be won. I have no doubt now that Ruth Powlett somehow holds the key of this strange mystery in her hand, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> you have said to her to-day {{will go a long way}} towards inducing her to unlock it. Forester was the murderer of Miss Carne, I have not a shadow of doubt, though how she knows it for certain is more than I can even guess." ...|$|E

5000|$|Bidle later said: [...] "We are polar opposites when {{it comes}} to our politics, {{religious}} beliefs. But <b>that's</b> <b>what</b> I loved about the whole trip.

6000|$|... "Ma'am," [...] said I very honestly, [...] "I {{know not}} {{what was the}} reason. My concern for you was in the {{beginning}} a very fragile and even a selfish thing, yet not altogether selfish, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> first stirred it was the joyous sway of the little nursery governess as she walked down Pall Mall to meet her lover. It seemed such a mighty fine thing to you to be loved that I thought you had better continue to be loved for a little longer. And perhaps having helped you once by dropping a letter I was charmed by {{the ease with which}} you could be helped, for you must know that I am one who has chosen the easy way for more than twenty years." ...|$|E
6000|$|... § 22. Again: the {{influence}} of surprise in producing the delight, is to be noted as a suspicious or evanescent element in it. Observe, my pleasure was chiefly (§ 19.) when I first got into beautiful scenery, out of London. The enormous influence of novelty--the {{way in which it}} quickens observation, sharpens sensation, and exalts sentiment--is not half enough taken note of by us, and is to me a very sorrowful matter. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> Wordsworth speaks of as a glory in the child, because it has come fresh from God's hands, is in reality nothing more than the freshness of all things to its newly opened sight. I find that by keeping long away from hills, I can in great part still restore the old childish feeling about them; and the more I live and work among them, the more it vanishes.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is well argued, Userti, {{and if it}} be so, mayhap my mind {{will become}} as yours in this matter, so that I shall no longer stand between Pharaoh and his desire. But is it so? There's the problem. I will not ask you why {{you say that the}} gods of the Egyptians are the true gods, because I know what you would answer, or rather that you could give no answer. But I will ask this lady whether her god is a false god, and if she replies that he is not, I will ask her to prove this to me if she can. If she is able to prove it, then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> I said to Pharaoh to-day I shall repeat three days hence.

6000|$|... "Believe me, I will {{do my best}} to find it out {{if there}} is such a secret, Mr. Powlett. I feel sure from what I have seen of your {{daughter}}, that if a wrong has been done of any kind it is not by her. I agree with you that she has a secret, and that that secret is wearing her out. I may say that my daughter is of the same opinion. I believe that there is a struggle going on in her mind on the subject, and that if she is to have peace, and as you say health, she must unburden her mind. However, Mr. Powlett, my advice in the matter is, leave her alone. Do not press her in any way. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> you said to me before is likely to be verified, and that if she unburdens herself it will be to Mary; and you may be sure whatever is the nature of the secret, my daughter will keep it inviolate, unless it is Ruth's own wish that it should be told to others." ...|$|E
60|$|Even {{when we come}} to the {{exception}} that proves the rule, even to such a signal exception as 'Uncle Tom's Cabin', <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> I say holds true. That is almost the greatest work of imagination that we have produced in prose, and it is the work of a New England woman, writing from all the inspirations and traditions of New England. It is like begging the question to say that I do not call it a novel, however; but really, is it a novel, in the sense that 'War and Peace' is a novel, or 'Madame Flaubert', or 'L'Assommoir', or 'Phineas Finn', or 'Dona Perfecta', or 'Esther Waters', or 'Marta y Maria', or 'The Return of the Native', or 'Virgin Soil', or 'David Grieve'? In a certain way it is greater than any of these except the first; but its chief virtue, or its prime virtue, is in its address to the conscience, and not its address to the taste; to the ethical sense, not the aesthetical sense.|$|E
60|$|I breathed more freely. We {{were sitting}} in the rotunda of a famous Washington hotel, and only a few moments before had the speaker, an utter {{stranger}} to me, moved his chair beside mine and opened a conversation. I noticed that he had that timid, lonely, helpless air which invests the bucolic traveler who, for the first time, finds himself among strangers, and his identity lost, in a world so much larger, so much colder, so much more indifferent to him than he ever imagined. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>what</b> we often attribute to the impertinent familiarity of country-men and rustic travelers on railways or in cities is largely due to their awful loneliness and nostalgia. I remember to have once met in a smoking-car on a Kansas railway one of these lonely ones, who, after plying me with a thousand useless questions, finally elicited the fact that I knew slightly a man who had once dwelt in his native town in Illinois. During the rest of our journey the conversation turned chiefly upon his fellow-townsman, whom it afterwards appeared that my Illinois friend knew no better than I did. But he had established a link between himself and his far-off home through me, and was happy.|$|E
