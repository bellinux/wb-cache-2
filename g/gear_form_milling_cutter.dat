Through analyzing {{the shape and}} characteristic parameters of double-helix screw, the helicoids equation and axial curve equation of double-helix screw were established. According to the relative position relations between <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> and double-helix screw in the machining process, the geometric mapping relationship of screw coordinate system and <b>formed</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> coordinate system was established by using the coordinate transformation theory.

40|$|In this paper, a {{mathematical}} model is presented by which the cutting forces in <b>gear</b> <b>form</b> <b>milling</b> process are predicted using the mechanistic approach. To use this approach, {{a detailed description of}} the chip geometry is needed. Eccentricity and run-out tool errors are considered, which is of great importance as the chip thickness will by these errors vary for the subsequent cuts. The chip geometry is determined by comparing the path of the cutting edge with already removed material. The boundary of the chips is determinable from the cutting edge geometry, which is here derived in parametric form so spur and helical gears are manufactured correctly. Locally on the cutting edge, the cutting forces are resolved from orthogonal cutting data and on the basis that these forces are proportional to the instantaneous chip thickness. The load each individual cutting tooth experience in operation, as well as the complete load on the tool, are resolved by summing the forces along the cutting edge. In the model, all cut chips are determined for each machined gear tooth gap, with the gear blank boundaries considered.

30|$|The {{chemical}} vapor deposition (CVD) diamond film {{is attractive}} as an ideal coating for excellent characteristics, such as the high hardness, favorable wear resistance, low friction coefficient, high thermal conductivity, low thermal expansion coefficient and excellent chemical stability [4, 5]. It is demonstrated that during the machining processes of the Al alloy workpieces, especially under the circumstance of the rough machining, the deposition of diamond films on the cobalt cemented tungsten carbide (WC-Co) <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> can prolong the working lifetime significantly, and improve the machining quality to some extent, because the excellent tribological properties of the diamond film can reduce the adhesion between the cutter and workpiece [6]. However, for the finish machining, since the cutting depth is relatively small, it is supposed that the optimal-designed uncoated WC-Co <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> can meet the requirement of the machining quality during their life cycles, but one drawback is that they wear out rapidly, followed by {{the deterioration of the}} machining quality. The employment of the turning or <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> made of the monocrystalline diamond is believed as the best choice for finish machining Al alloy workpieces, regardless of the cost, which can be directly used for mirror finishing [7, 8]. It is another option to adopt the polycrystalline diamond (PCD) as the cutting edges [9, 10], the wear resistance of which is undoubtedly much higher than that of WC-Co, while lower than those of the monocrystalline diamond and CVD diamond film. This is because the PCD is composed of not only diamond crystals but also some metallic bonding phases. Moreover, for either the monocrystalline diamond or PCD, it is rather difficult to <b>form</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutters</b> with complicated shapes. Consequently, prolonging the tool life and guaranteeing the long-time machining quality with low cost are main aims of depositing diamond films on <b>milling</b> <b>cutters.</b>|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the work presented in this thesis is to investigate {{the two sides of}} the flute, the face and the heel of a twist drill. The flute face was designed to yield straight diametral lips which could be extended to eliminate the chisel edge, and consequently a single cutting edge will be obtained. Since drill rigidity and space for chip conveyance have to be a compromise a theoretical expression is deduced which enables optimum chip disposal capacity to be described in terms of drill parameters. This expression is used to describe the flute heel side. Another {{main objective}} is to study the effect on drill performance of changing the conventional drill flute. Drills were manufactured according to the new flute design. Tests were run in order to compare the performance of a conventional flute drill and non conventional design put forward. The results showed that 50 % reduction in thrust force and approximately 18 % reduction in torque were attained for the new design. The flank wear was measured at the outer corner and found to be less for the new design drill than for the conventional one in the majority of cases. Hole quality, roundness, size and roughness were also considered as a further aspect of drill performance. Improvement in hole quality is shown to arise under certain cutting conditions. Accordingly it might be possible to use a hole which is produced in one pass of the new drill which previously would have required a drilled and reamed hole. A subsidiary objective is to design the <b>form</b> <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> that should be employed for milling the foregoing special flute from drill blank allowing for the interference effect. A mathematical analysis in conjunction with computing technique and computers is used. To control the grinding parameter, a prototype drill grinder was designed and built upon the framework of an existing cincinnati cutter grinder. The design and build of the new grinder is based on a computer aided drill point geometry analysis. In addition to the conical grinding concept, the new grinder is also used to produce spherical point utilizing a computer aided drill point geometry analysis...|$|R

In Russia there is GOST 1336 - 77, to regulate the parameters of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> shaving with a straight flutes, made of high speed steels. It is established that available rake and clearance angles, and inclination angle of helical flutes at the accepted values of pitch and diameter of the tool lead to obtaining the angles of the tooth profile other than 30 degrees, thus requiring the calculation of angles β 1 and β 2 in each case of design. In the general case we have an asymmetrical profile with respect to the axis passing through the top of the tooth. Using the CATIA V 5 R 17 software, a geometric model that allows us to determine the angles of the tooth profile of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter</b> with helical flutes has been developed. The model research has been conducted for geometric and design parameters of thread <b>milling</b> <b>cutter,</b> made of cemented carbide and high speed steel.
