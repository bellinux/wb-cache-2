5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an <b>impeller,</b> attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the <b>impeller</b> from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|For testing purposes, a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an <b>impeller</b> was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of where flow simply passes through a {{straight}} pipe to enter a centrifugal compressor; the flow is straight, uniform and has no vorticity. As illustrated below α = 0°. As the flow continues to pass into and through the centrifugal <b>impeller,</b> the <b>impeller</b> forces the flow to spin faster and faster. According {{to a form of}} Euler's fluid dynamics equation, known as pump and turbine equation, the energy input to the fluid is proportional to the flow's local spinning velocity multiplied by the local <b>impeller</b> tangential velocity.|$|E

Integral <b>impellers</b> {{are very}} {{important}} parts {{in the fields of}} aerospace, shipping and locomotive, whose manufacturing accuracy directly affects performance of key equipments. In developed countries special NC programming software is widely used in order to manufacture integral <b>impellers,</b> the vast majority of enterprises have not special NC programming software of integral <b>impellers</b> owing to expensive cost in China. Key technology of 5 -axis NC Programming for integral <b>impellers</b> was solved by using the general software UG and precision machining of integral <b>impellers</b> had been implemented in 5 -axis high-speed machining centre...|$|R

25|$|The {{idealized}} compressive dynamic turbo-machine {{achieves a}} pressure rise by adding kinetic energy/velocity to a continuous flow of fluid through the rotor or <b>impeller.</b> This kinetic energy is then converted {{to an increase}} in potential energy/static pressure by slowing the flow through a diffuser. The pressure rise in <b>impeller</b> is in most cases almost equal to the rise in the diffuser section.|$|E

25|$|A simple {{centrifugal}} compressor has four components: inlet, impeller/rotor, diffuser, and collector. Figure 3.1 shows {{each of the}} components of the flow path, with the flow (working gas) entering the centrifugal <b>impeller</b> axially from right to left. As a result of the <b>impeller</b> rotating clockwise when looking downstream into the compressor, the flow will pass through the volute's discharge cone moving away from the figure's viewer.|$|E

The numerical scheme models jumps of magnetic permeability for the solid <b>impellers,</b> resembling various configurations tested experimentally in the von-Karman Sodium experiment. The most striking experimental observations are reproduced in our set of simulations. In particular, {{we report on}} the existence of an axisymmetric dynamo mode, self-consistently generated when the magnetic permeability of the <b>impellers</b> exceeds a threshold.

40|$|LecturePg. 9 - 24 The {{efficiency}} of compressor <b>impellers,</b> {{apart from the}} design, depends on some features linked with their manufacture. These features are the accuracy of geometry, the surface quality obtained, and the blockages which are inevitable with covered <b>impellers</b> and are attributable to the joining method applied, e. g., greater blade thicknesses {{in the case of}} riveting, or narrowed cross sections, due to weld seams, in the case of welding. As a result of the ever increasing importance of efficiency, efforts have been made to further improve the manufacturing process. The advantages and disadvantages of the various forming methods for high-quality <b>impellers,</b> such as milling with a relatively high accuracy, and involving high manufacturing outlay, are discussed. The various casting processes with a variety of possibilities to fulfill the requirements made with regard to the dimensional tolerances, process-dependent blade thicknesses and manual work for achieving certain specified accuracies are described. The {{efficiency of}} <b>impellers</b> with closed passageways, that is, with a cover or shroud disc, is superior to that of <b>impellers</b> with open passageways. This means that when no cast <b>impellers</b> are used, suitable methods must be available for joining the blades and the cover. For maximum accuracy and minimum blockage, the high-vacuum brazing method has become more and more accepted during the past few years. However, the manufacture of <b>impellers</b> applying the brazing method becomes problematic for large diameters. In addition to vacuum brazing, manual and machine welding processes continue to be applied, including slot welding for two-dimensionally curved blades. Diffusion welding and electron-beam welding have not found acceptance since high costs, unfavorable crevices, and sharp edges, along with possible deformations, have a negative influence on the behavior of such <b>impellers</b> during operation. It is true that the sophisticated riveting process of some manufacturers for two-dimensionally curved blades requires great wall thicknesses; but, {{it is also true that}} high-accuracy <b>impellers</b> can be produced by this method. In addition, the vibratory behavior of such <b>impellers</b> is favorable due to system-inherent dampening. Moreover, riveted <b>impellers</b> will tolerate high stresses when the Bauschinger effect is taken into account. The manufacture of highly stressed <b>impellers</b> for turbocompressors is based on the availability of suitable materials and adequate test methods...|$|R
25|$|The key {{component}} {{that makes a}} compressor centrifugal is the centrifugal <b>impeller,</b> Figure 0.1, which contains a rotating set of vanes (or blades) that gradually raises {{the energy of the}} working gas. This is identical to an axial compressor with the exception that the gases can reach higher velocities and energy levels through the impeller's increasing radius. In many modern high-efficiency centrifugal compressors the gas exiting the <b>impeller</b> is traveling near the speed of sound.|$|E
25|$|Increased maximum boost pressure, 1,850hp (1,380kW) at 2,000ft (610m); <b>impeller</b> {{diameter}} 9.75in (24.7cm). Used on Seafire Mk.XV and Mk. XVII, Spitfire XII.|$|E
25|$|This {{unstable}} operation {{results from}} the development of pressure gradients {{in the opposite direction}} of the flow. Maximum pressure is observed at the discharge of the <b>impeller</b> blade and minimum pressure on the side opposite to the discharge side. When the <b>impeller</b> blades are not rotating these adverse pressure gradients pump the flow in the direction opposite to the direction of the fan. The result is the oscillation of the fan blades creating vibrations and hence noise.|$|E

50|$|Different {{types of}} <b>impellers</b> {{are used for}} {{different}} tasks; for instance, Rushton turbines are useful for dispersing gases into liquids, but are not very helpful for dispersing settled solids into liquid. Newer turbines have largely supplanted the Rushton turbine for gas-liquid mixing, such as the Smith turbine and Bakker turbine. The power number is an empirical measure {{of the amount of}} torque needed to drive different <b>impellers</b> in the same fluid at constant power per unit volume; <b>impellers</b> with higher power numbers require more torque but operate at lower speed than <b>impellers</b> with lower power numbers, which operate at lower torque but higher speeds.|$|R

25|$|The {{compressor}} {{increases the}} mass of intake air entering the combustion chamber. The compressor {{is made up of}} an <b>impeller,</b> a diffuser and a volute housing.|$|E
25|$|The most {{fundamental}} change {{made to the}} later Merlin (60, 70, 80 and 100 series) and Griffon engines (60 and 80 series) was the incorporation of a two-stage, two-speed supercharger, which provided a considerable increase in power, especially at higher altitudes. Two-stage refers {{to the use of}} two impellers on a common driveshaft, constituting two superchargers in series. As air was drawn through the air intake, fuel was pumped into the airstream by the carburettor. The first-stage <b>impeller</b> compressed the air-fuel mixture and this was then fed to the smaller second-stage <b>impeller</b> which further compressed the mixture.|$|E
40|$|Stirred aerated tanks by double <b>impellers</b> {{are used}} in {{fermentation}} and various biological processes for water treatment, food industry, and pharmaceutical production. In this study, a generalized correlation model was developed for the dependent parameter (kla/N). The oxygen mass transfer from air to liquid takes place by rotating the double <b>impellers</b> (IBRC and PBPU) in the aerated tank. This model considers Reynolds number, Froude number, power number, the liquid height, and the spacing between <b>impellers</b> as the most significant specifications {{that are related to}} aerated tank performance. The spacing between the <b>impellers</b> {{is considered to be a}} design factor of such industrial equipment due to its remarkable impact on the oxygen mass transfer...|$|R
50|$|Radial flow <b>impellers</b> impose {{essentially}} {{shear stress}} to the fluid, and are used, for example, to mix immiscible liquids or in general {{when there is}} a deformable interface to break. Another application of radial flow <b>impellers</b> are the mixing of very viscous fluids.|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the two general designs. Top-loading machines in Asia use <b>impellers</b> instead of agitators. <b>Impellers</b> are similar to agitators except {{that they do not}} have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.|$|R
25|$|In January 1989, an <b>impeller</b> blade {{on one of}} {{the reactor}} coolant pumps in Unit 3 broke at a weld, causing a large amount of metal debris to flow {{throughout}} the primary loop. As a result, the reactor was shut down for a considerable length of time.|$|E

The numerical solution is based on a one dimensional theory with a correction to a finite blade count. The proposed prime geometry is supposed to be tested through a CFD simulation. The aim of the CFD simulation is to optimize the prime geometry of a pump. The numerical solution of the prime geometry varies according to specific speeds and a shape of the <b>impeller's</b> main streamline. An interface between the numerical solution and 3 D CAD program is provided by a text document. Some examples of <b>impellers</b> with different specific speeds are being shown in the paper...|$|R

The fans produced have axial or centrifugal <b>impellers</b> with a diameter between approximately 30 mm and 1250 mm and are likewise developed in-house. Cross-flow blowers, as they are used in façade ventilation, {{are also in the}} product range. The <b>impellers</b> are made of either plastic, metal or more recently also a metal-plastic material combination.

50|$|A {{centrifugal}} pump containing {{two or more}} <b>impellers</b> is called a multistage {{centrifugal pump}}. The <b>impellers</b> may be mounted on the same shaft or on different shafts.

25|$|In {{many cases}} the flow leaving {{centrifugal}} <b>impeller</b> is near the speed of sound. The flow then typically flows through a stationary compressor causing it to decelerate. These stationary compressors are actually static guide vanes where energy transformation takes place. As described in Bernoulli's principle, this reduction in velocity causes the pressure to rise leading to a compressed fluid.|$|E
25|$|The turbine and <b>impeller</b> wheel sizes also {{dictate the}} amount of air or exhaust that can flow through the system, and the {{relative}} efficiency at which they operate. In general, the larger the turbine wheel and compressor wheel the larger the flow capacity. Measurements and shapes can vary, as well as curvature and number of blades on the wheels.|$|E
