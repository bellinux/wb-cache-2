50|$|Hydrogeomorphology {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} environment, in which water circulates, thus providing {{the information to}} understand the situation {{and to make the}} proper decisions. Quantitative study of <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> provides the theoretical base for the hydrogeomorphic approach, suggesting that certain unvarying <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> characters can be correlated to the hydrologic response of a basin. The measurable description of a <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> can be grouped in to linear aspect of channel network, areal aspect of <b>drainage</b> <b>basin,</b> relief aspect of channel system and basin form. Hydro-geomorphology is science that deals with occurrences of water with respect to landform. Hydrogeomorphology of a <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> is a function of rainfall kinematics, surface topography, <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> morphology and runoff etc. All these aspects are regarded as the potential to describe hydrogeomorphic properties of the <b>drainage</b> <b>basin.</b> Because of non-availability of hydrological data, discharge data and sediment load data over a sufficient period of time in ungauged catchments, various investigators have used the <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> parameters to study the hydrogeomorphology of the <b>drainage</b> <b>basin.</b> Hydrogeomorphic studies of <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> often suffer a setback due to lack of long-term data. Therefore, there is need to extrapolate the results of few small subsystems to other hydrologically and geomorphologically similar basins, which mostly remain ungauged for want of enormous resource and time involved in instrumentation and monitoring them. Importance of hydrology for geomorphological purposes has been increasingly appreciated among geomorphologists in the last few decades. Earlier geomorphologists were bounded to use different unconventional approach to evaluate the characteristics of rivers and <b>drainage</b> <b>basins</b> to get proper idea of various aspects of the water crisis.|$|R

Water collection {{on the east side}} of the Daccombe <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> or the Watcombe <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> flows through Barton and Watcombe into Babbacombe bay at Watcombe beach. Likewise water collection on the north side of the <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> collects in Haccombe and flows toward the River Teign.|$|R
50|$|In geomorphology, {{drainage}} systems, {{also known}} as river systems, are the patterns formed by the streams, rivers, and lakes in a particular <b>drainage</b> <b>basin.</b> They are governed by the topography of the land, whether a particular region is dominated by hard or soft rocks, and the gradient of the land. Geomorphologists and hydrologists often view streams as being part of <b>drainage</b> <b>basins.</b> A <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> is the topographic region from which a stream receives runoff, throughflow, and groundwater flow. The number, size, {{and shape of the}} <b>drainage</b> <b>basins</b> found in an area vary and the larger the topographic map, the more information on the <b>drainage</b> <b>basin</b> is available.|$|R
