25|$|<b>Gyrate</b> atrophy is an {{inherited}} degenerative disorder of the retina and choroid, sometimes accompanying the metabolic condition hyperornithinemia. The presence of <b>gyrate</b> atrophy with iminoglycinuria {{stems from a}} deficiency of proline in chorioretinal tissues, while processes behind hyperornithinemia disrupt the metabolic pathway from ornithine to proline, which alters the catabolism of ornithine, and also results in reduced levels of proline. Thus, <b>gyrate</b> atrophy can be found with either disorder, with proline deficiency as an underlying feature.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{characteristic}} of iminoglycinuria {{is the presence}} of glycine and imino acids in the urine. Otherwise, it is thought to be a relatively benign disorder, although symptoms associated with disruptions of proline and glycine metabolism caused by malabsorption may be present with iminoglycinuria. These include encephalopathy, mental retardation, deafness, blindness, kidney stones, hypertension and <b>gyrate</b> atrophy.|$|E

40|$|Study of ISEE 2 {{fast plasma}} data reveals that many suprathermal ion events that in {{previous}} studies would {{have been identified as}} intermediate ion events are actually <b>gyrating</b> ion events. Of 190 apparently intermediate ion events {{selected on the basis of}} their signature in energy-time spectrograms, half are actually found to be <b>gyrating</b> ion events. Using a model bow shock, the shock geometries and spacecraft locations for the observed <b>gyrating</b> and intermediate ion events are compared and found to be quite similar. Both <b>gyrating</b> and intermediate ion events are found to be associated with upstream MHD-like wave activity. Most <b>gyrating</b> ion events are associated with large-amplitude, monochromatic, weakly compressive waves, whereas many intermediate ion events are associated with smaller-amplitude, nonmonochromatic, weakly compressive waves. Some intermediate ion events are found to have no associated waves. Detailed study of the <b>gyrating</b> ion distributions reveals that the distributions are typically gyrotropic within about 4 earth radii of the bow shock, whereas at larger distances (up to about 10 earth radii) upstream from the shock the distributions are frequently 'gyrophase bunched'. In light of these observational characteristics, it is concluded that <b>gyrating</b> ion distributions are most likely generated both through coherent wave disruption of field-aligned beams and through reflection of solar wind ions off the shock...|$|R

25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males <b>gyrate</b> their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places her mouth to the anal fin (specifically the genital papilla) of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into her mouth and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E
25|$|A {{gyratory crusher}} {{is one of}} the main types of primary crushers in a mine or ore {{processing}} plant. Gyratory crushers are designated in size either by the gape and mantle diameter or by the size of the receiving opening. Gyratory crushers can be used for primary or secondary crushing. The crushing action is caused by the closing of the gap between the mantle line (movable) mounted on the central vertical spindle and the concave liners (fixed) mounted on the main frame of the crusher. The gap is opened and closed by an eccentric on the bottom of the spindle that causes the central vertical spindle to <b>gyrate.</b> The vertical spindle is free to rotate around its own axis. The crusher illustrated is a short-shaft suspended spindle type, meaning that the main shaft is suspended at the top and that the eccentric is mounted above the gear. The short-shaft design has superseded the long-shaft design in which the eccentric is mounted below the gear.|$|E

As the dancers <b>gyrate</b> around her, she starts walking down the carpet {{with the help of}} a pair of {{crutches}} while wearing a metallic bustier and a matching helmet. The metallic outfit is a reference to the film Metropolis. These scenes are interspersed with scenes of dead models lying around the mansion.

500|$|The Gentlemen, {{called the}} [...] "creepiest villains we've ever done" [...] by series writer Doug Petrie, were {{inspired}} by a nightmare Whedon had as a child, specifically {{one in which he}} was in bed and approached by a floating monster. Whedon fashioned The Gentlemen as something from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale, intending them to be frightening to children — monsters who carve out people's hearts, smiling as they do so. Nosferatu, Pinhead from Hellraiser, and Mr. Burns from The Simpsons all served as physical models for The Gentlemen. Elegantly Victorian in costume and demeanor, Whedon found their politeness and grace especially unsettling. Their metallic teeth {{were inspired by}} the intersection of Victorian culture with the height of the Industrial age, an era that Whedon considers [...] "classically creepy". For Buffy studies scholar Rhonda Wilcox, The Gentlemen and their straitjacket-wearing minions, who clumsily flap, <b>gyrate,</b> and crouch as they move, are representative of class disparity and patriarchy: The Gentlemen, with their Victorian suits, move effortlessly to accomplish what they set out to do while their minions, whom Whedon called [...] "footmen", do the [...] "dirty work".|$|E

Of course there is the {{requisite}} writhing, hip grinding, a rousing dance sequence, and a smoldering mantourage. It is, in a word, awesome". HitFix's Melinda Newman praised the direction by Mert and Marcus, feeling that [...] "the clip is a luscious collection of erotic images: two men biting an apple together, backlit men dancing in high heels, and Madge, looking as if she’s a dewy 25-year old." [...] A review in The Week praised the video for being self-referential with its [...] "dark, dominatrix-y" [...] visuals. Amanda Dobbins from New York magazine gave a positive review for the appearance of Kazaky and Madonna's look in the video.

40|$|A <b>gyrating</b> ion beam, with ring shape {{distribution}} in velocity space, supports negative energy modes near the harmonics of beam gyrofrequency. An {{investigation of the}} nonlinear interaction of high-frequency lower-hybrid waves with the negative energy beam cyclotron mode is made. A nonlinear dispersion relation is derived for the coupled modes. It is shown that a <b>gyrating</b> ion beam frequency upconverts the lower-hybrid waves separated by harmonics of the beam gyrofrequency. This process of upconversion may thus provide a tool for the diagnostics of the <b>gyrating</b> ion beams. The process may also be important in the saturation of lower-hybrid waves observed in the auroral zone S 3 - 3 satellite data...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{possible}} source of pickup ions (PUIs) the ribbon observed by the Interstellar Boundary EXplorer (IBEX). We {{suggest that a}} <b>gyrating</b> solar wind and PUIs in the ramp and in the near downstream region of the termination shock (TS) could provide {{a significant source of}} energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) in the ribbon. A fraction of the solar wind and PUIs are reflected and energized during the first contact with the TS. Some of the solar wind may be reflected propagating toward the Sun but most of the solar wind ions form a <b>gyrating</b> beam-like distribution that persists until it is fully thermalized further downstream. Depending on the strength of the shock, these <b>gyrating</b> distributions can exist for many gyration periods until they are scattered/thermalized due to wave-particle interactions at the TS and downstream in the heliosheath. During this time, ENAs can be produced by charge exchange of interstellar neutral atoms with the <b>gyrating</b> ions. In order to determine the flux of energetic ions, we estimate the solar wind flux at the TS using pressure estimates inferred from in situ measurements. Assuming an average path length in the radial direction of the order of a few AU before the distribution of <b>gyrating</b> ions is thermalized, one can explain a significant fraction of the intensity of ENAs in the ribbon observed by IBEX. With a localized source and such a short integration path, this model would also allow fast time variations of the ENA flux...|$|R
