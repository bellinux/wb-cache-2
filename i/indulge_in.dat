5|$|Young birds <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> play fighting, and one bird {{will often}} lock {{the neck of}} another under its chin. The kakapo is curious by nature and {{has been known to}} {{interact}} with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo, which have distinct personalities.|$|E
5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. There is a clear pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E

5|$|Ahimsa {{does not}} merely {{indicate}} absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> {{any sort of}} violence. Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages. Ahimsa being central to the Jain philosophy, Jain Ācāryas have produced, through ages, quite elaborate and detailed doctrinal materials concerning its various aspects.|$|E
5|$|Pre-Code female audiences {{liked to}} <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> the carnal lifestyles of mistresses and adulteresses {{while at the}} same time taking joy in their usually {{inevitable}} downfall in the closing scenes of the picture. While gangster films were claimed to corrupt the morals of young boys, vice films were blamed for threatening the purity of adolescent women.|$|E
5|$|The {{cattle egret}} may also show {{versatility}} in its diet. On islands with seabird colonies, it will prey on {{the eggs and}} chicks of terns and other seabirds. During migration {{it has also been}} reported to eat exhausted migrating landbirds. Birds of the Seychelles race also <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> some kleptoparasitism, chasing the chicks of sooty terns and forcing them to disgorge food.|$|E

5|$|Further, {{the earth}} goddess Bhudevi {{falls in love}} with her rescuer Varaha. Vishnu - in his Varaha form - marries Bhudevi, making her one of the consorts of Vishnu. In one narrative, Vishnu and Bhudevi <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> {{vigorous}} embraces and as a result, Bhudevi becomes fatigued and faints, sinking a little in the primordial ocean. Vishnu again acquires the form of Varaha and rescues her, reinstating her in her original position above the waters. Some scriptures state that Bhudevi gives birth to Varaha's son, an asura called Narakasura.|$|E
5|$|Glasser {{wished the}} benefit of the {{undivided}} assistance of counsel of his own choice. We think that such a desire on the part of an accused should be respected. Irrespective of any conflict of interest, the additional burden of representing another party may conceivably impair counsel's effectiveness. To determine the precise degree of prejudice sustained by Glasser {{as a result of the}} court's appointment of Stewart as counsel for Kretske is at once difficult and unnecessary. The right to have the assistance of counsel is too fundamental and absolute to allow courts to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> nice calculations as to the amount of prejudice arising from its denial.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{announced}} his candidacy {{in a radio}} broadcast on November 3, painting the race as a choice between a free society and state socialism. Chotiner's philosophy for the primary campaign was to focus on Nixon and ignore the opposition. Nixon did not <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> negative campaigning in the primaries; according to Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, the internecine warfare in the Democratic Party made it unnecessary. The Nixon campaign spent most of late 1949 and early 1950 concentrating on building a statewide organization, and on intensive fundraising, which proved successful.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1950s {{the cult}} of Kataragama has taken a nationalistic tone amongst the Sinhalese people. People visit the shrine year long, and during the annual festival {{it looks like a}} carnival. People get into trance and <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> ecstatic rituals {{formerly}} associated with Hindus such as fire walking, Kavadi and even body piercing or hook swinging. These ecstatic rituals have carried through the island and are widely practiced. Prominent Sinhalese politicians such as Dudley Senanayake and Ranasinghe Premadasa have associated with the temple upkeep by building, renovation and cleaning projects.|$|E
5|$|Troubled by his {{constant}} anger, Chandru meets with {{a psychiatrist who}} advises him to marry soon so that he {{will no longer be}} lonely, saying the loneliness is leading him to dwell on his past and <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> extreme acts. Chandru meets Rekha at a theatre and then at a book stall. He proposes to Rekha and even pleads with her to marry him. Surprised at his extreme pleading, Rekha politely informs him that she loves someone else (Ravi), and their marriage is already fixed. Raghunath is startled when Rekha tells him about Chandru's marriage proposal.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft was {{prompted}} {{to write the}} Rights of Woman after reading Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord's 1791 report to the French National Assembly, which stated that women should only receive a domestic education; she used her commentary on this specific event to launch a broad attack against sexual double standards and to indict men for encouraging women to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> excessive emotion. Wollstonecraft wrote the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond directly to ongoing events; she intended to write a more thoughtful second volume but died before completing it.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant that by the time Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} at the Scuola Normale Superiore, Fermi teamed up with a fellow student named Franco Rasetti with whom he would <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> light-hearted pranks and who would later become Fermi's close friend and collaborator. In Pisa, Fermi was advised by the {{director}} of the physics laboratory, Luigi Puccianti, who acknowledged that there was little that he could teach Fermi, and frequently asked Fermi to teach him something instead. Fermi's knowledge of quantum physics reached such a high level that Puccianti asked him to organize seminars on the topic. During this time Fermi learned tensor calculus, a mathematical technique invented by Gregorio Ricci and Tullio Levi-Civita that was needed to demonstrate the principles of general relativity. Fermi initially chose mathematics as his major, but soon switched to physics. He remained largely self-taught, studying general relativity, quantum mechanics, and atomic physics.|$|E

5|$|In 1654, when Michael Roberts was principal, {{the college}} {{accounts}} record payment {{for construction of}} a ball court. This was {{to the west of}} the principal's garden (which is to the north of the lodgings, alongside Ship Street), between a privy, stables, and the wall of the garden. Ball courts, bowling greens and groves were often added within the precincts of colleges during the 17th century so that undergraduates could amuse themselves under the watchful eyes of their tutors, rather than <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> forbidden pursuits such as drinking in alehouses. In 1757, principal Thomas Pardo added the area of the ball court to the garden of the lodgings and had a coach-house built there, which was reached from an entrance on the corner of Turl Street and Ship Street along a driveway across the north of the garden.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} begins nine months later. Rachel and Adam move into their first house together. He is horrified to {{discover}} {{that she has been}} married for over six years. She contacts her husband Kris Bumstead (Lennie James) and after briefly considering going back to him and dumping Adam, she gets the divorce. After a misunderstanding with Karen, Rachel worries that Adam has stopped finding her sexually attractive, and they agree to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> each other's sexual fantasies. Rachel shares her with Adam: to have sex in a shop window. Adam arranges to get the keys to a shop, and he and Rachel act out her fantasy, though are arrested when a ramraider leads the police to them.|$|E
5|$|The oldest form of hare {{coursing}} simply involved two dogs chasing a hare, the winner being the dog {{that caught the}} hare; this could be for sport, food or pest control. In order to <b>indulge</b> <b>in</b> the informal practice, or hunting, various cross breeds (under the generic British term lurchers) have been created; such animals may be specifically bred for coursing, such as the staghounds used to hunt coyote in the United States. Informal coursing has long been closely associated with pheasant hunting or poaching, lacking the landowner's permission, and is often seen as a problem by the local public, landowners and the police. Clubs affiliated to the Association of Lurcher Clubs organised informal coursing with the landowner's permission, sometimes using a single lurcher rather than a pair to chase a hare.|$|E
