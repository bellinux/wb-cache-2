25|$|In early April as the Allied {{forces and}} notably the French Army {{advanced}} toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders {{to destroy the}} electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but citizens succeeded in persuading the staff sergeant {{in charge of the}} operation to refrain from this absurd endeavor {{in the face of the}} imminent and inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by air strikes even before and after 23 February), and this could not be prevented. Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Wei√üenstein ward was saved by stout-hearted citizens who, during an unguarded moment, pulled off the fuze wiring from the explosive devices, which had already been installed, and <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Nagold river. Soon after that on 8 April, French troops (an armored vehicle unit) moved into Pforzheim from the northwest and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German infantry unit using artillery. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an Algerian and Moroccan unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine Dorance. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighterbomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders (which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the Volkssturm) the French troops finally succeeded and on 18 April took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the proud residential town of the Baden Margraves.|$|E
500|$|Reaching {{the grand}} final meant {{defeating}} the axe-wielding robot Terrorhurtz. Razer avoided the axe and lowered its arm into Terrorhurtz's polycarbonate armour panels. Terrorhurtz {{lined up for}} another strike, but Razer slid its wedge underneath Terrorhurtz's chassis. It buried the arm into its opponent, carried Terrorhurtz to the pit release button, and <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the pit. Only Tornado stood between Razer and a successful title defence. After twice losing to Razer that year, the developers of Tornado had constructed a large metal frame equipped with a rotating blade. Controversially qualifying as an [...] "interchangeable weapon", {{the size of this}} framework prevented Razer's claw from reaching Tornado's chassis. Team Razer responded by attaching a lifting hook {{to the front of the}} arm before the fight. Although Razer would still not be able to pierce Tornado, it could lift it by the framework. In the battle, Tornado used its superior pushing power to slam Razer into the arena wall and the house robots. Near the end of the fight, Razer managed to lift Tornado up and push it over the pit, but the size of the additional framework prevented Tornado from falling in. After a 45 minute discussion, the judges ruled in favour of Tornado becoming the new UK champion.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{begins with a}} brief scene of an {{astronaut}} on Mars uncovering a stone slate featuring {{the cover of the}} album Oops!... I Did It Again. A scientist back on Earth sees it through a video transmitter and says, [...] "Cute. What is it?" [...] As the astronaut replies, [...] "Oh, it's cute alright. It couldn't be...", the ground begins to shake as a large stage rises from the ground. Spears then descends from a platform onto a stage in a red catsuit as the track begins to play. As she continues to sing and dance, she suspends the astronaut mid-air above her. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes of Spears wearing a short white top and skirt, lying barefoot on a white web pad with dancers on the ground around her. During its bridge, Spears does a flip in the air to where the astronaut is and appears in a white jacket, short black leather skirt, and leather boots. As a symbol of his love for her, the astronaut gifts Spears with the Heart of the Ocean, the blue diamond from the blockbuster film Titanic (1997). She questions that she [...] "thought the old lady [...] <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the ocean in the end", to which he responds, [...] "Well, baby, I went down and got it for you". Spears comments [...] "Oh, you shouldn't have" [...] and walks away, the astronaut shrugs and leaves. The video concludes as Spears and her performers continue to dance.|$|E

6000|$|Making a {{perfunctory}} {{pass with}} the Bissell broom, she runs it to [...] the cupboard, {{comes back to}} the table, takes up a bottle and [...] holds it to the light; finding it empty, she turns it upside [...] down and <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the wastepaper basket; then, holding up [...] the other bottle, and finding it not empty, she corks <b>it</b> and [...] <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the fold of her skirt.|$|R

2500|$|Donegal captain Michael Murphy {{scored a}} goal after 2 minutes and 25 seconds, having {{collected}} a high ball delivered by Karl Lacey. [...] Championship Matters named it [...] "Goal of the Championship". After 10 minutes, Patrick McBrearty's attempt at scoring a point struck the post {{and the ball}} fell to Mayo's Kevin Keane. He <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the path of Colm McFadden, who {{took advantage of the}} error to score Donegal's second goal. McFadden was soon through on goal again, only for Mayo goalkeeper David Clarke to save on this occasion. Mayo scored their opening point, from a free, after 16 minutes. Colm McFadden scored 103 (6 points) for Donegal in the first half.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} {{hours of the}} Somme Offensive, Rees was on patrol, taking off in Airco DH.2 No. 6015 at 0555 hours. His attempt to join a {{formation}} of [...] "British" [...] machines brought an attack {{from one of the}} Germans. He shot up the attacker, hitting its fuselage between the two aircrew. As it dived away, Rees attacked a Roland. Long range fire from three other Germans did not discourage Rees from closing on it; it emitted a hazy cloud of smoke from its engine from the 30 rounds Rees fired into it and it fled. Rees then single handedly went after five more Germans. A bullet in the thigh paralysed his leg, forcing him to temporarily break off his assault. As the shock of the wound wore off, he was able to pursue the German formation leader, which was leaving after dropping its bomb. He fired his Lewis machine gun empty. In frustration, he drew his pistol but <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> his DH.2's nacelle. Meanwhile, the German two-seater pulled away above him. The German formation was shattered and scattered.|$|E
2500|$|According to Yusupov's account, Yusupov invited Rasputin to {{his home}} shortly after midnight, and ushered him into the basement. Yusupov offered Rasputin tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. At first, Rasputin refused the cakes, but then began to eat them. To Yusupov's surprise, Rasputin {{did not appear to}} be {{affected}} by the poison. Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. [...] Taking a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, Yusupov returned to the basement and, referring to a crucifix that was in the room, told Rasputin that he'd [...] "better look at the crucifix and say a prayer," [...] then shot him once in the chest. [...] Believing him to be dead, they then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat, in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night. [...] Upon returning to the Moika Palace, Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead. Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who - with some effort - freed himself and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed, and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped Rasputin's body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge and <b>dropped</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the Malaya Nevka River.|$|E
5000|$|... #5: The Only Way To Travel (modes of transportation) The ball is kicked {{into the}} {{backseat}} of a car which enters a tunnel, from which emerges a bicycle with the ball in its basket. The ball is then pushed by a locomotive, then a magnet attached to a plane picks <b>it</b> up and <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a tugboat, causing it to sink. After the ball is shot out of a volcano, it is caught by a blimp, which <b>drops</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the hole.|$|R
