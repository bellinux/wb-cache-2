5|$|The CFM56-5B/3 PIP (Performance Improvement Package) engine {{includes}} {{these new}} technologies and hardware changes to lower <b>fuel</b> <b>burn</b> and lower maintenance cost. Airbus A320s were to use this engine version starting in late 2011.|$|E

5|$|Krueger flap and Natural Laminar Flow Insect Mitigation Test Program – Boeing {{commenced}} {{a series}} of test flights on 17 March 2015 with a modified Boeing 757, incorporating new wing-leading-edge sections and an actively blown vertical tail. The left wing has been modified to include a 6.7 m-span glove section supporting a variable-camber Krueger flap which will be deployed during landing and which protrudes {{just ahead of the}} leading edge. Although Krueger flaps have been tried before as insect-mitigation screens, previous designs caused additional drag; the newer design being tested is variable-camber and designed to retract as seamlessly as possible into the lower wing surface. Increasing the use of natural laminar flow (NLF) on an aircraft wing has the potential to improve <b>fuel</b> <b>burn</b> by as much as 15%, but even small contaminants from insect remains will trip the flow from laminar to turbulent, destroying the performance benefit. The test flights have been supported by the European airline group TUI AG and conducted jointly with NASA as part of the agency’s Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) program. While the left wing tests the Kreuger flaps, the right wing is being used to test coatings that prevent insects from adhering to the wing. Success here will {{open the door to the}} application of Natural Laminar Flow to reduce <b>fuel</b> <b>burn.</b>|$|E

5|$|Eastern Air Lines {{operated}} {{the first commercial}} 757 flight on January 1, 1983, on the Atlanta-to-Tampa route. On February 9, 1983, British Airways began using the aircraft for London-to-Belfast shuttle services, where it replaced Hawker Siddeley Trident 3B trijets. Charter carriers Monarch Airlines and Air Europe also began 757 operations later that year. Early operators noted improved reliability and quieter performance compared with previous jetliners. Transition courses eased pilots' introduction to the new CRT-based cockpit, and no major technical issues arose. Eastern Air Lines, the first 727 operator to take delivery of 757s, confirmed that the aircraft had greater payload capability than its predecessor, along with lower operating costs through improved <b>fuel</b> <b>burn</b> {{and the use of}} a two-crew member flight deck. Compared with the 707 and 727, the new twinjet consumed 42 and 40percent less fuel per seat, respectively, on typical medium-haul flights.|$|E

40|$|Photon dose {{rates as}} a {{function}} of fission product decay times have been calculated for spent fuel assemblies typical of MTR-type research and test reactors. Based upon these dose rates, the length of time that a spent fuel assembly will be self-protecting (dose rate greater than 100 rem/h at 1 m in air) can be estimated knowing the mass of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned,</b> the fraction of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned,</b> and the <b>fuel</b> assembly specific power density...|$|R

25|$|The airline {{claims to}} have lower {{emissions}} than other airlines due to its fleet which has an average <b>fuel</b> <b>burn</b> of less than four litres for every 100 passenger kilometres it flies. The cargo division of the airline uses a similar hub-and-spoke network of operations.|$|E

30|$|Fire {{behavior}} {{is linked to}} fuel load and fuel moisture. We hypothesize that, 1) fuel load and fuel moisture will have a strong impact on the maximum and mean temperatures attained in experimental burns at both 5 and 30 cm above the leaf litter, 2) the percent of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> will be strongly related to the fuel load and fuel moisture levels, and 3) the percent of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> will be strongly correlated to the flame temperature at 5 and 30 cm.|$|R
30|$|Fuel {{moisture}} and fuel load combinations were {{strongly related to}} all measurements of fire behavior. Increasing fuel {{moisture and}} decreasing fuel load decreased maximum and mean temperatures at both 5 and 30 cm above the litter layer. Similarly, {{a higher percentage of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> in heavier <b>fuel</b> loads (likely due to longer smoldering times with moist fuels) and in dryer fuel conditions. Percent of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> was also positively correlated to mean temperatures achieved at 5 and 30 cm above the litter. This correlation was slightly stronger at 5 cm than at 30 cm (r = 0.82 vs. r = 0.73). The correlation between temperature and percent of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> indicates that temperature is a good predictor of some characteristics of fire behavior. Additional measures of fire behavior would be ideal but are not always possible in the field.|$|R

25|$|On April 3, 2006 Symphony Aircraft {{announced}} that a tuned exhaust system made by Power Flow Systems would be offered as an option on the SA-160.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the potential reduction in <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> for BLI (boundary layer ingestion) inlets on a BWB (blended wing body) airplane employing AFC (active flow control). The BWB is a revolutionary type airplane configuration with engines on the aft upper surface where thick boundary layer offers the greatest opportunity for ram drag reduction. AFC is an emerging technology for boundary layer control. Several BLI inlet configurations were analyzed in the NASA-developed RANS Overflow CFD code. The study determined that, while large reductions in ram drag result from BLI, lower inlet pressure recovery produces engine performance penalties that largely offset this ram drag reduction. AFC could, however, enable a short BLI inlet that allows surface mounting of the engine which, when coupled with a short diffuser, would significantly reduce drag and weight for a potential 10 % reduction in <b>fuel</b> <b>burned.</b> Continuing studies are therefore recommended to achieve this reduction in <b>fuel</b> <b>burned</b> considering the use of more modest amounts of BLI coupled with both AFC and PFC (Passive Flow Control) to produce a fail-operational system...|$|R
30|$|High <b>fuel</b> load {{treatments}} <b>burned</b> {{hotter than}} expected when using Iverson et al. (2004) as a baseline. The maximum temperature sensitivity of Tempilaq°G in our experiment was 427 °C. At 5 cm, 24 % of treatment units exceeded this temperature, with 9 % above 660 °C. Using additional paints with indicating points within this range (427 – 660 °C) would have {{enabled us to}} see more resolution at the higher temperatures. Finer resolution of temperatures would also have likely allowed for a higher correlation between pyrometer temperature and percent <b>fuel</b> <b>burned.</b> Vertical clumping of temperatures was readily visible at 5 cm and at 30 cm. Using additional paints with higher melting points would have broken apart these data clumps, causing them to spread laterally and improving the correlation between temperature and percent of <b>fuel</b> <b>burned.</b>|$|R
