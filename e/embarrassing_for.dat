5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though {{the manner in which}} it severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E
5|$|While the Australian Government offered MacArthur ICorps {{for service}} in Leyte and Luzon, nothing came of several {{proposals}} to utilise {{it in the}} liberation of these islands. The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if {{it could not be}} used for offensive operations. This was politically <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the government, and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be employed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident was <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E

5|$|The College found a patroness in Mary I, {{although}} {{it must have}} been <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> both sides, after the heralds initially proclaimed the right of her rival Lady Jane Grey to the throne. When King Edward VI died on 6 July 1553, Lady Jane Grey was proclaimed queen four days later, first in Cheapside then in Fleet Street by two heralds, trumpets blowing before them. However, when popular support swung to Mary's side, the Lord Mayor of London and his councils accompanied by the Garter King of Arms, two other heralds, and four trumpeters returned to Cheapside to proclaim Mary's ascension as rightful queen instead. The College's excuse was that they were compelled in their earlier act by the Duke of Northumberland (Lady Jane's father-in-law, who was later executed), an excuse that Mary accepted.|$|E
25|$|Encouraged by {{the success}} of Guatemala in the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état, in 1960, the U.S. decided to support an attack on Cuba by anti-Castro rebels. The Bay of Pigs {{invasion}} was an unsuccessful invasion of Cuba in 1961, financed by the U.S. through the CIA, to overthrow Fidel Castro. The incident proved to be very <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the new Kennedy administration.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the season, Buffalo coach Rex Ryan {{expressed}} {{that he wanted}} his team to be last {{in the league in}} penalties (the Bills had led the league in penalties in 2014). In that respect, this game was notably <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the Bills as they committed an outrageous 17 penalties for 135 yards. 5 of those were either personal fouls or unsportsmanlike conduct, and 2 of them negated Buffalo touchdowns.|$|E

25|$|Boniface I {{joined the}} Fourth Crusade as a Christian leader in 1203. In {{accordance}} with promises made to Asti and Alessandria, he officially abdicated the marquisate to William before he left. Immediately, William turned towards Asti, then protected by Milan. The Astigiani {{had a history}} of rebellion and were growing in power. In August, with his father beside him, he formed an alliance with Alba and Alessandria, another rebellious commune, against Asti. His allies proved of little worth as he had to make many concessions to them and was still defeated in the field. In April 1206, he opened negotiations with Asti. The peace treaty was <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> Montferrat, but it was accepted by all three allies. William promised to get his father's ratification, but his father was killed fighting against the Bulgarians unaware of any peace back home.|$|E
25|$|England, however, {{continued}} to paste the bowlers, although skipper Michael Vaughan was lucky {{on more than}} one occasion – the most notable when he was dropped by Mohammad Rafique off Rafique's own bowling. By stumps, however, the pair had added 40, and they continued on a sunny second day – less rusty, however, than they had been on the first day. It was all too <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> Bangladesh, as Vaughan raced to 120 before being caught behind off Mashrafe. Four overs later, the patient Rafique finally got his reward, Khaled Mashud coming up with a magnificent catch to get Trescothick out six short of a double century. That was as good as it got for Bangladesh, though, as Ian Bell, Warwickshire's prodigy, made 65 not out, and Graham Thorpe ran runs everywhere to score 42 not out with only two boundaries, before Vaughan decided that enough was enough and declared with seven wickets in hand and a lead of 420 runs.|$|E
500|$|After {{retirement}} from first-class cricket {{at the end}} of the 1960 season in England, McCool returned to Australia, taking up market gardening with a specialty in rare blooms at Umina Beach on the Central Coast of New South Wales. He continued playing club cricket in the Newcastle competition for Belmont until rheumatism forced him to retire from all forms of cricket aged 55: [...] "Rheumatism in my right hand made it <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> me to continue. [...] It was alarming to an old pro like me who prided himself on length and directions to have the ball slip out of my fingers out of control." ...|$|E

The Army's prolonged period of relative inactivity during 1944 led to public concern, and many Australians believed that the AIF should be demobilised if {{it could not be}} used for offensive operations. This was politically <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the government, and helped motivate it to look for new areas where the military could be used. It also impacted upon the Army's morale; as the Allies advanced further towards Japan, the Army was increasingly relegated to [...] "second string" [...] roles, despite having fought [...] "above its weight" [...] for most of the war.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} petition was circulated by Jonathan Speelman {{and others}} regarding the mandatory notification of the arbiter when leaving the playing area (the petition concentrated on toilet visits). Reasons given for this protesting against this [...] "noxious" [...] rule included: the FIDE rule that the toilet {{is part of}} the playing area; an indication it was [...] "humiliating" [...] for players to discuss bodily functions with arbiters (and <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the arbiters); a note that the Match Arbiter (the indicated person to be notified) was not always available, rendering it difficult to always comply with the rule; an argument that frequent toilet trips did not indicate cheating, and a request that players not be penalised merely for this; and an argument that the opponent might gain information from seeing a player notify the arbiter by moving as soon as they left for the bathroom visit. The response by Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov noted only that the third complaint was legitimate, and that [...] "common sense" [...] should apply.|$|E
500|$|The sinkings and {{the failure}} to mount an {{effective}} rescue were <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the Royal Navy. [...] All ships encountering enemies had been ordered to broadcast a sighting report, and the lack of such a report from Glorious was questioned in the House of Commons. It emerged that the heavy cruiser [...] had passed within [...] of the battle, flying the flag of Vice-Admiral John Cunningham, who was carrying out orders to evacuate the Norwegian Royal Family to the UK and maintain radio silence. Some survivors from Glorious and Devonshire testified that a sighting report had been correctly sent, and received by Devonshire, but that it had been suppressed by Cunningham, who departed at high speed in accordance with his orders. It was also alleged that there was confusion over the use of wireless telegraphy frequencies on board Glorious which could have contributed to the failure of any other ship or shore-station to receive a sighting report. The absence of normal airborne patrols over Glorious and its destroyers, in conditions of maximum visibility, were named as contributors to the sinkings.|$|E

500|$|On 17 October, Himmler {{met with}} Meyszner at Kraljevo while {{inspecting}} {{the newly created}} 7th SS Division. While mildly rebuking Meyszner and warning him that if such behaviour recurred, Himmler would have to dismiss him, Himmler {{was impressed with the}} new division. According to Moll, an important factor in Himmler's final decision was undoubtedly the fact that the dismissal of Turner, part of the Wehrmacht command structure, would be much less <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> him than the dismissal of his personal representative, Meyszner. Despite the fact that Turner was [...] "strict and unyielding", he was far more considerate of the concerns of Nedić, his regime and the Serbian population than any other senior member of the government of occupation. It was not just Meyszner's machinations that eventually unseated Turner, because he had been joined in his call for Turner's replacement by Kuntze. On 7 or 8 November 1942, Turner and his deputy Georg Kiessel were finally forced out and Turner was succeeded by his legal department chief, Walter Uppenkamp. In December 1942, Löhr was redesignated as Commander-in-Chief South-East Europe and Commander Army Group E but the local command situation did not change. During 1942, Meyszner was awarded the War Merit Cross 1st Class with Swords.|$|E
500|$|The Rhodesian {{government}} {{initiated a}} search for a new anthem around the time of its adoption of a new green-and-white flag in November 1968, but continued to use [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] until June 1969, when the mostly white electorate voted in favour of a republican form of government. The royal anthem officially remained in place until the formal declaration of a republic in March 1970, when it was abandoned along with numerous other overt references to the Crown. Republican Rhodesia was without an anthem for over four years before the chosen music was announced on 28 August 1974: the Fourth Movement, commonly called [...] "Ode to Joy", from Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The fact that the Council of Europe had adopted this tune as the [...] "Anthem of Europe" [...] in January 1972 apparently did not perturb the Rhodesian government; John Sutherland and Stephen Fender comment that Rhodesia's choice proved deeply <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the British Labour government, whose leaders now had to respect a melody associated with Rhodesia when attending official European functions. With a tune now in place, the Rhodesian government organised a nationwide competition to write matching lyrics, the winner of which would receive a cash prize of R$500 (equal to about US$1,000).|$|E
2500|$|J. Paul Austin, the {{chairman}} and CEO of Coca-Cola, and Mayor Ivan Allen summoned key Atlanta business leaders to the Commerce Club's eighteenth floor dining room, where Austin told them flatly, [...] "It is <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> Coca-Cola to be located {{in a city that}} refuses to honor its Nobel Prize winner. We are an international business. The Coca-Cola Co. does not need Atlanta. You all need to decide whether Atlanta needs the Coca-Cola Co." [...] Within two hours of the end of that meeting, every ticket to the dinner was sold.|$|E

2500|$|Newkirk has {{replied to}} the {{criticism}} {{that no one is}} being exploited, the women taking part are volunteers, and if sexual attraction advances the cause of animals, she is unapologetic. Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: [...] "Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> them, and I understand that. Our own members write to us sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|On 17 July 1942, Yamashita was reassigned from Singapore to far-away Manchukuo again, {{having been}} given a post in {{commanding}} the First Area Army, and was effectively sidelined for {{a major part of}} the Pacific War. It is thought that Tōjō, by then the Prime Minister, was responsible for his banishment, taking advantage of Yamashita's gaffe during a speech made to Singaporean civilian leaders in early 1942, when he referred to the local populace as [...] "citizens of the Empire of Japan" [...] (this was considered <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> the Japanese government, who officially did not consider the residents of occupied territories to have the rights or privileges of Japanese citizenship). He was promoted to full general in February 1943.|$|E
2500|$|The {{combination}} {{of sexuality and}} spirituality shown at Herrnhaag was not unknown in Christian history, but it caused increasing scandal both within and without the church, particularly <b>embarrassing</b> <b>for</b> Nicholas, [...] "who {{was trying to be}} recognized as a rightful theologian after joining the confession of Augsburg" [...] in 1748. Even Christel’s mother was concerned, realizing the events taking place at Herrnhaag and its nearby sister community of Marienborn were at the edge where metaphor and reality meet. Referring to a plowshare that can be raised and lowered, she later wrote to her son that [...] "I sometimes said we have already put the peg in the last hole. If we wanted to remain in the world, the Savior would have to make three or four holes further back and lower down." ...|$|E
