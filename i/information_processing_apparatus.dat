Up to 18 % of the patient safety errors generally and as many as 70 % of adverse drug events could be eliminated if the right information about the right patient is available at the right time. Health information exchange makes this possible. Here we present an overview of six different ways in which HIE can improve patient safety—improved medication <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> improved laboratory <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> improved radiology <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> improved communication among providers, improved communication between patients and providers, and improved public health <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> Within the area of improved medication <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> we discuss drug-allergy <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> drug–dose <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> drug–drug <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> drug-diagnosis <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> and drug–gene <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> We also briefly discuss HIE and decreased patient safety as well as standards and completeness of information for HIE and patient safety...|$|R

40|$|Landauer's principle, often {{regarded}} {{as the foundation of}} the thermodynamics of information processing, holds that any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a bit or the merging of two computation paths, must be accompanied by a corresponding entropy increase in non-information bearing degrees of freedom of the <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> <b>apparatus</b> or its environment. Conversely, it is generally accepted that any logically reversible transformation of information can in principle be accomplished by an appropriate physical mechanism operating in a thermodynamically reversible fashion. These notions have sometimes been criticized either as being false, or as being trivial and obvious, and therefore unhelpful for purposes such as explaining why Maxwell's Demon cannot violate the Second Law of thermodynamics. Here I attempt to refute some of the arguments against Landauer's principle, while arguing that although in a sense it is indeed a trivial and obvious restatement of the Second Law, it still has considerable pedagogic and explanatory power, especially in the context of other influential ideas in 19 'th and 20 'th century physics.

40|$|Cognitive science {{uses the}} notion of {{computational}} <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> to explain cognitive <b>information</b> <b>processing.</b> Some philosophers have argued that anything {{can be described as}} doing computational <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> and if so, it is a vacuous notion for explanatory purposes. An attempt is made to explicate the notions of cognitive <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> and computational <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> and to specify the relationship between them. It is demonstrated that the resulting notion of computational <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> can only be realized in a restrictive class of dynamical systems called physical notational systems (after Goodman's theory of notationality), and that the systems generally appealed to by cognitive science [...] physical symbol systems [...] are indeed such systems. Furthermore, it turns out that other alternative conceptions of computational <b>information</b> <b>processing,</b> Fodor's (1975) Language of Thought and Cummins' (1989) Interpretational Semantics appeal to substantially the same restrictive class of systems. The necessary connection of computational <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> with notationality saves the enterprise from charges of vacuousness and has some interesting implications for connectionism.

According {{to the findings of}} our empirical study, reduction of the demand uncertainty generally can improve the B 2 B system performances of cost saving, operational efficiency, satisfaction, and new business opportunity. Meanwhile, we also found that companies with low uncertainty on the factor of supply have better B 2 B system performances of turnover and market share than the ones with high uncertainty. However, the uncertainty factors of best-selling books, firm investment, and partner investment may not have significant impacts on the B 2 B system performances. From the perspective of <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities, enhancement of purchasing/sales/reconciliation functions is critical to the B 2 B systems if the performances of cost saving, turnover, and satisfaction are the most serious concerns of book publishing companies. On the other hand, the <b>information</b> <b>processing</b> capabilities of procurement/ distribution and enquiries have no significant effects on the B 2 B system performances.
