In addition, we verified that this innovative manipulator generated local flow by using high speed motion of an end effector. We applied this local stream to release microobjects [28]. Our system generates rotational flow by circular motion using the parallel link; the method is applied to the non-contact manipulation of microbeads.

Scope: We attempted to isolate egg cells and zygotes from the ovules of Alstroemeria aurea. The ovules were histologically observed using a clearing procedure which revealed the localization and sizes of the embryo sacs and egg apparatus within the ovules. For {{the isolation of}} egg cells, ovules were cut into sections with a surgical blade and treated with an enzyme solution. Subsequently, these ovule sections were dissected using a <b>glass</b> <b>needle</b> under an inverted microscope. Egg cells successfully isolated by this procedure were collected using microcapillaries connected to a micropump. For zygote isolation, ovules were excised from ovaries 24 hours after self-pollination. By treating excised ovules with an enzyme solution and subsequently dissecting them using a <b>glass</b> <b>needle,</b> zygotes were successfully isolated from the ovules and collected with a microcapillary.

The biological activities of DNA synthesis inducing factor(s) (Chapter 1), mitotic factor(s) (Chapter 2), and DNA coding for ovalbumin and thymidine kinase (Chapter 3) were studied following injection into mammalian somatic cells. ^ Chapter 1. A cell undergoing DNA replication (S phase) contains a factor(s) that induces DNA synthesis prematurely in a G(, 1) nucleus when an S phase cell is fused to a G(, 1) cell. An assay for the active factor(s) was developed in which a mixture of s phase extract loaded red blood cells (RBC) and synchronous G(, 1) HeLa cells was centrifuged onto Concanavalin A (Con A) treated coverslips and fused by PEG. This technique is called 2 ̆ 2 Centrifusion 2 ̆ 2. The synchronous G(, 1) HeLa cells injected with S phase extract initiated DNA synthesis earlier than the control G(, 1) cells mock injected with RBC loaded with buffer. ^ Chapter 2. It has been demonstrated that fusion between a mitotic and an interphase cell usually leads to breakdown of the interphase nucleus, followed by condensation of the interphase chromatin into discrete chromosomes, a process termed premature chromosome condensation. I wanted to develop an assay for the mitotic factor(s) that induces premature chromosome condensation. Experiments were performed utilizing <b>glass</b> <b>needle</b> mediated microinjection of HeLa cell mitotic extract into interphase somatic mammalian cells {{in an attempt to}} induce premature chromosome condensation. However, I was not able to induce premature chromosome condensation in the interphase cells, probably because of an inability to introduce sufficient mitotic factor(s) into the cells. ^ Chapter 3.

In a mouse model, this procedure is substantially complicated by the reduced corneal dimensions. Furthermore, {{it may be difficult}} to estimate the corneal area reached by the volume of a single injection. This study aimed to investigate intrastromal injections into the mouse cornea using different microneedles and to quantify the effect of injecting varying volumes. A reproducible injection technique is described. Methods Forty eyes of 20 129 [*]Sv/J mice were tested. India ink was intrastromally injected using 30 ° beveled 33 [*]G needles, tri-surface 25 ° beveled 35 [*]G needles, or hand-pulled and 25 ° beveled <b>glass</b> <b>needles.</b> Each eye received a single injection of a volume of 1 or 2 μL. Corneoscleral buttons were fixed and flat mounted for computer-assisted quantification of the affected corneal area. Histological assessment was performed to investigate the intrastromal location of the injected dye. Results A mean corneal area of 5. 0 ± 1. 4 [*]mm 2 (mean[*]±[*]SD) and 7. 7 ± 1. 4 [*]mm 2 was covered by intrastromal injections of 1 and 2 μL, respectively. The mean percentage of total corneal area reached ranged from 39 % to 53 % for 1 μL injections, and from 65 % to 81 % for 2 μL injections. Injections using the 33 [*]G needles tended to provide the highest distribution area. Perforation rates were 8 % for 30 ° beveled 33 [*]G needles and 44 % for tri-surface beveled 35 [*]G needles. No perforation was observed with glass needle; however, intrastromal breakage of needle tips was noted in 25 % of these cases. Conclusions Intracorneal injection using a 30 ° beveled 33 [*]G needle was safe and effective. The use of tri-surface beveled 35 [*]G needles substantially increased the number of corneal perforations. <b>Glass</b> <b>needles</b> may break inside the corneal stroma.

40|$|To whom {{correspondence}} {{should be}} addressed During intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) approxi-mately 10 % of all injected oocytes degenerate. The reason for this process is unknown.

By scanning electron microscope (SEM), it could be shown that the surface structure of mature oocytes is extremely elastic so that the injection needle penetrates the zona pellucida without destroying the mesh-like or more compact surface.

Neurite elongation was experimentally induced by towing neurites with a force-calibrated <b>glass</b> <b>needle.</b> On all substrata, towed elongation rate was proportional to applied tension above a threshold tension. The proportionality between elongation rate and tension can be regarded as the growth sensitivity of the neurite to tension, i. e., its growth rate per unit tension. On this basis, towed growth on all substrata can be described by the simple linear equation: elongation rate = sensitivity x (applied tension - tension threshold) The numerical values of tension thresholds and neurite sensitivities varied widely among different neurites. On all substrata, thresholds varied from near zero to greater than 200 mudynes, with some tendency for thresholds to cluster between 100 and 150 mudynes. Similarly, the tension sensitivity of neurites varied between 0. 5 and 5. 0 microns/h/mudyne. The lack of significant differences among sensitivity or threshold values on the various substrata suggest to use that the substratum does not affect the internal "set points" of the neurite for its response to tension. The growth cone of chick sensory neurons is known to pull on its neurite. The simplest cytomechanical model would assume that both growth cone- mediated elongation and towed growth are identical as far as tension input and elongation rate are concerned. We used the equation above and mean values for thresholds and sensitivity from towing experiments to predict the mean growth cone-mediated elongation rate based on mean rest tensions. These predictions are consistent with the observed mean values...|$|R

A compact parallel link produces precise three-dimensional motions. To reach the required end-effector frequency and amplitude, which is necessary for generating the rotational flow that can make rotational movement of microbeads having patterned data, the end effector motion is generated by controlling the three piezoelectric actuators at high speed. In this paper, we focus on rotational flow created by two-dimensional circular motion of the end effector mounted on the parallel link. By changing the amplitude and frequency of the circular motion, the generated swirl flow is analyzed in 3 D space using 9.6 -μm microbeads. We analyzed the velocity toward {{to the root of}} the end effector and angular velocity around the end effector by formulating models. From the analyzed data, we verified that the rotational flow has potential to manipulate micro-objects precisely in 3 D space.|$|R

Micromanipulation of the semi-vesicle by first pressing its membrane with a glass microneedle and then withdrawing the needle left a GV {{in the interior of}} the vesicle. During the process, an aqueous solution of Ficoll that filled the needle was introduced into the newly formed inner vesicle and remained encapsulated. Approximately 50 % of attempted micromanipulation resulted in the formation of an inner daughter vesicle, “microvesiculation”. By repeating the microvesiculation process, multiple inner GVs could be formed in a single parent semi-vesicle. A semi-vesicle with inner GVs could be detached from the electrode by scraping with a microneedle, yielding an oligovesicular vesicle (OVV) with desired inner aqueous contents.
