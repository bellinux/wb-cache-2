It focusses {{on the image}} processing aspects and the calibration of the cameras and it also clarifies details on ergonomic remote control of devices by gestures {{with the help of}} a vision system. The motion detection, the modelling and prediction of motion by the Kalman Filter are described. A main interest was to show through the example ARGUS, how the Kalman Filter should be modelled for a physical motion. Some hints for an intuitive dialogue and remarks about <b>home</b> <b>bus</b> systems are outlined. Most aspects mentioned in this report were realized in the ARGUS prototype.
