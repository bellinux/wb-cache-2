5|$|Tolcapone {{inhibits}} {{the activity}} COMT, an enzyme which degrades dopamine. It {{has been used}} to complement levodopa; however, <b>its</b> <b>usefulness</b> is limited by possible complications such as liver damage. A similarly effective drug, entacapone, has not been shown to cause significant alterations of liver function. Licensed preparations of entacapone contain entacapone alone or in combination with carbidopa and levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Under Spanish Crown rule, {{the town}} of Gibraltar fell into severe decline. The end of Muslim rule in Spain and the Christian capture of the {{southern}} ports considerably decreased the peninsula's strategic value. It derived some minor economic value from tuna-fishing and wine-producing industries but <b>its</b> <b>usefulness</b> as a fortress was now limited. It was effectively reduced {{to the status of}} an unremarkable stronghold on a rocky promontory and Marbella replaced it as the principal Spanish port in the region.|$|E

5|$|By 1963, when President John F. Kennedy began pushing Congress {{to finally}} build the Fort Circle Drive, many in Washington and the National Park Service were openly {{questioning}} whether the plan had outgrown <b>its</b> <b>usefulness.</b> After all, by this time, Washington had grown past {{the ring of}} forts that had protected it a century earlier, and city surface roads already connected the parks, albeit not in as linear a route as envisioned. The plan to link Fort Stanton Park with other fort parks via a grand drive was quietly dropped {{in the years that}} followed.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive {{transcranial}} magnetic stimulation temporarily improves levodopa-induced dyskinesias. <b>Its</b> <b>usefulness</b> in PD is an open research topic, Several nutrients {{have been}} proposed as possible treatments; however {{there is no evidence}} that vitamins or food additives improve symptoms. There is no evidence to substantiate that acupuncture and practice of Qigong, or T'ai chi, have any effect on the course of the disease or symptoms. Fava beans and velvet beans are natural sources of levodopa and are eaten by many people with PD; their intake is not free of risks as life-threatening adverse reactions have been described, such as the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.|$|E
5|$|The Senne {{had long}} since lost <b>its</b> <b>usefulness</b> as a navigable waterway, being {{replaced}} by canals, including the Charleroi Canal. The Senne {{had always been a}} river with an inconsistent flow, often overflowing its banks. In times of heavy rainfall, even the sluice gates were unable to regulate the flow of the river which was often swollen by numerous creeks flowing down from higher ground. Making matters worse, within the city the river's bed was narrowed by encroaching construction due to demographic pressure. The supports of numerous unregulated bridges impeded water flow and caused water levels to rise even further, exacerbated by a riverbed of accumulated waste.|$|E

5|$|In 1903 Synge left Paris {{and moved}} to London. He had written two one-act plays, Riders to the Sea and The Shadow of the Glen, the {{previous}} year. These met with Lady Gregory's approval and The Shadow of the Glen was performed at the Molesworth Hall in October 1903. Riders to the Sea was performed at the same venue in February the following year. The Shadow of the Glen, under the title In the Shadow of the Glen, formed part of the bill for the opening run of the Abbey Theatre from 27 December 1904 to 3 January 1905. Both plays were based on stories that Synge had collected in the Aran Islands, and Synge relied on props from the Aran Islands to help {{set the stage for}} each of them. He also relied on Hiberno-English, the English dialect of Ireland, to reinforce <b>its</b> <b>usefulness</b> as a literary language, partly because he believed that the Irish language could not survive.|$|E
