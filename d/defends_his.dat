5000|$|Nomen est omen {{is used in}} the {{exploitation}} of Skanderbeg's figure by connecting his name with Alexander the Great, who <b>defended</b> <b>his</b> territory, and implying that Skanderbeg also struggled to <b>defend</b> <b>his</b> territory from the Ottoman Empire.|$|R

25|$|Some {{versions}} of the anthropic principle are only interesting if the range of physical constants that allow certain kinds of life are unlikely in a landscape of possible universes. But Lee Smolin assumes that conditions for carbon based life are similar to conditions for black hole creation, which would change the a priori distribution of universes such that universes containing life would be likely. In Smolin vs. Susskind: The Anthropic Principle the string theorist Leonard Susskind disagrees about some assumptions in Lee Smolin's theory, while Smolin <b>defends</b> <b>his</b> theory.|$|E
25|$|But these differences, though {{demonstrating a}} Lagašite respect of {{religious}} figures simply {{in the amount}} of time and energy they required, is not as telling as the language Gudea uses to justify any punishment. Whereas Sargon or Naram-Sin simply demand punishment to any who change their words, based on their power, Gudea <b>defends</b> <b>his</b> words through tradition, “since the earliest days, since the seed sprouted forth, no one was (ever) supposed to alter the utterance of a ruler of Lagaš who, after building the Eninnu for my lord Ningirsu, made things function as they should”. Changing the words of Naram-Sin, the living god, is treason, because he is the king. But changing the words of Gudea, simple governor of Lagaš, is unjust, because he made things work right.|$|E
25|$|John Proctor is {{the protagonist}} of one of Miller's most {{controversial}} works, The Crucible. He is a faithful farmer who lives by a strict moral code that he violates by succumbing to {{an affair with a}} young girl, Abigail, who serves in his home. After Proctor rejects her, Abigail spitefully accuses John's wife of witchcraft, involving him in a string of affairs that challenge his beliefs and convictions. In his attempts to save his wife, he is convicted of witchcraft as well, and will only be acquitted if he confesses to his crime and signs his name to a piece of paper. Proctor is a strong, vital man in the prime of his life both in his confession of witchcraft and the subsequent passion with which he <b>defends</b> <b>his</b> name at the cost of his life.|$|E
