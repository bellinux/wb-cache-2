5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and threshing, not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader <b>has</b> <b>little</b> effect on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Apathetic agnosticism: The {{view that}} no amount of debate can prove or {{disprove}} the existence of one or more deities, and if one or more deities exist, they {{do not appear to be}} concerned about the fate of humans.

25|$|The Europeans found a large {{supply of}} ivory, but found the local Bari <b>had</b> <b>little</b> {{interest}} in anything they were selling. As a result, the merchants often turned to force, seizing the ivory, even this proved {{not to be}} economical and the merchant ventures <b>had</b> <b>little</b> success. Christian missionaries also established posts in the region, with the Catholic Apostolic Vicariate of Central Africa, covering the region.

It was, however, featured together with its wild mountain habitat in Olivier Messiaen’s Catalogue d'oiseaux ("Bird catalogue"), a piano piece written in 1956–58.

5|$|In adults {{short term}} use of nasal decongestants {{may have a}} small benefit. Antihistamines may improve {{symptoms}} in the first day or two; however, there is no longer-term benefit and they have adverse effects such as drowsiness. Other decongestants such as pseudoephedrine appear effective in adults. Ipratropium nasal spray may reduce the symptoms of a runny nose but <b>has</b> <b>little</b> effect on stuffiness.

2500|$|But as {{multiple}} US {{agencies have}} moved into embassies over the years, the COM's authority has actually declined. Not many Army officers realize that COMs <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no staff in the military sense; often they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> oversight of funds moving through other agencies in the embassy, and they <b>have</b> <b>little</b> or no planning capability, which sometimes leads to culture clashes with US military forces in country. More worrisome, under current rules COMs often <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to say about military operations in their countries, overpowered as they are by regional combatant command planning staffs and military teams that move in and out. Under President John F. Kennedy, COMs had explicit authority over Military Assistance Advisory Groups (MAAG), which {{were part of the}} ambassador's [...] "country team." [...] That authority has disappeared over the years...|$|R
5|$|In smaller litters, {{difficulties}} {{may occur}} during labour due to oversized pups. Large litters result in higher incidences of stillbirth, {{but because the}} pups are delivered at an advanced stage of development, {{lack of access to}} the mother's milk <b>has</b> <b>little</b> effect on the mortality rate of newborns. Cohabitating females assist in mothering duties if lactating.|$|E
5|$|Interactions with divers {{show that}} the prickly shark behaves inoffensively towards humans, either tolerating contact or fleeing when closely approached. It is {{susceptible}} to incidental capture by commercial bottom trawls, gillnets, or line gear. It <b>has</b> <b>little</b> commercial value since the meat is soft and poorly regarded. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the prickly shark as Near Threatened, citing its patchy known distribution and the continuing expansion of deepwater fisheries.|$|E

5|$|The tasselled {{wobbegong}} <b>has</b> <b>little</b> economic value, though its attractive skin is occasionally used for leather. In Australian waters, {{it is not}} fished and faces minimal threats. However, elsewhere in its range it may be negatively affected by extensive fishery activity and habitat degradation from pollution, blast fishing, and coral removal. Because of these concerns, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Least Concern.|$|E
