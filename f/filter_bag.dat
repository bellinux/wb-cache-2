25|$|The {{temperatures}} {{needed to}} break down dioxin are typically not reached when burning plastics outdoors in a burn barrel or garbage pit, causing high dioxin emissions as mentioned above. While plastic does usually burn in an open-air fire, the dioxins remain after combustion and either float off into the atmosphere, or may remain in the ash {{where it can be}} leached down into groundwater when rain falls on the ash pile. Fortunately, dioxin and furan compounds bond very strongly to solid surfaces and are not dissolved by water, so leaching processes are limited to the first few millimeters below the ash pile. The gas-phase dioxins can be substantially destroyed using catalysts, some of which can be present as part of the fabric <b>filter</b> <b>bag</b> structure.|$|E

Typically the shredding process uses a steel rotating disc, produce is loaded into a large hopper feeding tube and typically falls into a <b>filter</b> <b>bag.</b> The second process is the hydraulic press, this exposes the shredded produce to extreme pressures between two plates. The pressure causes the juice / water content from the produce to drip into a collection tray (Gastronorm) below, leaving behind the fibre content in the <b>filter</b> <b>bag.</b> The fibre left behind is generally composted, recycled in food products or discarded.|$|E

50|$|Bag {{breakage}} is {{an issue}} that arises with filtered central vacuums. In a portable vacuum, if the <b>filter</b> <b>bag</b> fails, this condition becomes immediately obvious as a cloud of dust and dirt blows into the room. Although it creates a mess, at least the problem can be immediately brought under control by shutting off the appliance. By contrast, if the <b>filter</b> <b>bag</b> in a central unit should fail, little change may be noticed by the remote operator. In fact, the only perceivable change may be an increase in suction power as a clogged but broken bag is completely bypassed. If the filtered air is also used to cool the motor (a very typical design), the first clue that something is amiss may be when the motor completely seizes up due to dirt accumulating in the motor brushes, windings, or bearings. Such a failure can require complete replacement of the expensive central unit.|$|E

The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and [...] "brushes" [...] connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft.

In the carbon black plant, Petrokemija d. d., there are six exhaust stacks for tail gases. Each of them has installed process equipment for cleaning tail gases.

The vicinity of the town, quality of {{the air in the}} region of Kutina, regarding floating particles PM 10, and corporate responsibility for further enviromental improvement, imposes development of new methods that will decrease the emmision of oil-furnace carbon black dust particles in the air. Combining centrifugal percipitator and filter, special construction of cyclofilter for filtration of oil-furnace carbon black dust particles from tail gases by using PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) membrane <b>filter</b> <b>bags,</b> was designed.

40|$|This {{manuscript}} covers an on site industrial {{case study}} focused on the dry filtration of particulate matter (PM) from the waste stream of fertilizer production. In the industrial plant producing fertilizers, {{it was necessary to}} exchange the old wet scrubber with new cleaning equipment for PM disposal. A <b>filter</b> unit with <b>bag</b> <b>filters</b> and pulse-jet cleaning was chosen as the new waste-free technology. Unfortunately, one step in the production involves granulation with steam and water, therefore the waste gas stream was quite humid. <b>Filter</b> <b>bags</b> captured 10 g and 40 g of H 2 O/kg of dry gas for GR-SA and NPK fertilizers respectively. Due to dry filtration feasibility concerns, a long term pilot unit test was conducted. The impact of operating conditions, especially the inlet stream temperature and humidity was evaluated. A inlet temperature 100 °C for GR-SA and 110 °C for NPK fertilizers was necessary to prevent clogging of the <b>filter</b> <b>bags.</b> We found that different cleaning pulses periods and pulse pressures have a minimum impact on the filter pressure difference (ΔP). Based on the results of the pilot test, recommendations for usable technological conditions were given, in order to avoid problematic deposits on filter material associated with increased ΔP. In addition to this, a straightforward comparison method was proposed in this paper for filter clogging according to ΔP between cleaning pulses. Web of Science 29738337...|$|R

50|$|Fan-bypass {{uprights}} {{have their}} motor mounted after the <b>filter</b> <b>bag.</b> Dust {{is removed from}} the airstream by the bag, and usually a filter, before it passes through the fan. The fans are smaller, and are usually a combination of several moving and stationary turbines working in sequence to boost power. The motor is cooled by the airstream passing through it. Fan-bypass vacuums are good for both carpet and above-floor cleaning, since their suction does not significantly diminish over the distance of a hose, as it does in direct-fan cleaners.

50|$|To {{ensure the}} filter bags {{have a long}} usage life they are {{commonly}} coated with a filter enhancer (pre-coat). The use of chemically inert limestone (calcium carbonate) is most common as it maximises efficiency of dust collection (including fly ash) via formation {{of what is called}} a dustcake or coating {{on the surface of the}} filter media. This not only traps fine particulates but also provides protection for the bag itself from moisture, and oily or sticky particulates which can bind the filter media. Without a pre-coat the <b>filter</b> <b>bag</b> allows fine particulates to bleed through the bag filter system, especially during start-up, as the bag can only do part of the filtration leaving the finer parts to the filter enhancer dustcake.|$|E
5000|$|Due to the {{patented}} {{technical features}} that allowed effective cleaning {{of all kinds}} of carpets and bare floors, plus the ability to clean in the tightest corners, the 350, which indicated that the brush vibrator bar was 35 cm, was sold and used in hotels, hospitals and offices. With the addition of features like a clutch-protected brush roller, a by-pass motor and hospital-grade filtration, the first SEBO found acceptance in the market by 1979. Commercial cleaning manufacturers such as Windsor Kärcher and Jeyes Hygiene re-branded SEBO uprights under their own name during the early 1980s. In 1986, the SEBO 360 was launched to replace the 350.

40|$|Actual {{operating}} {{results have been}} used to empirically determine the relationship between fabric filter (baghouse) differential pressure and stack gas flow in a reverse gas cleaned fabric filter. Assumptions are made that the tubesheet pressure drop is the sum of the pressure loss across the filter media and the dust cake. The dust cake is comprised of a component that remains on the bag after cleaning and a removable component that accumulates between cleaning cycles. The component that accumulates between cleaning is proportionate to the inlet dust concentration, the filter velocity and the time between cleaning. This relationship was examined with conventional fiberglass <b>filter</b> <b>bags</b> and with <b>filter</b> <b>bags</b> that have an ePTFE membrane laminated to the woven fiberglass. On average, the results show a 41 % decrease in fabric filter drag that allowed actual stack gas flow to increase by 5 % and baghouse pressure differential to decrease by 39 %. Results suggest the lower drag is attributable to improved ash removal from the bag during cleaning and not due to lower resistance through the filter media itself. Maximum electric power generation increased by 2. 8 % during the peak summer demand period due to the higher gas flow achieved with the ePTFE membrane bags. ...|$|R
