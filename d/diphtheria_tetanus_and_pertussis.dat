40|$|Immunization {{interventions}} {{taken over}} the years have influenced the epidemiology of the various diseases with a reduction in morbidity and generally a lower spreading of the corresponding infectious agents. In some cases, problems related to the length of protection provided by the vaccines and the consequent need not just to optimise vaccinations in newborns but also to plan booster vaccinations have been observed. Boosters are essential to avoid the creation of clusters of newly susceptible subjects among adolescents and adults, previously successfully vaccinated, due both to the decay of immunity and the reduced spreading of microrganisms. The 2005 - 2007 Italian National Vaccination Plan (INVP) has underlined the importance of reaching and maintaining high vaccination coverage rates in childhood and of planning booster vaccinations for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> <b>and</b> polio, beginning from pre-school age and every ten years in adult life. Two timeframes of intervention have been identified: 5 - 6 years (for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> <b>and</b> polio) and 11 - 15 years of age (for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria</b> <b>and</b> <b>pertussis).</b> The availability of combined vaccines for <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> <b>and</b> polio boosters is therefore an important resource. Two products, differing in antigen content and indications for use (DTaP-IPV and dTap-IPV), have been developed for booster immunisation against <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>pertussis</b> <b>and</b> polio.

The main objective of our study was to assess VC of adults against <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> poliomyelitis <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> (dTPaP) according to age.

Methods A cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} 680 adults consulting for biological examination in private laboratories in Lyon (France) to evaluate VC for <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus,</b> poliomyelitis <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> (dTPaP) <b>and</b> enabled reported vaccinations to be compared with documented, confirmed vaccinations. Results Verification of documented, confirmed vaccinations disclosed VC of 78. 7 % for tetanus, 63. 6 % for poliomyelitis, 57. 8 % for diphtheria and 10. 7 % for pertussis. Comparison of confirmed and self-reported vaccinations revealed that a large percentage of people who thought that they were vaccinated were not. VC significantly decreased with age for diphtheria and poliomyelitis and did not vary by gender. The VC rate for pertussis has increased since the 2008 recommendations were made.

Prelicensure studies demonstrated safety <b>and</b> efficacy against <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> when Tdap was administered as a single booster dose to adolescents. To reduce pertussis morbidity in adolescents and maintain the standard of care for <b>tetanus</b> <b>and</b> <b>diphtheria</b> protection, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that: 1) adolescents aged 11 - 18 years should receive a single dose of Tdap instead of <b>tetanus</b> <b>and</b> <b>diphtheria</b> toxoids vaccine (Td) for booster immunization against <b>tetanus,</b> <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> if they have completed the recommended childhood <b>diphtheria</b> <b>and</b> <b>tetanus</b> toxoids <b>and</b> whole cell <b>pertussis</b> vaccine (DTP) / <b>diphtheria</b> <b>and</b> <b>tetanus</b> toxoids <b>and</b> acellular <b>pertussis</b> vaccine (DTaP) vaccination series (five doses of pediatric DTP/DTaP before the seventh birthday; if the fourth dose was administered on or after the fourth birthday, the fifth dose is not needed) and have not received Td or Tdap. The preferred age for Tdap vaccination is 11 - 12 years; 2) adolescents aged 11 - 18 years who received Td, but not Tdap, are encouraged to receive a single dose of Tdap to provide protection against pertussis if they have completed the recommended childhood DTP/DTaP vaccination series. An interval of at least 5 years between Td and Tdap is encouraged {{to reduce the risk}} for local and systemic reactions after Tdap vaccination. However, an interval less than 5 years between Td and Tdap can be used; and 3) vaccine providers should administer Tdap and tetravalent meningococcal conjugate vaccine (Menactra, sanofi pasteur, Swiftwater, Pennsylvania) to adolescents aged 11 - 18 years during the same visit if both vaccines are indicated and available.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis antibody titers after antineoplastic treatment and to suggest an appropriate vaccination approach for pediatric hemato-oncologic patients. A total of 146 children with either malignancy in remission after cessation of therapy or bone marrow failure were recruited. All children had received routine immunization including diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccination before diagnosis of cancer. The serologic immunity to <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus</b> <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> was classified as: completely protective, partially protective, or non-protective. Non-protective serum antibody titer for <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus</b> <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> was detected in 6. 2 %, 11. 6 %, and 62. 3 % of patients, respectively, and partial protective serum antibody titer for <b>diphtheria,</b> <b>tetanus</b> <b>and</b> <b>pertussis</b> was seen in 37 %, 28. 1 %, and 8. 9 % of patients. There was no significant correlation between the severity of immune defect and age, gender or underlying disease.
