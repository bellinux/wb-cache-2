5|$|Various chromatographic {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to detect psilocin in body fluids: the rapid emergency drug identification system (REMEDi HS), a drug screening method based on HPLC; HPLC with electrochemical detection; GC–MS; and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. Although the determination of psilocin levels in urine can be performed without sample clean-up (i.e., removing potential contaminants that make it difficult to accurately assess concentration), the analysis in plasma or serum requires a preliminary extraction, followed by <b>derivatization</b> of the extracts in the case of GC–MS. A specific immunoassay has also been developed to detect psilocin in whole blood samples. A 2009 publication reported using HPLC to quickly separate forensically important illicit drugs including psilocybin and psilocin, which were identifiable within about half a minute of analysis time. These analytical techniques to determine psilocybin concentrations in body fluids are, however, not routinely available, and not typically used in clinical settings.|$|E

25|$|In {{this early}} stage of {{hydrogen}} stable isotope study, most isotope compositions or fractionations were reported as bulk measurements of all organic material or all inorganic material. Some exceptions include cellulose and methane, as these compounds are easily separated. Another advantage of methane for compound specific measurements {{is the lack of}} hydrogen exchange. Cellulose has exchangeable hydrogen, but chemical <b>derivatization</b> can prevent swapping of cellulose hydrogen with water or mineral hydrogen sources.

25|$|Besides {{the usage}} of {{dedicated}} pyrolyzers, pyrolysis GC of solid and liquid samples can be performed directly inside Programmable Temperature Vaporizer (PTV) injectors that provide quick heating (up to 30°C/s) and high maximum temperatures of 600–650°C. This is sufficient for some pyrolysis applications. The main advantage is that no dedicated instrument has to be purchased and pyrolysis can be performed as part of routine GC analysis. In this case quartz GC inlet liners have to be used. Quantitative data can be acquired, and good results of <b>derivatization</b> inside the PTV injector are published as well.|$|E
25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} chitin {{and certain}} peptides {{have been recognized}} for their antimicrobial properties in the past. Today, these materials are engineered into nanoparticles {{in order to produce}} low-cost disinfection applications. Natural peptides form nano-scale channels in the bacterial cell membranes, which causes osmotic collapse. These peptides are now synthesized in order to tailor the antimicrobial nanostructures with respect to size, morphology, coatings, <b>derivatization,</b> and other properties allowing them to be used for specific antimicrobial properties as desired. Chitosan is a polymer obtained from chitin in arthropod shells, and has been used for its antibacterial properties for a while, but even more so since the polymer has been made into nanoparticles. Chitosan proves to be effective against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, however it is more effective against fungi and viruses than bacteria. The positively charged chitosan nanoparticles interact with the negatively charged cell membrane, which causes an increase in membrane permeability and eventually the intracellular components leak and rupture.|$|E
40|$|AbstractIonic {{residues}} {{influence the}} stability of collagen triple helices and play a relevant role in the spontaneous aggregation of fibrillar collagens. Collagen types I and II {{and some of their}} CNBr peptides were chemically modified in mild conditions with two different protocols. Primary amino groups of Lys and Hyl were N-methylated by formaldehyde in reducing conditions or N-acetylated by sulfosuccinimidyl acetate. The positive charge of amino groups at physiological pH was maintained after the former modification, whereas it was lost after the latter. These chemical <b>derivatizations</b> did not significantly alter {{the stability of}} the triple helical conformation of peptide trimeric species. Also the enthalpic change on denaturation was largely unaffected by <b>derivatizations.</b> This implies that no significant variation of weak bonds, either in number or overall strength, and of entropy occur on modification.
