From November 1969 to April 1970 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '70 and her {{accompanying}} icebreaker USCGC Edisto (WAGB-284) was disabled. From November 1970 to April 1971 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '71 and again her accompanying icebreaker USCGC Staten Island (WAGB-278) was disabled. From August to September 1971 she conducted an oceanographic survey along North Slope, Alaska. From February to March 1972 she conducted a scientific survey in Cook Inlet, Alaska. From November 1972 to April 1973 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '73. From June to July 1973 she conducted oceanographic research in Alaskan waters. From November 1974 to April 1975 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '75. From 13 November 1975 to 26 February 1976 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '76. From July to September 1976 she deployed to the Arctic. From 9 November 1976 to 7 April 1977 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '77. During that deployment in December, 1976, she carried out numerous search-and-rescue missions at Wellington, New Zealand, following a torrential downpour. From 9 July 1977 to 8 September 1977 she undertook a cruise to the Arctic Ocean, {{during which time}} her crew constructed several radar navigation towers along the north coast of Alaska and conducted gravity surveys of the Arctic Ocean. From 20 November 1977 to 1 April 1978 she participated in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> '78. From mid-1977 to 9 May 1978 she was stationed at Naval Supply Center Oakland Oakland, California and used for icebreaking.|$|R
5000|$|Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> (OpDFrz or ODF) is the codename for {{a series}} of United States {{missions}} to Antarctica, beginning with [...] "Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> I" [...] in 1955 - 56, followed by [...] "Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> II", [...] "Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> III", and so on. (There was an initial operation before 'Deep Freeze' before Admiral Byrd proposed 'Deep Freeze').Given the continuing and constant US presence in Antarctica since that date, [...] "Operation Deep Freeze" [...] has come {{to be used as a}} general term for US operations in that continent, and in particular for the regular missions to resupply US Antarctic bases, coordinated by the United States military.|$|R
50|$|Released in 2010, this {{anti-virus}} software for Windows combines anti-virus, anti-spyware and anti-rootkit technologies. Faronics Anti-Virus works with <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> so that program updates {{can be performed}} without turning <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> protection off. Faronics Anti-Virus is managed remotely via Faronics Core.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> only protects {{workstations}} in a [...] "fresh-booted" [...] state. That is, <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> prevents permanent {{tampering with}} protected hard drives/partitions across reboots, but user activity between restarts {{is not limited}} by the program. For example, <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> does not prevent application installation; a user can install {{a modified version of}} a Web browser (but seemingly harmless to the unknowing user) designed to secretly send users' passwords to a server connected to the Internet. As a workaround, <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> can be configured to restart after user logout, shutdown after a chosen period of inactivity, or restart/shutdown at a scheduled time in an attempt to ensure that no such installations are retained (as rebooting the system returns the system to its original, unmodified state).|$|R

5000|$|In 1955, Seabees began {{deploying}} yearly to {{the continent}} of Antarctica. As participants in Operation <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze,</b> their mission was to build and expand scientific bases located on the frozen continent. The first [...] "wintering over" [...] party included 200 Seabees who distinguished themselves by constructing a 6000 ft ice runway on McMurdo Sound. Despite a blizzard that undid the entire project, the airstrip was completed {{in time for the}} advance party of <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> II to become the first to fly into the South Pole by plane. MCB 1 was assigned for <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> II.|$|R
5000|$|To make changes, {{a system}} {{administrator}} must 'thaw' the protected partition by disabling <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze,</b> make any needed changes, and then 'freeze' it again by re-enabling <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze.</b> These changes {{become part of}} the protected partition and will be maintained after restarts. 'Freezing' and 'thawing' can be done at the workstation level or remotely via either the Faronics Core management platform or the <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> Enterprise Console. Users of the Enterprise version can also create virtual partitions called ThawSpaces (of up to 1 TB on an NTFS-formatted drive) to retain data on [...] "frozen" [...] hard drives after restarts.|$|R

40|$|This work {{represents}} a formative {{evaluation of the}} effect of <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> on the labs in the Networking, Security, and Systems Administration department. This department maintains 4 labs for student use and has implemented <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze,</b> a software package intended to maintain a standard set of configurations on each computer. In order to provide a proper focus to the evaluation, the process consisted of identifying specific evaluation questions, first through a diverging process, including the input of key stake holders, followed by a converging process. The data was collected using both a survey instrument and interviews, providing both quantitative and qualitative data. This process resulted in information that <b>Deep</b> <b>Freeze</b> does indeed save time for the lab technicians, both in the duration of imaging and in the number of times the labs need to be imaged. Additionally the labs are kept more consistent, the practicals run smoother, and the students like the program.
