50|$|A <b>helper</b> <b>application</b> is an {{external}} viewer program launched to display content retrieved using a web browser. Some examples include JPEGview, Windows Media Player, QuickTime Player, Real Player and Adobe Reader. Unlike a plugin whose full code is included into the browser's address space, a <b>helper</b> <b>application</b> {{is a standard}} application, typically an image viewer or similar type lacking full save functionality.|$|E

40|$|Many popular programs, such as Netscape, use untrusted <b>helper</b> <b>applications</b> {{to process}} data from the network. Unfortunately, the {{unauthenticated}} network data they interpret could well have been created by an adversary, and the <b>helper</b> <b>applications</b> are usually too complex to be bug-free. This raises significant security concerns. Therefore, it is desirable to create a secure environment to contain untrusted <b>helper</b> <b>applications.</b> We propose {{to reduce the risk}} of a security breach by restricting the program's access to the operating system. In particular, we intercept and filter dangerous system calls via the Solaris process tracing facility. This enabled us to build a simple, clean, user-mode implementation of a secure environment for untrusted <b>helper</b> <b>applications.</b> Our implementation has negligible performance impact, and can protect pre-existing applications...|$|R

The program supported viewing JPEG files with or without QuickTime installed as well as featuring slideshows (something that Apple's PictureViewer couldn't do).

5000|$|The new video-enabled Flash Player {{quickly became}} one of the most popular means of {{deploying}} video on the World Wide Web. The Flash Player's ubiquity enabled Flash video to bypass a principal drawback of competing video technologies, which was the requirement for the end-user to download and install an additional browser plug-in or <b>helper</b> <b>application.</b> Other advantages of Flash video were the lack of [...] "chrome" [...] around the video player window which competing players typically displayed, and the customizability of the interface which enabled Web developers to create their own stylized video-playing widgets in Flash. Flash video is now an essential technology used by prominent Web sites such as YouTube, NBC.com, DailyMotion, MetaCafe and JumpCut.|$|E
50|$|The use of helper {{applications}} {{was more}} common {{in the early days of}} the World Wide Web, when HTML and file formats were still becoming standardized and computers were less powerful. Users of a slower computer could configure their browser to hand off all images using a <b>helper</b> <b>application,</b> which would cause the browser to display a standard icon as a placeholder. The user could click the icon only for images they wished to view, thus saving time and bandwidth. In addition, it was considered important for early browsers to be able to keep an image illustrating a figure or graph on screen while scrolling through a long scientific paper and having the image displayed in an external window while the browser window was scrolled allowed that.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{explosion}} in popularity of the Web was triggered by NCSA Mosaic which was a graphical browser running originally on Unix and soon ported to the Amiga and VMS platforms, and later the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms. Version 1.0 was released in September 1993, and was dubbed the killer application of the Internet. It was the first web browser to display images inline with the document's text. Prior browsers would display an icon that, when clicked, would download and open the graphic file in a <b>helper</b> <b>application.</b> This was an intentional design decision on both parts, as the graphics support in early browsers was intended for displaying charts and graphs associated with technical papers while the user scrolled to read the text, while Mosaic was trying to bring multimedia content to non-technical users. Mosaic and browsers derived from it had a user option to automatically display images inline or to show an icon for opening in external programs. Marc Andreessen, who {{was the leader of}} the Mosaic team at NCSA, quit to form a company that would later be known as Netscape Communications Corporation. Netscape released its flagship Navigator product in October 1994, and it took off the next year.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1992 other browsers had appeared, many of them {{based on}} the libwww library. These {{included}} Unix browsers such as Line Mode Browser, ViolaWWW, Erwise, and MidasWWW, and MacWWW/Samba for the Mac. Even though these browsers tended to be simple HTML viewers, relying on external <b>helper</b> <b>applications</b> to view multimedia content, they provided choice to users both in browsers and platforms.|$|R

40|$|In this video, {{we present}} a system called Artifact Buddy, which is {{grounded}} {{on the premise that}} an unaltered Instant Messenger system can simultaneously provide both artifact awareness and interpersonal awareness. In Artifact Buddy, artifacts and people are treated the same way. An artifact – in this case a Microsoft Word document- becomes a first-class IM buddy and behaves like other buddies within a defined group. The artifact-as-buddy knows which people are interested in it and notifies these individuals about its state. Group members can interact with the artifact (and the rest of the group) through the IM system’s standard chat features. Critically, this is all done with a client-side <b>helper</b> <b>application</b> that exploits an existing and unaltered IM system. The IM system does all the heavy lifting: it does the underlying distributed systems work, communication, account control, and so on. For a group that already uses this common IM program, all that is required is that one group member install a <b>helper</b> <b>application</b> to run in the background. Additionally, because our approach takes advantage of the interaction mechanisms already well established by IM, group members can readily join and participate in collaborations without requiring that they learn how to use a completely new application...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Modern {{biomedical}} research is often organized in collaborations involving labs worldwide. In particular in systems biology, complex molecular systems are analyzed {{that require the}} generation and interpretation of heterogeneous data for their explanation, for example ranging from gene expression studies and mass spectrometry measurements to experimental techniques for detecting molecular interactions and functional assays. XML {{has become the most}} prominent format for representing and exchanging these data. However, besides the development of standards there is still a fundamental lack of data integration systems that are able to utilize these exchange formats, organize the data in an integrative way and link it with applications for data interpretation and analysis. Results We have developed DIPSBC, an interactive data integration platform supporting collaborative research projects, based on Foswiki, Solr/Lucene, and specific <b>helper</b> <b>applications.</b> We describe the main features of the implementation and highlight the performance of the system with several use cases. All components of the system are platform independent and open-source developments and thus can be easily adopted by researchers. An exemplary installation of the platform which also provides several <b>helper</b> <b>applications</b> and detailed instructions for system usage and setup is available at [URL]. Conclusions DIPSBC is a data integration platform for medium-scale collaboration projects that has been tested already within several research collaborations. Because of its modular design and the incorporation of XML data formats it is highly flexible and easy to use. </p...|$|R

An essential feature of an RNA alignment editor is the facility to mark-up the alignment based on how it matches a given secondary structure prediction, but few available alignment editors offer such a feature.

Second, we describe efficient algorithms and data structures {{that allow us to}} incrementally construct lower resolution approximations to colored meshes from the geometry and color wavelet coefficients at interactive rates. We have integrated these algorithms in a prototype mesh viewer that supports progressive transmission, dynamic display at a constant frame rate independent of machine characteristics and load, and interactive choice of tradeoff between the amount of detail in geometry and color.
