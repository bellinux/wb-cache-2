25|$|The {{design of}} the Gardens' front facade was {{representative}} of Streamline Moderne architecture style, using straight lines and curved forms. The main entrance and lobby were {{on the first floor}} at street level, and the Greyhounds team offices were on the second floor above. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> doors, the lobby featured cast iron gates through which spectators filed to have their tickets taken. Inside these gates were concessions and entrances to the seating areas.|$|E
25|$|Haughfoot was a hamlet, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders {{near the village}} of Stow. It was in this unlikely location that a Lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners. The significance of this Lodge {{lies in the fact that}} none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges. The Minute Book of the Lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS. Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the Haughfoot fragment is sufficient to confirm that it was very likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS. The 'fragment' was probably retained because the Minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual on the same page.|$|E

500|$|Very little {{information}} was available about homosexuality beyond medical and psychiatric texts. Community meeting places consisted of bars that were commonly raided by police {{once a month}} on average, with those arrested exposed in newspapers. In response, eight women in San Francisco met in their living rooms in 1955 to socialize and have {{a safe place to}} dance. When they decided to make it a regular meeting, they became the first organization for lesbians in the U.S., titled the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB). The DOB began publishing a magazine titled The Ladder in 1956; <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> cover of every issue was their mission statement, the first of which stated was [...] "Education of the variant". It was intended to provide women with knowledge about homosexuality—specifically relating to women, and famous lesbians in history. However, by 1956 the term [...] "lesbian" [...] had such a negative meaning that the DOB refused {{to use it as a}} descriptor, choosing [...] "variant" [...] instead.|$|E
500|$|On each {{floor of}} the two-storey building, the floor plan {{consisted}} of a large central room flanked on either side by two smaller rooms. [...] Although the interior was laid out according to traditional cosmological norms with a north-south orientation and central supporting pillar, the decor was entirely innovative. Tranovola was the first building in Imerina to feature glass windows. Its walls were inlaid with mirrors and painted with naive art frescoes of Merina sovereigns and royal army imagery in a style that has drawn comparisons with French 19th century Épinal prints. The building's fine silk brocaded curtains, chandeliers, cabinets in ebony and gold, and sculptures in alabaster and bronze were remarked upon by a European visitor in 1823, as were the colourful fabric wall coverings imported from England. During the reign of RanavalonaI, Crown Prince Rakoto (later King RadamaII) occupied Tranovola as his personal residence. After the Queen's death, Radama continued to occupy rooms on the second storey of the building, using the smaller rooms {{on the ground floor}} as storage space. A British visitor in 1873 reported that the wooden floors of Tranovola were highly polished, while the walls were hung with French wallpaper and decorated with imported mirrors and oil paintings including a portrait of Queen Victoria given as a gift to RadamaII. Just <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door sat a seven-pound Armstrong Gun in its carriage with numerous imported sofas, costly decorative objects and other items placed throughout the vast space.|$|E

In 2008 a special trim was introduced, TI for Turismo Internationale, featuring 19" [...] alloy wheels, special badges on the front fenders and <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> headrests.

2500|$|Stewart also starred with Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn in George Cukor's classic The Philadelphia Story (1940). His {{performance}} as an intrusive, fast-talking reporter earned him his only Academy Award {{in a competitive}} category (Best Actor, 1941); he beat out his good friend Henry Fonda (The Grapes of Wrath). Stewart thought his performance [...] "entertaining and slick and smooth" [...] but lacking the [...] "guts" [...] of [...] "Mr. Smith". Stewart gave the Oscar statuette to his father, who displayed it {{for many years in}} a case <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door of his hardware store, alongside other family awards and military medals.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884 Portrait of Madame X, a {{portrait}} painting by John Singer Sargent of American-born Paris socialite, Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, {{was criticized for}} depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy {{was so great that}} he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884. In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a [...] "bust form" [...] was advertised that was to be worn <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.|$|E
2500|$|The 1974 models brought further modifications. [...] A 1.6l engine {{producing}} 44 HP SAE (50 PS DIN) {{replaced the}} previous 1.5l. The front fenders were enlarged, new front turn signals (identical {{to the ones}} on American spec Beetles) were added, and round, enlarged taillights were introduced, one year after their appearance on German Beetles (except the 1973 VW 1200). The engine cover remained unchanged, except it no longer had an emblem. <b>Inside,</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> seats were re-designed, and the interior colour was changed from gray to black. Also, the front hood release lever was relocated inside the glovebox, as on 1969 and later German Beetles.|$|E

2500|$|Shortly after 8 P.M., {{residents}} in apartments above the Democratic Club heard several shots. [...] Eight hours later, a cab driver {{going to a}} nearby cafe noticed that the club door was open; he also heard water running inside. The police were called and they found the bodies of Charles Binaggio and Charles Gargotta inside the club. Binaggio was seated at a desk and Gargotta was lying <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> door. [...] Both men {{had been shot in}} the head four times with separate [...]32 caliber revolvers. [...] The police theorized that Gargotta had been trying to escape the club when he was shot in the back of the head. As for the running water heard by the cabbie, it came from a broken toilet and was unrelated to the hit.|$|E

Ventilation in addition to the sunroof and front flap windows was provided by an opening flap under the windscreen. The car had load adjustable headlights and a heater (heaters were standardised on British economy cars in the 1960s).|$|E

2500|$|In {{a family}} tree chart first {{published}} <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> cover of Many Waters (1986, [...] ), L'Engle divided her major characters into categories she called [...] "chronos" [...] and [...] "kairos", two Greek terms for different concepts of time. The {{stories of the}} Austin family {{take place in a}} chronos environment, which L'Engle defined as [...] "ordinary, wrist-watch, alarm-clock time.". These are presented in a primarily realistic framework, though occasionally with elements that might be regarded as science fiction. Kairos, the framework in which the stories of the Murry and O'Keefe families take place, was defined as [...] "real time, pure numbers with no measurement", and often includes such elements as time travel, fantasy and religious content in a struggle between good and evil. A third category of characters, called by L'Engle [...] "those who cross and connect", link the chronos and kairos stories in a latticework of appearances in multiple series of books, ultimately placing nearly every L'Engle character in the same fictional universe.|$|E

The figure of his wife lies on the <b>inside.</b> <b>The</b> <b>front</b> of the tomb is adorned with niches on each (of which) is a shield which had arms painted on it". These two effigies are now in Atherington Church, sided by side on a replacement base, {{on the north side of}} the chancel. They were stated by Stothard (1876) to represent [...] "Sir Ralph Willington (d.1385) and his wife". Cresswell (1938) however suggested them to represent Sir Henry de Willington (d. pre-1437) and his wife Lady Isabella, whom she described as [...] "the last willingtons of importance who held the manor of Umberleigh". Certainly the knight bears the Willington armorials on the chest of his surcoat: (gules) a saltire vair, as can be seen from the Stothard drawing, but which is now barely visible on the monument itself. His head rests on a helm above which is his crest, resembling an inverted goblet (not apparently a pine tree proper as often quoted for this family).|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's 14-year-old brother Star {{testified that}} he'd walked into Jackson's bedroom and seen Jackson masturbating {{himself and the}} {{sleeping}} accuser. He testified that he'd meant {{to go to sleep}} in Jackson's room, had found the door [...] "kind of locked, so [...] pushed it, and it opened," [...] and he walked some ways into the room and stopped when he saw what Gavin and Michael were doing. He testified they were on the bed [...] "outside of the covers," [...] Jackson was on his back with his eyes closed, and Gavin was [...] "curled up" [...] facing away from Jackson and was [...] "kind of snoring." [...] Star couldn't remember what his brother had been wearing but said it might have been [...] "pants or underwears," [...] and that Jackson was wearing [...] "socks, underwears, and an undershirt," [...] but later said Jackson's [...] "hand was in his pants." [...] He variously used the words [...] "pants" [...] and [...] "underwears" [...] for both Gavin and Jackson to describe what they were wearing. One aspect that weakened his testimony was that Star, the only witness to the alleged molestation, claimed he twice walked in on Jackson molesting Gavin and was completely unnoticed, even while tripping the alarm system in the hallway leading to Jackson's bedroom. An alarm or bell would sound whenever anyone approached, and Star claimed that on both occasions the alarm went off and Jackson didn't hear it. Neither did he hear nor see the boy come and go. Star said he stood watching for about four seconds before he [...] "just went back to the guest units." [...] Star testified that two days later he had an almost identical experience. He allegedly walked into Jackson's bedroom and saw that [...] "the same thing was happening," [...] with Jackson [...] "masturbating, stroking up and down" [...] and his other hand moving around in Star's sleeping [...] "brother's underwears." [...] This time Star only stayed for three seconds before returning to the guest units. Star's account of the sexual act on the second occasion matched neither the description he gave during an interview with psychologist Stanley Katz nor his statement given in police interviews in 2003. Star Arvizo {{said in an interview with}} the psychologist on May 29, 2003, that he witnessed Jackson placing his hand on Gavin's crotch outside his clothes. On July 7, 2003, during his first interview with sheriff's investigators, Star changed his story. He claimed that during the first incident Jackson placed his left hand under the front of his brother's pajama pants. Star Arvizo changed his account still a third time during a police interview on August 13, 2003, when he claimed that Jackson had placed his hand <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>front</b> of his brother's boxer shorts. Dr. Katz' grand jury testimony about what Star had told him included a story about Jackson [...] "rubbing his penis against Gavin's buttocks" [...] and another about smelling marijuana. In court, Star denied that he'd made the allegations and refused Mesereau's offer to [...] "refresh [...] recollection [...] that page of [...] testimony." ...|$|E
