A review of the plans of the Euro- pean Community in the integration of their respective national markets into a single market is also presented in terms of bringing down physical, technical and <b>fiscal</b> <b>frontiers.</b> Lastly, it examines the strategies that could be taken by the SEACEN countries in response to this important development. ...|$|E
40|$|The current VAT {{regime in}} the EU, {{introduced}} with the removal of <b>fiscal</b> <b>frontiers</b> in 1993, is explicitly transitional. We consider the issues that arise in designing a 'definitive' regime. The two most widely canvassed options [...] adoption of a clearing house or a shift to origin taxation [...] are found wanting. The paper develops an alternative strategy, combining a harmonized rate of VAT on transactions between firms (both between and within member states) with national discretion over rates applied to final sales. This offers {{the prospect of a}} real improvement on current arrangements...|$|E
40|$|This paper tackles fiscal {{sustainability}} and fiscal soundness. In {{contrast to the}} existing literature, our analysis is in a general equilibrium framework. We obtain three results. First, we endogenize growth rate and interest rate, the two key rates for any study of {{fiscal sustainability}}; second, we illustrate that fiscal sustainability in general equilibrium should not be measured by a one-dimension indicator, e. g., debt-to-GDP ratio as in conventional studies, rather it is a line¡ªa fiscal sustainability frontier¡ªin two dimensions, namely, debt-to-GDP ratio and expenditure-to-GDP ratio; third, we obtain a novel and useful index of aggregate fiscal soundness. <b>Fiscal</b> sustainability, Sustainability <b>frontier,</b> <b>Fiscal</b> soundness...|$|R
40|$|Proposals for {{approximating}} and harmonising {{indirect taxes}} across Europe {{are central to}} the planned creation of a single European market in 1992. If implemented, the Commission's proposals would have major direct and indirect effects {{for a wide variety of}} European business. They would also have very large effects on the revenue position, tax structures, and tax administrations of member states. For this reason, they are very unlikely to be implemented, and since partial harmonisation is no more possible than partial pregnancy, it follows that the realistic prospect of <b>fiscal</b> <b>frontiers</b> being dismantled in 1992, or in any forseeable time frame, is small. It is important that business planning should be based, not on loose generalisations about the coming single European market, but on a careful assessment of what changes are likely to be implemented in practice. ...|$|E
