50|$|Differential {{nonlinearity}} (acronym DNL) {{is a term}} {{describing the}} deviation between two analog values corresponding to adjacent input digital values. It is an important specification for measuring error in a digital-to-analog converter (DAC); the accuracy of a DAC is mainly determined by this specification. Ideally, any two adjacent digital codes correspond to output analog voltages that are exactly one Least Significant Bit (LSB) apart. <b>Differential</b> <b>non-linearity</b> {{is a measure of}} the worst case deviation from the ideal 1 LSB step. For example, a DAC with a 1.5 LSB output change for a 1 LSB digital code change exhibits 1⁄2 LSB <b>differential</b> <b>non-linearity.</b> <b>Differential</b> <b>non-linearity</b> may be expressed in fractional bits or as a percentage of full scale. A <b>differential</b> <b>non-linearity</b> greater than 1 LSB may lead to a non-monotonic transfer function in a DAC. It is also known as a missing code.|$|E

We build an improved version of the Servo-Loop targeted to full transistor-level circuit simulation of static integral and <b>differential</b> ADC <b>non-linearity.</b> In comparison with the conventional implementation, the Servo-Loop version proposed was enhanced by an effective search algorithm. The algorithm was implemented as a versatile Servo-Looper tool written in Verilog-A language which is suitable for direct co-operation {{with most of the}} analog and mixed-signal simulators used in industry. The prospective advantage of our approach {{is the fact that the}} implementation in Verilog-A creates an ideal opportunity to build a complex environment comprising the virtual testing engine as well as the DUT in the form of circuit-level ADC design or its behavioral model. At this point, the powerful capabilities of the proposed Servo-Looper tool were successfully confirmed by a large simulation set performed on the ADC behavioral model and the full custom ADC design example.

50|$|All ADCs {{suffer from}} {{non-linearity}} errors caused by their physical imperfections, causing their output {{to deviate from}} a linear function (or some other function, {{in the case of}} a deliberately non-linear ADC) of their input. These errors can sometimes be mitigated by calibration, or prevented by testing. Important parameters for linearity are integral non-linearity (INL) and <b>differential</b> <b>non-linearity</b> (DNL).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} inflation rate differentials between seven Central and Eastern Countries (CEECs) and the Eurozone. We focus explicitly upon {{a group of}} CEECs given that although they are already member states, they are currently {{not part of the}} Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and must fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria before being able to adopt the euro. However, this group of countries does not have an opt-out clause and so must eventually adopt the single currency. Hence, considering divergence in inflation rates between each country and the Eurozone is important in that evidence of persistent differences may increase the chance of asymmetric inflationary shocks. Furthermore, once a country joins the Eurozone the operation of a country specific monetary policy is no longer an option. We explicitly test for convergence in the inflation rate <b>differentials,</b> incorporating <b>non-linearities</b> in the autoregressive parameters, fractional integration with endogenous structural changes, and also consider club convergence analysis for the CEECs over the period 1997 to 2011 based on monthly data. Our empirical findings suggest that the majority of countries experience non-linearities in the inflation rate differential, however there is only evidence of a persistent difference in three out of the seven countries. Complementary to this analysis we apply the Phillips and Sul (2007) test for club convergence and find that there is evidence that most of the CEECs converge to a common steady state.

The literature documents laboratory experiments under restressed conditions that show stress dependent rock properties are more significant in tighter rocks. For gas reservoirs, real gas properties are also sensitive to variations of pressure, and the correct description of gas flow must include pressure-dependent gas properties. Under these circumstances the resulting equation for real gas flow is a second order, non-linear, partial <b>differential</b> equation. <b>Non-linearities</b> include pressure-dependence of gas viscosity, gas compressibility, reservoir permeability and reservoir porosity. This paper investigates dynamic permeability change {{as a function of}} net overburden stress in tight gas reservoirs. The gas reservoir simulator used for this work included pressure-dependent reservoir permeability. Radial flow cases are analyzed using this simulator. During this study we found that from analysis of production data alone, it is impossible to determine the correct permeability value for tight gas reservoirs with pressure-dependent permeability. For the cases studied, the transient performance was similar for both constant permeability and pressure-dependent permeability. This similarity causes constant permeability and pressure-dependent permeability to be indistinguishable, based on analysis of transient performance data. It was found that the productivity index decreases when pressure-dependent permeability is more significant.

40|$|On-orbit system {{identification}} (ID) of large space systems {{is essential for}} various reasons. For example, the complex composite structure of such systems cannot be ground-tested; their structural dynamic characteristics must be known accurately {{in order to accomplish}} active control. Furthermore, such capability can be used to characterize/identify various disturbances. The identification process is consisted of four principal elements: (1) modeling, (2) the estimation algorithm, (3) input system, and (4) measurement system. These elements are highly correlated and all togerher determine the success of the identification problem. Accurate modeling of large space systems is the most important element of the identification process. Large flexible structures are non-linear and infinite dimensional systems with highly coupled parameters and low frequency packed modes. In addition, these systems are subject to stochastic and time-varying disturbances, they have structural parameters which can vary due to on-orbit assembly deployment, and operations. These systems are generally; however, represented by constant coefficient, finite order <b>differential</b> equations. The <b>non-linearities,</b> coupling and noise effects are also often neglected.
