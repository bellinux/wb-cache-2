50|$|The {{new school}} {{incorporates}} many eco-friendly design ideas. Central to this effort is a below <b>floor,</b> quiet, displaced <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> system which allows improved {{indoor air quality}} and thermal comfort while using less energy to deliver conditioned air. The building features {{a good deal of}} natural day lighting, with borrow lights throughout the interior, indirect lighting with higher ceilings, and daylight sensors. The building has highly reflective roofing materials and locally produced materials such as Kansas brick and limestone. The school was sited with careful attention to solar orientation to minimize heat gain yet maximize views. An existing pond was enhanced to collect storm water run-off and provide water for irrigation of the surrounding landscape.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{addition}} of a dual flow <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> system to the NASA Langley National Transonic Facility was experimentally validated with a Dual Aerodynamic Nozzle semi-span model. This model utilized two Stratford calibration nozzles to characterize the weight flow system of the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> system. The weight flow boundaries for the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> system were identified at mildly cryogenic conditions to be 0. 1 to 23 lbm/sec for the high flow leg and 0. 1 to 9 lbm/sec for the low flow leg.

40|$|Abstract — Ceiling {{fans are}} one of the mostly used comfort device in {{domestic}} use. <b>Air</b> <b>delivery</b> produced from fan is multiple of the rotational frequency of the fan. <b>Air</b> <b>delivery</b> {{is one of the most}} important parameter. To analyze the air delivered from the fan was important to identify the parameters affecting it. Ceiling fans are extensively used to create an indoor breeze, improve the space air distribution and hence enhance the feeling of comfort. The fan speed, room size, number of blades and downrod length all play an important role in deciding the induced flow pattern features in space. Few previous studies have investigated fan induced flow and its characteristics under different geometric and operating conditions. In this study,response surface methodology was used to predict <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> from the fan. The experiments were conducted based on three different Fan Blade, three different room volume, three different downrod lengths, three different fan speeds and mathematical model was developed. For targeted <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> optimum levels of input parameters were selected using optimization analysis...|$|R

40|$|Although {{constant}} positive airway pressure {{therapy is}} currently the most effective form of non-invasive treatment to relieve obstructive sleep apnea symptoms, it has relatively low treatment compliance due to pressure related side effects. Existing commercial continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices rely on the combined airflow characteristics of both the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit and nasal mask vent to regulate treatment pressure. Fluctuation in mask pressure occurs however, due to patient breathing, presenting an opportunity to develop an alternative breathing therapy device capable of achieving dynamic control of mask pressure. Within this research, a computer model of a proposed patient breathing therapy device, based on characteristics of a prototype system, is developed to determine the breathing system <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> requirements whilst operating under a simulated patient breathing load. This model initially utilises an idealised, zero order, <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit behaviour, since this system element {{is yet to be}} built. A review of different types of air compressors is undertaken and the diaphragm type compressor selected as being best suited for practical implementation within the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit of the breathing system, based on constraints of air quality, available machining resource and materials. Thermodynamic design of the compressor is undertaken to determine physical dimensions and a range of actuation methods are reviewed, based on force and speed requirements. A speed controlled 3 phase AC induction motor is selected to actuate the compressor. The diaphragm compressor is built and tested under both steady state and dynamic conditions and proven capable of meeting the breathing system air supply for both air pressure and flow requirements. The <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit within the model simulation, previously based on an idealised, zero order element, is characterised with the same dynamic behaviour as the prototype unit built, established during testing, and shown by simulation to meet the breathing system requirements under dynamic patient breathing load. Implementation of the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> unit within the completed prototype breathing system shows the mask pressure to fluctuate outside the desire pressure tolerance range; however, to remedy this situation, the compressor requires the development of an appropriate control scheme which {{is beyond the scope of}} this work...|$|R

These methods were applied to model the 20 kW automotive fuel cell system {{that was used in}} Animul H 2, a fuel cell-battery hybrid sedan developed by a group of engineering students at Virginia Tech. The <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> system included the air compressor, the drive motor for the compressor, the motor controller, and any plumbing between the fuel cell inlet and the compressor outlet. The procedure was to collect data from a series of tests of the <b>air</b> <b>delivery</b> system with no load (zero outlet pressure) and at several loads. The air compressor speed, outlet pressure, and motor controller current were measured in response to a variety of speed requests. This data was fit to transfer functions relating the compressor speed, outlet pressure, or motor controller current to the speed request. The fits were found using a least squares optimization technique. After the experimental model was developed, it was augmented with an analytical model {{of the rest of the}} fuel cell system. The mass flow of the air was determined fro...|$|R
