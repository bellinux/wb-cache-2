5|$|Another {{issue was}} whether the {{exterior}} shutter over Madeleine's bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box {{at the top of}} the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the Polícia Judiciária that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside.</b> Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.|$|E

50|$|Flow banding {{containing}} both obsidian and pumice {{is common}} at Panum Crater. Another common texture, called breadcrust, {{can also be}} seen in the dome. Breadcrust textures form when the inside of a cooling rock is still hot with gas escaping <b>from</b> it while <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface has already cooled. As <b>the</b> gas expands <b>from</b> <b>the</b> inside, <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> surface cracks to allow the gas to escape.|$|R
5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them. Suicidal defenses by workers are also noted in the Brazilian ant Forelius pusillus, where {{a small group of}} ants leaves the security of the nest after sealing the entrance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> each evening.|$|E
5|$|During Shadow of the Colossus, {{the player}} {{receives}} little {{information concerning the}} backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another. The game {{takes place in a}} fantasy setting, with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated peninsula, known as the Forbidden Land, separated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east. The presence of ruins and other ancient structures indicate the area was once a settlement.|$|E

5|$|In 1933, Hitler {{purchased}} a small holiday {{home on the}} mountain at Obersalzberg. Renovations began in 1934 and were completed by 1936. A large wing was added onto the original house and several additional buildings were constructed. The entire area was fenced off, and remaining houses on the mountain were purchased by the Nazi Party and demolished. Braun {{and the other members}} of the entourage were cut off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world when in residence. Speer, Hermann Göring, and Martin Bormann had houses constructed inside the compound.|$|E
5|$|It {{is only as}} {{a result}} of {{accurately}} maintaining the composition of the 3 litres alveolar air that, with each breath, some carbon dioxide is discharged into the atmosphere and some oxygen is taken up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> air. If more carbon dioxide than usual has been lost by a short period of hyperventilation, breathing will be slowed down or halted until the alveolar partial pressure of carbon dioxide has returned to 5.3kPa (40mmHg). The opposite occurs after breath-holding.|$|E
5|$|Phillips {{chooses to}} be kept in the dark {{about the future of the}} series, never knowing any farther ahead than his current working script. For Kill or Be Killed, he is using digital tools and the same panel layout he has used on {{previous}} works, but removed the frame <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> edges because he felt the full bleed makes the images feel more claustrophobic. Breitweiser, an integral part of the team, is coloring Phillips' art in a moody palette with gritty textures and incorporating color psychology.|$|E

5|$|The barracks {{was less}} than 10yards wide and 33yards long (9mx30m) and was divided into eight houses, each with three floors, {{containing}} 56 rooms in all. Each floor had seven rooms facing the front and seven in the back. There were no internal hallways. The rooms were accessed directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> via eight narrow wooden staircases, a fire hazard given that the stairs provided the sole exit and the houses were separated only by thin lathe and plaster partitions.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} was rebuilt in 1953 {{after having been}} destroyed during the war. The pavilion measures three bays by two, but is nearly a perfect square. It is built on a short stone platform called a yuetai (月台) which is accessed by a short set of stairs. While <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside,</b> the pavilion appears to only have two stories, there are actually three, with the second floor being hidden from outside view. Each of the exterior levels {{is surrounded by a}} perimeter of columns.|$|E
5|$|The {{floor of}} the barn was {{originally}} made of hard-packed flint gravel held together with iron panning, excavated from a local gravel deposit, which {{was used as a}} more readily available alternative to stone. In subsequent years it was repaired with brick, tile and, ultimately, cement, obscuring the original appearance of the floor. An indication of how it would have looked can still be obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> of {{the west side of the}} barn.|$|E

5|$|Ucu {{was born}} in Sukabumi, West Java, on 19 August 1976 to a strict Muslim family. As a child, she studied in the Darunnajah Islamic {{boarding}} school in Jakarta for six years; removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, she felt shocked when she learned {{that many of the}} women in her hometown worked as prostitutes. This discovery led her to become more critical of the world around her and made her interested in journalism. Ucu later attended the Jakarta Islamic State University.|$|E
5|$|According to Filitti, the war {{spelled out}} {{the end of}} Romania's aristocratic order, leaving the country prey to the nouveaux riches and the neo-Jacobins. As the Conservative Party itself {{collapsed}} into obscurity, he remained largely cut off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world, and rejected many of the recent innovations. Reportedly, he wrote all his books and articles in dip pen, and never watched a motion picture. After 1919, he had to recover from financial ruin, having entrusted {{the bulk of his}} assets (what had not been lost in the war) to a broker, who gambled it away and then committed suicide.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{construction}} {{began on}} the second phase, the B Station. The station came into operation gradually between 1953 and 1955. It was nearly identical to the A Station <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> and was constructed directly to its east as a mirror to it, which gave the power station its now familiar four-chimney layout. The construction of the B Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations). It was also the most thermally efficient power station in the world when it opened.|$|E
5|$|Albania still {{maintained}} some {{links with}} the outside world at this time, trading with neutral countries, such as Austria and Sweden, and establishing links across the Adriatic Sea with its former colonial power Italy. However, a modest relaxation of domestic controls was curtailed by Hoxha in 1973 with a renewed wave of repression and purges directed against individuals, the young and the military, whom he feared might threaten his hold on the country. A new constitution was introduced in 1976 that increased the Communist Party's control of the country, limited private property and forbade foreign loans. The country sank into a decade of paranoid isolation and economic stagnation, virtually cut off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> world.|$|E

As a security feature, the elevators must be operated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>outside</b> with a room key. There are no buttons inside the elevators themselves. Other services include 24-hour in-room dining {{and access to the}} spa. WiFi access and shoeshine services are available for an additional charge.|$|E
