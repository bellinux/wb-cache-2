40|$|AbstractExpression of the {{transcription}} factor zic 1 {{at the onset}} of gastrulation is one of the earliest molecular indicators of neural fate determination in Xenopus. Inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is critical for activation of zic 1 expression and fundamental for establishing neural identity in both vertebrates and invertebrates. The mechanism by which <b>interruption</b> of BMP <b>signaling</b> activates neural-specific gene expression is not understood. Here, we report identification of a 215 bp genomic module that is both necessary and sufficient to activate Xenopus zic 1 transcription upon <b>interruption</b> of BMP <b>signaling.</b> Transgenic analyses demonstrate that this BMP inhibitory response module (BIRM) is required for expression in the whole embryo. Multiple consensus binding sites for specific transcription factor families within the BIRM are required for its activity and some of these regions are phylogenetically conserved between orthologous vertebrate zic 1 genes. These data suggest that <b>interruption</b> of BMP <b>signaling</b> facilitates neural determination via a complex mechanism, involving multiple regulatory factors that cooperate to control zic 1 expression...|$|R

This {{study examined the}} effectiveness of distributing tasks across various sensory channels and presenting information {{on the nature of}} an interruption task to support timesharing and attention management. Participants performed a visually demanding simulated Air Traffic Control (ATC) task involving Data Link communication. At times, an interruption task was introduced, which consisted of counting subsets of signals that were presented in visual, auditory, or tactile form. Half of the subjects automatically received information on the modality and urgency of these pending interruption tasks whereas the other participants had the option to request this information. Within-subject variables in this study included ATC-related workload and the frequency and priority of interruption tasks. High-priority tasks had to be performed immediately whereas low-priority tasks could be delayed for up to two minutes. The results show that information about the nature of pending tasks supported participants in scheduling and timesharing more effectively. They were able to avoid intramodal interference and scanning costs associated with performing the ATC task concurrently with a visual interruption task. Crossmodal interference was lowest for auditory interruption tasks.

[MIL-STD- 1553 is a military standard that encompasses a method of communication and electrical- interface requirements for digital electronic subsystems connected to a data bus. PC/ 104 is an industry standard for compact, stackable modules that are fully compatible (in architecture, hardware, and software) with personal-computer data- and power-bus circuitry. ] Prior {{to the development of}} the miniBIC, only one- and two-channel PC/ 104 MIL-STD- 1553 boards were available. To obtain four channels, it was necessary to include at least two boards in a PC/ 104 stack. In comparison with such a two-board stack, the miniBIC takes up less space, consumes less power, and is more reliable. In addition, the miniBIC includes 32 digital input/output channels. The miniBIC (see figure) contains four MIL-STD- 1553 B hybrid integrated circuits (ICs), four transformers, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and an Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) interface. Each hybrid IC includes a MILSTD- 1553 dual transceiver, memory-management circuitry, processor interface logic circuitry, and 64 Kx 16 bits of shared static random access memory. The memory is used to configure message and data blocks. In addition, 23 16 -bit registers are available for (1) configuring the hybrid IC for, and starting it in, various modes of operation; (2) reading the status of the functionality of the hybrid IC; and (3) resetting the hybrid IC to a known state. The miniBIC can operate as a remote terminal, bus controller, or bus monitor. The FPGA provides the chip-select and data-strobe signals needed for operation of the hybrid ICs. The FPGA also receives <b>interruption</b> <b>signals</b> and forwards them to the ISA bus. The ISA interface connects the address, data, and control interfaces of the hybrid ICs to the ISA backplane. Each channel is, in effect, a MIL-STD- 1553 interface that can operate either independently of the others or else as a redundant version of one of the others. The transformer in each channel provides electrical isolation between the rest of the miniBIC circuitry and the bus to which that channel is connected...|$|R
