40|$|The article {{outlines}} {{social and}} economic consequences of collectivization to compare this state policy with the changes in agriculture in the 1990 s, and to estimate chances of the Russian agriculture to overcome the current crisis. The {{article is based on}} archive data on collectivization and on the program developed by the Academy of High <b>Ecotechnologies.</b> The authors believe {{that at the time of}} collectivization, it was a way to optimize agriculture: largely due to collectivization, though with all its losses and ‘extremes’, the soviet agriculture was partially industrialized and provided the country with food in the hardest years of the Great Patriotic War and in the post-war period, thus ensuring the food security of the Soviet state. The ‘emergency’ model of the so-called ‘return to civilization’ that was adopted under the reforms of the 1990 s aimed at turning the collective farmer into an individual farmer or a rural wageworker, but such a social ‘migration’ strategy imposed ‘from above’ deformed the rural social stratum and determined serious economic problems. Today the authors consider the neo-collective farms as a promising perspec-tive. They also support the program developed by the Academy of High <b>Ecotechnologies</b> for intensification of agricultural production on the basis of progressive domestic and foreign technologies, which will allow to increase the agricultural production in the next three to five years by several times. In particular, for more effective use of agricultural technologies and processing industries, the program suggests develop-ing the enlarged organizational-economic structures - ‘agropromkhozes’...|$|R

40|$|A {{wide range}} of <b>ecotechnologies</b> {{has been applied to}} {{treatment}} of variable stormwater and wastewater flows. Stormwater ponds and basins were already introduced as common ‘end-of-the-pipe’ treatment solutions in the 1960 s, almost parallel to the first attempts to develop structured wastewater treatment with the help of plants, inspired by natural wetlands. Constructed wetlands specifically designed for the treatment of variable flows emerged in the 1990 s and were joined by a growing group of vegetated filter systems, named bioretention filters, raingardens or retention soil filters, all following the principle of gravity-driven wastewater filtration. This chapter provides a general overview of these treatment facilities, including swales and buffer strips. Although the latter ones are gravity-driven filtration systems, they are commonly used for the treatment of road runoff and are highly adapted to fit into their landscape structure, they are described in a separate section. Each section includes references to detailed design and operation guidelines...|$|R

40|$|Metals {{were the}} first {{priority}} pollutants to be widely investigated in stormwater. In solid phase, they are often attached to very fine particles. The dissolved fraction creates considerable environmental problems {{as it is the}} most bioavailable fraction. Hence, removal of both fine and dissolved particles {{plays a major role in}} the treatment of polluted runoff. <b>Ecotechnologies</b> specifically designed to remove metals should be able to address different treatment mechanisms. However, the exhaustion of sorption capacity reduces the lifespan of treatment facilities. Additionally, metal concentrations fluctuate extremely—spatially, seasonally and over time—which poses another challenge for further increasing removal efficiencies. While soil- or sand-based systems should be designed in a way that the filter material can be exchanged, newer developments such as Floating Treatment Wetlands show promising removal capacities as the installations bind metals in sludge sediments, which can be removed from time to time. The different treatment mechanisms, aforementioned developments and techniques as well as their removal capacities will be discussed in this chapter...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of variable stormwater and wastewater flows, mostly precipitation driven, brings {{with them the}} challenge of both peak flows and pollutant loads. Wastewater treatment systems {{can be divided into}} those that are specifically designed and operated to deal with variable flows, and those that presume more steady-state operation, only coping with peak flows as anomalies for short periods of time. To date, the different types and scales of variability and the impact of this variability on functioning and treatment performance have neither been well characterised nor properly dealt with for the design of suitable treatment systems. In this book, <b>ecotechnologies</b> are defined as processes for the treatment of variable wastewater flows that harness ecological processes involving microbes, plants, animals, natural soils and media or recycled materials; have a low reliance on mechanical machinery or external energy sources; and {{have a positive impact on}} the quality and biodiversity of the surrounding environment.

40|$|A {{variety of}} <b>ecotechnologies</b> have shown {{promising}} yet variable results in reducing faecal microbial contaminants under challenging operational conditions. But relatively limited {{work has been}} conducted to investigate and understand faecal microbe removal in these systems under highly fluctuating hydraulic and contaminant loading. In most instances, ecotechnology-based systems such as sedimentation ponds, constructed wetlands and bioretention filters have proved effective for treating episodic discharges and demonstrated performance resilience removing faecal microbial contaminants with modest to good efficiency particularly where inflow concentrations are high. However, microbial removal may depend greatly {{on the type of}} microorganism, treatment system design and operational factors. Design characteristics such as type of filter material and depth, presence of a submerged zone, type of vegetation and operational conditions such as inflow concentration, and antecedent dry periods in combination with temperature changes can all affect the removal of faecal microbes. Factors influencing survival, fate and behaviour of retained faecal microbes are still poorly understood. These knowledge gaps need addressing in order to fully evaluate microbial removal from fluctuating contaminated flows and more accurately interpret faecal indicator bacteria-based water quality and potential health risks associated with discharge from these ecotechnology-based systems...|$|R

40|$|Constructed wetland <b>ecotechnologies</b> (CWEs) are a {{promising}} solution to effectively treat domestic wastewater {{in developing countries}} at low cost. This paper reports {{the findings of the}} effectiveness of sand media amended with woody biochar and two plants species (Melaleuca quinquenervia and Cymbopogon citratus) in removing biological oxygen demand (BOD 5), suspended solids and coliforms. The experimental design consisted of 21 vertical flow (VF) mesocosms. There were seven media treatments using sand amended with varying proportions of biochar. During the first 8 months, the mesocosms were loaded with secondary clarified wastewater (SCW) then septage. The influent had a 4 -day hydraulic retention time. Samples were monitored for BOD 5, total suspended solids (TSS), total volatile solids (TVS), total coliforms and faecal coliforms. In the first 8 months, there were no significant performance differences between media treatments in the outflow concentrations of BOD 5, TSS and TVS. The significant differences occurred during the last 3 months; using septage with biochar additions performed better than pure sand. For coliforms, the significant differences occurred after 6 months. In conclusion, the addition of biochar was not effective for SCW. The VF mesocosms system proved to be more effective in removing BOD 5, TSS, TVS and coliforms when septage was loaded into the media.

40|$|The green {{revolution}} of the 1960 s and 1970 s which resulted in dramatic yield increases in the developing Asian countries is now showing signs of fatigue in productivity gains. Intensive agriculture practiced without adherence to the scientific principles and ecological aspects has led to loss of soil health, and depletion of freshwater resources and agrobiodiversity. With progressive diversion of arable land for non-agricultural purposes, the challenge of feeding the growing population without, at the same time, annexing more forestland and depleting the rest of life is indeed daunting. Further, even with food availability through production/procurement, millions of marginal farming, fishing and landless rural families have very low or no access to food {{due to lack of}} income-generating livelihoods. Approximately 200 million rural women, children and men in India alone fall in this category. Under these circumstances, the ever{{green revolution}} (pro-nature, pro-poor, pro-women and pro-employment/livelihood oriented ecoagriculture) under varied terms are proposed for achieving productivity in perpetuity. In the proposed ‘biovillage paradigm’, eco-friendly agriculture is promoted along with on- and non-farm eco-enterprises based on sustainable management of natural resources. Concurrently, the modern ICT-based village knowledge centres provide time- and locale-specific, demand-driven information needed for evergreen revolution and <b>ecotechnologies.</b> With a system of ‘farm and marine production by masses’, the twin goals of ecoagriculture and eco-livelihoods are addressed.

40|$|Novel {{systems that}} are {{combinations}} of ecosystems and machines (technoecosystems) {{are the product of}} a new form of design called ecological engineering. One class of these <b>ecotechnologies</b> has as a goal some form of autonomous behavior independent of direct human control. This research presents the design and operational dynamics of a technoecosystem that consists of a wetland soil microcosm in which redox po-tential is the feedback control variable. This feedback loop allows novel system behavior in that it affords the ecosystem control over its own energy sources. The feedback control system was constructed using a standard Pentium computer running Labview. Redox potential in the sealed wetland soil microcosms was monitored over time by the computer using platinum-tipped electrodes. A redox value higher than a user-defined upper threshold triggered addition of a carbon solution, whereas a redox value lower than a lower threshold triggered addition of a nitrate solution. Experimental trials exhibited an oscillatory trend in re-dox potential over time, compared to steady decline in redox potential in the control trials. The feedback transformed the soil-based ecosystem from a reduced state into an alternative state of oxidation. The dif-ference in behaviors between the control and experimental microcosms {{can be seen as the}} result of the artificial feedback in the technological interface. Practical applications for the automatic optimization of the denitrification rate in wastewater treatment wetlands can be envisioned. Also, a taxonomy for the emerging variety of possible technoecosystems, based upon the types of interactions between living and nonliving system components, is proposed...|$|R
