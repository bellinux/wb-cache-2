5|$|Although {{only the}} United States Supreme Court can {{overturn}} the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court, they cannot overturn decisions exclusively {{based on the}} Oregon law, though other mechanisms exist that effectively overturn <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court. The U.S. Supreme Court can only accept cases from the Oregon Supreme Court if the decision involves issues of federal law and interpretation of federal law might change {{the outcome of the}} case. The Oregon Supreme Court is the final authority on Oregon law, and absent extraordinary circumstances the U.S. Supreme Court cannot overrule its interpretation of Oregon law (see adequate and independent state ground). Although only the U.S. Supreme Court can reverse or overturn <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court, <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court can be effectively overturned by changing the law. Thus later outcomes of the court can be affected by legislation passed by the Oregon Legislative Assembly or through the initiative and referendum process. Also, in most criminal decisions Oregon’s Governor or the President of the United States may issue a pardon (some crimes require the Oregon Legislature to concur).|$|E
5|$|Each country's marks are agreed {{between that}} country's leader and deputy leader and coordinators {{provided}} by the host country (the leader of the team whose country submitted {{the problem in the}} case of the marks of the host country), subject to the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolved.|$|E
5|$|Oregon’s {{state courts}} are courts of general jurisdiction, unlike federal courts. That is, the state courts can hear all cases {{regardless}} of whether the dispute is based on state law, federal law, or a combination of both, with a few exceptions. Thus the Oregon Supreme Court can hear appeals for cases based on both federal and state law. Although the U.S. Supreme Court is the only court that can overturn <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon court, Oregon Supreme Court decisions as to federal law are only binding on other Oregon state level courts. Federal courts are not required to follow the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court for decisions based on federal law, regardless as to if the federal court is located within the state. However, federal courts are bound to follow Oregon law and <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Oregon Supreme Court for cases that involve disputes based on Oregon law, even when those federal courts are not based in Oregon, per the Erie Doctrine developed by the U.S. Supreme Court. For this reason federal courts, and courts from other states, can certify questions about Oregon law to the Oregon Supreme Court in order to clarify what the law in Oregon is in regards to the specific fact pattern that the federal court has before it in their case (see ORS 28.200 to 28.255 and ORAP 12.20).|$|E

50|$|The ruling made by {{the appellate}} court is usually final. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> appellate court {{generally}} affirms <b>the</b> original <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial court. However, 10-20% of civil and criminal appeals are successful in reversing <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original trial.

5|$|While the High Court has {{inherent}} {{power to}} judicially review {{the decisions of}} inferior courts and other administrative bodies, one High Court judge may not judicially review a decision of another High Court judge, nor may the High Court judicially review <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Court of Appeal.|$|E
5|$|World War II {{broke out}} shortly after Minton joined the court, {{creating}} {{a flood of}} cases in which legal precedent provided little guidance, including challenges to wartime measures, selective service laws, price controls, rationing and civil liberties. In {{the majority of these}} cases, the court affirmed the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> district courts, but in several the court was required to establish a precedent. Minton stated on several occasions his personal preference to affirm the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower courts. He believed that the court that heard the case and pronounced judgment was generally able to make a decision that was superior to appellate courts' decisions. He believed the appellate process should be reserved for the more serious cases and cases where the lower court had clearly made a mistake.|$|E

5|$|According to {{customary}} law, noblemen {{could not}} be sued outside the province until the 15thcentury. King Louis I even prohibited all prelates and noblemen who owned lands in Transylvania from bringing legal proceedings of lesser importance concerning these estates to the royal court. Nevertheless, legal actions between Transylvanians and the inhabitants of {{other parts of the}} kingdom remained outside the jurisdiction of the voivodes. Litigants could appeal to the royal court against the decision of the voivode from the 14thcentury, but the voivode often remained involved in the proceedings. Legislation prescribed that appeals against <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voivodes were to be addressed to the judge royal only from 1444.|$|E
5|$|Castro was {{initially}} {{disappointed with the}} project as {{he did not want}} to solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E
5|$|Cuthbert {{presided over}} the Council of Clovesho in 747 along with Æthelbald of Mercia. This {{gathering}} mandated that all clergy should explain the basic tenets of Christianity to the laity, as well as legislating on clerical dress, control of monasteries, and {{the behavior of the}} clergy. It also mandated that each diocese hold a synod to proclaim the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> council. Cuthbert sent his deacon Cynebert to Pope Gregory III after the council with a report on the council and its resolutions. This action may have been taken in response to Boniface's complaints about Cuthbert and Æthelbald to the papacy. The actions of the council were also gathered into a collection at Cuthbert's command.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to the increasing international pressure, Goukouni stated that Libyan forces were in Chad by government request, and that international mediators should accept the decision of Chad's legitimate government. In a meeting held in May, Goukouni became more accommodating, declaring that while Libyan withdrawal was not a priority, he would accept the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OAU. Goukouni could not at the time renounce Libyan military support, necessary for dealing with Habré's FAN, which was supported by Egypt and Sudan and funded through Egypt by the US Central Intelligence Agency.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Rowan, who espoused the Relief position, {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1822 {{representing}} Jefferson and Oldham counties. He immediately became the leader of the Relief faction in the House. When Relief partisans decided to appeal Williams and Lapsley to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which was at the time the court of last resort in the state, Rowan was chosen to argue the appeal before the court alongside George M. Bibb and Lieutenant Governor William T. Barry. Their efforts failed, however, as the Court found the measure unconstitutional, upholding the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower courts.|$|E

5|$|On April 10, 1826, Rowan {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to legislation to reorganize the federal judiciary that would have required seven justices to concur with a decision in order to strike down a law as unconstitutional. The amendment, which ultimately failed, was offered {{in the aftermath of}} a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States declaring an occupying claimant law to be unconstitutional; Rowan personally disagreed with the Court's decision. Rowan offered another amendment providing that ministers of the federal courts would be subject to state laws when carrying out the <b>decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> federal courts.

5|$|Primarily {{an appeals}} court, the Oregon Supreme Court {{is also the}} court of last resort in Oregon. Although most oral {{arguments}} before the court are held in the Oregon Supreme Court Building, the court does travel around the state holding sessions in various schools.

It receives appeals from the Oregon Tax Court, the Oregon Court of Appeals, and some select cases such as death penalty appeals. <b>Decisions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court are published in the Oregon Reporter published by the Oregon Judicial Department. The Territorial Supreme Court was created in 1848 when the Oregon Territory was formed {{out of the old}} Oregon Country region, followed by the creation of the State Supreme Court in 1859 when Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14.|$|E
