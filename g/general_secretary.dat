5|$|Following Joseph Stalin's {{consolidation}} {{of power in}} the 1920s the post of the <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> of the Central Committee of the Communist Party became synonymous with 'Leader of the Soviet Union' because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet Government. The post of the <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> was abolished in 1952 under Stalin and later re-established by Nikita Khrushchev under the name of First Secretary; in 1966 Leonid Brezhnev reverted the office title to its former name. Being the head of the communist party, the office of the <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> was the highest in the Soviet Union until 1990. The post of <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> lacked clear guidelines of succession, so after the death or removal of a Soviet leader, the successor usually needed the support of the Politburo, the Central Committee, or another government or party apparatus to both take and stay in power. The President of the Soviet Union, an office created in March 1990, replaced the <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> as the highest Soviet political office.|$|E

5|$|After {{years of}} declining health, Brezhnev died on 10 November 1982 and was quickly succeeded in his post as <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> by Yuri Andropov. Andropov only held {{the office of}} <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> for {{less than two years}} until his 1984 death. Brezhnev had fostered a cult of personality, {{although}} not nearly to the same degree as Stalin. Mikhail Gorbachev, who would lead the USSR from 1985 to 1991, denounced his legacy and drove the process of liberalisation of the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, {{opposition}} {{within the}} Politburo and the Central Committee led to Khrushchev's removal as First Secretary. Leonid Brezhnev succeeded Khrushchev {{to the post}} as part of another collective leadership, together with Premier Alexei Kosygin and others. The office was renamed <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> in 1966. The collective leadership was able to limit {{the powers of the}} <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> during the Brezhnev Era. Brezhnev's influence grew throughout the 1970s as he was able to retain support by avoiding any radical reforms. Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko ruled the country {{in the same way as}} Brezhnev had. Mikhail Gorbachev ruled the Soviet Union as <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> until 1990, when the Communist Party lost its monopoly of power over the political system. The office of President of the Soviet Union was established so that Gorbachev still retained his role as leader of the Soviet Union. Following the failed August coup of 1991, Gorbachev resigned as <b>General</b> <b>Secretary.</b> He was succeeded by his deputy, Vladimir Ivashko, who only served for five days as Acting <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> before Boris Yeltsin, the President of Russia, suspended all activity in the Communist Party. Following the party's ban, the Union of Communist Parties – Communist Party of the Soviet Union (UCP–CPSU) was established by Oleg Shenin in 1993. The UCP–CPSU works as a framework for reviving and restoring the CPSU. The organisation has members in all the former Soviet republics.|$|E

5|$|In a {{proposal}} to the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee, Võ Văn Kiệt suggested democratizing the political system by giving the delegates to a party congress the power to elect the <b>general</b> <b>secretary,</b> the Central Committee and the Central Commission for Inspection, and giving congress delegates ultimate power on all matters put before them at the congress. He called for {{the reduction of the}} Central Committee from one-fourth to one-third, holding the elections of state leaders at the National Assembly {{in the immediate aftermath of}} a congress (and not a year later), secret ballots for elections, empowering delegates to self-nominate to the Central Committee and merging the offices of President and <b>General</b> <b>Secretary</b> into one. These suggestions, with the exception of holding the National Assembly elections earlier, were rejected at the 11th plenum of the 9th Central Committee in January 2005.|$|E
