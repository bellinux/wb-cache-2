40|$|<b>Ground</b> <b>roll</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{troublesome}} noises of land data and its elimination is often a challenge. Three-component (3 C) seismic recording offers techniques to suppress it by exploiting its elliptical polarization nature. We present a flexible method that detects and subsequently removes the <b>ground</b> <b>roll</b> using polarization analysis. The polarization analysis is carried out by doing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix formed by a sliding time window (data-adaptive) of every single-station 3 C recording. We derive a new attribute from the singular values of the SVD to quantify the ellipticity and energy of the recorded events and use it to detect the <b>ground</b> <b>roll.</b> The detected <b>ground</b> <b>roll</b> is attenuated from single-station or multi-station data by truncated eigenimages. The single-station filtering has the advantage of no dependency on the spatial sampling of the data. The economical impact of this feature is that the survey design may be less constrained by the sampling requirement of <b>ground</b> <b>roll</b> removal and thus makes the acquisition more cost-effective. We show that the method can reliably recognize and efficiently attenuate the <b>ground</b> <b>roll</b> with a land data example...|$|R

40|$|A {{sensitive}} and inexpensive penetrometer is described, {{consisting of a}} mounted rod and polished steel ball that may be advanced downward at variable speed through meat slices mounted on a plexiglass cylinder. The slice + mounting cylinder was placed on a top-loading balance, tared to zero, and centered under the penetrometer rod. Bind strength was measured as the peak force (g) required for the steel ball advancing at 2. 0 cm/min to penetrate the meat slice. Data points (grams force versus time) were collected and plotted using an IBM-compatible personal computer and printer. Since the balance collected gram values continuously, a QuickBasic program was developed, allowing the user to specify the time interval (1, 2, 5 s, etc.) between recorded values.

40|$|The quality {{assessment}} of manufacturing processes has been traditionally based on sample measures {{performed on the}} process output. This leads to the common “product-based Statistical Process Control (SPC) ” framework. However, there are applications of actual industrial interest where post-process quality measurement procedures involve time-consuming inspections strongly related to the operator’s experience and/or based on expensive equipment. Cylindrical grinding of large rolls {{may be one of}} them. The assessment of the final acceptability of a ground cylinder, in terms of surface finish, is a challenging task with traditional measuring tools, and it often depends on operator’s visual inspections and on his subjective evaluations. In this frame, a paradigm shift is required to substitute troublesome post-process monitoring procedures with in-process and signal-based ones. The paper reviews the quality control issues in surface quality monitoring of big <b>ground</b> <b>rolls</b> where process vibrations (i. e. chatter) are one of major concerns.

40|$|High {{speed steel}} rolls have prevailed in hot rolling mills {{due to their}} {{excellent}} wear resistance, high hardness and oxidation resistance. The thermal cycling ol the rolls causes the surface oxidation, which significantly changes the contact and tribological behaviour between work roll and hot rolled material. In the paper, the formation and growth ol oxide scale ol a high speed steel roll material were in- situ investigated by a High Temperature Microscope. In- situ observations indicate that the oxide scales of the high speed steel first nucleate at the carbides/matrix interfaces, and then rapidly spread to cover the carbides and followed by continuous growth over the whole surface. The selective oxidation of high speed steel has {{a significant impact on}} the roll surface morphology. Water vapour in oxidizing atmosphere increases the oxidation rates of carbides and the matrix. The two-high mini mill coupled with the Gleeble 3500 thermo- mechanical simulator was used to measure the tribological contact behaviour between high speed steel work roll and mild steel strip sample under the stalled hot rolling conditions. The experimental results show that fresh ground and pre- oxidized roll surfaces exhibit quite different ways of tribological behaviours. The rolling force of pre-oxidized rolls is always higher than that of fresh <b>ground</b> <b>rolls</b> whatever in different reductions, or temperatures.

40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of milk solids on restructured and emulsified turkey rolls. the milk solids used were nonfat dry milk (NFDM), whey protein concentrate (WPC), and calcium caseinate (CC). Turkey rolls consisted of 100 % breast meat or 90 : 10 or 70 : 30 breast-to-thigh, salt (1 %), water (10 %), internal or cluster fat (10 %), and 3 % of various milk solids (WPC, NFDM, CC). The objectives of these studies were to 1) determine which ratio between light and dark meat is preferred; 2) determine which of milk solids evaluated will permit {{the highest level of}} dark meat incorporation into evaluated products; 3) determine if there is a mechanism by which milk proteins lighten poultry meat; and 4) determine which milk protein produces the best bind between meat pieces. Panelists were used in the first study to evaluate cooked meat attributes of color intensity, color uniformity, cohesiveness, tenderness, roasted turkey flavor, juiciness, and overall acceptability. The attributes were rated on a seven-point scale. Rolls made with WPC or NFDM scored significantly higher for color uniformity, cohesiveness, roasted turkey flavor, and overall acceptability than rolls made with CC. No differences were noted among treatments for juiciness or toughness with rolls of the same light-to-dark meat ratio. However, the 90 : 10 rolls were rated significantly more tender than the rolls made with the 70 : 30 ratio. Rolls containing milk solids had significantly higher yields than the controls. In the second study, rolls were made using the preferred meat ratio (90 : 10 breast:thigh meat). NFDM and WPC were used as binders, but not CC, since in the first study it was an ineffective binding agent. The second study showed that no whitening or lightening occurred in turkey rolls. This researcher also found that both NFDM and WPC increased bind strength between meat pieces. Controls made without added milk solids had less bind strength between the meat particles. Meat particle size also affected bind strength in finished products, with finely chopped rolls having higher bind strength than coarsely <b>ground</b> <b>rolls.</b> Moreover, the second study had unexpected results indicating that NFDM will prevent development of pink discoloration during refrigerated storage.

It has many applications in several fields, including denoising, wave propagation in disordered media and pattern recognition.

This task is primarily undertaken through seismic exploration, where explosive sources generate seismic waves whose reflections at the different geological layers are recorded at the ground or sea level by acoustic sensors (geophones or hydrophones).
