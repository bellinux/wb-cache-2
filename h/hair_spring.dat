50|$|Preceding the {{development}} of torsion siege engines were tension siege engines that had existed {{since at least the}} beginning of the 4th century BC, most notably the gastraphetes in Heron of Alexandria’s Belopoeica that was probably invented in Syracuse by Dionysius the Elder. Though simple torsion devices could have been developed earlier, the first extant evidence of a torsion siege engine comes from the Chalcotheca, the arsenal on the Acropolis in Athens, and dates to c. 338 - 326 BC. It lists the building's inventory that included torsion catapults and its components such as <b>hair</b> <b>springs,</b> catapult bases, and bolts. The transition from tension machines to torsion machines is a mystery, though E.W. Marsden speculates that a reasonable transition would involve the recognition of the properties of sinew in previously existing tension devices and other bows. Furthermore, traditional historiography puts the speculative date of the invention of two-armed torsion machines during the reign of Philip II of Macedon circa 340 BC, which is not unreasonable given the earliest surviving evidence of siege engines stated above.|$|R

The Pitkin Watch Company {{was the first to}} mass-produce pocket watches in America. Pitkin's pocket watches had an excellent reputation for being accurate and durable. The plates for the Pitkins pocket watches were punched out with stamping dies but many times had to be finished to close tolerances by hand. The movements were three-quarter plate, slow train, and about the diameter of the modern 16-size pocket watch. The watch cases they made themselves from gold and silver. They imported from Europe many of the dials, hands, <b>hair</b> <b>springs</b> and balance jewels needed for their watches, even though they tried to avoid using foreign made parts. Pitkin named the first fifty movements after himself, however after that the name H & J. F. Pitkin was used.

40|$|Root-soil {{contact is}} an {{important}} factor for uptake of a less mobile soil nutrient such as phosphorus (P) by crop plants. Root hairs can substantially increase root-soil contact. Identification of crop cultivars with more and longer root hairs can, therefore, be useful for increasing P uptake in low input agriculture. We studied the root hairs of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cvs. Kosack, Foreman, Kraka) and barley cultivars (Hordeum vulgare L. cvs. Angora, Hamu, Alexis, Canut) in relation to P depletion from the rhizosphere in three soils of different P levels (0. 45, 1. 1 and 1. 6 mmoles P kg 1 soil; extracted with 0. 5 M NaHCO 3). Root hairs were measured in solution culture having nutrients and concentration similar to soil solution. Root hairs of Kraka were much longer (1. 27 0. 26 mm) and denser (38 3) hairs mm 1 root) than those of Kosack which had shorter (0. 49 0. 2 mm) and fewer (24 3) hairs mm 1 root) root hairs. Root hairs increased root surface area (RSA) of Kraka by 341 %. The increase with Foreman was 142 % and with Kosack it was 95 %. For winter barley, the length (1. 1 0. 3 mm) and density (30 1 hairs mm 1 root) of root hairs of Hamu differed from root hair length (0. 52 0. 18 mm) and density (27 1 hairs mm 1 root) of Angora. Root <b>hairs</b> of <b>spring</b> barley cultivars differed in length (Canut 1. 0 0. 24 mm; Alexis 0. 64 0. 19 mm) but not in density (Canut 31 1, Alexis 30 2 hairs mm 1 root).

40|$|Background and Aims A {{number of}} root and root hair traits have been {{proposed}} as important for acquisition of P. However, it remains unknown whether these traits are most important in determining macro- and micronutrient uptake at low soil fertility. This study investigated the variations in root and root <b>hair</b> traits among <b>spring</b> wheat genotypes and examined which root and root hair traits are most important for high uptake of macro- and micronutrients. Methods Six spring wheat genotypes were grown in a soil with low nutrient availability. The root and root hair traits {{as well as the}} content of macro- and micronutrients were identified. Results A significant genetic variability in root and root hair traits was found. High root growth vigour and long and dense root hairs enhanced uptake of macro- and micronutrients under low soil nutrient availability. Root growth vigour, however, was a better predictor of early nutrient acquisition than root hair length and density. Conclusions Selection and breeding for high root growth vigour and long and dense root hairs is a promising strategy to ensure efficient acquisition of both macro- and micronutrients in the early establishment of spring wheat in nutrient-limited soil and low nutrient input cropping systems. ...|$|R

40|$|The high {{sensitivity}} and sharp frequency selectivity of acoustical signal transduction in the cochlea suggest that an active process pumps {{energy into the}} basilar membrane's oscillations. This function is generally attributed to outer hair cells, but its exact mechanism remains uncertain. Several classical models of amplification represent the load upon the basilar membrane as a single mass. Such models encounter a fundamental difficulty, however: the phase difference between basilar-membrane movement and the force generated by outer hair cells inhibits, rather than amplifies, the modeled basilar-membrane oscillations. For this reason, modelers must introduce artificially either negative impedance or an appropriate phase shift, neither of which is justified by physical analysis of the system. We consider here a physical model based upon the recent demonstration that the basilar membrane and reticular lamina can move independently, albeit with elastic coupling through outer hair cells. The mechanical model comprises two resonant masses, representing the basilar membrane and the reticular lamina, coupled through an intermediate <b>spring,</b> the outer <b>hair</b> cells. The <b>spring's</b> set point changes in response to displacement of the reticular lamina, which causes deflection of the hair bundles, variation of outer hair cell length and, hence, force production. Depending upon {{the frequency of the}} acoustical input, the basilar membrane and reticular lamina can oscillate either in phase or in counterphase. In the latter instance, the force produced by hair cells leads basilar-membrane oscillation, energy is pumped into basilar-membrane movement, and an external input can be strongly amplified. The model is also capable of producing spontaneous oscillation. In agreement with experimental observations, the model describes mechanical relaxation of the basilar membrane after electrical stimulation causes outer hair cells to change their length...|$|R
