5|$|Conscientious objectors (COs) {{refuse to}} {{participate}} in military service because of belief or religious training. <b>During</b> <b>wartime,</b> this stance conflicts with conscription efforts. Those willing to accept non-combatant roles, such as medical personnel, are accommodated. There are few legal options for draftees who cannot cooperate with the military in any way.|$|E
5|$|<b>During</b> <b>wartime,</b> Swift {{became a}} special constable with {{responsibility}} for traffic control. He was enrolled in the RAF, and travelled to France after the Invasion of Normandy, but was stationed well behind the front line and did not see combat. This did not prevent risk to his life, however, as in 1944 a Dakota on which he was a passenger {{was involved in a}} near miss.|$|E
5|$|Monroe {{remained}} {{the commanding officer}} of the 114th Regiment until its disbandment by the Congress of the Confederate States in April 1862.

50|$|Songs and {{especially}} dances were often linked to conscription of Czech {{young men to}} the Army; they are called “verbuňk” in some regions. Conscriptions usually happened <b>during</b> <b>wartimes</b> and these songs have a particular place in Czech folklore music.

5|$|The Croatian Armed Forces (CAF) {{consist of}} the Army, Navy and Air Force {{branches}} {{in addition to}} the Education and Training Command and Support Command. The CAF is headed by the General Staff, which reports to the Defence Minister, who in turn reports to the President of Croatia. According to the constitution, the President is commander-in-chief of the armed forces and in case of immediate threat <b>during</b> <b>wartime</b> he issues orders directly to the General Staff.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} met from April 30 – May 1, 2, 22, 1945, {{and elected}} John J. Wicker, Jr., its presiding officer.

5|$|A major {{capital works}} program was also {{undertaken}} to prepare RAAF bases for the Hornets. Over $150 million was spent upgrading the runways, hangars and maintenance facilities at RAAF Base Williamtown, {{which has been}} the main F/A-18 base throughout the aircraft's service. The pre-existing airfield at RAAF Base Tindal in the Northern Territory was also developed into a major air base between 1985 and 1988 at a cost of $215 million so that it could accommodate No.75 Squadron. Until this time the squadron had been stationed at RAAF Base Darwin which, due to its location on Australia's north coast, was vulnerable to damage from cyclones and difficult to defend <b>during</b> <b>wartime.</b>|$|E

5|$|As mentioned, the British Railways batch had detail {{differences}} to previous versions. The most significant modification was {{the reduction of}} weight using lighter materials unavailable <b>during</b> <b>wartime.</b> From 1952 the air-smoothed casing ahead of the cylinders was removed to ease maintenance and lubrication. This coincided with {{the removal of the}} tender 'raves' on all locomotives, as they obstructed the packing of coal into the bunker and restricted the driver's view when reversing the locomotive. The resultant 'cut-down' tender included new, enclosed storage for fire-irons, revised step ladders and glass spectacle plates to protect the crew from flying coal dust when running tender-first.|$|E

Around the same time, lying in a bed in an army {{hospital}} ("Before the Lobotomy"), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen <b>during</b> <b>wartime</b> and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance ("Extraordinary Girl"). He quickly {{falls in love with}} her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony ("Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)").|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw. 7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF {{was intended to be}} a home defence force for service <b>during</b> <b>wartime</b> and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split in August and September 1914 into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line regiments.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Hammerstein's {{commitment}} to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to Show Boat. It {{can be seen}} in his later works, many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers. Carmen Jones is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans <b>during</b> <b>wartime,</b> and South Pacific explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, The King andI deals with different cultures' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural inclusiveness in societies.|$|E
5|$|Richard (Dick) Cresswell, DFC (27 July 1920– 12December 2006) was {{an officer}} and pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He held command of No.77 (Fighter) Squadron twice during World WarII, and again during the Korean War. Cresswell was {{credited}} with being the first RAAF pilot to shoot down an enemy aircraft at night over Australian soil, the only man to serve as commanding officer of an RAAF squadron on three occasions <b>during</b> <b>wartime,</b> and the first officer to lead a jet-equipped Australian squadron in combat. His performance in Korea earned him both the Commonwealth and the US Distinguished Flying Crosses.|$|E
5|$|Swift {{broke into}} the Manchester City first team in 1933, {{taking part in the}} club's run to the 1934 FA Cup Final, where the club triumphed 2–1 against Portsmouth. Three years later Swift won a League Championship medal, after playing in every match of Manchester City's championship-winning season. War denied Swift several years of playing in his prime, though <b>during</b> <b>wartime</b> he was chosen to {{represent}} his country in international matches. After the war he made his competitive international debut, playing 19 internationals between 1946 and 1949.|$|E
50|$|A {{presidency}} becomes imperial when {{it relies}} on powers beyond those allowed by the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution established three separate branches of government, not for efficiency but to avoid the arbitrary exercise of power. The government outlined by the Constitution was to replace and improve upon the imperial executive government of King George III of Britain. The book links the president’s accumulation of foreign powers <b>during</b> <b>wartimes</b> to the accretion of domestic powers.|$|R
40|$|Deception <b>during</b> <b>wartimes</b> is {{probably}} {{as old as}} the armed conflicts themselves. Logic to mislead your adversary is efficient and potential payoff by using it can be gained quickly. Deception is traditionally employed not only in the military but also in political, economic, and commercial context. The paper presents an extensive categorization of military deception measures, and analyzes them at a manner which may contribute to the awareness rising of its vast opportunities among military commanders...|$|R

5|$|The Nationality Act of 1940 {{provided}} for {{loss of citizenship}} based on foreign military or government service, when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country. This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for desertion from the U.S. armed forces, remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service <b>during</b> <b>wartime,</b> or voting in a foreign election. The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary, in a 1958 case (Nishikawa v. Dulles), and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case (Trop v. Dulles).|$|E
5|$|The {{great number}} of Russian horses {{captured}} as matériel <b>during</b> <b>wartime</b> became {{a threat to the}} Finnhorse's purebreeding: many Russian animals were stallions, {{and there was no way}} to ensure new owners would not crossbreed them with Finnhorses. For practical and political reasons, Soviet Russia would not accept these horses back as a part of Finland's massive war indemnity. Finnhorses however, were accepted as payment, and a total of 18000 animals were sold to Soviet Russia at low rates in 1947 and 1948. The best Finnhorses were not offered to the Soviets, however, and according to contemporary witnesses, many showy but otherwise useless horses ended up in Russia.|$|E

In peacetime, the castle held around 131 officers and men but it would have needed to be substantially reinforced <b>during</b> <b>wartime</b> if all the weapons were to be manned. Although the fort never received its full complement of guns, by 1881 it had ten 12.5 inch, 38 ton (317mm, 39,000kg) rifled muzzle-loading (RML) guns, fifteen 10 inch, 18 ton (254mm, 18,000kg) RML guns, five 9 inch, 12 ton (228mm, 12,000kg) RML guns, and 3 64-pounders (29kg), together forming a powerful arsenal.|$|E
