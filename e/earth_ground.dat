25|$|A third wire, {{called the}} bond (or earth) wire, is often {{connected}} between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and <b>earth</b> <b>ground.</b> This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures {{there is always}} a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current {{for as long as it}} takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.|$|E

25|$|Electrical sockets {{for single}} phase domestic, {{commercial}} and light industrial purposes generally provide either {{two or three}} electrical connections to the supply conductors. Two-pin sockets normally provide neutral and line connections, both of which carry current and are defined as live parts. Neutral is usually very near to earth potential, usually being earthed either at the distribution board or at the substation. Line (also known as phase or hot, and commonly, but technically incorrectly, as live) carries the full supply voltage relative to the neutral (and to earth). Three-pin sockets provide, in addition, a protective earth connection for exposed metal parts of an appliance. If internal insulation should fail, a short-circuit to the earthed exposed metal parts will hold them at a low potential, and should operate fuses or circuit breakers to isolate the faulty appliance from the supply. Depending on the supply system, some sockets may have two line connections, each at significant voltage to earth and without a neutral pin; for example, a split phase system may have 240V between line connections each at 120V with respect to earth ground; but a single-phase receptacle connected to a three-phase system may have, for example, 208V between contacts and only 120V between each contact and <b>earth</b> <b>ground.</b>|$|E

[...] A meter for this type normally measures two of the windings relative to the third winding, and adds the watts. [...] One disadvantage of this system is that if the safety earth fails, it is difficult to discover this by direct measurement, because no phase has a voltage relative to earth.|$|E
