40|$|High-speed {{turbines}} {{are used}} in tipper stage liquid engines of launch vehicles and the most common ones include LH 2 and LOX turbines used in the cryogenic stages. The main constraints in the design Of turbine system for a liquid engine are thermal loads, mass flow and pressure drops in various systems ahead of the turbine inlet. The temperature of the combustion products/gases reaching the turbine blades must be well below the ruching point of the turbine blade material and the mass flow rate must be sufficient to generate the required power. Turbine call be started in two ways, by generating gases using a solid propellant-based spinner motor, and using compressed gases stored in gas bottles. The first method involves design challenges but requires less space and weight. On the other hand, second method is simple but requires more space. Because of the space and weight constraints associated with the upper stages, first method is preferred and discussed in this paper. It consists of a solid propellant-based spinner motor with a convergent-divergent nozzle, a <b>guiding</b> <b>duct</b> connecting nozzle exit, and the turbine inlet manifold {{in the form of}} a torroid with nozzle block having, 39 guiding nozzles. The combustion products generated by the spinner motor are guided to the manifold through the <b>guiding</b> <b>duct.</b> Inlet manifold acts as a reservoir and Supplies hot gases uniformly to the turbine through 39 nozzles. This study addresses the role of computational fluid dynamics in the design of turbine startup system using unstructured cell-centered AUSM+-UP-based finite volume solver with the two-equation turbulence model. The flow and the thermal characteristics of the solid motor with a convergent-divergent nozzle were Studied to evaluate the gas temperature, operating pressure, and flow velocities. The <b>guiding</b> <b>duct</b> along with the inlet manifold was analysed separately to find the drop ill temperature and pressure within the system. From the simulation results, the mass flow through each guiding nozzle, and hence, energy available Could be evaluated to ensure proper functioning of the turbine...|$|R

40|$|The {{conditions}} under which high frequency (f>> fuh) long-range extraordinary-mode discrete field-aligned echoes observed by the Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) on board the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite in the plasmasphere are investigated by ray tracing modeling. Field-aligned discrete echoes are most commonly observed by RPI in the plasmasphere although they are also observed over the polar cap region. The plasmasphere field-aligned echoes appearing as multiple echo traces at different virtual ranges are attributed to signals reflected successively between conjugate hemispheres that propagate along or nearly along closed geomagnetic field lines. The ray tracing simulations show that fieldaligned ducts with as little as 1 % density perturbations (depletions) and less than 10 wavelengths wide can guide nearly field-aligned propagating high frequency X mode waves. Effective guidance of wave at a given frequency and wave normal angle (Ψ) depends on the cross-field density scale of the duct, such that ducts with stronger density depletions need to be wider {{in order to maintain}} the same gradient of refractive index across the magnetic field. While signal guidance by field aligned density gradient without ducting is possible only over the polar region, conjugate field-aligned echoes that have traversed through the equatorial region are most likely <b>guided</b> by <b>ducting.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} repair of bioabsorbable poly(lactide) (PLA) biliary stent in common bile duct (CBD) transection injury in canine prior to the clinical application. Circular tubing CBD stent was prepared by melt extraction technique using PLA.

The stent was obtained to determine degradation of PLA in vivo at postoperative week 1, 4, and 12, respectively. The changes of outer diameter and burst pressure of CBD were investigated. Furthermore, serum liver enzyme values and CBD histopathological analysis were examined in the animals.

50|$|Bearland Wood {{faced the}} {{universal}} mining problem of ventilation {{in a way}} which was both very old and radically new. Most industrial age mines were drained and ventilated using pumps, typically powered by steam engines. Morgans equipped Bearland Wood with a ventilation flue where a chimney stack was built above the mine's upward shaft and a coal-fired furnace was placed {{at the foot of the}} chimney. The furnace sucked air from the mine shaft which sucked fresh air from the lateral adit in turn. The air flow was <b>guided</b> by wooden <b>ducts</b> so that it always passed through areas where men worked. Miners extended or redirected the ducts as the working faces moved. This method long predated steam pumps, but as Morgans was erecting it at Bearland Wood the Mines Inspector at Risca Colliery (near where Morgans had been a colliery manager) declared steam pumps to be unsatisfactory and ordered their older ventilation furnaces to be reinstated. The ventilation flue at Bearland Wood is a scheduled Ancient Monument. Its conservation was supported by the Heritage Lottery Fund.|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere {{in the presence}} of irregularities is differently affected in different frequency ranges. Very high frequency waves are scattered whereas very low frequency waves are <b>guided</b> through the <b>ducts</b> formed by the irregularities under suitable conditions. We have analyzed VLF and VHF waves recorded at Varanasi (geomag. Lat. = 140 55 / N, long. = 1540 E, L = 1. 07) during the period January 1991 to December 1999. The occurrence rate of VLF waves is low and sporadic and they are generally observed during nighttimes. The VHF scintillations at Varanasi are also mostly observed during nighttimes. A correlation study of these two simultaneously recorded signals has been carried out. The recorded events of VLF whistlers/emissions and VHF scintillations are largely uncorrelated. However, {{there are a number of}} days when these two events are simultaneously observed. Analysis of these correlated events show that at time and under certain suitable conditions, the ionospheric irregularities may help VLF wave propagation and also cause scattering of VHF signals resulting into either weak or strong scintillations...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to spread F, evidence for field-aligned electron density irregularities is commonly observed on Alouette 2 topside sounder ionograms recorded near perigee (500 km). This evidence {{is provided by}} distinctive signal returns from sounder-generated Z mode waves. At low latitudes these waves become <b>guided</b> in wave <b>ducts</b> caused by field-aligned electron density irregularities and give rise to strong long-duration echoes. At high latitudes, extending well into the polar cap, these Z mode waves (and stimulated electrostatic waves at the plasma frequency) produce a series of vertical bars on the ionogram display as the satellite traverses discrete field-aligned density structures. The radio frequency (RF) noise environment to be expected in the 400 to 500 km altitude region from low to high latitudes was examined by analyzing perigee Alouette 2 topside sounder data. All observed noise bands were scaled on nearly 200 topside sounder ionograms recorded near perigee at low, mid, and high latitude telemetry stations.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the application value of transpancreatic septotomy with pancreatic <b>duct</b> stent or <b>guide</b> wire in difficult {{endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography}} (ERCP). MethodsA total of 309 patients who underwent difficult ERCP in Medical Center for Digestive Diseases, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from June 2012 to May 2014 were selected; 228 patients among them received placement of pancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>guide</b> wire/plastic stent or conventional precut papillotomy, and achieved successful bile duct cannulation; the other 81 patients received transpancreatic septotomy with placement of guide wire (guide wire group, 37 patients) or pancreatic duct stent (stent group, 44 patients). The success rate and incidence of complications were compared between these two methods for cannulation. ResultsOf the 81 patients who underwent transpancreatic septotomy, 77 achieved successful bile duct cannulation, and the success rate {{did not differ significantly}} between the guide wire group and stent group (91. 89 % (34 / 37) vs 97. 73 % (43 / 44); P＞ 0. 05). Seventeen patients experienced complications, with 8 cases of acute pancreatitis, 3 cases of hemorrhage, and 1 case of biliary tract infection in the guide wire group, and 3 cases of acute pancreatitis, 1 case of hemorrhage, 1 case of biliary tract infection in the stent group; compared with the guide wire group, the stent group had a significantly lower incidence of complications (11. 36 % vs 32. 43 %; χ 2 = 3. 75, P＜ 0. 05) and a significantly lower incidence of acute pancreatitis (6. 82 % vs 21. 62 %;χ 2 = 2. 25, P＜ 0. 05). ConclusionTranspancreatic septotomy can further improve the success rate of bile duct cannulation with ERCP. The stent group has a higher success rate and a lower incidence of pancreatitis after ERCP than the guide wire group, and thus the application of stent is safer in clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} leaned bypass stator vanes {{impact on the}} fan model acoustic and aerodynamic performance was carried out {{for the purpose of}} noise reduction technology development for advanced turbofan engine. It was studying three versions of bypass <b>duct</b> <b>guide</b> vanes of fan model with pressure ratio 1. 54, tip speed 390 m/s and inlet diameter 700 mm. The fan model reference configuration has the blades swept back in the meridional direction (the sweep angle is equal to 18. 3 degrees). The blade aspect ratio is equal to 2. 13; blades count is equal to 41. The blade has approximately the same profiles along the blade height with the maximal thickness 5. 3 %. The second configuration of bypass stator was obtained by blade tip and hub profile displacement in circumferential direction clockwise and counter clockwise accordingly in such a manner that the tilt angle between the blade centreline and the radial direction kept constant and equal to + 30 degrees. At last, the third configuration of bypass stator was obtained by blade tip and hub profile displacement in circumferential direction counter clockwise and clockwise accordingly in such a manner that the tilt angle between the blade centreline and the radial direction kept constant and equal to 30 degrees. Spectra and directivity diagrams of three versions of fan model measured in the anechoic chamber of C- 3 A test facility were analyzed. It was obtained, that the stator version leaned in the direction of rotation showed noise reduction relative to the reference stator version; on the contrary the stator version leaned counter to the direction of rotation showed increased noise levels. More noticeable these trends appear at approach mode in rear hemisphere...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} a new surgical technique for the complete excision of the lacrimal drainage apparatus (LDA) that combines external and endoscopic approaches. Methods: This study involved a noncomparative, retrospective chart review of the clinical and pathological findings of four patients presenting with LDA papillomas who underwent a combined open and endonasal excision of the lacrimal system. Results. Of the four patients, three were male. The mean age at referral was 41 years, and all cases were unilateral. Histopathology revealed two transitional cell papillomas, one squamous cell papilloma, and one combined transitional/squamous papilloma. Epiphora and an external lesion were the main complaints at presentation. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction was present in all four patients. Papilloma virus infection was suggested in two cases and was confirmed in the only patient who had recurrence. CT identified a solid enhancing mass in two cases. The surgical approach in all cases was performed with the patient under general anesthetic supplemented with infiltration of local anesthesia with vasoconstriction. The lacrimal sac was exposed as per an external dacryocystorhinostomy with biopsy collection from the lacrimal sac lumen to confirm the diagnosis prior LDA excision. The superior aspect of the LDA was isolated by using lacrimal probes in each canaliculus to stabilized parallel incisions and careful dissection toward the common canaliculus until they met the medial aspect of the lacrimal sac. The sac was then separated from the periosteum from the medial orbital wall, using sharp dissection. Finally, an endoscopic dissection of the lower end of the nasolacrimal duct released the most inferior aspect of the LDA, allowing the surgeon to pull and excise the complete system from the external wound. Conclusions: Extensive LDA papillomas required complete excision of the drainage system to prevent recurrence and/or malignant transformation. The use of a combined approach through an open excision of the superior part of the LDA in conjunction with the direct manipulation of the nasolacrimal <b>duct</b> <b>guided</b> by the nasal endoscope facilitates the complete excision of the system for extensive benign lesions...|$|R
40|$|An {{intermediate}} turbine <b>duct</b> <b>guides</b> {{the flow}} from the smaller diameter high pressure turbine to the downstream larger diameter intermediate or low pressure turbine. It is typically equipped with a structural vane transferring loads for the core to the external parts, and supplies the core with necessary services such as oil and air. Flow in an intermediate turbine duct is highly complex, influenced by the upstream turbine stage flow structures, which include tip leakage flows and non-uniformities originating from the upstream high pressure turbine vane and rotor. The complexity of the flow structures makes predicting them using numerical methods difficult, hence there exists a need for experimental validation. This thesis includes results from experiments conducted in two different facilities, the Chalmers Large-Scale Low-Speed Turbine Facility and the Oxford Turbine Research Facility. At Chalmers, the emphasis was at aerodynamic measurements including static pressure, total pressure, velocities and flow angles in the intermediate turbine duct. In Oxford, the experimental campaign included both aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements {{with the purpose of}} describing the aerothermal flow through the intermediate turbine duct. A new intermediate turbine duct with a medium turning vane was designed, manufactured, instrumented and installed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility. Three high pressure turbine stage inlet conditions were studied; a uniform inlet flow and two low-NOx swirl profiles. Three adjacent intermediate turbine duct vanes were instrumented in an identical manner, to study the vane-to-vane clocking effect. Instrumentation includes static pressure tappings and thin film heat flux gauges installed on the intermediate turbine duct vane and endwalls at discrete locations. A three-hole pressure probe equipped with thermocouples above and below was traversed at the intermediate turbine duct exit. Steady and unsteady CFD predictions were performed of the intermediate turbine duct on its own and the full 1. 5 high pressure turbine stage. The results from the test campaign in Oxford show the clocking effect to have a larger effect on the surface aerodynamics and heat transfer of the intermediate turbine duct vane than the introduction of a low-NOx swirl profile at the high pressure turbine stage inlet. The clocking effect is for example seen to change the incidence to the intermediate turbine duct vane. The change in inlet condition is seen to have local effects in the intermediate turbine duct. The CFD results are found to in general match the experimental data fairly well, both in aerodynamics and heat transfer. A comparison of steady and averaged time averaged unsteady CFD is noted to provide similar results...|$|R
60|$|May {{be killed}} by chloroform, or {{potassium}} cyanide, or drowned. It may also be readily suffocated with house-hold gas. It should be killed immediately before use, as otherwise the gastric juice attacks {{the wall of the}} stomach, and the dissection is, in consequence, rendered extremely disagreeable. A very young rabbit is unsatisfactory as regards the genitalia, but otherwise there is no objection to a little one, and it has this advantage-- that it may be immersed more conveniently under water, in a large pie dish, for purposes of fine dissection. The external features of the animal should be examined: eyelids, whiskers and teeth, toes, anus, perineal space {{on either side of the}} same, urogenital opening, and position of the ribs, vertebral column, and limb girdles beneath the skin should be made out. Then the animal should be pinned out through the legs, the ventral surface uppermost, the skin opened up along the middle line from pelvic girdle to symphyses of jaw; separated from the body wall below by means of the handle of a scalpel, and turned back; and then the abdominal wall should be cut into and two flaps pinned back to expose its contents. Note the xiphisternum. The caecum and colon will be recognised (Section 16); the stomach, the right and left central, and left lateral lobes of the liver will probably be apparent; and the urinary bladder (especially if distended) in the middle line behind. Without any further dissection, but simply by turning the parts over, all the structures of the abdomen in Figure 1, Sheet 1, will be identified. Seek especially for and note particularly, the gall bladder, bile duct, and portal vein, pancreatic duct, sacculus rotundus, vermiform appendix, ureters (by pulling urinary bladder forward), genital ducts (looping over ureters), spleen, kidneys, and adrenals. The vena cava inferior is seen dorsally. The genital <b>duct</b> <b>guides</b> the student to the genital gland; if the subject is a male, the testes may be exposed by dissection, or by pulling the vas deferens gently the scrotal sac will be turned inside out, and the testes brought into view. The ovary lies exposed without dissection posterior to the kidney. Examine all this carefully, and make small sketches of points of interest-- the duodenal loop and the pyloric end of the stomach, for instance; the meeting of colon, caecum, and sacculus rotundus again; or the urinary bladder and adjacent parts. Note the dorsal aorta and vena cava and their connexions behind. (Compare figure of circulation.) Cut through pelvic girdle, and remove one hind leg, to see bladder and genital ducts better (compare Sheet 10). Wash away any blood that may flow. Turn all the intestines over to the animal's right, and see the dorsal aorta and vena cava inferior of the abdomen, the inferior mesenteric artery, and the spermatic (or ovarian) artery (compare, of course, with figure in book). In front, immediately dorsal to the spleen, is a variable quantity of lymphoidal tissue, which must be very carefully cleared to see the superior mesenteric and coeliac arteries. Separate Spigelian lobe from stomach, and look for vagus nerve descending by oesophagus, solar plexus around the superior mesenteric artery, and thrown up very distinctly by the purple vena cava inferior beneath, and the splanchnic nerve. To see the abdominal sympathetic behind, gently remove the peritoneum that lies on either side of the aorta; blood-vessels will be seen running in between the vertebral bodies, and the sympathetic chain, with its ganglia, made out very distinctly, as it runs across them longitudinally. Now cut oesophagus just in front of stomach, and cut the rectum, cut through the mesentery supporting the intestine, and remove and unravel alimentary canal; cut open, wash out, and examine caecum and stomach. Bleeding to a considerable extent is inevitable, chiefly from the portal vein. The liver had better remain if the same rabbit is to serve for the second dissection.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2015 Z mode (ZM) {{sounding}} {{from the}} Radio Plasma Imager (RPI) onboard the Imager for Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) satellite {{has provided a}} new method to measure the geomagnetic field aligned electron density (Ne) distribution, magnetospheric ducts, and Z mode cavities in the low- to mid-latitude region of the magnetosphere from the ducted and nonducted fast ZM echoes observed from radio sounding at 20 - 1000 kHz. Z mode is a trapped wave mode of the plasma confined in frequency between the ZM cutoff frequency, fz, and the upper hybrid resonance frequency, fuh. In the past, trapped ducted Z mode echoes in the ZM cavity were used to measure field aligned electron density thousands of kilometers above the satellite altitude. However, no {{attempt was made to}} study the properties of the <b>ducts</b> that can <b>guide</b> ZM waves. Magnetospheric ducts {{play an important role in}} the propagation of plasma waves, wave particle interactions, particle acceleration, and precipitation. In the past, ducts have been known since the discovery of the plasmasphere, but there is limited knowledge of the properties of ducts, their origins and occurrence patterns, and their distribution on a global scale in the magnetosphere especially for ducts extending to high altitudes (above 1000 km). Analysis of ducted echoes from the conjugate and local hemispheres has enabled nearly instantaneous magnetic field aligned electron density profiles. Field aligned density distribution plays an important role in magnetospheric dynamics. Despite its importance, there is a lack of accurate representation of the latitudinal dependence of density distribution along the field lines by the existing empirical models, due to limited measurement of off-equatorial electron density profiles and availability of relatively fewer measurements of Ne at higher altitudes. There is also a need to describe the transition of field aligned electron densities from the topside ionosphere into the plasmasphere properly. RPI on IMAGE, designed to sweep from 3 kHz to 3 MHz, has observed both ducted and nonducted ZM echoes in the frequency range of 40 - 800 kHz in an altitude range of ~ 600 - 10, 000 km, invariant latitude of ~ 20 °- 90 °, at all magnetic local times (MLTs) and for an fpe/fce range of 0. 25 - 6, where fpe and fce are electron plasma frequency and electron gyro frequency respectively. About 72, 000 plasmagrams have been surveyed, out of which ~ 1500 cases of ducted- and ~ 3500 cases of nonducted fast ZM echoes have been identified. Two cases of ducted, two cases of nonducted, and a set of seven successive cases of nonducted and ducted fast ZM echoes have been analyzed to study the propagation, reflection, and guidance of fast ZM waves in the magnetosphere and measure: (1) field aligned electron density distribution; (2) duct parameters (half-width ΔL and density variation ΔN/N); and (3) Z mode cavity parameters. In absence of ducts, four nonducted echoes are obtained, each reflecting from locations where fz ~f, where f is the wave frequency. Three of the echoes retrace their path after reflection and one forms a loop. When a Ne depletion duct is present inside a Z mode cavity, fast Z mode waves can be <b>guided</b> within the <b>duct</b> and propagate back and forth between their reflection points above and below the satellite altitude. Ray tracing calculations of ducted Z mode echoes show that: (1) in the presence of ducts, both nonducted and ducted echoes are obtained, and echoes are formed from both looping as well as retracing paths; (2) average time delays (tg) depend upon the electron density distribution along geomagnetic field lines and the shape of the Z mode cavity; (3) time delay spread (Δtg) and upper cutoff frequency (fuc) depend upon duct half-width (ΔL) and density perturbation (ΔN/N); (4) echoes are obtained from local as well as conjugate hemispheres when the duct extends to the conjugate hemisphere; and (5) the discovery of a new phenomenon of gap in frequency for echoes reflecting from below the satellite altitude. The gap frequency range depends upon the duct parameters and is a consequence of the peculiar shape of the refractive index surface for f~fpe. From ZM soundings of 11 case studies, it is found that the measured ducts have half-widths of ~ 160 - 500 km at the equator and density depletions of ~ 1 %- 6 %, covering an altitude range of ~ 1000 - 10, 000 km. The first quantitative measurements of ZM cavities have been presented in this thesis. The bandwidth and the length of ZM cavities lie in the range of ~ 10 - 50 kHz and ~ 3800 - 15, 000 km, respectively. From the inversion of time delay versus frequency dispersion of the fast ZM echoes, field aligned electron density distributions both above and below the satellite from an altitude of ~ 1000 - 10, 000 km (and ~ 90 - 10, 000 km if accompanied by Whistler mode echoes) are obtained. The electron density profiles obtained from ZM sounding are in good agreement with in-situ electron density measurements from the CHAMP (~ 350 km) and DMSP (~ 850 km) satellites, from RPI passive measurements, and give a better estimate of electron density as compared to empirical density models. Our results demonstrate that ZM sounding is a new and powerful method to measure field aligned electron density distribution, magnetospheric ducts, and ZM cavities in the altitude range of ~ 1000 - 10, 000 km (and ~ 90 - 10, 000 km if accompanied by Whistler mode echoes) at low- to mid-latitude region of the magnetosphere. These measurements can improve the existing empirical density models and provide a new understanding of the magnetospheric ducts as well as of waves propagating therein...|$|R
