5|$|General {{relativity}} {{does not}} place any {{limits on the}} possible dimensions of spacetime. Although the theory is typically formulated in four dimensions, one can write down the same equations for the gravitational field <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of dimensions. Supergravity is more restrictive because it places an upper limit {{on the number of}} dimensions. In 1978, work by Werner Nahm showed that the maximum spacetime dimension in which one can formulate a consistent supersymmetric theory is eleven. In the same year, Eugene Cremmer, Bernard Julia, and Joel Scherk of the École Normale Supérieure showed that supergravity not only permits up to eleven dimensions but is in fact most elegant in this maximal number of dimensions.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{successfully}} rendezvous in time {{to bring}} aboard the new host, a female (Nicole Orth-Pallavicini), much to Dr. Crusher's surprise. She helps with the other Trill to transplant Odan into the new host, and both Riker and Odan fully recover. When Odan attempts to continue their relationship, Dr. Crusher is uncomfortable, knowing both that the Trill appear to have no preferences on gender orientation, and that Odan will continue to live on <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of hosts' bodies. Odan admits he still loves Dr. Crusher, but understands her confusion and discomfort, and promises to never forget her or their short time together. And Dr. Crusher replies that she loves Odan too; in Odan's new, female host body, Odan then kisses the inner wrist of her hand.|$|E

50|$|Despite his {{abilities}} and track record, {{he was never}} presented the opportunity to design a class of entirely-new locomotives that were produced <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>numbers.</b> He was continually stymied by railway management and politicians, and often his superbly performing locomotives were treated as embarrassments by his superiors, because they showed up the poor performance of the officially approved locomotives.|$|R

25|$|Some {{assemblers}} {{may also}} be able to perform some simple types of instruction set-specific optimizations.

25|$|In the 1970s, many {{physicists}} {{became interested}} in supergravity theories, which combine general relativity with supersymmetry.

25|$|There are {{two major}} {{prerequisites}} for brain morphometry: First, the brain features of interest must be measurable, and second, statistical methods {{have to be in}} place to compare the measurements quantitatively. Shape feature comparisons form the basis of Linnaean taxonomy, and even in cases of convergent evolution or brain disorders, they still provide a wealth of information {{about the nature of the}} processes involved. Shape comparisons have long been constrained to simple and mainly volume- or slice-based measures but profited enormously from the digital revolution, as now all sorts of shapes <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of dimensions can be handled numerically.|$|E
25|$|In mathematics, a bivector or 2-vector is a {{quantity}} in exterior algebra or geometric algebra that extends {{the idea of}} scalars and vectors. If a scalar is considered an order zero quantity, and a vector is an order one quantity, then a bivector {{can be thought of}} as being of order two. Bivectors have applications in many areas of mathematics and physics. They are related to complex numbers in two dimensions and to both pseudovectors and quaternions in three dimensions. They can be used to generate rotations <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of dimensions, and are a useful tool for classifying such rotations. They also are used in physics, tying together a number of otherwise unrelated quantities.|$|E

Production {{of the main}} model, the 12Z-17, was just starting {{at the time of}} the armistice.

25|$|The most {{important}} was the Grand Ole Opry, aired starting in 1925 by WSM in Nashville and continuing to the present day. Some of the early stars on the Opry were Uncle Dave Macon, Roy Acuff and African American harmonica player DeFord Bailey. WSM's 50,000-watt signal (in 1934) could often be heard across the country. Many musicians performed and recorded songs <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of styles. Moon Mullican, for example, played Western swing but also recorded songs that can be called rockabilly. Between 1947 and 1949, country crooner Eddy Arnold placed eight songs in the top 10. From 1945 to 1955 Jenny Lou Carson {{was one of the}} most prolific songwriters in country music.|$|E
25|$|The American {{sociologist}} Talcott Parsons {{carried on}} the work of the early founders mentioned above in his early (1937) work on action theory. By 1951, Parsons places these earlier ideas firmly into the realm of formal systems theory in The Social System. For the next several decades, this synergy between general systems thinking and the further development of social system theories is carried forward by Parson's student, Robert K. Merton, and a long line of others, in discussions of theories of the middle-range and social structure and agency. During part of this same period, from the late 1970s through the early 1990s, discussion ensues <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of other research areas about the properties of systems in which strong correlation of sub-parts leads to observed behaviors variously described as autopoetic, self-organizing, dynamical, turbulent, and chaotic. All of these are forms of system behavior arising from mathematical complexity. By the early 1990s, the work of social theorists such as Niklas Luhmann began reflecting these themes of complex behavior.|$|E
25|$|By now, polyhedra were firmly {{understood}} as three-dimensional examples of more general polytopes <b>in</b> <b>any</b> <b>number</b> of dimensions. The {{second half of}} the century saw the development of abstract algebraic ideas such as Polyhedral combinatorics, culminating in the idea of an abstract polytope as a partially ordered set (poset) of elements. The elements of an abstract polyhedron are its body (the maximal element), its faces, edges, vertices and the null polytope or empty set. These abstract elements can be mapped into ordinary space or realised as geometrical figures. Some abstract polyhedra have well-formed or faithful realisations, others do not. A flag is a connected set of elements of each dimension - for a polyhedron that is the body, a face, an edge of the face, a vertex of the edge, and the null polytope. An abstract polytope is said to be regular if its combinatorial symmetries are transitive on its flags - that is to say, that any flag can be mapped onto any other under a symmetry of the polyhedron. Abstract regular polytopes remain an active area of research.|$|E
