Grooming Pharaohs <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> a quick rub with a hound glove or a damp cloth. They are clean dogs, shed very little, and have no noticeable odour, except when wet or when they've been outside; but their odour quickly returns to normal.|$|E
2500|$|In DIGO, {{improved}} {{oral hygiene}} and plaque control is still important {{to help reduce}} any inflammatory component that may be contributing to the overgrowth. Reversing and preventing gingival enlargement caused by drugs <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> ceasing drug therapy or substituting to another drug. [...] However, {{this is not always}} an option; in such a situation, alternative drug therapy may be employed, if possible, to avoid this deleterious side effect. [...] In the case of immunosuppression, tacrolimus is an available alternative which results in much less severe gingival overgrowth than cyclosporin, but is similarly as nephrotoxic. [...] The dihydropyridine derivative isradipidine can replace nifedipine for some uses of calcium channel blocking and does not induce gingival overgrowth.|$|E

No doubt in point of intellect the English judges and the bar represent the most highly trained product of the British Empire.

Wot a woman would do whose 'usband had never done anything wrong I can't think.|$|E

6000|$|The idea of beholding these famous places {{inflamed}} Mr. Titmarsh's mind; and {{the charms}} of such a journey were eloquently impressed upon him by Mr. James.

[...] Mr. Titmarsh considered all these things; but also the difficulties of the situation: he had but six-and-thirty hours {{to get ready for}} so portentous a journey--he had engagements at home-- finally, could he afford it? In spite of these objections, however, with every glass of claret the enthusiasm somehow rose, and the difficulties vanished.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding his humility, his {{willingness}} {{within a certain}} range to learn, his profound reverence for what he took for truth, he was no more ready than many far inferior men to discern a certain important rule of intellectual life that was expressed in a quaint figure by one of our old English sages. 'He is a wonderful man,' said the sage, 'that can thread a needle when he is at cudgels in a crowd; and yet this <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> to find Truth in the hurry of disputation.'[130] The strenuous member of parliament, the fervid minister fighting the clauses of his bill, the disputant in cabinet, when he passed from man of action to the topics of balanced thought, nice scrutiny, long meditation, did not always succeed in getting his thread into the needle's eye.|$|E

As for me, if I went up in a powder explosion, or saved a hundred lives, I'd want all my friends to hear about it, and their friends as well. I'd be prouder than Lucifer over the affair.
