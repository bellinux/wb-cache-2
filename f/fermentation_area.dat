30|$|The {{configuration}} of the surveyed plants {{is more or less}} variable. They are equipped with storage area for raw wastes and with matured compost area, while the maturing area and the <b>fermentation</b> <b>area</b> are generally confused. These different configurations revealed {{at the level of the}} compost plants can cause problems with the quality of the products. Indeed, the very close arrangement between the compost piles and the fermentation piles or even the inorganic refuse pool can lead to mixtures of materials and thus interfere with the normal evolution of the composting process. For instance, composting plant A is configured with a distance of 5  m between the compost pile (which is assumed to be mature) and the inorganic refuse pool. In the composting plant D, it was noticed that the fermentation piles are almost in the middle of crop wastes and decaying fruits and vegetables. This proximity could lead to the presence of phytopathogens and nematodes inoculum in the final product. Vegetables and especially tomato fruits wastes are disposed for free decaying and not managed at all.|$|E
40|$|Five actinophages highly {{specific}} for Streptomyces mediterranei {{were isolated}} from lysed broth cultures. Studies {{were performed on}} the effect of plating conditions on plaque formation. The development of phage-resistant strains of S. mediterranei not only eliminated the phage but also significantly increased rifamycin yields. The phage-resistant cultures proved to be more unstable than the original sensitive strain. Maintenance of the cultures as frozen vegetative mycelium assured culture stability and reproducibility of the results. Strict aseptic precautions throughout the laboratories and <b>fermentation</b> <b>areas</b> did not eliminate the danger of phage infection; effective control was obtained only with the introduction of resistant strains. S. mediterranei phages proved to be highly specific for calcium as an adsorption cofactor; addition of calcium-sequestering agents to sensitive mycelium completely prevented its lysis by the phage. The resistant strains developed were capable of adsorbing the phage and of releasing it without multiplication upon aging of the mycelium. No marked morphological, cultural, or biochemical differences were found among the various phage-resistant strains...|$|R

The sampling points were selected from <b>fermentation</b> <b>areas,</b> beer conditioning areas and beer bottling and canning sites. Multiplex PCR methodology was used for detection of three Pectinatus and three Megasphaera species using species specific primers. The presence of six Lactobacillus and three beer spoilage Pediococcus species were also examined. Overall, 117 samples were analysed from ten breweries; six samples were positive for the presence of Pectinatus species and three samples were positive for the presence of Megasphaera species, while 34 samples were positive for the presence of Lactobacillus species and 23 samples were positive for Pediococcus species.

40|$|Most {{lakes in}} the eastern part of China are {{eutrophic}} and non-point pollution accounts for more than half of the nutrient load to the lakes and reservoirs. Some efforts have been made to reduce the nonpoint source pollution in the catchments of sensitive water bodies. Technologies for the control of non-point pollution in Chinese rural areas are multipond systems, biogas <b>fermentation,</b> hilly <b>area</b> ecological agriculture, constructed wetlands, ecotone engineering and others. They are effective in the removal of nutrients from the runoff water or reduction of waste, and they are used with multi-purposes. To control non-point pollution, the cooperation with farmers and other residents in the countryside is the key to success, and the program has to consider their benefits. There are still many difficulties with its control, and more efforts are needed to develop suitable technologies and environmental education...|$|R
25|$|The {{area has}} a long {{winemaking}} tradition and was {{the birthplace of the}} sparkling wine Cava, invented in the early 1870s in Sant Sadurní d'Anoia by Josep Raventos of Codorníu Winery. At the turn of the 20th century, the Catalan wine industry was at the forefront of Spain's emergence as a world leader in quality wine production, being the first Spanish wine region to adopt the use of stainless steel <b>fermentation</b> tanks. The <b>area</b> is also an important cork production region, with output aimed primarily at the region's Cava houses.|$|R
50|$|If the kinetic inhibitors {{and high}} {{temperatures}} are compatible then dolomitization {{can take place}} in saline environments above thermodynamic and kinetic saturation with respect to dolomite. This type of environment includes, freshwater and seawater mixing zones, normal saline to hypersaline subtidal environments, schizohaline environments (fluctuating salinity: fresh-water to hypersaline conditions) and hypersaline supratidal environments. When requirements are fulfilled dolomitization can take place in alkaline environments which are those {{under the influence of}} bacterial reduction and <b>fermentation</b> processes, and <b>areas</b> with high input alkaline continental groundwaters. Environments with high temperatures (about 50 °C) such as subsurface and hydrothermal environments are conducive to dolomitization.|$|R

Surface area for absorption are related to metabolic body size, directly so in frugivores; area for absorption is relatively less in larger faunivores and more in larger folivores, especially those with large stomachs.

The theoretical part is focusing {{to the structure}} of lignocellulosis phytomass, on technology of mechanical treatment and acid hydrolysis. The experimental part is based on the production of neutralized hydrolyzate obtained by using technology of high-pressure hydrolyse by pressure 1, 5 MPa, in retention time of 500 seconds and 190 °C. Data, generated by operation server Linode Platform Manager, emerges, that the area with the best polynormal cubic function, which is aproximated by the smallest mistake. The local extremes, where are the verification of the cumulative CH 4 by anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> (in thermophilic <b>area</b> by temperature 51 °C) in relation on dry matter, are calculated of tha data obtained of Maple 14. The highest yeld of CH 4 production was found by pressure of high-pressure hydrolyser 2, 37 MPa. The maximum value of production of biogas (CH 4) was 190 m 3. t- 1 of dry phytomass. Based on the optimalization, was maximum yeld of CH 4 (of biochemical aspects) found about dry matter 8, 57 % and pH 4, 84.

40|$|The {{energetic}} and material valorisation of biomass resources and {{especially those with}} a lignocellulosic structure is gaining increasing attention. Among various processes within the biorefining concept, anaerobic digestion has been extensively implemented {{for the production of}} methane from organic waste fractions. Acidogenic fermentation (acidogenesis) is an intermediate stage during anaerobic digestion (following hydrolysis and followed by acetogenesis and methanogenesis) that could be investigated as an individual process for the production of "green" chemicals. In this study, we are investigating the acidogenic fermentation of three complex lignocellulosic substrates, namely beet pulp, wheat bran and miscanthus by mixed microbial cultures. Next to that, we investigate the effect of substrate pre-treatment by steam explosion on the fermentation profiles. The parameters that were monitored are the pH, the production and composition of biogas, the concentration of the soluble organic matter and the concentration of metabolites like volatile fatty acids and ethanol. Three identical experiments were performed, one for each substrate. Each experiment included five series of reactors, representing different combinations of untreated/pre-treated substrate with inoculum; each series consisted of three replicates. An anaerobic mixed culture inoculum, impoverished in methanogens through pH adjustment and heat treatment, was developed from activated aerobic sludge. Experiments were conducted under anaerobic conditions for 22 days, in batch reactors of 100 ml working volume, at a constant temperature of 35 °C, with the pH left uncontrolled during fermentation. The pH stabilised after 7 days of <b>fermentation</b> in the <b>area</b> of 4. 3 - 5. 2 and methanogenesis was inhibited in all cases, with the exception of untreated miscanthus in the presence of inoculum. Results show that the fermentation profiles are substrate-dependent and no common conclusion concerning the effect of steam explosion can be drawn. While steam explosion solubilised part of the organic matter of all substrates, it did not necessarily improve their digestibility. Indeed, miscanthus is virtually non digestible both in the pre-treated and untreated forms, wheat bran shows similar behaviour in both forms and only beet pulp shows a different profile, with the untreated form being more digestible. Acetic acid and butyric acid where the most dominant metabolites with concentrations reaching 10. 5 and 9. 4 g_CODeq/kg_mixed liquer, respectively...|$|R
