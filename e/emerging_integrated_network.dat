The <b>emerging</b> <b>integrated</b> <b>Network</b> Enhanced Telemetry (iNET) Standard defines new, network-based data delivery protocols which can produce various network data flows. Augmenting existing Serial Streaming Telemetry (SST) data flows with these network-based data flows is crucial to enhancing current flight test capabilities. This paper briefly introduces the network protocols referenced in the iNET Standard and then identifies the various data flows generated by network-based components which comply with the iNET Standard. Several combinations of SST and TmNS data flows are presented and the enhanced telemetry capabilities provided by each combination are identified. Identifying time intervals of unused telemetry network bandwidth explicitly for reallocation to other test articles is also addressed...|$|E

We still have not solved the latency problem (bandwidth-×-delay product) for WAN applications, or provided for the delivery of this bandwidth to the applications through the host architecture and operating systems.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim of this}} dissertation {{is neither}} to increase {{the state of the}} art in networking technology nor to predict the future structure of telecommunications networks. It is an attempt to raise the awareness of both the author and the reader as to the evolutionary forces driving vast changes in the telecommunications field. The impact of these changes will significantly alter the way we live and conduct business in the Information Age. For those involved with the communications field, the ability to make sound business decisions will require an in-depth knowledge of the technology and services that compose ISDN. Therefore this paper will explore the motivating forces, the potential services, and the technical components in the <b>emerging</b> <b>Integrated</b> Services Digital <b>Network</b> (ISDN).

Therefore several research projects try to reinvent the Internet and provide a network architecture which is better armed for future needs. This thesis is situated in the ANA project which builds an autonomic network based on a clean slate approach. The ultimate goal is to develop a novel autonomic network architecture that enables flexible, dynamic, and fully autonomic formation of networks.

40|$|In recent years, due to {{the rapid}} {{convergence}} of multimedia services, Internet and wireless communications, {{there has been a}} growing trend of heterogeneity (in terms of channel bandwidths, mobility levels of terminals, end-user quality-of-service (QoS) requirements) for <b>emerging</b> <b>integrated</b> wired/wireless <b>networks.</b> Moreover, in nowadays systems, a multitude of users coexists within the same network, each of them with his own QoS requirement and bandwidth availability. In this framework, embedded source coding allowing partial decoding at various resolution is an appealing technique for multimedia transmissions. This dissertation includes my PhD research, mainly devoted to the study of embedded multimedia bitstreams in heterogenous networks, developed at the University of Bologna, advised by Prof. O. Andrisano and Prof. A. Conti, and at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I spent eighteen months as a visiting scholar, advised by Prof. L. B. Milstein and Prof. P. C. Cosman. In order to improve the multimedia transmission quality over wireless channels, joint source and channel coding optimization is investigated in a 2 D time-frequency resource block for an OFDM system. We show that knowing the order of diversity in time and/or frequency domain can assist image (video) coding in selecting optimal channel code rates (source and channel code rates). Then, adaptive modulation techniques, aimed at maximizing the spectral efficiency, are investigated as another possible solution for improving multimedia transmissions. For both slow and fast adaptive modulations, the effects of imperfect channel estimation errors are evaluated, showing that the fast technique, optimal in ideal systems, might be outperformed by the slow adaptive modulation, when a real test case is considered. Finally, the effects of co-channel interference and approximated bit error probability (BEP) are evaluated in adaptive modulation techniques, providing new decision regions concepts, and showing how the widely used BEP approximations lead to a substantial loss in the overall performance...|$|R
40|$|<b>Emerging</b> {{cellular}} <b>networks</b> <b>integrate</b> {{the user}} terminal geo-localization function besides the communication function. The conventional positioning {{approach is to}} estimate the terminal location in two-steps: first the distance to all connected base stations is assessed based on signal time-of-flight measurements, then the location is deduced from the distances by multilateration. The two-step approach incurs a performance degradation because information is lost from the received signal when the multi-lateration is performed. In this paper, we propose to iterate between the two conventional steps to progressively refine the distance estimates based on {{the knowledge of the}} position estimate obtained from the previous iterations. The information exchanged between the two-steps not only consists in the mean of the estimates (distance or position) but also of their variance that convey information about the reliability of the estimates. Simulation results show that the achievable performance after a few iterations is close to the performance of the optimal approach that directly estimates the position based on the observation of the received signal. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

However there are many problems to construct the <b>integrated</b> <b>networks</b> such as network design, network connection for file servers and designing application servers. This paper addresses schemes for <b>integrated</b> <b>network</b> systems based on a real <b>integrated</b> <b>network</b> in our university. Network designing policy, routing schemes for central huge file servers and high availability schemes for application servers are discussed. Our proposal for network design is construction with two different generation network facilities to avoid hardware and software failure. For file servers which has many network interface to improve bandwidth, many routing algorithms are standardized to select network interface for packets from file servers, {{but there are no}} effective implementation for client which throw packets toward file servers. We propose network interface selecting method that looks up optimal interface in NIS maps and set as "automount" arguments. We implement these approaches on our network and evaluate its efficacy under real network system operation. In consequence, routing schemes for file servers can reduce roundabout routing. リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学情報科学研究科...|$|R
