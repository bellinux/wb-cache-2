40|$|The {{characteristic}} contour inflection of a <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> {{is the key}} to altitude adaption. In {{sea level}} conditions, it forces the flow to a symmetrical separation, limiting the side load generation and increasing the thrust. After the transition, under high altitude conditions, the nozzle flows full, increasing the vacuum thrust. A hot flow experimental study has been conducted at the German Aerospace Center on a planar <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle.</b> The wall temperature distribution has been measured at various depths for the determination of the heat flux through the wall.

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) {{are working}} {{together}} to advance the technology readiness level (TRL) of the <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> concept. <b>Dual</b> bell <b>nozzles</b> are a form of altitude compensating nozzle that consists of two connecting bell contours. At low altitude the nozzle flows fully in the first, relatively lower area ratio, nozzle. The nozzle flow separates from the wall at the inflection point which joins the two bell contours. This relatively low expansion results in higher nozzle efficiency during the low altitude portion of the launch. As ambient pressure decreases with increasing altitude, the nozzle flow will expand to fill the relatively large area ratio second nozzle. The larger area ratio of the second bell enables higher Isp during the high altitude and vacuum portions of the launch. Despite {{a long history of}} theoretical consideration and promise towards improving rocket performance, <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzles</b> have yet to be developed for practical use and have seen only limited testing. One barrier to use of <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzles</b> is the lack of control over the nozzle flow transition from the first bell to the second bell during operation. A method that this team is pursuing to enhance the controllability of the nozzle flow transition is manipulation of the film coolant that is injected near the inflection between the two bell contours. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is being run to assess the degree of control over nozzle flow transition generated via manipulation of the film injection. A cold flow <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle,</b> without film coolant, was tested over a range of simulated altitudes in 2004 in MSFC's nozzle test facility.

MSFC then proceeded to add film injection to the CFD grid of the <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle.</b> A series of nozzle pressure ratios and film coolant flow rates are investigated to determine the effect of the film injection on the nozzle flow transition behavior.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} a single nozzle and a <b>dual</b> <b>nozzle</b> strut based ejector. The results {{are focused on the}} fluid properties in the ejector duct. The research focused on choking mechanisms, mass flow entrainment, and mixing duct pressure distributions. The two ejectors were tests at equivalent primary mass flow rates. This corresponds to chamber pressures ranging from 100 psi to 900 psi in the single nozzle strut and 50 psi to 450 psi in the <b>dual</b> <b>nozzle</b> strut. Secondary flow was drawn from the lab at atmospheric pressure, and was not controlled. The secondary flow was found to choke at a value of 2. 3 lb/s for a primary mass flow rate at approximately 2. 1 lb/s for both ejectors. This choke was believed to be a mass addition choke rather than a traditional aerodynamic choke. The mixing duct pressure distribution exhibited two distinct trends at "low pressure" trend and at "high pressure" trend. For the low pressure trend, the mixing length for the ejectors remained fixed around 20 inches, regardless of the chamber pressure. For the higher pressure trend, the mixing length was considerably longer and increased with increasing chamber pressure. At high chamber pressures (high mass flow rates), a supersonic core flow was present at the exit of the duct. For these cases, the two streams did not have time to mix {{by the end of the}} duct...|$|E

The frequencies associated with this phenomenon were predicted to within 5 percent for a full scale F- 15 aircraft. Amplitude levels associated with this phenomenon were found to dominate the dynamic pressure fluctuations in the inter-nozzle region, and reach a level near the structural design limit for this aircraft.

40|$|The <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> {{belongs to}} the family of Altitude Compensating Nozzles (ACN), which {{constitutes}} an option of great interest to improve launcher first stage performance.

Therefore the <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> operates with a separated flow at take off and in the initial portion of the flight trajectory. This characteristic is of important concern since the external flow is neither steady nor axisymmetric, and its coupling with the internal flow separation can cause dangerous side loads.

Test results are presented for a dual throat thruster burning gaseous oxygen and hydrogen at primary (inner) chamber pressures from 380 to 680 psia. Heat flux profiles were obtained from calorimetric cooling channels in the inner nozzle, outer or secondary chamber and the tip of the inner nozzle.

Fluxes {{near the end of the}} inner nozzle were significantly higher than in Mode II when only the inner chamber was fired, due to the flow separation and recirculation caused by the back pressure imposed by the secondary chamber. As the pressure ratio increased, these heat fluxes increased and the region of high heat flux relative to Mode II extended farther upstream.

The density gradient patterns in the shadowgraphs were compared to pressure data measured along the top and side walls of the mixing duct. The shadowgraph images showed the presence of barrel shocks emanating from the nozzles which at low pressures terminated in Mach disks and at higher pressures extended beyond the barrel shape and reflected off {{the walls of the}} duct. Based on pressure data from previous testing, reflected shocks were expected {{on the walls of the}} duct. The shadowgraph images confirmed the locations of these reflected shocks on the top wall of the duct.

Spray cooling is an effective method to remove high heat fluxes from electronic components. To understand the physical mechanisms, the current work studies heat transfer rates from single and <b>dual</b> <b>nozzle</b> sprays on a small heated surface (1. 3 mm x 2 mm). Thermal lnk Jet (TIJ) atomizers generate small droplets, 33 um dia. at known frequencies leading to controlled spray conditions with a monodisperse stream of droplets interacting with the hot surface. Particular interest in this work is the dissipated heat flux {{and its relation to}} the liquid film thickness, the surface superheat, the cooling mass flow rate.

The limit of droplet spreading-splashing deposition has been reported to be K= 57. 7 (K=We 1 / 2 *Re 1 / 4) for an ambient temperature of 25 •c at the surface. Current experimental results at K= 47. 9 and K= 27. 2 for the surface temperatures of 140 "C and 120 "C indicating that a stable droplet spreading regime is achieved with little splashing. In addition, the liquid film thickness is investigated in relation to the heater superheat and a stable thin film is seen at superheats beyond 20 •c. The efficiency of the spray system is inversely related to the film thickness and may be due to ejection of liquid from the surface due to bursting of vapor bubbles. ej 201...|$|E

40|$|Preferential weld {{corrosion}} (PWC) has posed {{a problem}} to {{the oil and gas}} industry for a number of years. The general consensus from authors is that environmental effects take precedence over the weld chemical composition and microstructure. Therefore, the primary approach is to ensure the correct corrosion inhibitor selection and application to prevent PWC. Although there has been considerable focus directed toward the effect of flow rate on PWC in inhibited carbon dioxide (CO 2) -saturated environments, the consideration of a higher, localized turbulence over the weld material and the implications this has on PWC appears minimal. This paper considers this effect by reviewing the performance of a commercially available, film-forming oilfield corrosion inhibitor using a submerged impinging jet (SIJ). The <b>dual</b> <b>nozzle</b> arrangement of the SIJ allowed a carbon steel parent metal and a 1 % Ni, 0. 25 % Mo weld material to be subjected to the same brine chemistry, but different flow conditions. The velocity over the parent metal was kept constant at 7 m/s while the weld material was subjected to velocities of 7, 8. 8, and 11. 4 m/s to simulate different severities of turbulence. Galvanic current and linear polarization resistance (LPR) measurements were used to assess the weld resistance to PWC. Although the weld was shown to be cathodic to the parent metal, increasing velocity and turbulence at the weld relative to the parent metal was found to reduce the galvanic current, suggesting increased susceptibility of the weld to corrosion. The addition of inhibitor at 100 ppm accentuated this effect and led to a reversal of the galvanic current when the relative velocities were 7 m/s and 11. 4 m/s for the parent metal and weld, respectively. The paper discusses the power of this galvanic technique for prediction of the conditions conducive to accentuating PWC...|$|E

Forming the microparticles in a premixed cosolvent, i. e., with a preformed superstructure, did not allow the polymer to deposit {{on the surface of the}} microparticles.

40|$|The Salt Disposition Integration (SDI) {{portfolio}} of projects provides the infrastructure within existing Liquid Waste facilities {{to support the}} startup and long term operation of the Salt Waste Processing Facility (SWPF). Within SDI, the Blend and Feed Project will equip existing waste tanks in the Tank Farms to serve as Blend Tanks where 300, 000 - 800, 000 gallons of salt solution will be blended in 1. 3 million gallon tanks and qualified for use as feedstock for SWPF. Blending requires the miscible salt solutions from potentially multiple source tanks per batch to be well mixed without disturbing settled sludge solids that may be present in a Blend Tank. Disturbing solids may be problematic both from a feed quality perspective {{as well as from}} a process safety perspective where hydrogen release from the sludge is a potential flammability concern. To develop the necessary technical basis for the design and operation of blending equipment, Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) completed scaled blending and transfer pump tests and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. A 94 inch diameter pilot-scale blending tank, including tank internals such as the blending pump, transfer pump, removable cooling coils, and center column, were used in this research. The test tank represents a 1 / 10. 85 scaled version of an 85 foot diameter, Type IIIA, nuclear waste tank that may be typical of Blend Tanks used in SDI. Specifically, Tank 50 was selected as the tank to be modeled per the SRR, Project Engineering Manager. SRNL blending tests investigated various fixed position, non-rotating, <b>dual</b> <b>nozzle</b> pump designs, including a blending pump model provided by the blend pump vendor, Curtiss Wright (CW). Primary research goals were to assess blending times and to evaluate incipient sludge disturbance for waste tanks. Incipient sludge disturbance was defined by SRR and SRNL as minor blending of settled sludge from the tank bottom into suspension due to blending pump operation, where the sludge level was shown to remain constant. To experimentally model the sludge layer, a very thin, pourable, sludge simulant was conservatively used for all testing. To experimentally model the liquid, supernate layer above the sludge in waste tanks, two salt solution simulants were used, which provided a bounding range of supernate properties. One solution was water (H{sub 2 }O + NaOH), and the other was an inhibited, more viscous salt solution. The research performed and data obtained significantly advances the understanding of fluid mechanics, mixing theory and CFD modeling for nuclear waste tanks by benchmarking CFD results to actual experimental data. This research significantly bridges the gap between previous CFD models and actual field experiences in real waste tanks. A finding of the 2009, DOE, Slurry Retrieval, Pipeline Transport and Plugging, and Mixing Workshop was that CFD models were inadequate to assess blending processes in nuclear waste tanks. One recommendation from that Workshop was that a validation, or bench marking program be performed for CFD modeling versus experiment. This research provided experimental data to validate and correct CFD models as they apply to mixing and blending in nuclear waste tanks. Extensive SDI research was a significant step toward bench marking and applying CFD modeling. This research showed that CFD models not only agreed with experiment, but demonstrated that the large variance in actual experimental data accounts for misunderstood discrepancies between CFD models and experiments. Having documented this finding, SRNL was able to provide correction factors to be used with CFD models to statistically bound full scale CFD results. Through the use of pilot scale tests performed for both types of pumps and available engineering literature, SRNL demonstrated how to effectively apply CFD results to salt batch mixing in full scale waste tanks. In other words, CFD models were in error prior to development of experimental correction factors determined during this research, which provided a technique to use CFD models for salt batch mixing and transfer pump operations. This major scientific advance in mixing technology resulted in multi-million dollar cost savings to SRR. New techniques were developed for both experiment and analysis to complete this research. Supporting this success, research findings are summarized in the Conclusions section of this report, and technical recommendations for design and operation are included in this section of the report...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Extensive {{investigations}} {{of the characteristics of}} single and dual impinging plane turbulent jets were conducted and an analysis provided for coating film flow behaviour under the influence of impinging jets. The special characteristics of the fluctuating pressure on the impingement plate were also studied for both normal and oblique impinging jets. The findings of the present study provide an insight into the behaviour of impinging turbulent jets and their use in the modern industrial hot-dipped metal coating. The main findings are: Velocity fields from a normal jet plane impingement onto a flat plate show that the decay of the centreline velocity agreed well with the equation determined from Hiemenz solution for stagnation flow. However the wall shear stress in the impingment region, which is linearly proportional to the distance from the stagnation position, was found significantly below that predicted from Hiemenz solution. The influence of the impingement plate on the jet flow development was found to be confined to a region relatively close to the impingment surface. The wall jet growth and wall friction were found higher than the values for wall jets in parallel nozzle studies and this is likely {{to be related to the}} difference in the initial jet conditions. For normal impingement, two distinct groups of normalised shear stress profiles corresponding to small H/D (≤ 5) and large H/D (> 7 approximately) were found. The distinction is related to H/D only and independent of the Reynolds number. Reynolds number was found to have insignificant effect on the stagnation pressure, impingment pressure profile and the profile half-width. However the maximum wall shear stress was a function of both H/D and Re. The present results are consistent in magnitude with previously published values which were measured over a narrower range of H/D and Re. In the study of impingement pressure fluctuations, the pressure spectra and spectrograms were obtained for normal and oblique jet impingement at various Reynolds numbers and nozzle distances. The profile of the RMS impingement pressure was independent of Re and the results suggest that the change in the profile with H/D is not related to the transition in the wall jet flow but is most likely associated with the penetration of the mixing layers towards the nozzle centre line as the nozzle distance varies. There are regions consisting of distinguishable dominating frequencies in the pressure spectrograms and both the nozzle distance and nozzle exit velocity can influence these features in the impingement and wall jet regions. The pressure spectrum at the stagnation position was well related to the velocity spectra along the jet centre line over a wide frequency range. At higher frequencies the pressure fluctuation was found to decay significantly. Comprehensive study of the mean pressure and wall shear stress due to the impingement of asymmetric dual jets onto a flat surface was conducted. For dual jet impingement, it was found that there were significant changes in the distribution of both pressure and wall shear stress with nozzle distance and correlations were made to provide a description of their behaviour. The force acting on the impingement surface was found to be inversely proportional to distance as predicted by simple hovercraft theory. Even though the behaviour of peak pressures of dual jet system is similar to that of single jet impingement, their magnitudes are between 10 % to 30 % lower and the half-width of the pressure distribution was higher than the single jet results. Both stagnation points moved from the intersection point of the nozzle centreline in the direction away from the cushion region. The effect of Re on impingement pressure profiles was insignificant but there was small effects of Re on the wall shear stress distributions. An analysis was presented for the coating film flow under the influence of external forces imposed by impinging jets. This analysis was used to calculate the final film thickness. Asymptotic solutions to the simplified solution for single jet impingement in extreme cases of the withdrawal speed, U, suggest that the final film thickness is linearly proportional to U/P P at low speed and proportional to (U/P P) 1 / 2 at high U. With the beneficial effect of the cushion force, the <b>dual</b> <b>nozzle</b> system can operate much closer to the strip to reduce the film thickness, energy consumption and noise level. Furthermore, actual trials showed improvement in coating thickness distribution across the strip width could be obtained...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} {{structures of}} a new <b>dual</b> fuel <b>nozzle</b> design concept (inner swirl nozzle, double swirl nozzle, and outer swirl nozzle) were developed for the chemically recuperated gas turbine (CRGT) combustor. The combustion flow fields in the combustor with the three nozzles were investigated, respectively, based on the FLUENT simulation. The realizable - model and PDF model were adopted, respectively, for the turbulence flow and nonpremixed reformed gas combustion. The obtained results using these models showed good agreement with experimental results in original oil combustor. The effects of different <b>dual</b> fuel <b>nozzle</b> structures on the flow field, fuel concentration distribution, and temperature distribution in the combustor were simulated and analyzed. Results suggest that the double swirl nozzle and outer swirl nozzle can form a better flow field with obvious central recirculation zone (CRZ), shorten fuel and air mixing distance, and obtain a more uniform outlet temperature distribution, {{in comparison with the}} inner swirl nozzle. However, compared with double swirl nozzle, the outer swirl nozzle can result in a better combustion flow field with the high temperature region in the CRZ, which is important to stabilize the flame...|$|R
40|$|In typical engine installations, the pylon of {{an engine}} creates a flow {{disturbance}} that {{interacts with the}} engine exhaust flow. This interaction of the pylon with the exhaust flow from a <b>dual</b> stream <b>nozzle</b> was studied computationally. The <b>dual</b> stream <b>nozzle</b> simulates an engine with a bypass ratio of five. A total of five configurations were simulated all at the take-off operating point. All computations were performed using the structured PAB 3 D code which solves the steady, compressible, Reynolds-averaged NavierStokes equations. These configurations included a core nozzle with eight chevron noise reduction devices built into the nozzle trailing edge. Baseline cases had no chevron devices and were run with a pylon and without a pylon. Cases with the chevron were also studied with and without the pylon. Another case was run with the chevron rotated relative to the pylon. The fan nozzle did not have chevron devices attached. Solutions showed {{that the effect of}} the pylon is to distort the round jet plume and to destroy the symmetrical lobed pattern created by the core chevrons. Several overall flow field quantities were calculated that might be used in extensions of this work to find flow field parameters that correlate with changes in noise...|$|R
40|$|The nozzle are {{currently}} presenting {{the most promising}} optimisation possibilities to supply the increasing needs of the aerospace industry. The <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzles</b> allow the altitude adaptation of the flow. The inflection forces the flow to a stable and symmetrical separation, generating an optimised thrust for sea level operation. During the flight, when the ambient pressure decreases under a certain value, the flow suddenly attaches the nozzle wall down to the nozzle end, generating a higher expansion for higher performance. The study presented in this document was made at the DLR (German Aerospace Center) {{as part of a}} PhD. This fundamental study has for objective the understanding of the flow behaviour in a <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle,</b> in order to define the various parameters of influence. A cold flow test series has been conducted on various nozzle geometries. Pressure measurements have been made and the flow has been observed with schlieren optics {{in order to determine the}} influence of the geometry on the evolution of the flow transition from one operating mode to the other, its duration and stability toward pressure variations. Temperature and pressure measurements were also made during a test series under warm gas conditions to investigate the thermal load in the vicinity of the wall inflection...|$|R
40|$|The contour {{inflection}} of the <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> {{forces the}} flow to a symmetrical and controlled separation in sea level mode. At a certain altitude, {{the transition to}} high altitude mode takes place: the flow attaches rapidly to the nozzle extension wall, down to the exit plane. During this transition, the separation point moves in the extension generating potential high side load peaks due to its asymmetrical position. A cold flow subscale test campaign has been conducted on three nozzle models at the German Aerospace Center to evaluate the generation of side loads in <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzles.</b> The phenomenology is given for the different nozzle flow regimes. Both operating modes are related to very low side loads. Transition and retransition induce a strong short time peak. The phase of sneak transition, corresponding to a flow separation within the inflection region {{before the start of}} the actual transition, generates comparable side loads to separated conventional nozzles. The influence of the various geometrical parameters on flow behavior and side load generation was also investigated in this study. The extension length is shown to be the critical parameter for flow stability, transition duration and side load generation, leading to the necessity of a trade off for the optimization of the dual bell concept in rocket applications...|$|R

40|$|The <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> {{has been}} found {{out to be one}} of the most {{promising}} concepts for alti-tude adaption of the nozzle jet. The wall contour inflection linking the base nozzle with the ex-tension provides two stable operating modes, circumventing the area ratio limitation inherent to conventional main stage engine nozzles. During the past decade, numerous experimental as well as analytical investigations have been conducted at the German Aerospace Center for a better understanding and the qualification of the dual bell concept for main stage engine application. Cold and hot flow tests aimed to point out the influence of the geometrical parameters on the flow behavior. The conditions for the transition from sea level to altitude mode and back, the hysteresis between these values, the duration of the transition and the resulting side load genera-tion were of particular interest. The contour optimization results in a trade-off between the tran-sition duration, stability and side load amplitude, all depending on the extension length. Out of the experimental work, it was possible to define the parameters for realistic <b>dual</b> bell <b>nozzle</b> geometries and to conduct an analytical study of the nozzle behavior during ascent of a parallel staged heavy launcher. The additional loss in sea level, the so-called drag effect, was evaluated for the chosen nozzle using DLR’s CFD in-house code Tau.
