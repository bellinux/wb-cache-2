We have considered RSFQ-based crossbar, Batcher-banyan, and shared bus switching fabrics, and the complexity and performance parameters of these circuits have been estimated. The results show that the proposed RSFQ <b>digital</b> <b>switches</b> with overall throughput of 5 : 76 Tbps operating at an internal clock frequency of ¸ 60 GHz and dissipating as low as 45 mW power per fabric could effectively compete with their semiconductor and photonic counterparts.

40|$|A {{bistable}} <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> {{is made of}} {{a material}} whose electrical resistance reversibly decreases in response to intercalation by positive ions. Flow of positive ions between the bistable <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> and a positive ion source is controlled {{by means of an}} electrical potential applied across a thermal <b>switching</b> <b>element.</b> The material of the thermal <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> generates heat in response to electrical current flow therethrough, which in turn causes the material to undergo a thermal phase transition from a high electrical resistance state to a low electrical resistance state as the temperature increases above a predetermined value. Application of the electrical potential in one direction renders the thermal <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> conductive to pass electron current out of the ion source. This causes positive ions to flow from the source into the bistable <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> and intercalate the same to produce a non-volatile, low resistance logic state. Application of the electrical potential in the opposite direction causes reverse current flow which de-intercalates the bistable logic <b>switching</b> <b>element</b> and produces a high resistance logic state...|$|R

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{features}} description of electronics <b>switches</b> for <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and on the design of program for optimal calculation of switching points and the figure of <b>switches</b> in <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays investigation. The electronics switches types, used for time circuit separation, are described in the preamble. These switches are the base of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays and in principal two types are defined: the switch S and switch T. The switch S allows the interconnection only of the same channel intervals from incoming circuit with random outgoing circuit. The switch S is being used in multistage switching arrays in combination with the switches T because it can not be used separately. The switch T allows exchanging the time position of incoming circuit to different time position of outgoing circuit depending on connection needs. The time switch can substitute the space switch under specific work conditions. In practice, the time switch with controlled reading and writing is used. The following part of diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the designs and calculations of optimal <b>switching</b> points of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array which is the executive unit of switching systems. These systems directly interconnect the signals from digital multiplexes and make the basic assumptions for telecommunication networks integration. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array means the equipment which is able to connect the channels of digital multiplexes carrying the information in encoding form. The multiplexes are the most often with pulse coded modulation or adaptive delta modulation. The <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> arrays are divided into the time and space one. The <b>switching</b> arrays of <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> systems can be made by time switching array T whose realization is limited to specific capacity or by the connection of multistage arrays. Single stages sequenced one behind each other are made by the switches T and S. The space array S does not allow making the <b>digital</b> <b>switching</b> array of switching centre. The program which determines possible proposals of switching arrays from defined figure of inputs and calculates the optimal figure of switching points and switches is a part of diploma thesis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an introduction to}} the design and simulation of a novel class of integrated photonic phased array <b>switch</b> <b>elements.</b> The main objective is to use nano-electromechanical (NEMS) based phase shifters of cascaded under-etched slot nanowires that are compact in size and require a small amount of power to operate them. The structure of the <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> is organized such that it brings the phase shifting elements to the exterior sides of the photonic circuits. The transition slot couplers, used to interconnect the phase shifters, are designed to enable biasing one of the silicon beams of each phase shifter from an electrode located {{at the side of the}} phase shifter. The other silicon beam of each phase shifter is biased through the rest of the silicon structure of the <b>switch</b> <b>element,</b> which is taken as a ground. Phased array <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> ranging from 2 × 2 up to 8 × 8 multiple-inputs/multiple-outputs (MIMO) are conveniently designed within reasonable footprints native to the current fabrication technologies. Chapter one presents the general layout of the various designs of the <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> and demonstrates their novel features. This demonstration will show how waveguide disturbances in the interconnecting network from conventional <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> can be avoided by adopting an innovative design. Some possible applications for the designed <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> of different sizes and topologies are indicated throughout the chapter. Chapter two presents the design of the multimode interference (MMI) couplers used in the <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> as splitters, combiners and waveguide crossovers. Simulation data and design methodologies for the multimode couplers of interest are detailed in this chapter. Chapter three presents the design and analysis of the NEMS-operated phase shifters. Both simulations and numerical analysis are utilized in the design of a 0 º- 180 º capable NEMS-operated phase shifter. Additionally, the response of some of the designed photonic phased array <b>switch</b> <b>elements</b> is demonstrated in this chapter.
