5|$|Each of {{the seven}} books is set {{over the course of}} one school year. Harry struggles with the {{problems}} he encounters, and dealing with them often involves the need to violate some school rules. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> caught breaking rules, they are often disciplined by Hogwarts professors. The stories reach their climax in the summer term, near or just after final exams, when events escalate far beyond in-school squabbles and struggles, and Harry must confront either Voldemort or one of his followers, the Death Eaters, with the stakes {{a matter of life and}} death – a point underlined, as the series progresses, by characters being killed in each of the final four books. In the aftermath, he learns important lessons through exposition and discussions with head teacher and mentor Albus Dumbledore. The only exception to this school-centred setting is the final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, in which Harry and his friends spend most of their time away from Hogwarts, and only return there to face Voldemort at the dénouement.|$|E
2500|$|Bradbury {{described}} himself as [...] "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them." [...] He {{did not believe that}} book burning was an inevitable part of our future; he wanted to warn against its development. In a later interview, when asked if he believes that teaching Fahrenheit 451 in schools will prevent his totalitarian vision of the future, Bradbury replied in the negative. Rather, he states that education must be at the kindergarten and first-grade level. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> unable to read then, they will be unable to read Fahrenheit 451.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{important}} pedagogical {{feature of}} GCE is learning through communicative practices {{outside the classroom}} that [...] "harness [...] the educational force of the wider culture". <b>If</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> encouraged [...] "to see themselves as political agents", educators assume {{they are more likely}} to acquire the knowledge, skills and abilities that enable them to [...] become agents of change. Another important element of the student-centered participatory nature of GCED, is that students, through their engagement with others via Social Network Services, create their own forms of global citizenship through dialogue, learning, and action. This is [...] an important element, for example, in the activities of grassroots organizations like 'GIN' (Global Issues Network), which involves students and teachers in projects that address global issues such as human rights, trade rules, and deforestation. Such student-driven, student-led projects combine both the 'global consciousness' and 'global competence' aspects of GCED.|$|E

2500|$|Regular {{admission}} {{is a good}} choice for students who are unsure where they would like to go. One advantage is that it can help students who have improved their grades substantially in the fall of twelfth grade, since decisions are not made until March of that year. In addition, it offers students more time to make their decision about a college under somewhat less pressure than an early method. The fairly dominant view is that regular {{admission is}} more likely to result in higher offers of financial aid, particularly <b>if</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> admitted to several institutions that present different aid offers. Accordingly, one offer can be used as leverage {{to try to get a}} better offer at another institution, particularly if there are competing multiple acceptances. Several reports suggested that a [...] "growing number of colleges" [...] including Harvard, Cornell, and Carnegie-Mellon have stated publicly that they will consider matching offers from competing colleges.

To apply for TAP, students can visit the financial aid website at FAFSA.gov. To apply students will first need the school name and code. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> working part-time individuals can receive up to $1500, and <b>if</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> working full-time they can receive up to $3,000. <b>If</b> <b>students</b> <b>are</b> in school one must be a full-time student with at least a 2.0 average and taking 12 credits or more.
