500|$|Loev {{was well}} {{received}} in North America; {{it was the}} first Indian film to be screened at the SXSW, with Brooke Corso of The Macguffin stating that the beautiful and heartbreaking film shines when, [...] "it focuses on what is said when the characters aren't speaking, and what is avoided when they do". Matt Shiverdecker of Austin American-Statesman was largely laudatory of the film at the same event as well, dubbing it as a [...] "small miracle". He praised the added realism, unlike the clichéd storybook romance. He attributed the film's success to its actors and the beautiful scenery. Siddhant Adlakha of Birth Movies Death called Loev a [...] "minuscule film of miraculous construction" [...] and [...] "a melancholy tale where questions have no <b>easy</b> <b>answers,</b> [...] but one where bliss, even momentary, feels infinite".|$|E
500|$|Adversely, Bill Gibron, {{writing for}} DVD Verdict, gave Gunslinger a {{negative}} review, writing, [...] "Roger Corman {{was responsible for}} a lot of smoldering cinematic cowflops {{over the course of his}} economically sound career, but Gunslinger has got to be one of the most overripe and ridiculous." [...] While he stated that [...] "Beverly Garland, who plays our dispassionate Rose, and John Ireland, as the cool and callous Cane Myro, are decent enough," [...] he wrote that [...] "there isn't much to recommend in this movie," [...] saying that [...] "there's too much unresolved intrigue, too many <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> to rotten questions, to make heads or tails of what is supposed to matter." [...] TV Guide gave Gunslinger two stars, and said that [...] "it's a strange little Corman film, made before he went wholeheartedly for horror films, and this too has a semi-sense of the strange." [...] Film reviewer Leonard Maltin gave Gunslinger one star and a half.|$|E

500|$|With no {{knowledge}} of the fashion industry, Morgan decided to make a film on the topic after being shocked by the news of the collapse of Rana Plaza. After spending several days getting information, and discovering the industry's human rights violations and [...] "staggering environmental impacts", he was sure he had to make the film. He had also previously had an appreciation for the genre, saying he was [...] "actually fascinated by those [...] films that follow one person". Like Morgan a non-connoisseur of fashion, executive producer and eco activist Lucy Siegle said that she does not like such films as they are usually limited to exploring the aesthetic aspects of the industry. It is The True Cost differential in her opinion; it [...] "goes there and then someit unravels the grim, gritty, global supply chain of fast fashion". Nevertheless, the film purposely does not give viewers a clear answer on how to solve the problems as there are [...] "no straightforward answers". Morgan commented, [...] "I'm probably most proud that we avoided <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> and instead chose to trust people to both feel and think deeply about the issues raised." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named {{it as one}} of his favorite episodes of the series, calling it [...] "not only funny and moving, but incredibly important", both for its religious element and message of tolerance. Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a [...] "smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society". Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer's singing was used to [...] "dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt's behavior", calling it [...] "a textbook example of what music can add to drama." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] "the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season." [...] Perigard appreciated the fact there were no <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions {{during the course of the}} episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in [...] "a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion", and Semigran similarly commended the episode's balance, writing that Falchuk [...] "covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect." [...] In an article discussing Glee increasingly inconsistent tone, characterizations, and weird moments in the second season, film and television critic Matt Zoller Seitz cited [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] as an exception: [...] "an episode built around an earnest, Afterschool Special-style contemplation of faith that improbably turned out to be one of the series' boldest, silliest, maybe finest hours".|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Derbyshire, culture {{editor of}} the New Statesman called it [...] "a {{remarkable}} novel" [...] and its protagonist [...] "a convincing witness to the defining moral catastrophe of the 20th century." [...] Tim Martin of The Telegraph praised the novel for not being just another story about banality of evil: [...] "it is a magnificently artificial project in character construction, a highly literary and provocative {{attempt to create a}} character various enough to match the many discontinuous realities of the apocalyptic Nazi world-view. The result is a sprawling, daring, loose-ended monster of a book, one that justifies its towering subject matter by its persistent and troubling refusal to offer <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> and to make satisfying sense." [...] Writing for The Guardian, British author James Lasdun criticized the novel for [...] "some large flaws" [...] such as its main character, [...] "a ghoul belonging more to the fictional universe of, say, Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho", and provocative use of anachronisms, but called it a [...] "monumental inquiry into evil. To say that it falls short of Melville's visionary originality (and lacks, also, the breadth and vitality of Tolstoy, despite the claims of some reviewers) is hardly a criticism. It's a rare book that even invites such comparisons, and for all its faults, for all its problematic use of history, The Kindly Ones does just that." [...] In The Spectator, British journalist and biographer Patrick Marnham wrote: [...] "Dr Aue cannot be brought to trial because he does not exist; on the other hand, he can give us something even more valuable than vengeance, something that no real war criminal can manage, and that is total honesty." [...] Harvard University's English studies' Professor Leland de la Durantaye wrote that The Kindly Ones [...] "is indeed about cruelty and evil in the way that morality plays are, but it is also about evil in history, the weaving together of hundreds of objectives, millions of people, into an ensemble so vast, diverse, and ever-changing that even a well-placed and sharp-sighted observer cannot fully grasp it." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{review in}} DVD Talk {{concluded}} that Beban's performance {{was able to}} overcome the film's melodramatic premise:"Beppo is a delightful character ... His rage after being robbed was another standout moment. [...] The camera does a very tight closeup, one of the closest I can recall for a film from 1915, and his anger and fear are almost palatable. ... The ending {{of the film is}} also very dramatic and works well, without a false Hollywood happy ending ...

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} cited feminist {{writer of the}} time was Mary Wollstonecraft, often {{characterized}} as the first feminist philosopher. A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) {{is one of the}} first works that can unambiguously be called feminist, although by modern standards her comparison of women to the nobility, the elite of society (coddled, fragile, and in danger of intellectual and moral sloth) may at first seem dated as a feminist argument. Wollstonecraft identified the education and upbringing of women as creating their limited expectations based on a self-image dictated by the typically male perspective. Despite her perceived inconsistencies (Miriam Brody referred to the [...] "Two Wollstonecrafts") reflective of problems that had no <b>easy</b> <b>answers,</b> this book remains a foundation stone of feminist thought.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Bennett {{wrote the}} first of four books with 'In Search of' in their title, In Search of the Sacred: Anthropology and the Study of Religion, in [...] which he called for a {{combination}} of historical, textual and participant observation research to shed light on how religion is lived as well as on its history and official dogmas. [...] He argued that no researcher is neutral and that we all need to engage in reflexivity to guard against bias and the imposition of a priori presuppositions, so that, as a reviewer commented, [...] "suddenly the act of observation becomes the subject of observation" [...] and [...] "for a teacher like Bennett, his own experience as an ordained minister and missionary, his own experience with the give and take of ecumenical teaching becomes the data of religious thought". [...] "Bennett", Dening continued, [...] "is not independent of all the observations made through centuries of thought", so [...] "there is convergence: library and field, intellect and emotion, thought and experience in the end come together". [...] The book, said this reviewer, helped [...] "to make the exposition of {{more than a hundred years}} of thought on the study of religions lucid and memorable". [...] Alan Race, in another review, described the book as cutting [...] "through a dense thicket, yielding a clear, highly readable survey of how" [...] anthropology and Religious Studies [...] "have interacted and failed to interact", although remarking that it mainly discussed European history. Bennett followed this in 1998 with In Search of Muhammad and in 2001 with In Search of Jesus: Insider and Outsider Images. [...] A. G Noorani describes In Search of Muhammad as [...] "an earnest effort by a devout Christian to understand Muhammad, and places" [...] Bennett [...] "in the ranks of others whose services Minou Reeves [...] acknowledges in her survey of Western writing on Muhammad." [...] Commenting on Bennett's discussion of the sources available for the life of Muhammad, Hugh Goddard says that while he is [...] "not as negative" [...] as [...] "some modern Western scholars", neither [...] "is he uncritical of them", suggesting that [...] "some traditions, particularly concerning Muhammad’s miracles and the role of women, should be judged as unreliable." [...] Referring to Bennett's attempt to suggest how [...] "Christ and Muhammad might be viewed as somehow complementary, rather than as rivals" [...] he called this a [...] "brave attempt" [...] even though [...] "there are no <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> to such a significant question." [...] Citations include Gerard Rixhon, who says that he makes [...] "words of Bennett's" [...] his [...] "own [...] "when he wrote his searching book on Muhammad" [...] and aimed [...] "to hear Muslim voices." ...|$|E
