5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into {{groups of three}} or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of the}} 19thcentury they were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|A dolphinarium is an {{aquarium}} for dolphins. The dolphins are usually <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> a large pool, though occasionally {{they may be}} <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> pens in the open sea, either for research or for public performances. Some dolphinariums consist of one pool where dolphins perform for the public, others are part of larger parks, such as marine mammal parks, zoos or theme parks, with other animals and attractions as well.|$|E

5|$|As of 2006, {{there are}} four known {{surviving}} manuscripts containing the fatwa. One of them is an Arabic copy, discovered by Muhammad Abdullah 'Inan in the Vatican in 1951 and <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> the Borgiano collection of the Vatican Library. The other three were translations to Spanish written in the Arabic script (aljamiado). One of them was <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> Aix-en-Provence, France, and one in Madrid, Spain. The third aljamiado translation {{used to be in}} Madrid, but its location is currently unknown.|$|E
5|$|At {{the other}} extreme, {{in the more}} {{developed}} parts of the world, animals are often intensively managed; dairy cows may be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> zero-grazing conditions with all their forage brought to them; beef cattle may be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> high density feedlots; pigs may be housed in climate-controlled buildings and never go outdoors; poultry may be reared in barns and <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> cages as laying birds under lighting-controlled conditions. In between these two extremes are semi-intensive, often family run farms where livestock graze outside {{for much of the}} year, silage or hay is made to cover the times of year when the grass stops growing, and fertiliser, feed and other inputs are bought onto the farm from outside.|$|E
5|$|Harbour {{porpoises}} {{have historically}} been <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> captivity, {{under the assumption that}} they would fare better than their dolphin counterparts due to their shallow-water habitats. Of the 150 harbour porpoises kept worldwide, nearly 100 were <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> Denmark. Nearly half of these died of diseases caught before they were captured, or damage sustained during capture and transit. Almost all died within 14 months. Breeding success has always been poor with porpoises, and there are only six recorded births (of a harbour porpoise and five finless porpoises). Lack of births in captivity is mainly due {{the fact that there were}} few breeding attempts, many were actually <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> isolation and those who were not were often not mature.|$|E

5|$|The museum {{stresses}} that the paintings be <b>kept</b> <b>in</b> good condition by whoever has them.

Additionally, they should be kept away from light and stored in acid-free paper. Hawley also noted to avoid rolling the paintings, which will crack the paint. If these guidelines are not followed, the paintings could be damaged and drop in value. More repainting {{would need to be}} done too, which hurts the paintings' integrity.|$|E
