2500|$|As {{defined by}} Evershed MR in Re Ellenborough Park [...] Ch 131, an {{easement}} requires {{the existence of}} at least two parties.

2500|$|Prescription {{may also}} be used to end an {{existing}} legal easement.

50|$|Peter Gibson LJ {{held that}} L&B could not claim a car parking right for {{additional}} land, because the alleged <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> was not adequately identified. The reason why {{there must be}} a <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> before there can be a grant is because certainty is of prime importance, as said in Ashburn Anstalt v Arnold.|$|E

50|$|An {{easement}} {{can not be}} recognised {{where it}} the <b>dominant</b> and servient <b>tenement</b> are under common ownership. However, rights may be recognised as 'quasi-easements', which can then be implied as full easements upon the {{conveyance of the land}} in question.|$|R
5000|$|The {{range of}} {{easements}} is primarily restricted by a fourfold test {{laid out in}} Re Ellenborough Park. The homeowners around Ellenborough Park wished to show they had an easement over the communal gardens to claim compensation for its requisition in World War II. Lord Evershed MR agreed because (1) they owned the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenements,</b> (2) their rights to the [...] "servient" [...] tenement (i.e. the park) benefited their land (3) they did not own the servient tenement, and, despite some prior authority suggesting easements could not be for pure pleasure, (4) it was within a recognised class of easements. Most often, easements are rights of way. Many recent cases have also involved car parking, including Moncrieff v Jamieson where the owner of land between the shoreline and a steep escarpment only had access through his neighbour's, and he had, from 1973 become used to parking there. The servient tenement owner claimed the car parking took away {{his use of the}} land, and so could not be an easement. But the House of Lords held that in the nature of parking (which was not permanent) to which the dominant owner had become accustomed, the right could count as an easement.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{required}} of a praedial servitude that it benefit {{the owner of the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> in his capacity as owner of the land (rather than merely in his personal capacity).

In determining utilitas, the following factors are considered: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{dominant}} estate is also called a <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement,</b> {{as noted in}} a section of an article on easements.|$|E
50|$|If, in {{the case}} of praedial {{servitude}}s, the <b>dominant</b> and servient <b>tenements</b> are merged, the servitude will be terminated: If the merger was not intended to be permanent, the servitude will revive when the properties are separated again; if the merger was intended to be permanent, the servitude will not revive when the properties are again separated. Praedial servitudes also terminate when the requirements for their constitution can no longer be fulfilled.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{summarizes}} the literature {{relating to the}} decomposition of property into packages of less than full ownership in the United States and United Kingdom. It does not include specialized areas of law such as Oil and Gas Law and Water Law. Ownership of land is commonly divided by geography into parcels, by time into leaseholds and other estates, and by use into <b>dominant</b> and servient <b>tenements.</b> Some of these divisions, such as leaseholds, have received substantial economic attention and developments in the landlord-tenant debate are reviewed here. Other divisions, such as other temporal estates and servitude doctrines, have received only occasional economic analysis.

50|$|Praedial servitudes {{are limited}} real rights {{existing}} only {{in respect of}} land. They are vested in successive owners of one piece of land, called the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement,</b> which derives a benefit from another piece of land, the servient tenement, belonging to someone other than {{the owner of the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b> In other words, praedial servitudes always involve at least two pieces of land, one of which serves the other. They benefit successive owners and are inseparably bound to the land they benefit.|$|E
5000|$|The praedial {{servitude}} must {{benefit the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> itself, {{not just the}} pleasure or caprice of whosoever {{happens to be the}} landowner at a particular time.|$|E
50|$|Personal and praedial servitudes {{are created}} through {{agreement}} between {{the owner of the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> and the owner of the servient tenement. The terms of the agreement will provide for the nature, scope and extent of the servitude; the price to be paid by the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> as a consideration for the grant of the servitude; and the duration of the servitude. A praedial servitude can be granted in perpetuity, or it may exist for a specified period of time or until the fulfilment of a specified condition.|$|E
50|$|The company, Linden Mews Ltd, {{was formed}} by two {{residents}} of the mews to buy a carriageway where the residents of numbers four and five were accustomed to parking their cars. They claimed an easement, and the company claimed trespass and charges for the parking. The company said anything more than disembarking and unloading {{in front of their}} properties would contravene Harris v Flower that a dominant owner could only use a right of way granted for the enjoyment of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> {{for the purposes of the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> and not for other land.|$|E
50|$|Section 1(2) of the Law of Property Act 1925 {{states that}} {{easements}} are an interest {{capable of being}} legal, with S52 of the 1925 Act stating that all conveyances will be void unless created by deed. Therefore, for an express legal easement to be formed rather than simply equitable {{it must have been}} created by deed. A legal easement must be registered against both the dominant and servient tenements, if their titles are registered, in order to take effect. The benefit of legal easements pass automatically on the transfer of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> or part of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{line with}} the rule of {{vicinity}} (vicinitas), the tenements must be close enough {{to each other for}} the servient tenement to be able reasonably to enhance the use and enjoyment of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} an {{equitable}} easement passes with {{the transfer of}} the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b> Whether section 62 of the Law of Property Act 1925 can operate to turn an equitable easement into a legal easement upon conveyance of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> is unclear. On the one hand, it would seem odd that a mere licence could become a legal easement through the section, when the much closer equitable easement could not; on the other hand, construing the section in this way is unnecessary {{from the perspective of the}} purchaser, since a right enforceable in equity will be almost as useful as one enforceable at common law.|$|E
50|$|Next, it must {{be shown}} that the right is {{connected}} with the enjoyment of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> in some way. It is important to this end that the right must benefit an individual in their capacity as a land owner, and not merely form a personal right. For example, it has been judicially stated that a right of way over a plot of land in Northumberland to an estate in Kent would not form the requisite benefit, {{the proximity of the}} two pieces of land being too remote. It was recognised in Re Ellenborough Park however that an easement need not be over an adjacent property, though there must clearly be some reasonable connection in which the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> can be benefitted.|$|E
50|$|As {{defined by}} Evershed MR in Re Ellenborough Park 1956 Ch 131, an {{easement}} requires {{the existence of}} at least two parties. The party gaining the benefit of the easement is the dominant estate (or <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement),</b> while the party granting the benefit or suffering the burden is the servient estate (or servient tenement).|$|E
50|$|I {{think that}} the right claimed goes wholly outside any normal idea of an easement, that is, {{the right of the}} owner or the {{occupier}} of a <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> over a servient tenement. This claim (to which no closely related authority has been referred to me) really amounts to a claim to a joint user of the land by the defendant.|$|E
5000|$|The {{express grant}} {{of a right}} of access had to be {{construed}} {{in the light of}} the circumstances that existed when it was granted in 1973, but it was not necessary for it to be shown that all the rights that were later claimed as necessary for the comfortable use and enjoyment of the servitude were actually in use at that date. It was sufficient that they might be considered to have been in contemplation at the time of the grant, having regard to what the dominant proprietor might reasonably be expected to do in the exercise of his right to convenient and comfortable use of the property, Ewart v Cochrane (1861) 4 Macq. 117 considered. In the particular and unusual circumstances of the instant case, the rights ancillary to the express grant of a right of access in favour of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> included a right to park vehicles on the servient tenement, in so far as that was reasonably incidental to the enjoyment of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{benefit of}} a legal {{easement}} will pass to the next owner of that tenement without express words. This was {{the position of the}} common law and is now reflected in both sections 62 and 187 of the Law of Property Act 1925. If the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> is leased, even if only at equity, the benefit of the legal easement will still pass to the lesee and it will remain an easement at law albeit one enforceable by the lessee in equity only.|$|E
5000|$|Prescription {{may also}} be used to end an {{existing}} legal easement. For example, if a servient tenement (estate) holder were to erect a fence blocking a legally deeded right-of-way easement, the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> holder would have to act to defend their easement rights during the statutory period or the easement might cease to have legal force, even though it would remain a deeded document. Failure to use an easement leading to loss of the easement is sometimes referred to as [...] "non-user." ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{historical}} {{example of}} Solar access is Ancient Lights, a doctrine based on English law {{that refers to}} a negative easement that prevents the owner or occupier of an adjoining structure from building or placing on his own land anything that {{has the effect of}} obstructing the light of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b> In common law, a person's window on his property receiving flow of light that passed through it for so long a time as to constitute immemorial usage in law, the flow of light became an “ancient light” that the law protected from disturbance. The Prescription Act 1832 created a statutory prescription for light. It provided that: ...|$|E
5000|$|It was {{submitted}} for the defendant {{that the right}} to deposit objects on the land of another had been recognised, in the case of Pye v Mumford. Whilst Upjohn J accepted that such a right could form an easement, he noted that the right claimed was wholly uncertain and incapable of enforcement by the courts, due to the variable amount of vehicles and their indeterminate tenure on the plaintiff's land. Additionally, as an easement must be {{for the benefit of the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement,</b> it {{was submitted}} that the use of the plaintiff's land to carry out repairs was merely for the benefit of Mr Greenhalf's business, and did not in any way benefit his own land. The main problem the court found however was the breadth of the right that the defendant was seeking, with Upjohn J stating: ...|$|E
50|$|Where land is registered, as is now common, {{there are}} further {{circumstances}} where an equitable easement will arise. Where both the dominant and servient tenements are registered, easements must be registered against both titles {{under the terms}} of the Land Registration Act 1925. Failure to do so will render them easements in equity only, although they will still bind purchasers under rule 258 of the Land Registration Rules 1925. Where the servient land is unregistered, it is likely that the easement will not have to be registered against the dominant title, even if that is itself registered land. This has been disputed, however, and is significant because if legal would bind successors after first registration whereas an equitable easement would require registration as a land charge. Rule 250(1) allows for easements to arise in equity through prescription where the title is registered, but a right arising through prescription would be created as a legal easement and there seems to be no part of this process where the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> has a right in equity only.|$|E
5000|$|Equitable {{easements}} {{have the}} same basic requirements as easements at law concerning their subject matter. Easements are recognised as arising in equity {{in at least three}} circumstances. The first is where section 1(2)(b) of the Law of Property Act 1925, requiring an easement to be [...] "absolute in possession or a term of years absolute", renders an easement incapable of existing as an interest at law. This includes easements for periods of uncertain duration, such as those ending when a particular event happens (the passing of planning permission over one of the tenements, for example). More controversially this category also includes easements for life, similarly incapable of existing at law. Although the topic has not arisen in the courts since at least 1925, it is difficult to show that as easement for life accommodated the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement,</b> since it is inherently personal in nature. Rights purporting to be easements for life would, if they were rejected as easements, be licences instead and take effect through contract. The second category involves those cases where an specifically enforceable contract to create an easement has taken effect but the easement has not been granted. Here, the regular principles of equity will operate to bring about an easement, since [...] "equity regards as done those things which ought to be done". The third category is where the grantor holds only an equitable interest himself. The most common occasion where this will happen is where an easement is created by operation of a testamentary disposition. Where there is a will, legal title vests in the executors of the estate until transferred to the deceased's personal representatives, but any devised interests operate at equity from the time of disposition.|$|E
50|$|The {{appellant}} (J) appealed {{against a}} decision (2005 1 S.C. 281) that {{a right of}} vehicular access from a public road included a right to park on the servient tenement such vehicles as were reasonably incidental to the enjoyment {{of access to the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b> The respondents (M) owned a property situated between the foot of a steep escarpment and the foreshore. Vehicles could not be driven onto the property. The property once formed part of the lands owned by J and he was the owner of the land between the property and the public road. Since the property had no access to the public road, the rights conveyed by the disposition in 1973 included a right of access from the public road through J's land. The effect of that conveyance was to confer a servitude right of access to the property from the public road for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic; and a right to stop vehicles on the servient tenement in order to turn, load and unload goods from them and set down and pick up passengers was accessory to the right of vehicular access. M claimed that there was also an accessory right to park vehicles on the servient tenement. The sheriff granted declarator that M were entitled to park vehicles on the servient tenement in the exercise of rights accessory to the servitude right of access and pronounced permanent interdict against J. The Court of Session dismissed an appeal. J submitted that it was not possible in the law of Scotland for there to be a servitude of parking; a permanent interdict was unnecessary and its terms were too uncertain to enable J to know what was prohibited by it.|$|E
40|$|The Law on Fundamentals of Property Relations, prescribes the {{possibility}} of raising two lawsuits to protect the easement. The lawsuit for the establishment, {{the owner of the}} <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> may demand that according to the owner of the servient tenement, establish the existence of easements. In another case, the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> which unreasonably prevents or obstruct easement with lawsuit to demand termination of acts which prevents or disturbed, while performing easement. In addition to the petitory protection, the right holder of easements, has the right to the protection of possession, and obligation lawsuits for damages caused by the actions of the owner of the servient tenement or any third persons, and lawsuit for enforcement of obligations under the contractual relationship of the establishment of easement. The subject of this work is the protection of real easement confessoria lawsuits as follows: Lawsuit to establish easement, actio confessoria publiciana and actio negatoria confessoria...|$|E
40|$|LL. M. Chapter 1 {{investigates the}} {{requirement}} of praedia utilitas. The continuing existence of this requirement is considered desirable and therefore the broad interpretation thereof by van Oven and others is rejected. Their approach involves a disregard of the benefit requirement. Attention is drawn {{to the fact that}} in South African law (unlike Roman law), not only is the natural condition of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> taken into account, but also its arrangement. in deciding whether the benefit requirement is complied with. Several criteria for the benefit requirement (from common law, Dutch and South African authors and cases) are discussed. The conclusion is reached that no decisive criterium has yet been found nor is it probable that one will be found. The different criteria have to be weighed up against each other. One has to accept that economic, social and historical considerations, apart from these criteria. can play a part in the decision whether or not an alleged praedial servitude satisfies the benefit requirement. Some of these are briefly discussed. In a supplement Dutch cases on {{the requirement of}} praedia utilitas are discussed. Chapter 2 investigates the requirement of perpetua causa. Three different aspects of this requirement are considered. Some authors deduct from the first part of D 8 2 28 the principle that the possibility of exercising a praedial servitude may not be dependent on an act by the owner or user of the servient tenement. This aspect of the requirement is rejected as there is almost no authority for it in South African law and because it is undesirable in terms of legal policy. The second aspect of the requirement demands the eternal capability of the servient tenement to provide a benefit to the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement,</b> whilst the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> must have a corresponding eternal need in this regard. Different author's views on the relationship between this aspect of the requirement of perpetua causa and the requirement of praedia utilitas, are discussed. The confusion of others concerning the difference between a causa perpetua and a causa continuam is indicated. It is pointed out that the requirement of perpetua causa is not properly founded in common law. In Roman law a causa perpetua was only required for servitudes concerning water, which had to be aqua viva to satisfy this requirement. In South African law aqua viva is not required and therefore the requirement of perpetua causa became obsolete. The position in modern Dutch law is researched. On grounds of legal policy the perpetua causa-requirement is considered undesirable, as it constitutes an arbitrary restriction on socially beneficial real burdens. The abolishment of the requirement will be in accordance with the recent attempts by South African jurists to adopt a more social definition of the concept of ownership. The third aspect of the requirement (that a praedial servitude may not be constituted under a resolutive condition or period fixture), has been abolished long ago. Chapter 3 investigates the requirement of vicinitas. The view is taken that a great distance between the dominant and servient tenements is not per se in conflict with this requirement. The requirement is seen merely as a manifestation of the utilitas-requirement with regard to the distance between the tenements. Support for this viewpoint is found in common law, modern Dutch, English and South African law. The dominant and servient tenements may be any distance apart, provided the servient tenement can properly benefit the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement.</b> According to D 8 3 7 1, de a 1 i ng with rura 1 servitudes, an intermediate tenement must be subject to an appropriate servitude. The validity of this rule in common law, modern Dutch and South African law is investigated. The position of the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> who has the competence to use the intermediate tenement precario, is discussed with reference to English and Dutch cases. The conclusion is reached, on authority and grounds of policy, that the rule in Q 8 3 7 1 should not be followed in South African law. The existence of a praedial servitude is admissible if the servitude, having regard to the factual situation, will probably benefit the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement,</b> notwithstanding the presence of any unburdened intermediate tenements...|$|E
40|$|Easement means, a right {{enjoyed by}} the owner of land over the lands of another: such as rights of way, right of light, rights of support, rights to a flow of air or water etc. The <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> is the land owned by the {{possessor}} of the easement, and the servient tenement is the land over which the right is enjoyed. An easement must exist for the accommodation and better enjoyment {{to which it is}} annexed, otherwise it may amount to mere licence. An easement benefits and binds the land itself and therefore countinious despite any change of ownership of either dominant or servient tenement, although it will be extinguished if the two tenemants come into common ownership. An easement can only be enjoyed in respect of land. This means two parcels of land. First there must be a 'dominant tenement' and a 'servient tenement'. <b>Dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> to which the benefit of the easement attaches, and another (servient tenement) which bears the burden of the easement. A positive easement consist of a right to do something on the land of another; a negative easement restrict the use of owner of the serviant tenement may make of his land. An easement may be on land or on the house made on land. The next classification is on easement on the ground, and the other one under the ground. An easement shall be done in accordance with the principle of restrictions. This means that the less burden the servient tenement. When there is doubt about the extent of the actual easement shall take what easier the servient tenement. The new needs of the dominant estate does not result in the expansion of servitude.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent {{decisions}} have highlighted {{the question of whether}} a common law abandonment of easements can occur in respect of Torrens title land in circumstances where the title to the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> makes express reference to the easement. Though not having to resolve this question, as abandonment was in fact found not to occur, the courts pondered the difficult question of whether abandonment can be permitted, and perhaps more critically, whether it was only the acts of the current registered proprietor that could be taken into account, or whether the conduct and intent of previous owners should also be considered. The argument that will be made that common law abandonment should not be permitted, and if it is (by legislative direction), then only the conduct and intent of the current registered proprietor [* 2] should be considered. Support for this reasoning will be found in an examination of what the goals of Torrens are, as well as consideration of economics, both neoclassical and behavioural...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} an {{interest}} 2 ̆ 2 running 2 ̆ 2 with particular realty is employed in connection with assignments of easements and profits to develop rules which are reasonably clear and free from dispute in most situations. The burden, on the servient land passes with such land to all takers thereof. In theory {{this end of the}} easement or profit runs with the servient tenement itself, rather than merely with an estate therein, and hence is binding upon even adverse possessors of the freehold. The benefit of an easement appurtenant to some <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> passes freely therewith even without separate mention. The benefit of a profit appurtenant passes in similar fashion. The only limitation is that the servient land must not be 2 ̆ 2 surcharged, 2 ̆ 2 or unduly burdened, by certain transfers as described below. s The benefit of a profit in gross is freely assignable from one person to another, subject only to the rule that where assigned to more than one the new takers must 2 ̆ 2 work together with one stock 2 ̆ 2 that is, in common as one person.

40|$|The {{interesting}} recent Queensland Supreme Court case Weigal v Toman has reopened {{the debate}} about the fundamental nature of an easement and in particular the status of easements providing for storage or the parking of vehicles. Case law differs in relation to whether these types of easements could be considered to satisfy the accepted Re Ellenborough Park indicia to be included within the category of valid easements. Case law suggests that easements that grant overly extensive rights to the owner of the <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> take the easement beyond what is contemplated by an easement but authority differs as to where to draw that line. This article will discuss this unresolved controversy and seek to parse out the underlying principles behind this debate. It is suggested that conservatism derived from the numerus clausus principle has stymied acknowledgement of these types of easements. Rather than revealing some grant drawing upon issues of practicality and convenience that has tended to create inconsistency in judicial approaches to this issue. Although this may provide a just result in particular circumstances it does not assist the process of development of clear legal principle. This article will argue for a less stringent application of the numerus clausus principle that allows the creation of valid easements for parking and storage subject to criteria that acknowledge the fundamental nature of easements. This conclusion is bolstered by some recent and significant authorities that confirm this is the direction the law is taking...|$|E
40|$|One {{explanation}} for the poor development {{of the law of}} servitude in Sri Lanka is that it is based on Roman and Roman-Dutch law which are stagnant systems and hence contributes to the Sri Lankan law of servitude being a fossil law.   The aim {{of this study is to}} examine whether the law of servitudes is truly a law which cannot be developed according to the needs of the society and, if so, whether the reason for this is that this area is mainly governed by the principles of Roman and Roman-Dutch law. This question was explored by researching the way this area of law has been developed in two other similar jurisdictions: Scotland and South Africa.   The similarities between these systems are that these jurisdictions are mixed legal systems and that the law of property and especially the law of servitudes have been substantially influenced by and mainly governed by Roman and Roman-Dutch law principles of the law of servitudes adopted in the courts and supplemented by the legislature of these jurisdictions.   Aspects such as: the importance of the requirement that there must be a <b>dominant</b> <b>tenement</b> for the creation of servitudes; the applicability of the principle of numerus clausus in recognising new kinds of servitudes in selected systems; and the acquisition of a servitude by prescription, were selected to narrow down and focus the research. My conclusion is that neither the area of law pertaining to servitudes nor the Roman and Roman-Dutch principles on servitudes are fossil areas or systems.   The difference between the three systems consists basically in the way in which the principle and the sources are used by the law-makers in the specific country.   They can either breathe life into a dead system or make a dead system alive by the way they handle issues in their judgements.   Finally, suggestions were made of the areas which may be rejuvenated and proposals are provided for what needs to be done.
