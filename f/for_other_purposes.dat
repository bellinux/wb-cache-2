5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for {{water supply and sanitation}} (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715. A certain percentage of these resources was dedicated exclusively for water supply and sanitation. They mainly go to small municipalities that show low income levels. Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply and sanitation <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
5|$|After renovation, {{owing to}} du Maurier's sponsorship, the {{facility}} {{was named the}} Stanley Theatre du Maurier Stage, {{taken over by the}} Arts Club Theatre Company and later became their main stage. This venue has allowed the Arts Club to put on new kinds of shows, such as large musicals, classics and productions from around the world. The first production was Swing!, which opened on October 28, 1998 and had a successful run, followed by Hamlet. In addition to showing Arts Club productions, the theatre is rented out <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes,</b> including business and educational presentations, and has been used for comedy acts and concerts, such as Lorne Elliott, Francis Cabrel, and RyanDan.|$|E

5|$|Quarrying in Giffnock {{continued}} until 1912 when, due to flooding {{and the high}} cost of extracting stone, work ceased. Numerous ventures tried to revitalise the quarries <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes,</b> including the cultivation of mushrooms in the tunnels. As the pits began to fill with water, it became an issue that needed to be resolved. In the early 1930s, William Bearmore & Co began tipping slag from the production of steel into the Giffnock quarries. The slag tipping {{continued until}} 1969, when Derek Crouch Limited began scrap metal extraction, which lasted until the late 1970s. Today the ground is a wasteland.|$|E

5|$|Spiders are chelicerates, which {{differ from}} other {{arthropods}} {{in that the}} usual body segments are fused into only two tagmata, the cephalothorax and abdomen. Jumping spiders have a distinctive rectangular carapace. All spiders' abdomens bear appendages that have been modified into spinnerets that extrude silk from up to six types of silk glands within their abdomen. The cephalothorax and abdomen are joined by a small, cylindrical pedicel, which allows the abdomen to move while spinning silk. While most jumping spiders do not build webs to catch prey, they use silk <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes,</b> including moulting and laying eggs.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Armoured Brigade was {{established}} in February 1943 {{as part of a}} reorganisation of the Australian Army's armoured units. As there was no longer any threat of Japanese forces invading Australia, the 2nd Armoured Division was disbanded to free up manpower <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes.</b> However, it was decided to retain the headquarters of that division's 6th Armoured Brigade to command armoured units that were intended to take part in offensive operations in New Guinea and other locations in the South West Pacific. This specialised formation was designated the 4th Armoured Brigade. The need for armoured support of infantry forces had been demonstrated by the Army's experiences in the New Guinea Campaign during 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The chapel was {{dedicated}} to Our Lady of Sorrows (also called the Madonna di Pietà or Mater Dolorosa).

An ornate fountain is located at the building's main courtyard, above which is a niche with a statue and above it an elaborate sculpture of the coat-of-arms of Pinto. Similar to the fountain of the first Castellania on site, it was supplied by water from the aqueduct.|$|E

5|$|The last {{stretch of}} Hebden Beck {{before it reaches}} the River Wharfe was used to power a corn mill in the Middle Ages, and corn milling survived {{into the middle of}} the 19th century. In the 14th century Fountains Abbey had a fulling mill in the village. In 1791 a three-storey cotton mill was built {{alongside}} the corn mill. It housed 54 spinning frames and was productive until 1870 when it was driven out of business by the more efficient stream-driven machinery of the industrial revolution. At its peak, the mill employed more than 70 men, women, and children. The building was used <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes</b> including a roller skating rink until it was demolished in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Although {{found to}} be {{reliable}} and accurate, the M249 was considered to present unacceptable hazards {{in the form of}} an exposed hot barrel and sharp edges. There were complaints that the front sight required special adjustment tools. On August 23, 1985, then-U.S. Under Secretary of the Army James R. Ambrose suspended M249 production pending the development of the product improvement program (PIP) intended to fix these problems. Congress deleted funds for the M249 from the Fiscal Year 1986 defense budget, then retroactively set aside the program's prior year's funds from the M249 program <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes,</b> including retirement and pay raises. Over 1,100 M249s already issued were to remain in use, but be retrofitted with the PIP kit when it became available. Over 7,000 remaining M249s were to stay in storage at depots until corrective changes could be made. The PIP kit was eventually developed and implemented, and production of the M249 resumed. In 1994 the M249 squad automatic weapon was re-designated the M249 light machine gun.|$|E

She anchored in the mouth of {{the southern end of the}} canal on 29 December and remained in that area until mid-January 1915, when she proceeded northward up the canal. On 3–4 February, she and the armed merchant cruiser Himalaya supported ground troops against an Ottoman attack on the canal in the vicinity of El Kubri. Later on the 3rd, after the Ottoman attack at El Kubri had been defeated, Ocean was sent to Deversoir to provide artillery support to the garrison there, but Ottoman attacks were insignificant.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{bricks and}} {{brickwork}} were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Fort Zeelandia {{was built on}} a small island off Tainan in Formosa (Taiwan) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony. It was built using bricks from Batavia (Jakarta), where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters. After a siege in 1662, the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga, a Ming dynasty general. The fort was destroyed by an explosion in 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse. The masonry was later used <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes.</b> All that remains {{is part of the}} southern wall.|$|E
5|$|In the 16th century, St Thomas-a-Watering on Old Kent Road was a {{place where}} {{religious}} dissenters and those found guilty of treason were publicly hanged. The road was rural in nature and several coaching inns were built alongside it. In the 19th century it acquired the name Old Kent Road and several industrial premises were set up to close to the Surrey Canal and a major business, the Metropolitan Gas Works was developed. In the 20th century, older property was demolished for redevelopment and Burgess Park was created. The Old Kent Road Baths opened around 1905 had Turkish and Russian bath facilities. In the 21st century, several retail parks and premises typical of out-of-town development have been built beside it while public houses have been redeveloped <b>for</b> <b>other</b> <b>purposes.</b>|$|E
