5|$|Two {{populations of}} pallid {{sturgeon}} in the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers of Montana are both {{at risk of}} extinction, and current projections are that wild pallid sturgeon populations <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> will be extinct by 2018. Though a vigorous stocking effort was implemented in 1996, until pallid sturgeon females reach reproductive maturity sometime after they are 15years of age, recovery efforts <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> will not be readily measurable. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation has been conducting spring pulse water releases from the Tiber Dam every four to fiveyears to try to recreate a semblance of an annual spring flood to restore and rejuvenate downstream floodplains. These pulse releases are done {{in an effort to}} restore suitable habitat for numerous fish species.|$|E
5|$|After the US Army stopped alcohol {{trading with}} the Blackfeet Nation <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> in 1869, traders John J. Healy and Alfred B.

5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed {{the presence of}} a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta. Based on two parts of a skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History, G. latidens is also known from bonebed material. Horner, who described the specimens, considered it to be a less derived species.|$|E
5|$|Marshall died {{of heart}} failure {{at the age of}} 38 in 1939. Twenty-five years later, {{partly as a result of}} his efforts, The Wilderness Society helped gain passage of the Wilderness Act. The Act was passed by Congress in 1964 and legally defined {{wilderness}} areas of the United States and protected some nine million acres (36,000km2) of federal land. Today, Marshall is considered largely responsible for the wilderness preservation movement. Several areas and landmarks, including The Bob Marshall Wilderness <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> and Mount Marshall in the Adirondacks, have been named in his honor.|$|E

5|$|Steep and {{strewn with}} rapids, the Kootenay, despite being {{unsuitable}} for commercial transportation of agricultural and mineral products, {{is considered an}} outstanding whitewater river.

5|$|There {{is limited}} {{evidence}} for extinction of amphibians at the K–Pg boundary. A study of fossil vertebrates across the K–Pg boundary <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> concluded that no species of amphibian became extinct. Yet {{there are several}} species of Maastrichtian amphibian, not included {{as part of this}} study, which are unknown from the Paleocene. These include the frog Theatonius lancensis and the albanerpetontid Albanerpeton galaktion; therefore, some amphibians do seem to have become extinct at the boundary. The relatively low levels of extinction seen among amphibians probably reflect the low extinction rates seen in freshwater animals.|$|E

Its altitudinal range runs from sea level up to , spanning a wide variety of vegetational zones. The range includes isolated endemic populations in Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz, California. The distribution reconnects in northeastern Sierra Nevada running continuously along the Pacific Coast to Juneau, Alaska, with populations dotted along the Taku and Stikine River valleys. From the Pacific coast, the range extends longitudinally to the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> and Alberta.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's {{decision}} to discontinue the NP trains caused consternation <b>in</b> <b>Montana.</b> Mike Mansfield (D-Montana), then Senate Majority Leader, {{pointed out that}} the Empire Builder bypassed Montana's major population centers, and had no difficulty in making his displeasure felt. The new company reacted to the pressure and announced a resumption of service over the ex-Northern Pacific, to begin on June 14. This service took the form of an unnamed section of the Empire Builder running separately between Minneapolis and Spokane, Washington. Mansfield's intervention earned the train the nickname “Mike Mansfield Limited”. The Northern Pacific route, which included the Yellowstone River, Homestake Pass and Bitterroot Mountains, was praised for its scenery. Amtrak considered the route one of the company's six most beautiful. The train also provided a convenient connection to Yellowstone National Park at Livingston, Montana.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown, {{assistant}} {{curator of}} the American Museum of Natural History, found the first partial skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex in eastern Wyoming in 1900. H. F. Osborn originally named this skeleton Dynamosaurus imperiosus in a paper in 1905. Brown found another partial skeleton in the Hell Creek Formation <b>in</b> <b>Montana</b> in 1902. Osborn used this holotype to describe Tyrannosaurus rex in the same paper in which D. imperiosus was described. In 1906, Osborn recognized the two as synonyms, and acted as first revisor by selecting Tyrannosaurus as the valid name. The original Dynamosaurus material resides in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London.|$|E
