2500|$|Although harshly {{condemned}} by critics who decried {{its lack of}} conventional finish, Manet's work had admirers from the beginning. One was Ã‰mile Zola, who wrote in 1867: [...] "We are not accustomed to seeing such simple and direct translations of reality. Then, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> is such a surprisingly elegant awkwardness ... it is a truly charming experience to contemplate this luminous and serious painting which interprets nature with a gentle brutality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-night," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>There</b> came {{a little}} pause. [...] "Good-night, Margaret," [...] I repeated, and walked very {{deliberately}} {{and with a}} kind of sham preoccupation to the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{few minutes}} since you asked whether {{we had not}} heard from Graham during our absence, and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were two letters for papa on business; this was true, but I did not tell you all." ...|$|E
60|$|EMMY. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>theres</b> a lady {{bothering me}} to see the doctor. That isnt asking. Its telling.|$|R
60|$|Than hers, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> is {{in history}} no sadder story.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> was {{something}} to my mind very fine about this, even though it might show some want of proper balance.|$|R
6000|$|... 6. In church matters Herbert, Newcastle, and I are {{the most}} {{conservative}} and the most church-like; with a sympathy from Argyll. But, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> is no struggle here: patronage, the sore subject, not being a cabinet affair.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen," [...] said Bukta. [...] "Short paces. No {{need for}} a second shot, Sahib. He bleeds cleanly where he lies, and we need not spoil the skin. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> would be no need of these, but they came--in case." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You did, eh?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>There</b> seemed {{nothing more}} to say; I didn't know what sort of {{struggle}} he meant, or who fought who; and personally sandstone or soapstone or any other stone is {{all the same to}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Man, it's a crevasse,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> for <b>there</b> were {{no words}} to {{describe}} the magnitude of it. 'An' young Bannister's sayin' it's {{no more than a}} superfeecial flaw!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 134. Still, as <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> is {{no reason}} why sculpture, even for {{simplest}} persons, should confine itself to imagery of fish, or fowl, or four-footed things.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{would you}} like to board with me? As <b>I</b> have <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> is lots of room, and you have just eaten a sample meal. We do not live in style-- but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did {{not want}} to begin a long {{conversation}} and find myself stranded. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no mistake. I pointed to my twenty mark piece, and repeated for the third time that I wanted a cushion, 'a twenty mark cushion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fifteen," [...] said Bukta. [...] "Short paces. No {{need for}} a second shot, Sahib. He bleeds cleanly where he lies, and we need not spoil the skin. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> would be no need of these, but they came - in case." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, because, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> lies, as wrapt up in a mantle, much of {{the glory}} of our gospel matters in this temple which Solomon builded; {{therefore}} I have made, as well as I could, by comparing spiritual things with spiritual, this book upon this subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed I was. But <b>I</b> <b>said</b> 'might.' <b>There</b> is the Grand Duke and the Marquis, you know. Yes; no calling {{could be}} too humble were the man what I would wish him to be." ...|$|R
2500|$|On September 9, 2015, Clinton apologized {{during an}} ABC News {{interview}} {{for using the}} private server, saying she was [...] "sorry for that." [...] Appearing on NBC's Meet the Press on September 27, 2015, Clinton defended her use of the private email server while she was secretary of state, comparing the investigations to Republican-led probes of her husband's presidential administration {{more than two decades}} ago, saying, [...] "It is like a drip, drip, drip. And that's why <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there's</b> only so much that I can control".|$|R
60|$|So Ahab had {{committed}} a horrible and great sin, and had received sentence for it, and now, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>there</b> {{was nothing to}} be done but to repent; and he did so, after his fashion.|$|R
6000|$|Last May, a braw wooer cam doun the lang glen, [...] And sair wi' {{his love}} he did deave me; [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> was naething I hated like men-- [...] The deuce gae wi'm, to believe me, believe me; [...] The deuce gae wi'm to believe me.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{house is}} good enough,--an old-fashioned manor-house, with high brick chimneys, and brick gables, tiled all over, and large square windows set in stone. The house is good enough, only it {{stands in the}} middle of a farm-yard. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> were no trees, but there is an avenue." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{thought that}} the {{lightning}} and the black darkness had frightened her; so <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was no danger, but she must wait till the storm blew over. She answered: [...] "It is not THAT! It is not THAT! I want to go home! O take me away from here!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I couldna be sure,' <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> 'but <b>there</b> was an airm-chair at gaed to Tibbie Birse. If {{it was the}} ane ye mean, it a' gaed to bits, an' I {{think they}} burned it. It was gey dune.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, my friend, for a moment. If you had so thought, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> was a mode {{of escape}} without {{falsehood}} or disgrace. In saying so I must have seemed to urge you {{to break away from}} Nina Balatka." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay, lad, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> not <b>there</b> {{was such}} haste; did I, {{mistress}} housewife?"--(she snorted); [...] "only that thou art a well-grown lusty fellow, and 'tis time thou wentest forth. For thee, Ambrose, thou wottest I made thee a fair offer {{of bed and}} board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not mine, not mine!" [...] I cried, {{throwing}} out my arms; and {{though that was}} all <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> was such a ring in my choking voice that she rose stiffly from her seat and stood tense and tall confronting me, almost eye to eye, reproof in every line of her.|$|E
6000|$|The long scar turned deeper purple than ever. 'Only {{so far as}} that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> {{still be}} rights I had no power to resign,' said Berenger. 'And {{then he began to}} prove to me---what I had no mind to hear' (and his voice trembled) '---all that I know but too well.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he requested, [...] "if {{you meet}} with strong opposition, {{come to me}} before you decide on any course, and I'll see what can be arranged. I dare say there'll be some trouble, but I know the trustees--and, as <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>there</b> are people who must be saved all needless pain, at any cost." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>I</b> went <b>there</b> to consult--allowing for {{the sake}} of {{argument}} that he was in any wise concerned in the matter. He grew insolent then, and ended by saying he had wanted me for three days past to copy a report on bomb-shells, egg-shells, clamshells, and I don't know what all, connected with conchology, and nobody had been able to find me.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are outrageous, Ferg," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Surely <b>there</b> {{is none of}} this 'graft' as {{you call}} it, in a perfect and {{harmonious}} matrimonial union!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} {{travelled}} through it," [...] Jeanne answered; [...] "but I {{am afraid that}} you did not understand what I meant just now. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> were very few people with whom I cared to talk. You are not one of those few, Monsieur le Comte." ...|$|R
60|$|Ay. Old Father Thames {{is a good}} {{landscape}} gardener, as <b>I</b> <b>said.</b> <b>There</b> is Basildon--and Hurley--and Pangbourne, {{with its}} roaring lasher. Father Thames has {{had to work hard}} for many an age before he could cut this trench right through the chalk, and drain the water out of the flat vale behind us. But I suspect the sea helped him somewhat, or perhaps a great deal, just where we are now.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I made {{a remark}} {{a little while}} ago,' said Daniel Doyce then, 'which I am {{inclined}} to think was an incorrect one. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> was nothing to detain you here, Clennam, half an hour longer. Am I mistaken in supposing that you would rather not leave here till to-morrow morning? Do I know, without being very wise, where {{you would like to}} go, direct from these walls and from this room?' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>there</b> {{was nothing}} I longed {{for more than}} to see any city but Berlin, and should be delighted {{to be free of}} the odious {{military}} service. Indeed, I thought, from his splendour of appearance, the knickknacks about the room, the gilded carriage in the remise, that my uncle was a man of vast property; and that he would purchase a dozen, nay, a whole regiment of substitutes, in order to restore me to freedom.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is no more}} tacking or box-hauling to be done tonight. We {{have barely}} room to pass out of the shoals on this course; {{and if we can}} weather the 'Devil's Grip,' we clear their {{outermost}} point--but if not, as <b>I</b> <b>said</b> before, <b>there</b> is but an alternative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} this {{statement}} {{to be shown}} to Dr. John Easterling of Stranraer. He heard on one occasion this haunting sound. My sad experience may show him that I spoke truth when <b>I</b> <b>said</b> that <b>there</b> was much knowledge in the world which has never {{found its way to}} England.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you ladies may have found at European firesides," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "but <b>there</b> can be very little doubt what you have left there." ...|$|R
