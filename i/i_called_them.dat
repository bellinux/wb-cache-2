Firstly, {{it refers to}} the fact that all the songs on the album were written after her move to England, while the songs on Debut were songs she had written during the {{previous}} ten years of her life in Iceland. In a 1996 interview, Björk said: [...] "I always knew it would be two albums and that's why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> Debut and Post. Before and after". Secondly, the title was inspired by the singer's desire to communicate with friends and family back in Iceland, giving Post the additional meaning of [...] "mail". Talking with Raw in 1996, Björk stated: [...] "I called the record Post, because I always address my songs back in my head to Iceland in a letter. Because it was such a big jump for me to move away from all my relatives, all my friends, everything I know".|$|E

I want to state publicly and unequivocally that I am in {{sympathy with the}} IRA - indeed sympathy is too weak a word ... I cannot join them {{in the fight for}} freedom of my country, but the very least I can do is speak up for them when they are being slandered and vilified by unscrupulously vicious propaganda. The oppressors of Irish freedom call the IRA terrorists and murderers, but <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> by their proper titles; <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> freedom fighters, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> heroes; and <b>I</b> venerate their dead as martyrs for Ireland." ...|$|R

6000|$|Theologians <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them.</b> Philologians {{would be}} a better word,--lovers of the [Greek: *Logos*], or Word, by which the heavens and earth were made. What logos, about this Logos, have they learned, or can they teach? ...|$|E
6000|$|As I re-entered {{the dining-room}} I saw Jacobus cast down his eyes. I banged the {{plate on the}} table. At this {{demonstration}} of ill- humour he murmured something in an apologetic tone, and I turned on him viciously {{as if he were}} accountable to me for these [...] "abominable eccentricities," [...] I believe <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I {{never tell}} you of my little gods? I so often emerged triumphant from my troubles, and so undeservedly, that I thought I was {{especially}} looked after by certain tricky spirits {{in return for}} the entertainment I gave them. My little gods, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them,</b> and we had quite a bowing acquaintance. But you see at the critical moment they flew away laughing." ...|$|E

60|$|Then he made {{signs to}} us that he would procure some buffaloes, or young bulls, as <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them,</b> to carry things for us, and made signs, too, {{that if we were}} weary, we might be carried too; but that we slighted, only were willing to have the creatures, because, at last, when they could serve us no farther for carriage, we might eat them all up if we had any {{occasion}} for them.|$|E

60|$|I {{clung to}} {{the thought of the}} telephone. It gave me the quiet {{satisfaction}} of the gambler who holds the unforeseen ace. The situation was in my hands. The police, I knew, had been profoundly stirred by Mr MacGinnis's previous raid. When <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> up, as I proposed to do directly the door had closed on the ambassadors, there would be no lack of response. It would not again be a case of Inspector Bones and Constable Johnson to the rescue. A great cloud of willing helpers would swoop to our help.|$|E

60|$|My sureties being ready, <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> in, {{and when}} the bond for my {{appearance}} was made, he told them, that they was bound {{to keep me from}} preaching; and that if I did preach, their bonds would be forfeited. To which I answered, that then I should break them; for I should not leave speaking the Word of God: even to counsel, comfort, exhort, and teach the people among whom I came; and I thought this to be a work that had no hurt in it: but was rather worthy of commendation, than blame.|$|E
60|$|Then I {{prepared}} myself within, putting {{myself in}} a posture of defence; I loaded all my cannon, as <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them,</b> that is to say, my muskets, which were mounted upon my new fortification, and all my pistols, and resolved to defend myself to the last gasp; not forgetting seriously to recommend myself to the divine protection, and earnestly to pray to God to deliver {{me out of the}} hands of the barbarians; and in this posture I continued about two hours, but began to be mighty impatient for intelligence abroad, for I had no spies to send out.|$|E
6000|$|Of course I {{took charge}} of the two young women, and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> [...] "my dear," [...] and they never minded, knowing that {{whatever}} I said was said in a fatherly and protecting spirit. I gave them their places on each side of me at dinner, Mrs. Atherfield on my right and Miss Coleshaw on my left; and I directed the unmarried lady to serve out the breakfast, and the married lady to serve out the tea. Likewise I said to my black steward in their presence, [...] "Tom Snow, these two ladies are equally the mistresses of this house, and do you obey their orders equally;" [...] at which Tom laughed, and they all laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Miss Headworth, 'they are {{the fruits}} of yesterday's expedition. My two children, as <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them,</b> brought them home in triumph. I cannot tell you what {{pleasure}} Lord Kirkaldy's kindness gave them--and many more.' ...|$|R

60|$|It {{had been}} some time already {{that we had been}} used to tread barefooted upon the rocks, the gravel, the grass, and the sand on the shore; but as we found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or {{travelling}} on the dry burning sands, within the country, so we provided ourselves with a sort of shoes, made of the skins of wild beasts, with the hair inward, and being dried in the sun, the outsides were thick and hard, and would last a great while. In short, as <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them,</b> so I think the term very proper still, we made us gloves for our feet, and we found them very convenient and very comfortable.|$|E
60|$|We lay here {{till the}} 16th of February, without any news of our travellers, as <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them.</b> All the hopes we had was, that five of our men asking my leave to travel, swore {{to me they}} would go quite up to the Andes but they would find them; nay, {{they would go to}} the Spanish gentleman himself, if they did not hear of them; and obliged me to stay twenty days for them, and no longer. This I readily promised, and giving them {{everything}} they asked, and two Peruvian sheep to carry their ammunition, with two dozen of rockets for signals, a speaking trumpet, and a good perspective glass, away they went; and from them we had yet heard no news, so that was our present hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all. I {{speak in}} all seriousness. You {{still believe in}} {{equality}}, and yet you {{do the work of}} the corporations, and the corporations, from day to day, are busily engaged in burying equality. And you call me a socialist because I deny equality, because I affirm just what you live up to. The Republicans are foes to equality, though most of them fight the battle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on their lips. In the name of equality they destroy equality. That was why <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> stupid. As for myself, I am an individualist. I believe the race is to the swift, the battle to the strong. Such is the lesson I have learned from biology, or at least think I have learned. As I said, I am an individualist, and individualism is the hereditary and eternal foe of socialism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{it comes}} speech, also. Several saints come, {{attended}} by myriads of angels, and they speak to me; I hear their voices, but others do not. They are very dear to memy Voices; {{that is what}} <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> to myself." ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--The {{boys have}} multiplied {{themselves}} by fifty daily, and {{have seemed to}} appear in hosts (especially in the hottest days) round all the corners at Gad's Hill. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> the prowlers, and each has a distinguishing name attached, derived from his style of prowling.|$|R

6000|$|... "Our navy had {{suddenly}} and mysteriously disappeared! Also, as suddenly and as mysteriously, the railway and telegraph and telephone service ceased, the men all deserted, poles were cut down, the Church laid a ban upon the electric light! I {{had to be}} up and doing--and straight off. Your life was safe--nobody in these kingdoms but Merlin would venture to touch such a magician as you without ten thousand men at his back--I had nothing to think of but how to put preparations in the best trim against your coming. I felt safe myself--nobody would be anxious to touch a pet of yours. So this is what I did. From our various works I selected all the men--boys I mean--whose faithfulness under whatsoever pressure I could swear to, and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> together secretly and gave them their instructions. There are fifty-two of them; none younger than fourteen, and none above seventeen years old." ...|$|E
6000|$|If, {{as might}} happen, any other wayfarer was early abroad, I could conceal {{myself in the}} tussocks of grass and bushes that bordered the path. In my thick veil, with my stout green parasol and {{inconspicuous}} shawl, I made a queer and surprising figure no doubt. Indeed, from what I have heard, the ill fame of Wanderslore acquired a still more piquant flavour in the town by reports that elf-folk had been descried on its outskirts. But if I sometimes skipped and capered in these early outings, it was for exercise as well as suppressed high spirits. To be prepared, too, for the want of such facilities in the future, I {{had the foresight to}} accustom myself to Mrs Bowater's steep steps as well as to my cemented-in [...] "Bateses," [...] as <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them.</b> My only difficulty was to decide whether to practice on them when I was fresh at the outset of my walk, or fatigued at the end of it. Naturally people grow [...] "peculiar" [...] when much alone: self plays with self, and the mimicry fades.|$|E

Your wife is greatly better, vastly better; and though she is in bad hands, displays a very different aptitude. She is a woman of affairs; you are—dear boy, you are yourself. I bid you back to your amusements; like a smiling dominie, I give you holidays for life. Yes,’ he continued, ‘there is a day appointed for all when they shall turn again upon their own philosophy. I had grown to disbelieve impartially in all; and if in the atlas of the sciences there were two charts I disbelieved in more than all the rest, they were politics and morals. I had a sneaking kindness for your vices; as they were negative, they flattered my philosophy; and <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>them</b> almost virtues. Well, Otto, I was wrong; I have forsworn my sceptical philosophy; and I perceive your faults to be unpardonable. You are unfit to be a Prince, unfit to be a husband. And I give you my word, I would rather see a man capably doing evil than blundering about good.’ ...|$|E
