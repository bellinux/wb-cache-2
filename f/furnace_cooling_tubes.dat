40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{residual}} mechanical properties of OPC and OPC/slag concretes, exposed to either 400 or 800 ºC followed by <b>furnace</b> or water <b>cooling.</b> The heat transfer from surface to {{centre of the}} specimens maintained similar trend for all blends for both 400 and 800 ºC. After 400 ºC, OPC and OPC/slag water cooled specimens presented a further 20 % loss in the residual strength when compared with <b>furnace</b> <b>cooled</b> specimens. This additional strength decrease of 20 % is possibly due to thermal stresses caused by the thermal shock of the concrete with water at 20 ºC. After 800 ºC, all OPC/slag water cooled specimens presented further strength loss of 5 % when compared with <b>furnace</b> <b>cooled</b> specimens. However, water cooled OPC specimens presented strength loss of 14 % when compared with <b>furnace</b> <b>cooled</b> specimens, and therefore, thermal stresses cannot solely {{be the cause of}} this strength loss.

The microstructure and texture are assessed (before and after annealing followed by <b>furnace</b> <b>cooling)</b> and linked to the compression behaviour and shape memory response. It is shown that SLM strongly orients the fine austenite subgrains towards the building direction. This texture induces the highest spring back along the building (vertical) direction and the lowest along the horizontal direction after compression. The compressive stiffness, on the other hand, is the highest along horizontal direction and the lowest in vertical direction. The internal stresses due to SLM processing are another factor that may induce large martensite plates, decreasing the spring back. Although post-annealing (followed by <b>furnace</b> <b>cooling)</b> annihilates these large SLM stress induced martensite plates, it is unsuccessful to achieve completely isotropic properties.

To better predict {{the effectiveness of the}} LCG and determine possible modifications to improve performance, computer simulations dealing with the interaction of the cooling garment with the human body have been run using the Wissler Human Model.
