25|$|The Monroe Epic {{programmable}} calculator {{came on the}} market in 1967. A large, printing, <b>desk-top</b> unit, with an attached floor-standing logic tower, it could be programmed to perform many computer-like functions. However, the only branch instruction was an implied unconditional branch (GOTO) {{at the end of the}} operation stack, returning the program to its starting instruction. Thus, it was not possible to include any conditional branch (IF-THEN-ELSE) logic. During this era, the absence of the conditional branch was sometimes used to distinguish a {{programmable calculator}} from a computer.|$|E
500|$|Early skyscrapers {{were mainly}} {{made up of}} small office cubicles, {{commonly}} only [...] across, which were placed adjacent to one another along long corridors, following a pattern first invented in the Oriel Chambers building in England in 1864. This allowed the average small company to rent {{a small amount of}} space using one or two offices, but held out the option for future expansion by renting additional office cubicles if required at a later date. A skyscraper office relied on natural sunlight from the windows but if necessary was dimly lit from electric <b>desk-top</b> lamps. By the standards of the day, these offices were very modern, with radiators, air vents, and the latest fixtures and fittings, and modern communication systems, including telephone and pneumatic tubes were often installed. As a result, many businesses chose to move out of their older, low-rise offices in Chicago to take up tenancy in the new skyscrapers, which were felt to be more convenient and healthier.|$|E

50|$|A height-adjustable desk or sit-stand desk can be {{adjusted}} to both sitting and standing positions; this is purported to be healthier than the sit-only desk. Sitting for {{extended periods of time}} has been linked to detrimental health effects. Other options for sit-stand desks include smaller, <b>desk-top</b> models that can be placed on, or removed from an existing desk to switch between sitting and standing.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Robot Chemist, marketed in 1959, was a desk-sized {{instrument that}} appeared to be too large for general acceptance. Thus, a much smaller, <b>desk-top</b> unit was designed in 1958-1962 and first marketed in 1963. This latter instrument contained the first precipitation-filtration unit ever sold commercially in order to provide protein-free blood for analysis of blood components that could not be analyzed in the presence of proteins.|$|E
50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{its life}} the number of people working on the paper declined. Being <b>Desk-Top</b> {{published}} the need for so many people to produce it, {{as was the case in}} the early days, was no longer there. However, the lack of new blood coming in meant that enthusiasm dwindled. By Issue 125 there were only three people working on it and, eventually, it quietly died.|$|E
50|$|This {{involved}} the locomotives being stripped to the bare chassis and remanufactured {{from the ground}} up, the only equipment retained being the bogies, main frames and fuel tanks. The original Alco 12-251C engines and AEI generators were replaced with fully overhauled GE 7FDL-12 engines and alternators. New cabs with <b>desk-top</b> controls and improved collision protection and bodies that retained a dual-cab configuration were fitted. The JLs have since resumed their original numbers with two sold to Southern Shorthaul Railroad.|$|E

50|$|A more {{comprehensive}} picture of fineness {{is given by}} particle size analysis, yielding {{a measure of the}} amount of each size range present, from sub-micrometer upwards. This used to be mainly a research tool, but with the advent of cheap, industrialized laser-diffraction analyzers, its use for routine control is becoming more frequent. This may {{take the form of a}} <b>desk-top</b> analyzer fed with automatically gathered samples in a robotized laboratory, or, increasingly commonly, instruments attached directly to the output ducts of the mill. In either case, the results can be fed directly into the mill control system, allowing complete automation of fineness control.|$|E
50|$|From a {{customer}} perspective, IP telephony uses a high-bandwidth Internet connection and specialized {{customer premises equipment}} to transmit telephone calls via the Internet, or any modern private data network. The customer equipment may be an analog telephone adapter (ATA) which interfaces a conventional analog telephone to the IP networking equipment, {{or it may be}} an IP Phone that has the networking and interface technology built into the <b>desk-top</b> set and provides the traditional, familiar parts of a telephone, the handset, the dial or keypad, and a ringer in a package that usually resembles a standard telephone set.|$|E
5000|$|In {{recent years}} {{there seems to}} be a renewed {{interest}} in xBase, mostly because of a number of open source, portable, xBase implementations (listed below), and the scripting applicability of the language. While newer <b>desk-top</b> database tools are optimized for mouse usage, xBase has always been [...] "keyboard friendly", which helps make scripting and meta-programming (automating the automation) easier. Meta-programming generally does not work as well with mouse-oriented techniques because automating mouse movements can require calculating and processing of screen coordinates, something most developers find tedious and difficult to debug. xBase is one of the few table-oriented scripting languages still available.|$|E
5000|$|The 401x series {{consisted}} of a large monitor {{sitting on top of}} a wheeled cart. The cart held most of the electronics in a vertical case at the back. This could be opened from the front to access the various switches and jumpers, as well as providing access to the expansion cards. Inside the cart, expansion cards were connected using the [...] "Minibus" [...] system, using a 36-pin card connector with an 8-bit data bus. In addition to the communications card and various enhancements, the <b>Desk-Top</b> Mounting Kit allowed the CRT to be placed on a desk while the cart was connected to it using a cable up to [...] away.|$|E
5000|$|The Trimline handset was {{produced}} in both rotary dial and Touch-Tone versions. Rotary dial Trimline production began in late 1965 and Touch Tone dials were added the following year in mid-1966. The Trimline base was available in <b>desk-top</b> and wall-mount versions. The handsets and bases were interchangeable. The Trimline was the first US telephone to achieve some design recognition in Europe, where it {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Manhattan" [...] model or the [...] "Gondola". Today, similarly designed telephones are sold by many companies. AT&T retained the Trimline name for the later [...] "Trimline III", a more compact successor featuring squared corners and straight lines.|$|E
50|$|MapInfo Corporation, {{initially}} incorporated as Navigational Technologies Incorporated, developed {{location intelligence}} software. The company, was headquartered in North Greenbush, New York. It was acquired on April 19, 2007 by Pitney Bowes, and on January 28, 2009, {{the name of}} the division it had become was changed to Pitney Bowes Business Insight. From inception, MapInfo had grown quickly, appearing at number 23 in Inc. Magazine's annual list of the 500 fastest-growing private companies in the U.S. in 1992, and holding an initial public offering (IPO) in 1994. Its products included a <b>desk-top</b> mapping application, various map and demographic data products, and some web-based applications. It acquired several other companies in order to market their software, data, or services directly.|$|E
50|$|An {{open frame}} monitor {{provides}} the LCD monitor and enough supporting structure to hold associated electronics and to minimally support the LCD. Provision {{will be made}} for attaching the unit to some external structure for support and protection. Open frame LCDs are intended to be built into some other piece of equipment. An arcade video game {{would be a good}} example with the display mounted inside the cabinet. There is usually an open frame display inside all end-use displays with the end-use display simply providing an attractive protective enclosure. Some rack mount LCD manufacturers will purchase <b>desk-top</b> displays, take them apart, and discard the outer plastic parts, keeping the inner open-frame LCD for inclusion into their product.|$|E
50|$|Dr Andrews {{concluded}} that the EirGrid EIS is particularly remiss in failing to locate, identify and assess mine workings. The failure to recognise and assess the potential for collapse of old mine workings was a major and fundamental omission. The failure almost certainly stems {{from a lack of}} understanding of such issues, a failure to examine the sites in the field, and a total lack of site investigation of any form whatsoever other than a <b>desk-top</b> study. The absence of any form of appropriate assessment is total folly and is clearly unacceptable. Dr Andrew told the inspectors that permitting the project could not be granted until such on site assessment and study had been completed to an acceptable professional standard.|$|E
50|$|However, {{physicians}} are embracing mobile {{technologies such as}} smartphones and tablets at a rapid pace. According to a 2012 survey by Physicians Practice, 62.6 percent of respondents (1,369 physicians, practice managers, and other healthcare providers) say they use mobile devices {{in the performance of}} their job. Mobile devices are increasingly able to sync up with electronic health record systems thus allowing physicians to access patient records from remote locations. Most devices are extensions of <b>desk-top</b> EHR systems, using a variety of software to communicate and access files remotely. The advantages of instant access to patient records at any time and any place are clear, but bring a host of security concerns. As mobile systems become more prevalent, practices will need comprehensive policies that govern security measures and patient privacy regulations.|$|E
50|$|Petersburg High School {{opened the}} current Johnson Road {{location}} on September 3, 1974. The campus style {{architecture of the}} facility was divided into four wings by architect Gordon B. Galusha. The William W. Lawson, Jr. Gymnasium, which extends east of the main building, was named after the title winning basketball coach, the late William H. Lawson, Jr. It has one full-sized basketball court and seats approximately 3,000 fans comfortably. The auditorium {{is located in the}} main building and seats 924 with 532 plush red-cushioned seats located in the orchestra. Seating {{in the rear of the}} auditorium includes <b>desk-top</b> seats. The band and choral rooms include built in risers and an individual sound studio for instrumental music students. The cafeteria, adjacent to the auditorium, is centrally located to provide easy access by all wings.|$|E
50|$|The 202 telephone, {{like the}} 102, {{consisted}} of two distinct parts. The <b>desk-top</b> set, containing only the dial and a cradle that secured a handset, which combined the receiver and the transmitter elements in one unit, in the on-hook position. The cradle contained a plunger that operated the hookswitch located underneath the cradle, inside the housing. The second part was a physically separate subscriber set (desk set box), in form of a metal or Bakelite box, which contained the ringer and the electrical components to interface the desk set with the telephone network. The desk set {{was connected to the}} subscriber set with a four-conductor mounting cord. The subscriber set was typically mounted either on the wall in close proximity, or to the rear or underneath a desk.|$|E

50|$|Its {{operation}} {{was made possible}} by the arrival of inexpensive photolithography that permitted printing without typesetting. Before the arrival of <b>Desk-Top</b> Publishing it was typed, with the typewritten sections pasted up onto master sheets using Cow Gum, with headlines in Letraset. The first 66 issues were in A4, but from issue 67 the Voice changed to A3 newsprint and from Issue 72 to A2 newsprint. It was first printed by Voice personnel on a small press owned {{by a member of the}} collective and then at a squat in Islington, North London but printing was quickly moved back to Brighton. In the early days doing the printing yourself was part of the philosophy of those involved. Bankruptcy of the printer and a subsequent suspicious fire meant that printing had to be moved back to London on two occasions, to be printed by another alternative paper, the Islington Gutter Press. Later, to accommodate the new format, it was printed in Bristol.|$|E
5000|$|Donald Liebenson of the Chicago Tribune {{described}} Nickmans next release, Planetary Traveler, as [...] "boldly {{going where}} no computer animation video has gone before." [...] At {{a time when}} computer animation (CGI) was created solely on dedicated computer graphics work stations, Planetary Traveler became the first original, full-length program ever created entirely on standard <b>desk-top</b> computers. The seminal work {{was the result of}} a two-year collaboration by Nickman with seven artists from five different states via the internet. Former Tangerine Dream member Paul Haslinger composed the music score. As a result, Nickman was invited to give the Keynote Address at the MacWorld Conference in Düsseldorf, Germany, in November 1997. The sequel to Planetary Traveler is entitled Infinitys Child and was released by Sacred Earth Pictures in 2009. Two of Nickmans most recent films, Echoes of Creation and Sacred Earth began airing on Public Television nationwide in 2015. Both films are true to his signature fusing of picture to music and were specifically designed as a way for viewers to connect emotionally with the beauty of our planet, rather than intellectualize it through a discussion about it. Using music as the narrative, Echoes of Creation is a 40-minute journey through Alaska, the Pacific Northwest and as far south as California, featuring a soundtrack by Grammy nominated composer David Arkenstone and spoken word by Karen Hutton. Its prequel Sacred Earth also follows Nickmans unique fusion of picture to music throughout the American Southwest, featuring music by Grammy-nominated composer David Lanz and spoken word by Academy Award-winning actor Linda Hunt and in the finale features a dance performance by Caroline Richardson, former First Soloist with the National Ballet of Canada.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} our initial {{efforts to make}} SPHINX, the CMU continuous speech recognition system, environmentally robust. Our work has two major goals: to enable SPHINX to adapt to changes in microphone and acoustical environment, and to improve the performance of SPHINX when it is trained and tested using a <b>desk-top</b> microphone. This talk will describe some of our work in acoustical pre-processing techniques, specifically spectral normalization and spectral subtraction performed using an efficient pair of algorithms that operate primarily in the cepstral domain. The effects of these signal processing algorithms on the recognition accuracy of the Sphinx speech recognition system was compared using speech simultaneously recorded from two types of microphones: the standard close-talking Sennheiser HMD 224 microphone and the <b>desk-top</b> Crown PZM 6 fs microphone. A naturallyelicited alphanumeric speech database was used. In initial results using the stereo alphanumeric database, we found that both the spectral subtraction and spectral normalization algorithms were able to provide very substantial improvements in recognition accuracy when the system was trained on the close-talking microphone and tested on the <b>desk-top</b> microphone, or vice versa. Improving the recognition accuracy of the system when trained and tested on the <b>desk-top</b> microphone remains a difficult problem requinng more sophisticated noise suppression techniques...|$|E
