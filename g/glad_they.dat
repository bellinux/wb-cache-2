With Steve Finley already entrenched as Houston's centerfielder, and aged 26 years, Lofton was traded during the off-season to the Cleveland Indians for catcher Eddie Taubensee and right-handed pitcher Willie Blair.

500|$|... "In Dahomey" [...] – This was {{cut from}} the score after the 1946 Broadway {{production}} {{and has not been}} revived since due to its being potentially offensive, as well as unnecessary to the plot.

They chant in a supposed African language before breaking into modern English, singing about how <b>glad</b> <b>they</b> are to return to their apartments after the day's performance.

The band thought they had enough material for a release, but when the label told them to keep writing, Levine wrote this song in frustration at the pressure. [...] "That song comes sheerly from wanting to throw something. It was the 11th hour, and the label wanted more songs. It was the last crack. I was just pissed. I {{wanted to make a}} record and the label was applying a lot of pressure, but I'm <b>glad</b> <b>they</b> did." ...|$|E

The magnitude of the challenge ahead of them was made clear a few weeks later, on the night of May 18, 1959, when the seven astronauts gathered at Cape Canaveral to watch their first rocket launch, of an SM-65D Atlas, which was similar to the one that was to carry them into orbit.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Your Sinclair rated the game within the top fifth of their top 100 ZX Spectrum games. The {{magazine}} said that Underwurlde {{was the most}} simultaneously loved and hated game of its era—though Sabreman's invulnerability to direct damage was novel, the Your Sinclair also recalled the game's [...] "stratospheric level of frustration". Their readers, however, ranked the game {{near the bottom of}} their top 100 games for the platform. Underwurlde was later included in the 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation Rare Replay, wherein critics rated it among the worst of the 30 titles by Ultimate Play the Game and its successor, Rare. Kyle Hilliard (Game Informer) wrote that Ultimate's early games, such as Underwurlde, fared the worst in the package, though he was <b>glad</b> <b>they</b> were included. [...] "By today's standards," [...] began New Zealand newspaper The Nelson Mail, [...] "the likes of ... Underwurlde are so clunky and archaic that they are almost laughably impenetrable; strange relics from a bygone era that serve only to illustrate how far the industry has progressed." ...|$|E

[...] The finale scene of the episode is a parody of the ending from the 1977 movie [...] According to Thiessen, the joke was an [...] "afterthought"; originally, there was going to be a more elaborate ending, but due to time constraints, a new finale was created. During the animation stage, one of the directors noted that the scene was [...] "kind of like the ending to A New Hope" [...] and so, the decision was made to create [...] "scene for scene" [...] parody of the original.|$|E

The identities of the seven were announced at a press conference at Dolley Madison House in Washington, D.C., on April 9, 1959: Scott Carpenter, Gordon Cooper, Glenn, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Alan Shepard, and Deke Slayton. Glenn, wrote Tom Wolfe, [...] "came out of it as tops among seven very fair-haired boys. He had the hottest record as a pilot, he was the most quotable, the most photogenic, and the lone Marine."

500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, I think that was the first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm <b>glad</b> <b>they</b> thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E
500|$|The next morning, flight day five, Young and Duke ate {{breakfast and}} began {{preparations}} for the first extra-vehicular activity (EVA), or moonwalk. After the pair donned and pressurized their space suits and depressurized the Lunar Module cabin, Young climbed out onto the [...] "porch" [...] of the LM, a small platform above the ladder. Duke handed Young a jettison bag full of trash to dispose of on the surface. Young then lowered the equipment transfer bag (ETB), containing equipment for use during the EVA, to the surface. Young descended the ladder and, upon setting foot on the lunar surface, became the ninth human {{to walk on the}} Moon. Upon stepping onto the surface, Young expressed his sentiments about being there: [...] "There you are: Mysterious and Unknown Descartes. Highland plains. Apollo 16 is gonna change your image. I'm sure <b>glad</b> <b>they</b> got ol' Brer Rabbit, here, back in the briar patch where he belongs." [...] Duke soon descended the ladder and joined Young on the surface, becoming the tenth and youngest human to walk on the Moon, at age 36. After setting foot on the lunar surface, Duke expressed his excitement, commenting: [...] "Fantastic! Oh, that first foot on the lunar surface is super, Tony!" [...] The pair's first task of the moonwalk was to unload the Lunar Roving Vehicle, the Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph (UVC), and other equipment, from the Lunar Module. This was done without problems. On first driving the lunar rover, Young discovered that the rear steering was not working. He alerted Mission Control to the problem before setting up the television camera and planting the flag of the United States with Duke. The day's next task was to deploy the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP); while they were parking the lunar rover, on which the TV camera was mounted, to observe the deployment, the rear steering began functioning without explanation. While deploying a heat-flow experiment (that had burned up with the Lunar Module Aquarius on Apollo 13 and had been attempted with limited success on Apollo 15), a cable was inadvertently snapped after getting caught around Young's foot. After ALSEP deployment, they collected samples in the vicinity. About four hours after the beginning of EVA-1, they mounted the lunar rover and drove to the first geologic stop, Plum Crater, a [...] crater on the rim of Flag crater, about [...] across. There, at a distance of [...] from the LM, they sampled material from the vicinity of Flag Crater, which scientists believed penetrated through the upper regolith layer to the underlying Cayley Formation. It was there that Duke retrieved, at the request of Mission Control, the largest rock returned by an Apollo mission, a breccia nicknamed Big Muley after mission geology principal investigator William R. Muehlberger. The next stop of the day was Buster Crater, about [...] from the LM. There, Duke took pictures of Stone Mountain and South Ray Crater while Young deployed a magnetic field experiment. At that point, scientists began to reconsider their pre-mission hypothesis that Descartes had been the setting of ancient volcanic activity, as the two astronauts had yet to find any volcanic material. Following their stop at Buster, Young did a demonstration drive of the lunar rover while Duke filmed with a 16 mm movie camera. After completing more tasks at the ALSEP, they returned to the LM to close out the moonwalk. They reentered the LM 7 hours, 6 minutes, and 56 seconds after the start of the EVA. Once inside, they pressurized the LM cabin, went through a half-hour briefing with scientists in Mission Control, and configured the cabin for the sleep period.|$|E

However, they never divorced, and Bonnie was wearing Thornton's wedding ring when she died. Thornton was still in prison when he heard of her death.

His portrayal of Morrison was praised and members of The Doors noted that Kilmer did such a convincing job that they had trouble distinguishing his voice from Morrison's. Paul Rothchild played Kilmer's version of [...] "The End" [...] for the band's guitarist, Robby Krieger, who told him, [...] "I'm really <b>glad</b> <b>they</b> got 'The End'.
