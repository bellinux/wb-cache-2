5|$|The Los Alamos Laboratory was {{reinforced}} by a British Mission under James Chadwick. The first to arrive were Otto Frisch and Ernest Titterton; later arrivals included Niels Bohr and his son Aage Bohr, and Sir Geoffrey Taylor, an expert on hydrodynamics who made a major contribution {{to the understanding of}} the Rayleigh–Taylor instability. This instability at the interface between two fluids of different densities occurs when the lighter fluid <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> heavier, and was vital to the interpretation of experiments with explosives, predicting the effects of an explosion, the design of the neutron initiators, and the design of the atomic bomb itself. Chadwick remained only for a few months; he was succeeded as head of the British Mission by Rudolf Peierls. The original idea, favored by Groves, was that the British scientists would work as a group under Chadwick, who would farm out work to them. This was soon discarded in favor of having the British Mission fully integrated into the laboratory. They worked in most of its divisions, only being excluded from plutonium chemistry and metallurgy. With the passage of the Atomic Energy Act of 1946, known as the McMahon Act, all British government employees had to leave. All had left by the end of 1946, except for Titterton, who was granted a special dispensation, and remained until 12 April 1947. The British Mission ended when he departed.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, The Coup {{released}} Party Music {{to widespread}} praise. However, {{in part because}} of distribution problems, sales of the album were low. The original album cover art depicted group members Pam the Funkstress and Riley {{standing in front of the}} twin towers of the World Trade Center as they are destroyed by huge explosions, and Riley <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> button on a guitar tuner. The cover art was finished in June 2001 and the album was scheduled to be released in mid-September. However, in response to the uncanny similarity of the artwork with the September 11, 2001, attacks, the album release was delayed until November of that year with the cover featuring a hand with a flaming martini glass.|$|E

500|$|Starting around 16 Ma in Miocene {{time and}} {{continuing}} into the present, {{a large part}} of the North American Plate in the region has been under extension by literally being pulled apart. Debate still surrounds the cause of this crustal stretching, but an increasingly popular idea among geologists called the slab gap hypothesis states that the spreading zone of the subducted Farallon Plate <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> continent apart. Whatever the cause, the result has been the creation of a large and still-growing region of relatively thin crust; the region grew an average of [...] per year initially and then slowed to [...] per year in the last 5 million years.

2500|$|Upon his return, Reavis visited New York {{to renew}} his acquaintances with various {{political}} and business leaders. [...] Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements. [...] James Broadhead, who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, followed his examination [...] by proclaiming, [...] "The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Hurd who have pronounced it good. [...] I have {{associated with them}} in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs. [...] Mr. J. Addison Reavis is the gentleman who <b>is</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>the</b> claim and his is a man of remarkable energy and persistence." [...] Roscoe Conkling in turn stated [...] "I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find they all go to show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee." [...] In addition to the endorsement, Conkling introduced Reavis to Robert G. Ingersoll. [...] Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.|$|E
