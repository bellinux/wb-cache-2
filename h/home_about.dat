5|$|Due to {{internal}} conflicts, the band broke up in 2005. Three years later, the band reunited {{to support the}} tenth anniversary re-release of Something to Write <b>Home</b> <b>About,</b> and soon afterward entered the studio to write new material. In early 2010, the band released Simple Science, their first release in six years, followed in 2011 by the full-length There Are Rules.|$|E
5|$|The reunion {{show was}} officially {{announced}} on Friday, November 14, {{along with the}} official confirmation of the album re-release and a 2009 national tour. The tenth anniversary edition of the album includes a code to download bonus demo tracks from the original recording of Something To Write <b>Home</b> <b>About</b> from the Vagrant Records website, and a DVD containing a band retrospective and other content, including archive footage, and their live performance from March 13, 2009 at Liberty Hall in Lawrence. The show took place Sunday, November 16, 2008 at the record bar in Kansas City. The band played their album Something To Write <b>Home</b> <b>About</b> from beginning to end, {{as well as a}} six song encore.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Red Letter Day, Dewees became a {{full-time}} member as the band began recording their second studio album in Los Angeles in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, Vagrant Records co-owner John Cohen borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund {{the production of the}} album. On September 21, 1999, the band released Something to Write <b>Home</b> <b>About</b> on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles. Something to Write <b>Home</b> <b>About</b> has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre. Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top indie labels in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release. Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's DIY ethic.|$|E

5|$|In late August and September 2008, while Dewees was touring with Reggie and the Full Effect, {{he began}} making hints that The Get Up Kids would be reuniting {{to commemorate the}} tenth anniversary of the band's second album Something to Write <b>Home</b> <b>About.</b> The reunion was finally {{confirmed}} by a post on the official music blog of The Kansas City Star, confirming rumors that the band would be playing a surprise reunion show at The Record Bar in Kansas City on November 16, 2008. According to the article, the band had made the decision over the summer and had Dewees intentionally leak the information to gauge fan interest.|$|E
5|$|Jane's {{reported}} in 2002 that Iraqi intelligence had found classified documents in his <b>home</b> <b>about</b> a U.S. attack on Iraq.

5|$|Union forces hastily {{attempted}} {{to destroy the}} vital salt works. They destroyed about {{one third of the}} boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds. They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad. But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells. General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him. Carpenter's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there. Within three months, the saltworks were back in full production. Carpenter later wrote a long letter <b>home</b> <b>about</b> this battle and how his men responded.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned <b>home</b> <b>about</b> 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
