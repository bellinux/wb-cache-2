25|$|A <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> can be {{used for}} the direct {{analysis}} of cells expressing one or more specific proteins. Cells are immunostained in solution using methods similar to those used for immunofluorescence, and then analysed by flow cytometry.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{collecting}} data from samples using the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> is termed 'acquisition'. Acquisition is mediated {{by a computer}} physically connected to the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer,</b> and the software which handles the digital interface with the cytometer. The software is capable of adjusting parameters (e.g., voltage, compensation) for the sample being tested, and also assists in displaying initial sample information while acquiring sample data to ensure that parameters are set correctly. Early flow cytometers were, in general, experimental devices, but technological advances have enabled widespread applications {{for use in a}} variety of both clinical and research purposes. Due to these developments, a considerable market for instrumentation, analysis software, as well as the reagents used in acquisition such as fluorescently labeled antibodies has developed.|$|E
25|$|Flow cytometry {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{sophisticated}} and expensive method for cell counting. In a <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> the cells flow in a narrow stream in front of a laser beam. The beam hits them one by one, and a light detector picks up the light that is reflected from the cells.|$|E
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> {{have many}} other abilities, such as {{analyzing}} {{the shape of}} cells and their internal and external structures, as well as measuring the amount of specific proteins and other biochemicals in the cells. Therefore, <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> are rarely purchased {{for the sole purpose}} of counting cells.|$|R
25|$|<b>Flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> operate by hydrodynamically {{focusing}} suspended cells so {{that they}} separate from each other within a fluid stream.|$|R
50|$|Hydrodynamic {{focusing}} is {{a technique}} used to provide more accurate results from <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> or Coulter counters for determining the size of bacteria or cells.|$|R
25|$|In bio{{technology}}, {{flow cytometry}} is a laser- or impedance-based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, cell sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, by suspending cells {{in a stream}} of fluid and passing them through an electronic detection apparatus. A <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second.|$|E
25|$|Flow cytometry {{has several}} {{advantages}} over IHC including: {{the ability to}} define distinct cell populations by their size and granularity; the capacity to gate out dead cells; improved sensitivity; and multi-colour analysis to measure several antigens simultaneously. However, flow cytometry can be less effective at detecting extremely rare cell populations, {{and there is a}} loss of architectural relationships {{in the absence of a}} tissue section. Flow cytometry also has a high capital cost associated with the purchase of a <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The plots {{are often}} made on {{logarithmic}} scales. Because different fluorescent dyes' emission spectra overlap, signals at the detectors {{have to be}} compensated electronically as well as computationally. Data accumulated using the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> can be analyzed using software, e.g., JMP (statistical software), WinMDI, Flowing Software, and web-based Cytobank (all [...] ), Cellcion, , FlowJo, FACSDiva, CytoPaint (aka Paint-A-Gate), VenturiOne, CellQuest Pro, Infinicyt or Cytospec. Once the data is collected, {{there is no need}} to stay connected to the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> and analysis is most often performed on a separate computer. This is especially necessary in core facilities where usage of these machines is in high demand.|$|E
50|$|Uses: Immunological {{methods are}} gaining wider use as more {{advanced}} <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> are utilized for clinical testing. Patient specific assays are still generally only used in research protocols.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} {{name of the}} fluorescence-based {{flow cytometry}} technology was [...] "pulse cytophotometry" [...] (German: Impulszytophotometrie), based on the first patent application on fluorescence-based flow cytometry. At the 5th American Engineering Foundation Conference on Automated Cytology in Pensacola (Florida) in 1976 - eight years after {{the introduction of the}} first fluorescence-based <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> (1968) [...] - it was agreed to commonly use the name [...] "flow cytometry", a term that quickly became popular.|$|E
2500|$|Flow cytometry is {{routinely}} {{used in the}} diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers, but has many other applications in basic research, clinical practice and clinical trials. A common variation involves linking the analytical capability of the <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> to a sorting device, to physically separate and thereby purify particles of interest based on their optical properties. [...] Such a process is called cell sorting, and the instrument is commonly termed a [...] "cell sorter".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} {{to the ability to}} label and identify individual cells via fluorescent antibodies, cellular products such as cytokines, proteins, and other factors may also be measured as well. [...] Similar to ELISA sandwich assays, cytometric bead array (CBA) assays use multiple bead populations typically differentiated by size and different levels of fluorescence intensity to distinguish multiple analytes in a single assay. [...] The amount of the analyte captured is detected via a biotinylated antibody against a secondary epitope of the protein, followed by a streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin treatment. The fluorescent intensity of R-phycoerythrin on the beads is quantified on a <b>flow</b> <b>cytometer</b> equipped with a 488nm excitation source. [...] Concentrations of a protein of interest in the samples can be obtained by comparing the fluorescent signals to those of a standard curve generated from a serial dilution of a known concentration of the analyte. Commonly also referred to as cytokine bead array (CBA).|$|E
2500|$|The first impedance-based {{flow cytometry}} device, using the Coulter principle, was {{disclosed}} in U.S. Patent 2,656,508, issued in 1953, to Wallace H. Coulter. Mack Fulwyler was {{the inventor of}} the forerunner to today's flow cytometers - particularly the cell sorter. Fulwyler developed this in 1965 with his publication in Science. [...] The first fluorescence-based flow cytometry device (ICP 11) was developed in 1968 by Wolfgang Göhde from the University of Münster, filed for patent on 18 December 1968 and first commercialized in 1968/69 by German developer and manufacturer Partec through Phywe AG in Göttingen. At that time, absorption methods were still widely favored by other scientists over fluorescence methods. Soon after, flow cytometry instruments were developed, including the Cytofluorograph (1971) from Bio/Physics Systems Inc. (later: Ortho Diagnostics), the PAS 8000 (1973) from Partec, the first FACS (Fluorescence-activated cell sorting) instrument from Becton Dickinson (1974), the ICP 22 (1975) from Partec/Phywe and the Epics from Coulter (1977/78).

40|$|Flow cytometry {{specializes in}} high‐content {{measurements}} of cells and particles in suspension. Having long excelled in analytical throughput of single cells and particles, only recently {{with the advent}} of HyperCyt sampling technology, flow cytometry's multiexperiment throughput has begun to approach the point of practicality for efficiently analyzing hundreds‐of‐thousands of samples, the realm of high‐throughput screening (HTS). To extend performance and automation compatibility, we built a HyperCyt‐linked Cluster Cytometer platform, a network of <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> for analyzing samples displayed in high‐density, 1, 536 ‐well plate format. To assess the performance, we used cell‐ and microsphere‐based HTS assays that had been well characterized in the previous studies. Experiments addressed important technical issues: challenges of small wells (assay volumes 10 μL or less, reagent mixing, cell and particle suspension), detecting and correcting for differences in performance of individual <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers,</b> and the ability to reanalyze a plate in the event of problems encountered during the primary analysis. Boosting sample throughput an additional fourfold, this platform is uniquely positioned to synergize with expanding suspension array and cell barcoding technologies in which as many as 100 experiments are performed in a single well or sample. As high‐performance <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> shrink in cost and size, cluster cytometry promises to become a practical, productive approach for HTS, and other large‐scale investigations of biological complexity. © 2012 International Society for Advancement of Cytometr...|$|R
5000|$|While most <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> do {{not have}} {{sufficient}} sensitivity, {{there are a few}} commercially available <b>flow</b> <b>cytometers</b> {{that can be used for}} virus quantification. A virus counter quantifies the number of intact virus particles in a sample using fluorescence to detect colocalized proteins and nucleic acids. Samples are stained with two dyes, one specific for proteins and one specific for nucleic acids, and analyzed as they flow through a laser beam. The quantity of particles producing simultaneous events on each of the two distinct fluorescence channels is determined, along with the measured sample flow rate, to calculate a concentration of virus particles (vp/mL). [...] The results are generally similar in absolute quantity to a TEM result. The assay has a linear working range of 105-109 vp/mL and an analysis time of ~10 min with a short sample preparation time.|$|R
