40|$|At {{the core}} of the GCP {{architecture}} is a scientific domain model, which is heavily parameterized with GCP-indexed ontology terms. The GCP-indexed ontology reuses established international standards where available, converts other publicly available controlled vocabularies into formally managed ontology, and develops novel ontology if no public vocabularies yet exist. General and crop-specific GCP ontologies are being developed by crop teams involving GCP and <b>external</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> &#x 2013; in particular, for crop-specific ontology relating to plant anatomy, developmental stage, trait and phenotype for selected GCP crops. Crop ontologies are being developed for chickpea, maize, Musa, potato, rice, sorghum and wheat. The Bioversity crop descriptor lists already loaded into OBO format files provide the primary structure to develop the crop ontologies. Then, terms to be mapped to the ontologies are extracted from the crop databases where trait values have been stored by crop scientists. These sources allow the ontology teams to identify the most commonly used concept names and their interrelations. Experts validate the selection of keywords that will build the controlled vocabulary. |$|R
40|$|The Swedish Industrial Association for Multiphase Flows (SIAMUF) is a {{consortium}} of various Swedish companies and has been initiated in 1998 together with an academic research program entitled "Multiphase Flow". The main goals of SIAMUF are to broaden the competence within the area of multiphase flows, by arranging courses, seminars and workshops, to identify the relevant research areas, to transfer results from academia to industry and to obtain an overview of relevant academic research worldwide. Successfully bringing together industry and academia to improve the knowledge and technology for Swedish industry is unique and, among other aspects, motivates to develop better suitable courses and workshops for both students and industry. Every year, a workshop is organized where academia, Swedish industry, and <b>external</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> discuss their research and challenges they face. SIAMUF provides financial support and industrial time for academic visits to industry, contributes to a "best practice guideline" for multiphase flows, organizes an annual workshop and a large multiphase flow course once every five years in collaboration with ERCOFTAC. Swedish academia {{in the field of}} multiphase flow provides courses to SIAMUF members, gives lectures and courses tailored to the needs of industry, and participates in joint research projects. This platform has been motivating for both academia and industry, bringing the partners closer to another and increasing the level of education and research, both in industry as well as academia...|$|R

40|$|Policies and {{management}} for the Wadden Sea, like {{for so many}} other nature areas, {{have to find a}} balance between important natural values {{on the one hand and}} economic functions on the other hand. <b>Scientific</b> <b>experts</b> play an important role in these processes. In the case of the Wadden Sea, <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> have been involved in the development of trilateral ecological targets for the Wadden Sea as well as in the implementation of these targets in the Netherlands as took place in the controversial decision making processes regarding cockle fisheries and gas mining. Drawing on concepts and insights from policy analysis and science and technology studies, this article analyses the different roles <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> play in these policy processes. We show how the role of science shifts from an accommodating role in policy development to a role as advocacy in controversial policy implementation processes. The article concludes with some implications for organising effective science¿policy interactions in the field of nature conservation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{international}} standard-setting. Using the HACCP food safety standard {{as the basis}} of discussion, this paper considers the influence of <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> on the regulatory process. What is usually referred to as the diffusion or dissemination of soft or voluntary standards is here explained in terms of transferability of a regulatory concept. It is the ability of <b>scientific</b> <b>experts</b> to transform practices into a universal concept and, conversely, to develop technologies for users which translate the concept into practice, that explains why this reference has travelled so well across countries, industry sectors and historical periods. <b>Scientific</b> <b>experts</b> played a translating role between standard-setters and groups of practical users. This highlights the counter-intuitive distribution of power in standard-setting: while experts dominate the development of generic rules, official rule-makers (such as governments) assert their authority by developing alternative technologies for the appropriation of the standard by users and, sometimes, allow the latter to deviate from experts' universal concepts where these are shown to be problematic...|$|R
