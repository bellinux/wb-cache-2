25|$|In Season 18, John Nathan-Turner {{became the}} series' producer. He instituted {{a number of}} changes to the show, {{including}} toning down the humour and introducing more science fiction concepts. During this season the Fourth Doctor became very much subdued and, on occasion, melancholy. Baker began the season in poor health, though he eventually recovered. Both the actor and the character seemed noticeably older and tired, due to Baker's gaunt appearance and greying hair. Baker had been finding the role <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> maintain and the previous season had been particularly draining on him. Many of this season's stories also had an elegiac tone, with entropy and decay being a recurring theme.|$|E
25|$|In November 2003, Terry Jones {{announced}} {{she would be}} retiring from Point of Grace. She was finding it <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> handle a full-time music career and being a full-time wife and mother. She wrote a letter which was posted on the group's website, along with a letter from Heather, Shelley, and Denise. They {{made it clear that}} they had no intentions of carrying on as a trio, and called upon band leader Dana Cappillino's wife Leigh to join her husband on tour. Terry's last tour with the group was the 2003 Christmastime Tour with Michael W. Smith, and her last concert was in Little Rock, Arkansas, on February 28, 2004. Leigh had been officially on board since January 1, 2004, but her first concert was in Atlanta, Georgia on March 12, 2004.|$|E
25|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis of 1997 began in Thailand in May 1997, {{where the government}} found it <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> maintain the Thai baht peg at ฿25 to US$1. By 2 July 1997 Thailand abandoned its defence of the baht, allowing it to float freely. Indonesia, which had massive foreign reserves and was seen as having a strong economy, responded on 11 July 1997, by widening its exchange rate band from 8 to 12%. Indonesia had taken similar actions in the {{years leading up to}} the crisis, in December 1995 from 2 to 3%, in response to the Mexican {{financial crisis}}, and in June and September 1996 from 3 to 5% and then 5 to 8%. These actions had been successful in the past in defending the rupiah, but on this occasion there was a more serious crisis of confidence.|$|E

Its wood was <b>hard</b> <b>and</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> work, used for war and peace, for domestic vessels and door posts, for spears and shields. It had to be treated with care because its berries are toxic. The name Eoghan then already had a religious significance in pagan Ireland.|$|R

25|$|The {{marginal}} value theorem {{is a type}} of optimality model that is often applied to optimal foraging. This theorem is used to describe a situation in which an organism searching for food in a patch must decide when it is economically favorable to leave. While the animal is within a patch, it experiences the law of diminishing returns, where it becomes <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> find prey as time goes on. This may be because the prey is being depleted, the prey begins to take evasive action and becomes harder to catch, or the predator starts crossing its own path more as it searches. This law of diminishing returns can be shown as a curve of energy gain per time spent in a patch (Figure 3). The curve starts off with a steep slope and gradually levels off as prey becomes harder to find. Another important cost to consider is the traveling time between different patches and the nesting site. An animal loses foraging time while it travels and expends energy through its locomotion.|$|E

500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet that I just couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> like her character.

The meat ration in late 1916 was only 31% of peacetime, and it fell to 12% in late 1918. [...] The fish ration was 51% in 1916, and none at all by late 1917. The rations for cheese, butter, rice, cereals, eggs and lard were less than 20% of peacetime levels.

2500|$|In local terms, British control {{rested on}} the Indian Civil Service, but it faced growing difficulties.

By 1945 Indians were numerically dominant in the ICS and at issue was loyal divided between the Empire and independence. [...] The finances of the Raj depended on land taxes, and these became problematic in the 1930s. Epstein argues that after 1919 it became <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> collect the land revenue. The Raj's suppression of civil disobedience after 1934 temporarily increased {{the power of the}} revenue agents but after 1937 they were forced by the new Congress-controlled [...] provincial governments to hand back confiscated land.

2500|$|Asymptotic {{flatness}} is an idealization, and a {{very useful}} one, both in our current [...] "Gold Standard" [...] theory of gravitation -- General Relativity—and in the simpler theory it [...] "overthrew", Newtonian gravitation. [...] One might expect that as a (so far mostly hypothetical) sequence of increasingly sophisticated theories of gravitation providing more and more accurate models of fundamental physics, these theories will become monotonically more [...] "powerful". [...] But this hope is probably naive: we should expect a monotonically increasing range of choices in making various theoretical tradeoffs, rather than monotonic [...] "improvement". [...] In particular, as our physical theories {{become more and more}} accurate, we should expect that it will become <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> employ idealizations with the same ease with which we can invoke them in more forgiving (that is, less restrictive) theories. [...] This is because more accurate theories necessarily demand setting up more accurate boundary conditions, which can render it difficult to see how to set up some idealization familiar in a simpler theory in a more sophisticated theory. [...] Indeed, we must expect that some idealizations admitted by previous theories may not be admitted at all by succeeding theories.|$|E
2500|$|Georgescu was {{especially}} prolific {{in the final}} part of his career, when he reputedly identified with the slogan anul şi romanul ("a new novel every year"). According to Iulia Arsintescu, their quality declined as their author became [...] "plagued by an illness that was <b>harder</b> <b>and</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> bear." [...] Beginning with Mai mult ca perfectul, Georgescu was creating a new cycle, {{with a focus on}} Huzurei. The narrator Miron Perieţeanu, himself a fictional version of Georgescu, tells the successive stories of Ioan, Luca, Matei and Marcu (names based on the Romanian versions for the Four Evangelists). The events in these novels also take place during the early 20th century, covering the 1907 peasants' revolt as well as the World War I occupation of the country. According to literary chronicler Ioan Holban, the Huzurei setting is [...] "a desolate place, stupefied by the torpor, with squeamish people always sweaty from the heat, moving idly from one tavern to another [...] and devoting themselves to that almighty goddess that is the siesta [...] This is only a first impression, for Huzurei is 'the living citadel' of its time , grouping, in between its ridiculous houses and streets, a diverse world, caught {{in the midst of a}} struggle over power and money: [...] crimes are being committed, intrigues, drug traffic networks and 'wholesale' exchanges are being set up, politics are hotly debated, predictions are being made, investigations, chases take place, dramas are being consumed, people eat vigorously, and nubile girls are being sold (bought) [...]" [...] The Huzurei narratives as a whole are thought by Cosaşu equal in value to some of their acclaimed predecessors: George Călinescu's Bietul Ioanide and Marin Preda's Moromeţii.|$|E
