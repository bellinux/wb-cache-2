5|$|Favre {{was drafted}} by the Atlanta Falcons {{in the second round}} with the 33rd overall pick in the 1991 NFL Draft. On July 19, 1991, Favre agreed to a three-year, US$1.4million {{contract}} with a reported signing bonus of $350,000. Atlanta head coach Jerry Glanville did not approve of the drafting of Favre, saying it would take a plane crash for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Favre into the game. Favre's first pass in an NFL regular season game resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown in a game against the Washington Redskins. He only attempted four passes in his career at Atlanta, was intercepted twice, and completed none of them. Favre took one other snap, which resulted in a sack for an eleven-yard loss.|$|E
5|$|Following Armageddon, Orton {{entered the}} 2006 Royal Rumble match as the thirtieth and final wrestler, {{but he was}} {{eliminated}} by Rey Mysterio. Mysterio won the match and a title shot, and Orton urged <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> the title shot at stake in a match at No Way Out. In the weeks preceding No Way Out, Orton made controversial remarks about Eddie Guerrero, Mysterio's friend who had died a few months previously, {{in an attempt to}} gain villain heat. Many fans felt the comments were highly distasteful so soon after Guerrero's death in November 2005. Orton won at No Way Out, earning Mysterio's title shot for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 22. General Manager Theodore Long re-added Mysterio to the WrestleMania 22 title match, however, making it a triple threat match between Orton, Mysterio, and then-champion, Kurt Angle. On April 2, at WrestleMania 22, Orton was pinned by Mysterio, making Mysterio the World Heavyweight Champion and ending their on-screen rivalry.|$|E
