5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is when children <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is when the infant feels separation anxiety when separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured when the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is when the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is when {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
500|$|Mark Gevisser {{writes that}} the Kremlin's backing of the law was {{reflective}} of a [...] "dramatic tilt toward homophobia" [...] in Russia {{that began in the}} years preceding the law's passage. Gevisser {{writes that the}} law's passage allowed the Russian government to find [...] "common ground" [...] with the nationalist far right, and also appeal to the many Russians who view [...] "homosexuality as a sign of encroaching decadence in a globalized era." [...] He writes: [...] "Many Russians <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> steady themselves against this cultural tsunami by laying claim to 'traditional values,' of which rejection of homosexuality is the easiest shorthand. This message plays particularly well for a government wishing to mobilize against demographic decline (childless homosexuals are evil) and cozy up to the Russian Orthodox Church (homosexuals with children are evil)." ...|$|E

We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people." [...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in me coming back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that," [...] she said. [...] "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment," [...] said O'Day. [...] "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to know how I <b>feel,</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> go there." [...] O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation. She stated, [...] "After being kicked out, I learned you have to fight to stay happy, and that takes forgiveness of yourself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Determining {{whether or}} not a tea is wild is a {{challenging}} task, made more difficult through the inconsistent and unclear terminology and labeling in Chinese. Terms like yěshēng ( [...] ; literally [...] "wild" [...] or [...] "uncultivated"), qiáomù ( [...] ; literally [...] "tall tree"), yěshēng qiáomù ( [...] ; literally [...] "uncultivated trees"), and gǔshù are found on the labels of cakes of both wild and [...] "wild arbor" [...] variety, and on blended cakes, which contain leaves from tea plants of various cultivations. These inconsistent and often misleading labels can easily confuse uninitiated tea buyers regardless of their grasp of the Chinese language. As well, the lack of specific information about tea leaf sources in the printed wrappers and identifiers that come with the pu'er cake makes identification of the tea a difficult task. Pu'er journals and similar annual guides such as The Profound World of Chi Tse, Pu-erh Yearbook, and Pu-erh Teapot Magazine contain credible sources for leaf information. Tea factories are generally honest about their leaf sources, but someone without access to tea factory or other information is often {{at the mercy of the}} middlemen or an unscrupulous vendor. Many pu'er aficionados seek out and maintain relationships with vendors who they <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> trust to help mitigate the issue of finding the [...] "truth" [...] of the leaves.|$|E

60|$|BROADBENT [hugely self-satisfied]. I think I've {{done the}} trick this time. I just {{gave them a}} bit of {{straight}} talk; and it went home. They were greatly impressed: everyone of those men believes in me and will vote for me when the question of selecting a candidate comes up.

60|$|This is {{the least}} {{intrusive}} approach by which I can touch on a topic that must of necessity be a delicate one; yet which {{may well be a}} difficulty among Latins like yourself. Against this preposterous Prussian upstart we have not only to protect our unity; we have even to protect our quarrels. And the deepest of the reactions or revolts of which I have spoken is the quarrel which (very tragically as I think) has for some hundred years cloven the Christian from the Liberal ideal. It would ill become me, in whose country there is neither such clear doctrine nor such combative democracy, to suppose it can be easy for any of you to close up such sacred wounds. There must still be Catholics who <b>feel</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> never forgive a Jacobin. There must still be old Republicans who feel that they could never endure a priest. And yet there is something, the mere sight of which should lock them both in an instant alliance. They have only to look northward and hold the third thing, which thinks itself superior to either: the enormous turnip-face of ce type là, as the French say, who conceives that he can make them both like himself and yet remain superior to both.|$|E
