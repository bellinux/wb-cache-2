40|$|Homogeneous acid {{catalysis}} of nonasymmetric reactions {{continues to}} be an area of significant focus, and this chapter concentrates on recent relevant advances within a green chemistry context. The developments in acid catalysis are viewed through a number of key reactions including esterification, hydrolysis, and etherification. We begin with an overview of the typical mechanistic considerations for acid catalysis. One of the key, recent developments in the area has been a drive towards the application of novel “greener” solvent media for many classical acid-catalysed transformations. We consider the benefits offered by “green” solvents such as high temperature and supercritical water, and ionic liquids, on acid-catalysed reactions.

40|$|Abstract: Organic {{synthetic}} methodology in the 21 st century aims {{to conform}} to the principles of green sustainable chemistry (GSC) and we may expect that in the future, the realization of GSC will be an important objective for chemical industries. An important aim of synthetic organic chemistry is to implement waste-free and environmentally-benign industrial processes using Lewis acids as versatile as aluminum choride. A key technological objective of our work in this area has been to achieve a “catalyst recycling system that utilizes the high activity and structural features of fluorous Lewis acid catalysts”. Thus, we have developed a series of novel fluorous Lewis acid catalysts, namely the ytterbium(III), scandium(III), tin(IV) or hafnium(IV) bis(perfluoroalkanesulfonyl) amides or tris(perfluoro- alkanesulfonyl) methides.

The catalysts before and after stability tests were characterized by X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method and thermogravimetric analysis. The {{results indicated that the}} major factor affecting the deactivation of the catalyst was the deposition of organic substances on the surface active sites of the catalyst during batch reaction. Washing the deactivated catalyst with either MeOH or an aqueous hydrazine solution at 80 degrees C could completely recover the initial activity of the catalyst, and calcining the deactivated catalyst in air at 500 degrees C and then reducing in an aqueous hydrazine solution could partly recover its activity. The deactivation and regeneration of the catalyst in the <b>direct</b> oxidative <b>esterification</b> at gas-liquid-solid phase are important and meaningful. (c) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Selective {{oxidation}} of {{aliphatic alcohols}} under mild and base-free conditions is a challenging process for organic synthesis. Herein, we report a one-pot {{process for the}} <b>direct</b> oxidative <b>esterification</b> of aliphatic alcohols that is significantly enhanced by visible-light irradiation at ambient temperatures. The new methodology uses heterogenerous photocatalysts of gold–palladium alloy nanoparticles on a phosphate-modified hydrotalcite support and molecular oxygen as a benign oxidant. The alloy photocatalysts can absorb incident light, and the light-excited metal electrons {{on the surface of}} metal nanoparticles can activate the adsorbed reactant molecules. Tuning the light intensity and wavelength of the irradiation can remarkably change the reaction activity. Shorter wavelength light (< 550 nm) drives the reaction more efficiently than light of longer wavelength (e. g., 620 nm), especially at low temperatures. The phosphate-exchanged hydrotalcite support provides sufficient basicity (and buffer) for the catalytic reactions; thus, the addition of base is not required. The photocatalysts are efficient and readily recyclable.

The cascade reaction {{that leads to the}} alkyl cinnamates occurs through two oxidation steps: the selective oxidation of cinnamyl alcohol to cinnamaldehyde, followed by oxidation of the hemiacetal that results from the base-catalysed reaction of cinnamaldehyde with an aliphatic alcohol. The rate constants for the two steps were evaluated in the temperature range 10 – 45 [*]°C. The cinnamyl alcohol oxidation is faster than the oxidative esterification of cinnamaldehyde with methanol, ethanol, 2 -propanol, 1 -butanol, 1 -hexanol or 1 -octanol. The rate constants of the latter reaction are pseudo-zero order with respect to the aliphatic alcohol and decrease as the bulkiness of the alcohol is increased.

The oxidative esterification of cinnamyl alcohol with 2 -phenylethanol follows pseudo-first-order kinetics with respect to 2 -phenylethanol and is faster than observed for other alcohols because of fast diffusion of the aromatic alcohol in the crystalline phase of the support.

The potential of employing MSNs for drug delivery was further studied on the biological behaviors of these nanoparticles in blood vessels. The research demonstrated the size and surface effects on the interaction of MSNs with human red blood cell membranes, and proposed that appropriate surface modification of nanoparticles can improve their biocompatibility and diminish their dangerous side effects on red blood cells. MSN materials have also been extensively applied in the field of catalysis. We have tethered a Pt(II) bipyridine catalyst onto MSNs in order to enhance its thermal stability and product selectivity. A detailed investigation on the catalytic activity showed that the catalytic performance was similar between the homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. However, the homogeneous system exhibited appreciable degradation after 16 hr at 100 °C. Instead, using MSNs as scaffolds, this catalyst system retained its activity after 72 hr at 150 °C, demonstrating an increased thermal stability. We also explored the feasibility of introducing a biocatalyst to function synergically with MSN supported inorganic catalyst. Supported Au-nanoparticle catalyst employed for <b>direct</b> alcohol oxidative <b>esterification</b> usually suffers from a slow alcohol oxidation rate. We designed a co-catalyst system by combining a biocatalyst, alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme and an inorganic catalyst, mesoporous silica nanoparticles supported Au nanoparticle to accelerate reaction tandemly. We identified several factors that affect the catalytic performance of the co-catalyst system. We then examined the catalytic capability of this co-catalyst system on the one-pot transformation of allyl alcohol into allyl acrylate ester. We expect that this system could lead {{to the development of a}} variety of catalyst pairs for a great scope of reactions. We further explored the possibility of the intracellular co-delivery of a biocatalyst and its substrate using MSNs. We designed a gold nanoparticle-capped MSNs platform and demonstrated its ability to release luciferin from the interior pores of MSNs upon gold nanoparticle uncapping in response to disulfide-reducing antioxidants, and co-deliver bioactive luciferase from the PEGylated exterior surface of MSNs into Hela cells. The effectiveness of intracellular catalytical reactions was evaluated by measuring luminescence emission signals. We envision that our co-delivery systems could play a significant role in intracellular controlled catalysis and tumor imaging. The research presented in this dissertation would provide MSNs with a great potential for various biomedical and catalytic applications...|$|R
40|$|The <b>direct</b> <b>esterification</b> of {{palmitic}} acid with L-(+) -arabinose {{has been carried}} out. The use of Candida antartica lipase B as the catalyst and the choice of suitable solvent and experimental conditions allowed carrying out the reaction successfully. In particular 10 % dimethyl-sulfoxide in tert-butanol {{was found to be}} the optimal solvent. The product has been fully characterized by means of FTIR, ESI-MS, DSC, mono and bidimensional 1 H and 13 C NMR. These techniques confirm that only the primary alcoholic group was involved in the esterification reaction...|$|E
40|$|The esters of {{gallic acid}} and higher primary alcohols, {{especially}} fatty alcohols, have recently gained considerable interest as possible antioxidants for fats. Two independent methods for {{the preparation of}} these esters are described. In the first method the hitherto unknown compound galloyl chloride is converted into an ester of gallic acid by reaction with the appropriate alcohol. A new type of molecular addition compound between galloyl chloride and dioxane is described. The second method deals with the <b>direct</b> <b>esterification</b> of gallic acid with higher alcohols, which, until now, had not been successfully achieved...|$|E
