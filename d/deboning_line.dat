40|$|ABSTRACT The {{variation}} in broiler breast meat color (CIE values L*a*b*) that normally occurs during pro-cessingwas evaluated on 6, 997 broiler breast fillets (pecto-ralis major muscles) from 79 flocks using a Minolta Chroma Meter. The samples were randomly collected at 3 to 6 h postmortem from the <b>deboning</b> <b>line</b> {{at a single}} major Italian processing plant. In addition, 216 fillets were selected based on lightness (L*) values as being dark (L* 56), and were analyzed for ultimate pH, intact and groundmeat cooking loss, and shear value. The overall range in measured lightness (L*) was considerable and varied from 40 (dark...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Four {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} de-termine the range of breast meat color variation observed in commercial processing plants {{and its relationship to}} muscle pH and texture. Boneless, skinless breast fillets were collected weekly from the <b>deboning</b> <b>lines</b> of five commercial processing plants over a 4 -wk period. Plant personnel selected breast fillets based on their appearance as being “lighter than normal, ” “normal, ” or “darker than normal ” in color. Five representative fillets of each ap-pearance classification were transported to a central labo-ratory for analyses of visual score (1 to 5 with 1 = light, 3 = normal, or 5 = dark), instrumental color, muscle pH, (Key words: broiler breast meat, objective color, subjective color, muscle pH, tenderness...|$|R
