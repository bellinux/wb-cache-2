40|$|Oscillations in {{electrical}} activity are a characteristic feature of many brain networks and display {{a wide variety}} of temporal patterns. A network may express a single oscillation frequency, alternate between two or more distinct frequencies, or continually express multiple frequencies. In addition, oscillation amplitude may fluctuate over time. The origin of this complex repertoire of activity remains unclear. Different cortical layers often produce distinct oscillation frequencies. To investigate whether interactions between different networks could contribute to the variety of oscillation patterns, we created two model networks, one generating on its own a relatively slow frequency (20 Hz; slow network) and one generating a fast frequency (32 Hz; fast network). Taking either the slow or the fast network as source network projecting connections to the other, or target, network, we systematically investigated how type and strength of inter-network connections affected target network activity. For high <b>inter-network</b> <b>connection</b> strengths, we found that the slow network was more effective at completely imposing its rhythm on the fast network than the other way around. The strongest entrainment occurred when excitatory cells of the slow network projected to excitatory or inhibitory cells of the fast network. The fast network most strongly imposed its rhythm on the slow network when its excitatory cells projected to excitatory cells of the slow network. Interestingly, for lower <b>inter-network</b> <b>connection</b> strengths, multiple frequencies coexisted in the target network. Just as observed in rat prefrontal cortex, the target network could express multipl...|$|E
40|$|Networks {{in nature}} {{do not act}} in {{isolation}} but instead exchange information, and depend on each other to function properly. An incipient theory of Networks of Networks have shown that connected random networks may very easily result in abrupt failures. This theoretical finding bares an intrinsic paradox: If natural systems organize in interconnected networks, {{how can they be}} so stable? Here we provide a solution to this conundrum, showing that the stability of a system of networks relies on the relation between the internal structure of a network and its pattern of connections to other networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that if network inter-connections are provided by hubs of the network {{and if there is a}} moderate degree of convergence of <b>inter-network</b> <b>connection</b> the systems of network are stable and robust to failure. We test this theoretical prediction in two independent experiments of functional brain networks (in task- and resting states) which show that brain networks are connected with a topology that maximizes stability according to the theory.

SMTP, if configured to use backup MXes, can transparently cope with temporary local network outages. A message can be transmitted along a variable path by choosing the next hop from a preconfigured list of MXes with no intervention from the originating user.|$|R

Equitable distribution of bandwidth required for network management to access all the resources provided, including the Internet. The bandwidth evenly divide requires a protocol that is able to identify the current status of the client.

40|$|Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus (T 1 DM) usually begins in {{childhood and adolescence}} and causes lifelong damage to several major organs including the brain. Despite increasing evidence of T 1 DM-induced structural deficits in cortical regions implicated in higher cognitive and emotional functions, little is known whether and how the structural connectivity between these regions is altered in the T 1 DM brain. Using inter-regional covariance of cortical thickness measurements from high-resolution T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance data, we examined the topological organizations of cortical structural networks in 81 T 1 DM patients and 38 healthy subjects. We found a relative absence of hierarchically high-level hubs in the prefrontal lobe of T 1 DM patients, which suggests ineffective top-down control of the prefrontal cortex in T 1 DM. Furthermore, <b>inter-network</b> <b>connections</b> between the strategic/executive control system and systems subserving other cortical function...|$|R
40|$|Network {{theory is}} {{increasingly}} employed {{to study the}} structure and behaviour of social, physical and technological systems - including civil infrastructure. Many of these systems are interconnected and the interdependencies between them allow disruptive events to propagate across networks, enabling damage to spread far beyond the immediate footprint of disturbance. In this research we experiment with a model to characterise the configuration of interdependencies in terms of direction, redundancy and extent, and we analyse the performance of interdependent systems {{with a wide range}} of possible coupling modes. We demonstrate that networks with directed dependencies are less robust than those with undirected dependencies, and that the degree of redundancy in inter-network dependencies can have a differential effect on robustness determined by their direction. As interdependencies between many real-world systems exhibit these characteristics, it is likely that many such systems operate near critical thresholds. The vulnerability of an interdependent network is shown to be reducible in a cost effective way, either by optimising <b>inter-network</b> <b>connections,</b> or by hardening high degree nodes. The results improve understanding of the influence of interdependencies on system performance and how to mitigate associated risks...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that functional brain connectivity is an important determinant of cognitive aging. However, the fundamental concept of inter-individual variations in functional connectivity in older individuals is not yet completely understood. It is essential to evaluate {{the extent to which}} inter-individual variability in connectivity impacts cognitive performance at an older age. In the current study, we aimed to characterize individual variability of functional connectivity in the elderly and to examine its significance to individual cognition. We mapped inter-individual variability of functional connectivity by analyzing whole-brain functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from a large sample of cognitively normal older adults. Our results demonstrated a gradual increase in variability in primary regions of the visual, sensorimotor, and auditory networks to specific subcortical structures, particularly the hippocampal formation, and the prefrontal and parietal cortices, which largely constitute the default mode and fronto-parietal networks, to the cerebellum. Further, the inter-individual variability of the functional connectivity correlated significantly with the degree of cognitive relevance. Regions with greater connectivity variability demonstrated more connections that correlated with cognitive performance. These results also underscored the crucial function of the long-range and <b>inter-network</b> <b>connections</b> in individual cognition. Thus, individual connectivity-cognition variability mapping findings may provide important information for future research on cognitive aging and neurocognitive diseases. </p...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{recognised}} that satellites can play {{very important role}} in supporting B-ISDN services based on ATM technology. There have been several projects to exploit ATM over satellite for broadband services since 1992. These include the European RACE II CATALYST project which developed a satellite ATM demonstrator and the EPSRC project which studied the interconnection of Broadband ATM Islands via satellite. In a broadband network environment, ATM over satellite {{can be used for}} <b>inter-network</b> <b>connections</b> as transit link and for terminal access as access link. For transit link a small number of earth stations require a high bit rate link. Static bandwidth reservation based on estimated fixed rates provide a simple solution. However for terminal access a large number of terminals require low bit rate links. Since the traffic is expected to have large fluctuations, a dynamic reservation system is a more efficient but complex solution. Dynamic reservation Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) appears to be the best solutions, as it takes advantage of the flexibility and statistical multiplexing capabilities of ATM and supports all traffic classes. The paper shows that ATM over satellite can implement a flexible and efficient bandwidth resource management mechanisms which allows the satellite link to be configured to meet the requirements of broadband services from low bit rate to high bit rate.

40|$|Normal {{aging is}} {{typically}} characterized by abnormal resting-state functional connectivity (FC), including decreasing connectivity within networks and increasing connectivity between networks, {{under the assumption}} that the FC over the scan time was stationary. In fact, the resting-state FC has been shown in recent years to vary over time even within minutes, thus showing the great potential of intrinsic interactions and organization of the brain. In this article, we assumed that the dynamic FC consisted of an intrinsic dynamic balance in the resting brain and was altered with increasing age. Two groups of individuals (N = 36, ages 20 â 25 for the young group; N = 32, ages 60 â 85 for the senior group) were recruited from the public data of the Nathan Kline Institute. Phase randomization was first used to examine the reliability of the dynamic FC. Next, the variation in the dynamic FC and the energy ratio of the dynamic FC fluctuations within a higher frequency band were calculated and further checked for differences between groups by non-parametric permutation tests. The results robustly showed modularization of the dynamic FC variation, which declined with aging; moreover, the FC variation of the <b>inter-network</b> <b>connections,</b> which mainly consisted of the frontal-parietal network-associated and occipital-associated connections, decreased. In addition, a higher energy ratio in the higher FC fluctuation frequency band was observed in the senior group, which indicated the frequency interactions in the FC fluctuations. These results highly supported the basis of abnormality and compensation in the aging brain and might provide new insights into both aging and relevant compensatory mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive networks, which combine topological {{evolution}} of the network with dynamics on the network, are ubiquitous across disciplines. Examples include technical distribu-tion networks such as road networks and the internet, natural and biological networks, and social science net-works. These networks often interact with or depend upon other networks, resulting in multilayer adaptive networks. We study susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic dynamics on such networks revealing a new stable state which only emerges {{in the case of}} weakly coupled net-works [5]. In this state, the disease is endemic in one network but neither becomes endemic nor dies out in the other. Instead, it persists only at the interconnected nodes and does not break out into the wider network. Additional details We consider two networks A and B with the same number of nodes NA = NB = N, where a randomly chosen fraction of nodes pcoup from each network are connected through <b>inter-network</b> <b>connections</b> to nodes in the other network [2, 1], see Fig. 1. We extend Gross et al. âs model of SIS epidemic dynam-ics on adaptive networks [4] from a single to multilayer networks. Nodes in both networks can be in either one of two states â susceptible or infected â where susceptible nodes can get infected from their intra- and inter-network neighbors and infected nodes can recover and become susceptible again. In addition, each network is indepen-dently adaptive in the sense that susceptible nodes can rewire their intra-network edges from infected neighbors to randomly selected susceptible ones. However, the inter-links connecting between networks are permanent (nonadaptive). This limits an individual networkâs ability to adapt in the face of challenges, since it can change its own topology but not its dependence on other networks. In geographically distant social net-works, for example, long-distance links are often family links which are not subject to rewiring compared to short-distance friend and acquaintance links...|$|R
40|$|M. Comm. "For {{better for}} worse, most {{computer}} {{systems are not}} in that way today. Security is in general, a trade-off with convenience of remote access via networks to their computers. Inevitably, they suffer from some loss of security. It {{is the purpose of}} the research to discuss how <b>Inter-networks</b> <b>connection</b> could be secured. " (Cheswick, 1994 : 3) By definition, the public Internet is a giant network which is composed of thousands of small to 'large networks. It is important to realize that the Internet is considered a public network, similar to the public telephone network, because the general public has easy access to it. This is great for ease of use and accessibility of a virtually infinite amount of information, however it creates great challenges to achieving the information security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability. The confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability security objectives, are at risk due to the increased potential that, once connected to the Internet, any one of {{the hundreds of thousands of}} Internet users could use the Internet services offered by an organization (i. e. telnet, file transfer protocol, world wide web, etc.) to attack their private network and gain unauthorised access to computer resources and information. These attacks could result in confidential and restricted data and computer resources being controlled by unauthorised people, to the modification and sabotage of confidential and restricted data and computer resources. Other major exposures to the information security objectives exist because an organisation's Internet traffic will, almost always, take a route on a network which the organisation has little or no control' over. This risk is compounded by the ease of which network traffic may be accessed without authorisation through the tactics of snooping, hijacking, and spoofing. Snooping occurs when a "data scope," which may be a computer with snooping software or a common piece of network analysing hardware, which is placed on a portion of a network and information is displayed as it is transmitted through the network. Hijacking, on the other hand, occurs when Internet traffic is stolen by an imposing host on the same network as the target host. Spoofing, is similar to hijacking except that a host acts as an impostor of another host on the same network and steals traffic meant for a target host, at the same time confusing the target host by sending fake information in the place of the stolen information. The methods for snooping, hijacking, and spoofing are varied and can be quite technical but they are common and pose serious exposures to information security objectives. The security objective of availability is also at risk due to increased Internet traffic levels, and denial-of-service attacks like the infamous Internet worm which caused hundreds of Internet hosts to grind to a halt for several hours. However, Internet is not secure by default, nor will it perform at its best by default, thus there is a need for Internet to be secured, and more specifically for PrivateNet system technology to be applied. The purpose of this short dissertation is threefold, namely: To help the computer auditor to understand the information security risks associated with the client' use of the Internet; To evaluate the capabilities of the features provided by the PrivateNet system in addressing the security objectives of availability, confidentiality, accountability and integrity in an Internet environment; and To help the information security managers to identify the areas where security needs to be enhanced in the Internet environment...|$|R
