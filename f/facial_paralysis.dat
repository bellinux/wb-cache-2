40|$|BACKGROUND The <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> {{is a broad}} term {{having so}} many {{differential}} diagnoses starting from congenital causes to malignant tumour. Accurate diagnosis with localisation of the site of injury or compression and timely intervention {{has become a challenge}} to an otorhinolaryngologist. Objective- To outline the incidence of the different aetiologies and the profile of peripheral <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> patients in the Otolaryngology Dept. of ENT in VIMSAR, Burla. MATERIALS AND METHODS The records of 53 patients with <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> seen during the years of 2016 & 2017 were analysed. RESULTS From the 53 patients analysed, 60. 4...|$|R

25|$|Once the <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> sets in, {{many people}} may mistake it as {{a symptom of}} a stroke; however, there are a few subtle differences. A stroke will usually cause a few {{additional}} symptoms, such as numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. And unlike Bell's palsy, a stroke will usually let patients control the upper part of their faces. A person with a stroke will usually have some wrinkling of their forehead.|$|E
25|$|Bell's palsy {{is a type}} of <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{that results}} in an {{inability}} to control the facial muscles on the affected side. Symptoms can vary from mild to severe. They may include muscle twitching, weakness, or total loss of the ability to move one or rarely both sides of the face. Other symptoms include drooping of the eyelid, a change in taste, pain around the ear, and increased sensitivity to sound. Typically symptoms come on over 48 hours.|$|E
25|$|One {{disease that}} may be {{difficult}} to exclude in the differential diagnosis is involvement of the facial nerve in infections with the herpes zoster virus. The major differences in this condition are the presence of small blisters, or vesicles, on the external ear and hearing disturbances, but these findings may occasionally be lacking (zoster sine herpete). Reactivation of existing herpes zoster infection leading to <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> in a Bell's palsy type pattern is known as Ramsay Hunt syndrome type 2.|$|E
2500|$|Facial Synkinesis is {{a common}} sequela to Idiopathic <b>Facial</b> Nerve <b>Paralysis,</b> also called Bell’s Palsy or Facial Palsy. Bell’s Palsy, which is thought to occur due to a viral {{reactivation}} which can lead (through unknown mechanisms) to diffuse axon demyelination and degeneration of the seventh cranial nerve, results in a hemifacial paralysis due to non-functionality of the nerve. As the nerve attempts to recover, nerve miswiring results (see Mechanism of Action below). In patients with severe <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis,</b> <b>facial</b> synkinesis will inevitably develop.|$|R
40|$|Peripheral <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> in {{children}} {{might be an}} alarming sign of serious disease such as malignancy, systemic disease, congenital anomalies, trauma, infection, middle ear surgery, and hypertension. The cases of 40 consecutive children and adolescents who were diagnosed with peripheral <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> at Baskent University Adana Hospital Pediatrics and Pediatric Neurology Unit between January 2010 and January 2013 were retrospectively evaluated. We determined that {{the most common cause}} was Bell palsy, followed by infection, tumor lesion, and suspected chemotherapy toxicity. We noted that younger patients had generally poorer outcome than older patients regardless of disease etiology. Peripheral <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> has been reported in many countries in America and Europe; however, knowledge about its clinical features, microbiology, neuroimaging, and treatment in Turkey is incomplete. The present study demonstrated that Bell palsy and infection were the most common etiologies of peripheral <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> is {{a common}} problem that {{involves}} the paralysis of any structures innervated by the facial nerve. The pathway {{of the facial nerve}} is long and relatively convoluted, and so {{there are a number of}} causes that may result in <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis.</b> The most common is Bell's palsy, a disease of unknown cause that may only be diagnosed by exclusion.|$|R
25|$|The rate of {{complications}} is about 12% for minor complications and 3% for major complications; major complications include infections, <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis,</b> and device failure. To avoid {{the risk of}} bacterial meningitis, which while low is about thirty times as high compared to people who don't undergo CI procedures, the FDA recommends vaccination prior to the procedure. The rate of transient facial nerve palsy {{is estimated to be}} approximately 1%. Device failure requiring reimplantation is estimated to occur in 2.5-6% of the time. Up to one-third of people experience disequilibrium, vertigo, or vestibular weakness lasting more than 1 week after the procedure; in people under 70 these symptoms generally resolve over weeks to months, but in people over 70 the problems tend to persist.|$|E
25|$|Ali al-Sulayhi {{was killed}} by Najah's sons {{on his way to}} Mecca in 1084. His son Ahmed Al-Mukarram led an army to Zabid and killed 8,000 of its inhabitants. He later {{installed}} the Zurayids to govern Aden. al-Mukarram, who had been afflicted with <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis</b> resulting from war injuries, retired in 1087 and handed over power to his wife Arwa al-Sulayhi. Queen Arwa moved the seat of the Sulayhid dynasty from Sana'a to Jibla, a small town in central Yemen near Ibb. Jibla was strategically near the Sulayhid dynasty source of wealth, the agricultural central highlands. It was also within easy reach of the southern portion of the country, especially Aden. She sent Ismaili missionaries to India, where a significant Ismail community was formed that exists to this day. Queen Arwa continued to rule securely until her death in 1138.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the exact}} cause of Bell's palsy—a type of facial paralysis—is unknown, {{it may be}} related to {{reactivation}} of HSV-1. [...] This theory has been contested, however, since HSV is detected in large numbers of individuals having never experienced <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis,</b> and higher levels of antibodies for HSV are not found in HSV-infected individuals with Bell's palsy compared to those without. [...] Regardless antivirals have been found to not improve outcomes.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Acute {{otitis media}} {{is a common}} disease among children, and {{peripheral}} <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> secondary to acute otitis media is a dramatic clinical entity for children and parents. In this report we discuss the clinical presentation of <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> secondary to acute otitis media and management of this clinical issue. Material and Method: The medical histories of seven children who suffered from <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> secondary to acute otitis media were collected retrospectively. Results: All seven of the children(ages: 1 - 9 years; 4 boys, 3 girls) underwent a myringotomy operation. Corticosteroids and antibiotics were also added during the treatment. All {{of the children were}} recovered totally; the recovery period varied from a week to a month(meanrecovery time: 1. 8 weeks). Discussion: Rare complications like <b>facial</b> nerve <b>paralysis</b> can be seen during the normal course of acute otitis media,despite proper treatment. Immediate treatment may help to overcome these clinical complications...|$|R

In the following weeks, Sarita and Rosita successfully defended the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, first against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love and Velvet Sky), and then against Madison Rayne and Tara. They made their third successful defense on the June 16 episode of Impact Wrestling, defeating Velvet Sky and Ms. Tessmacher, following interference from ODB. In early July, Stock was sidelined from in-ring competition after suffering <b>facial</b> <b>paralysis.</b> On the July 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Sarita, wearing a protective mask, and Rosita lost the Knockouts Tag Team Championship to Ms. Tessmacher and Tara. Sarita and Rosita received a rematch for the title on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, but were again defeated by Tessmacher and Tara. Sarita was eventually unmasked on October 16, during the Bound for Glory pre-show by Ink Inc. member Toxxin. The following month at Turning Point, Sarita, Anarquia and Hernandez faced Ink Inc.'s Jesse Neal, Shannon Moore and Toxxin in a six-person tag team match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship, which Mexican America managed to retain, when Sarita pinned Toxxin after hitting her with the title belt. On the March 22, 2012, episode of Impact Wrestling, Sarita and Rosita again failed to recapture the Knockouts Tag Team Championship, when they were defeated by Eric Young and ODB. Sarita and Rosita were given another title opportunity on April 15 at Lockdown, but were once again defeated by Eric Young and ODB, this time in a tag team steel cage match. Afterwards, both Sarita and Rosita went inactive from TNA, while Anarquia left the promotion and Hernandez turned face, effectively disbanding Mexican America.|$|E
