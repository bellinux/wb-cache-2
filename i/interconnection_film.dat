40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{technology}} developed for reliable electrical <b>interconnection</b> on <b>film</b> substrates and between vertically stacked film layers. Applying through-hole via technologies for 3 D foil stacks enables multi-functionality and RF performance combined with open form-factor and very cost-efficient manufacturing of conformable electronic modules. The manufacture of fine line metal patterns (line /space geometries below 20 μm) on film substrates is performed by cost-effective roll-to-roll technology. Furthermore procedures and technologies for handling and lamination of film based sub-modules have been developed. Also the manufacture and handling of ultra-thin and flexible integrated circuits has been combined with placement of SMD type passive and with integrated printed passive components in the same technology...|$|R

40|$|Cuban Film Institute {{throughout}} its existence. 1 Three {{months after the}} triumph of the revolution on January 1, 1959, the first cultural act of the new government was to create ICAIC (Instituto Cubano de Arte e Industria Cinematográficos). The law founding the film institute asserted-in its only reference to subject matter or genre forms-that, “Our history is a veritable goldmine of themes and heroes capable of cinematic incarnation, which will serve as a fountain of revolutionary inspiration, culture, and information. ” 2. Twenty years later, a long essay celebrated ICAIC’s anniversary by extolling the various <b>interconnections</b> of <b>film</b> and history, and concluded that the latter was the emotional well-spring of Cuban cinema. 3 Shortly before the 20 th-anniversary, the greatest of the Cuban directors, Tomás Gutiérrez Alea summed up the priority accorded history in the film institute by stating. “Every foot of film we shoot is marked, in the final instance, by a concern with history. ” 4 The decision to make films about the past is a serious one. Historical movies are a good deal more costly to produce than contemporary films, for they require elaborate and specific costumes, sets, and locations. Further, the reconstruction of past events, the resuscitation of historical figures, and the evocation of yesterday's language and customs are arduous tasks which can-and often do-result i...|$|R

40|$|Thin film {{photovoltaics}} can {{be beneficial}} for specific applications like building integrated photovoltaics. To fully exploit the differentiator of form freedom, the <b>interconnections</b> in thin <b>film</b> modules can be tuned depending on the required module output. Traditionally, an alternation of coating and scribing steps is applied, determining the form from the start. Here, we present a set of techniques to define the module design from a master substrate with homogeneously coated electroactive layers. By applying subtractive and additive laser-based processes, the size and form of the module are only fixed after the manufacturing of the whole solar cell stack. By laser-induced forward transfer, an isolating dielectric material and a conductive top electrode are deposited in laser ablated scribes to enable the interconnection between two adjacent cells. After optimization of the laser settings for ablation and forward transfer, the optimal annealing time and temperature for the curing of the silver top electrode were determined. The proof of principle was demonstrated by constructing a 4 -cell organic solar module of 1. 0 % efficiency on an area of over 3 cm 2 showing the anticipated short-circuit current and open-circuit voltage...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} review, the main {{degradation}} mechanisms {{occurring in the}} different layer stacking (i. e. photoactive layer, electrode, encapsulation <b>film,</b> <b>interconnection)</b> of polymeric organic solar cells and modules are discussed. Bulk and interfacial, as well as chemical and physical degradation mechanisms are reviewed, {{as well as their}} implications and external or internal triggers. Decay in I-V curves in function of time is usually due to the combined action of sequential and interrelated mechanisms taking place at different locations of the device, at specific kinetics. This often makes the identification of specific root causes of degradation challenging in non-model systems. Additionally, constant development and refinement in terms of type and combination of materials and processes render the ranking of degradation mechanisms as a function of their probability of occurrence and their detection challenging. However, it clearly appears that for the overall stability of organic photovoltaic devices, the actual photoactive layer, as well as the properties of the barrier and substrate (e. g. cut of moisture and oxygen ingress, mechanical integrity), remain critical. Interfacial stability is also crucial, as a modest degradation at the level of an interface can quickly and significantly influence the overall device properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to investigate}} and interpret nationalism in Indonesian films for children with local settings. Four films for children –Garuda Di Dadaku (2009), Di Timur Matahari (2011), Serdadu Kumbang (2011), dan Tanah Surga…katanya (2012) - are analyzed {{with reference to the}} theoretical assumption of film as a form system covering its language use and mise-en-scène (Bordwell & Thomson, 2010). Employing a formal system analysis, aspects of nationalism were constructed and interpreted using Bhabha’s (2000) dissemination theory and a seminal theory of ideology in children and teenagers’ literary texts by Hollindale (1988). Results show that nationalism is presented: 1) through the films’ mise-en-scène which generates attachment to Indonesian nation; 2) in abstract notions through the <b>films</b> <b>interconnection</b> with aspects of humanity, social justice, and unity; 3) the use of children characters’ points of view. The presentation implied that, in the context of building nationalism, the constructed meanings from exposures on nationalism originated in local issues as well as socio-cultural issues have placed children in an instrumental role as the glue in the weaving of Indonesian nationalism. These findings generate three implications: (1) giving inputs about the kind of texts for children which focus on children’s point of view; (2) encouraging the exposure of localities to raise the sense of nationalism; and (3) preparing practical ways to empower film as part of national character building in teaching children...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1995 With edge {{rates of}} high speed digital devices pushing into the sub-nano second range, {{interconnections}} {{with the associated}} packages {{play a major role}} in determining the speed, size and performance of digital circuits and systems. The purpose of this study is to develop experimental techniques based on time domain peeling algorithms (dynamic deconvolution) for accurate electrical characterization and circuit modeling of general interconnection structures. This thesis describes the basic principles and computational procedure of these time domain peeling algorithms, accompanied by many illustrations and examples of practical interconnection structures in high speed electronic packages. These include general single (isolated) interconnections with nonuniform cross section, general uniformly/ nonuniformly coupled interconnection structures with discontinuities, power/ ground systems with the associated parallel plane structures, resistive lossy <b>interconnections</b> in thin <b>film</b> single and multi-chip modules, and multilayer high-pin-count packages. It is shown that the distributed circuit models consisting of cascaded transmission line sections lead to an accurate evaluation of the time domain response of high speed interconnection structures. These distributed models are synthesized from the time domain reflection and transmission (TDRIT) measurements, and the impedance profiles of the distributed model are extracted by using scattering matrix-based peeling algorithms By direct time domain integration or frequency domain optimization, the distributed circuit model can also be used to construct the lumped element circuit model as well as the proposed hybrid element model consisting of transmission lines and lumped elements. The hybrid model is intended to combine the efficiency of the lumped element model with the accuracy of the distributed circuit model leading to efficient accurate simulation of circuits in general CAD tools. The accuracy of these circuit models is also confirmed by comparing the simulated data with the measured data for the test fixtures on printed circuit boards (PCBs) and chip-to-chip level interconnections. The techniques developed in this thesis can help to assure the signal fidelity of high speed circuits in the early design stage by incorporating interconnect models into integrated circuit design and simulation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{cinematic}} {{treatment of a}} cluster of themes – law, justice, morality, human emotions and social relationships – in what appears in genre to be a fairly straightforward Chinese martial arts film, Wu Xia (2011). The film is atypical for its genre, however, both in the characters it depicts and in the narrative it constructs. In particular, Wu Xia has only three fight scenes and is heavy with dialogue (both in the broad, conversational sense of spoken dialogue and in the more technical, Bakhtinian sense of dialogism (1992)). In a striking departure from genre conventions, the film develops {{what amounts to a}} cinematic commentary on jurisprudential debates about free will, punishment and ways of attributing responsibility and blame for human behaviour (for legal discussion of these issues, see Rawls 1999). Taking Bordwell (1989) ’s approach to interpreting filmic meaning as exemplary in its attention simultaneously to conventional form, distinctive rhetorical styles, and historicity, I will offer an analysis {{of what might be called}} the ‘cinematic experience of justice’, a reading of Wu Xia that is especially concerned with <b>interconnections</b> between the <b>film’s</b> formal characteristics, its stated and implied meanings, and its likely impact on specific cinema audiences. Focusing on the film’s distribution simultaneously in two different Chinese language versions, one released in Hong Kong and the other throughout mainland China, the analysis compares significant language choices made in the film’s soundtrack and relates them to the respective social, political and historical contexts of film’s distribution in its two different cuts. This paper suggests that Wu Xia is highly distinctive in several ways: in how it depicts the practice of law as being starkly at odds with the emotional experience of being human; in how little faith it expresses in the rule of law; and, perhaps most significantly, in its open ridiculing of a formalistic approach to justice. I will conclude by discussing the significance of these aspects of the film in the political dynamics of China and postcolonial Hong Kong...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a historical}} and theoretical study of the southern imaginary {{at the intersection of}} mass and regional culture. The focus is on two cinematic treatments of significant violent crimes in the region during the 1950 s: firstly, the assassination of Albert Patterson, which prompted the clean of the “wide open” town of Phenix City, Alabama; and secondly, the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi, which {{played a critical role in}} accelerating the African American freedom struggle. The Phenix City Story (Allied Artists, 1955), and Crisis in the Deep South, an unproduced 1956 screenplay written by Crane Wilbur, were both products of the media frenzy surrounding these actual events and they each involved investigation and research into local circumstances as part of their development and production. Rooted in film studies, history and cultural studies, the method of this thesis is to look backward to the foundational elements of the texts in question (e. g., the ‘raw material’ of the actual historical events,), and forward to the consequences of cinematic intervention into local commemorative regimes. In this way, I chart how the overlaps and <b>interconnections</b> between these <b>film</b> projects and others of the era reveal the emergence, consolidation and dissolution of a larger “cycles of sensation,” a concept outlined by Frank Krutnik and Peter Stanfield. The thesis offers a radical close reading of these texts to illuminate the complex relationship between Hollywood film and historical fact. The thesis examines southern exceptionalism and outlines the ways its romantic visions of “moonlight and magnolias” inform the treatment of the American South in the cinematic imagination, while tracing presentations of the modern American South through the popular hicksploitation cycle of the 1970 s. The failed attempt to make a film out of the murder of Emmett Till in the 1950 s demonstrates the limitations of Hollywood’s ability to address civil rights issues. My analysis of The Phenix City Story uncovers connections between the film’s racial melodrama and the Alabama town’s hidden history of racial violence and the Ku Klux Klan activity, while arguing for the role race played in the political corruption that the film’s narrative exposes...|$|R
