40|$|Abstract. Java {{provides}} a specification for a user-defined general purpose <b>equivalence</b> <b>operator</b> for objects, but collections such as Set have more stringent requirements. This inconsistency breaks polymorphism: programmers must {{take care to}} follow Set’s contract rather than the more general Object contract if their object could enter a Set. We have dynamically profiled 30 Java applications {{to better understand the}} way programmers design their objects, to determine whether they program with collections in mind. Our results indicate that objects which enter collections behave very differently to objects which do not. Our findings should help developers understand the impact of design choices they make, and guide future language designers when adding support for collections and/or equality. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Weighted Opial-type inequalities {{are shown}} to be {{equivalent}} to weighted norm inequalities for sublinear operators and for nearly positive operators. Examples involving the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function and the non-increasing rearrange-ment are presented. Opial-type inequalities are related to norm inequalities much as quadratic forms are related to bilinear forms. A linear operator T on Hilbert space {{gives rise to the}} bilinear form (f, g) 7 → 〈Tf, g 〉 and the quadratic form f 7 → 〈Tf, f〉. Duality shows that the norm of T and the norm of the bilinear form coincide and a standard polarization argument shows that this norm is equivalent to but not necessarily equal to the norm of the quadratic form, called the numerical radius of T. In this paper, far from the luxuries of Hilbert spaces and linear operators, we show that the <b>equivalence</b> of <b>operator</b> norm and numerical radius persists. The work is in response to Richard Brown’s suggestion that Steven Bloom’s result [2, The-orem 1] which gives the <b>equivalence</b> for positive <b>operators</b> should apply in greater generality. Opial-type inequalities have been much studied since Opial’s original paper in 1960 and the papers [2], [3] and [4] include many references. After the main theorem showing equivalence of Opial-type and norm inequali-ties, an example involving the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function is included to illustrate that the equivalence cannot be taken in a pointwise sense. To show that the method can be readily applied to generate non-trivial inequal-ities from known norm inequalities we give a simple weight characterization of an Opial-type inequality for the non-increasing rearrangement...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{equivalence}} between two Hilbert spaces: (i) {{the space of}} states of $U(1) ^n$ Chern-Simons theory with a certain class of tridiagonal matrices of coupling constants (with corners) on $T^ 2 $; and (ii) the space of ground states of strings on an associated mapping torus with $T^ 2 $ fiber. The equivalence is deduced by studying the space of ground states of $SL(2,Z) $-twisted circle compactifications of $U(1) $ gauge theory, connected with a Janus configuration, and further compactified on $T^ 2 $. The equality of dimensions of the two Hilbert spaces (i) and (ii) is equivalent to a known identity on determinants of tridiagonal matrices with corners.

40|$|A {{study of}} the invertibility of the finite {{interval}} convolution operator is conducted using several different approaches. By establishing an <b>equivalence</b> to an <b>operator</b> acting on a space of functions defined on the real axis and using the corona theorem, the invertibility of the operator is studied for kernel functions for which a solution of the correspondent homogeneous Riemann-Hilbert problem is known thus enabling the study of invertibility for a class of symbols which includes the products of exponential polynomials by functions with Fourier spectra in (0, 1). Here, the main purpose is to enlarge the number of classes of symbols for which the invertibility of the operator can be completely studied. By establishing an <b>equivalence</b> to an <b>operator</b> acting on a space of functions defined on a system of two straight lines parallel to the real axis, the same ideas (the corona theorem) are used to study the invertibility for a wide class of kernel functions which satisfy a condition of the same type as above. Using this method include the products of exponential polynomials with Fourier spectra in (- 1, 1) by functions with Fourier spectra in (- 1, 1) but under conditions {{quite different from the}} previous class. These results are extended to Bessel potential spaces since these spaces often appear in the applications. As a last approach an algebraic perspective of the convolution operator is given by establishing an <b>equivalence</b> to an <b>operator</b> which is an element on an algebra generated by three idempotents with relations binding them which admits a matricial symbol. Here the main purpose is to give a different approach to the study of this operator which can, in the near future, allow for different classes to be studied and, above all, to give an example of an algebra with symbol which may be of some interest in the study of other operators or other operator algebrasAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
