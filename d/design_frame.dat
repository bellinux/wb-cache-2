Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs {{and in some cases}} outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( [...] or registered trademarks in some cases [...] ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic <b>design</b> <b>frame</b> ( [...] {{in the form of a}} badge or shield shape [...] ) and had each clubs individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post.|$|E

50|$|According to a 1988 {{study of}} Williamson County {{historical}} resources:Outside of Franklin, relatively few large brick and frame residences {{were built in}} the county. Notable exceptions include the Italianate style John Hunter House and Andrew Vaughn House. The Owen-Cox House on Moores Lane was also remodeled into an Italianate design during this period. One of the most significant houses built in the county after the war was the Y.M. Rizer House constructed on Del Rio Pike. Built ca. 1875, the house is a combination of Italianate and Second Empire detailing and is unique in the county. Important Italianate <b>design</b> <b>frame</b> dwellings built in the 1870s include the Henry Pointer House, Jordan-Williams House, the James Wilhoite House and the Thomas Critz House.|$|E

The design structural overstrength, the ductility supply, the plastic redistribution parameter, the supply reduction factor and the performance ratio of the frames under study are analysed. The 13, 608 <b>designed</b> <b>frames</b> under study have performance ratios higher than one mostly due to the high values of design structural overstrength, showing that the seismic supply produced by Eurocode 3 and Eurocode 8 restrains are always higher than the seismic demand.

50|$|The {{model was}} based on the {{prototype}} bus designed and built by FFG known as B1 (later this bus became KD1 in the CIÉ fleet) for CIÉ. The bus was built on an all welded integral <b>design</b> <b>frame.</b> The model was offered with a choice of engine/gearbox combinations, including the Detroit Diesel 6V71/Allison V730, the Cummins LT10/Voith D851, the Rolls Royce Eagle/ZF 4HP500 Ecomat and the Gardner 6LXB/ZF 4HP500 Ecomat. The GM combination ran on Rockwell axles, the remaining powerpacks driving on Kirkstall axles. Steering was provided by ZF, suspension by Dunlop pneumatics, shocks by Koni and the air system by Wabco. Door systems on the early production models were made by Keiert of Germany with later buses having Deans Doors systems. SWF provided the wiper system and many electrical components.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{design of}} Moment Resisting Steel Frames (MRSFs) is usually governed by drift limits rather than {{strength}} {{because of their}} high flexibility. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate the seismic performance of a 6 -story MRSF designed according to the Egyptian code with three different levels of allowable story drift limits: 0. 5 %, 0. 75 % and 1. 0 %. Seismic evaluation in this study has been carried out by static pushover analysis and time history earthquake analysis. Ten ground motions with different PGA levels are used in the analysis. The mean plus one standard deviation values of the roof-drift ratio, the maximum story drift ratio and the maximum beam- and column-strain responses are used as the basis for the seismic performance evaluations. The results obtained indicated that the strength and the initial stiffness of the <b>designed</b> <b>frames</b> decrease as the allowed story drift limit of the frame increases. Two of the <b>designed</b> <b>frames</b> exhibit maximum story drifts that are higher than the allowed limits specified by the code. The maximum story drift and beam-strain responses of the <b>designed</b> <b>frames</b> under the earthquake loading increase with the increase in the allowable story drift limits...|$|R
