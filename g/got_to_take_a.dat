500|$|Q {{performs}} her own stunts in the series. The actress {{liked to}} have her character [...] "be able to do her own thing," [...] as it is an action series where females play lead roles; during her film career, she noted [...] "but in movies, alongside big action men, we've always <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> step back and let the men shine. And in this, it's about the women who know what they're doing." [...] At some point Q set up a three-week long training period {{for the rest of}} the cast to make their fight scenes in the series believable; she had her partner, an action director, bring his stunt team to train them. In filming the stunts she was already used to working in an environment where filming in television would be faster than in American films, because of her time starring in films in Asia, which usually took two to six weeks.|$|E

I'm going {{straight}} to my boarding-house to dig with double vim, for I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> examination next week for a provincial school certificate. Next winter I'll be a flourishing pedagogue in some up-country district." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, it can't be helped. If I {{want to be}} a civil {{engineer}} I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> opening where I can get it. Besides, Mr. Ramsdell thinks it will be the best kind of training for Roger and me. He knows the men {{at the head of the}} Mentor Company, and will get them to give us every opportunity to advance ourselves. That, you know, will mean a great deal." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't {{see that}} we should be as well off to coop 'em up on the island. We've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> in <b>a</b> supply of water from there before it'll be safe to leave the harbor, an' they'd {{interfere}} with sich a job mightily." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've <b>got</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> chance with, {{some sort}} of a chance. I'd find a chance. I'll do that anyhow. I'll go away. I mean what I say--I'll stop trifling and shirking. If I don't come back it won't matter. If I do----" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{the singing}} he refused to wait till she came down the aisle, but hurried out into the open air away from the crowd. As Jack caught up with him he said: [...] "You go to bed; I've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> run out into the country or I can't sleep at all. Father will be up in the morning, I suppose.

60|$|You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> new {{resolution}} {{into your}} soul, and break {{off from the}} old way. You've got to know that you're a man, and being a man means you must go on alone, ahead of the woman, to break a way through the old world into the new. And you've got to be alone. And you've got to start off ahead. And if you don't know which direction to take, look round for the man your heart will point out to you. And follow--and never look back. Because if Lot's wife, looking back, was turned to a pillar of salt, these miserable men, for ever looking back to their women for guidance, they are miserable pillars of half-rotten tears.|$|E
6000|$|... "What do {{the other}} fellows do with their Harvard {{training}} when they go into business, as nine-tenths of them do? Business is business, whether you keep a hotel or import dry-goods or manufacture cotton or run a railroad or help a big trust to cheat legally. Harvard has <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> back seat {{when you get out}} of Harvard. But you don't suppose that keeping a summer hotel would mean living in the country the whole time, do you? That's the way mother does, but I shouldn't. It isn't good for the hotel, even. If I had such a place as Lion's Head, I should put a man and his family into it for the winter to look after it, and I should go to town myself--to Boston or New York, or I might go to London or Paris. They're not so far off, and it's so easy to get to them that you can hardly keep away." [...] Jeff laughed, and looked up at Westover from the log where he sat, whittling a pine stick; Westover sat on the stump from which the log had been felled eight or ten years before.|$|E
6000|$|... {{and much}} more to the same maudlin effect. In plain prose, the ardent Bullivant was all for {{the lower part of}} the young lady's face, and {{actually}} worried her, and Mr. Blyth, and everybody in the house, until he <b>got</b> leave <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> cast of it.|$|R
50|$|Nelly {{heard this}} and got angry. “Are you crazy,” she said. She turned to Kaps and said, “If {{you do that}} I’ll expose you! We are here to enjoy ourselves.” The next morning she {{purchased}} some tranquillizers and <b>got</b> him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> hot bath <b>to</b> relax him.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be <b>took</b> down <b>a</b> peg or two," [...] Skip said threateningly, as he doubled {{his fist}} and brandished it before Carrots's face.|$|R
6000|$|... "You got me.... Though {{the fellows}} usually call me 'Eddie'--Julius Edward Schwirtz is my full name--my father was named Julius, and my mother's oldest brother was named Edward--my old {{dad used to}} say it wasn't respectful to him because I always {{preferred}} 'Eddie'--old codger used to get quite het up about it. Julius sounds like you was an old Roman or something, and in the business {{you got to have}} a good easy name. Say, speaking of that, I ain't with Lowry any more; I'm chief salesman for the Ætna Automobile Varnish and Wax Company. I certainly got a swell territory--New York, Philly, Bean-Town, Washi'nun, Balt'more, Cleveland, Columbus, Akron, and so on, and of course most especially Detroit. Sell right direct to the jobbers and the big auto companies. Good bunch of live wires. Some class! I'm rolling in my little old four thousand bucks a year now, where before I didn't hardly make more 'n twenty-six or twenty-eight hundred. Keeps me on the jump alrightee. Fact. I got so tired and run-down-- I hadn't planned to take any vacation at all, but the boss himself says to me, 'Eddie, we can't afford to let you get sick; you're the best man we've got,' he says, 'and you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> good vacation now and forget all about business for a couple weeks.' 'Well,' I says, 'I was just wondering if you was smart enough to get along without me if I was to sneak out and rubber at some scenery and maybe get up a flirtation with a pretty summer girl'--and I guess that must be you, Miss Golden!--and he laughs and says, 'Oh yes, I guess the business wouldn't go bust for a few days,' and so I goes down and gets a shave and a hair-cut and a singe and a shampoo--there ain't as much to cut as there used to be, though--ha, ha!--and here I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "we'll get to business. I've {{a word or}} two to say {{first to}} you, Hickson, and my other friends. We've none of us been idlers in the world. We started out to make money, and we've made it. We're {{probably}} worth more than any other five men in the world. We can control the finance of every nation, we can rule the money markets of every capital in Europe. Personally I'm satisfied. I guess you are. It seems, however, that our wives aren't. I'm sorry for it, but it can't be helped. They want something that dollars in the ordinary way can't buy. This scheme is to meet that case. It's my wife's idea--my wife's and Mr. de Valentin's between them. I take it that if you go into it you'll go into it {{for the same reason that}} I do--for your wives' sakes. I want to make this clear, for I tell you frankly I think it's the biggest fool's game I've ever taken a hand in. I'm proud of my name, if my wife isn't. If any one got calling me Monsieur le Duc of anything, I guess my fingers 'd itch to knock him down. If our wives, however, won't be happy till they hear themselves called Madame la Duchesse, I suppose we've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> back seat. Mr. de Valentin here says that he's the rightful King of France. I know nothing about history, but no doubt he's right. He says, too, that in their hearts the French people want him on the throne, and, with money, he says he could find his way there. The bargain is, I understand, that we find the money, and he establishes our wives well amongst the aristocracy of France. He asks for twelve million dollars, that is two millions each. If my wife asks me to, I shall put my lot down, much as I should buy her the Czar of Russia's crown if it came on the market, and she wanted it. It's for you to say whether you want to come in. If you want to ask any questions, there's Mr. de Valentin. He's come over to fix the thing up, and I guess he's prepared to give you all particulars." ...|$|E

50|$|The Reys’ cottage {{soon became}} an {{intellectual}} {{center for the}} town, hosting book clubs, discussion groups, {{and the opportunity to}} watch a children's author at work.
