25|$|As {{described}} in the abstract of his log made by Bartolome de Las Casas, on the outward <b>bound</b> <b>voyage</b> Columbus recorded two sets of distances. Las Casas originally interpreted that he reported the shorter distances to his crew so they would not worry about sailing too far from Spain. However, according to Oliver Dunn and James Kelley, this was a misunderstanding by Las Casas. Columbus did report two distances each day but one was in measurements he normally used, {{the other in the}} Portuguese maritime leagues used by his crew.|$|R

50|$|The Centurion {{arrived at}} Marseilles, on her outward <b>bound</b> <b>voyage</b> after {{delivering}} her goods, she remained there {{for more than}} five weeks, taking in lading, and then intended to return to England. When she was ready to depart from Marseilles, there were other smaller sundry ships. Their masters of which interested Robert Bradshaw of Limehouse, the master of the Centurion, to stay a day or two for them until they could get in readiness to depart. They agreed that it would be far better for them all to go in company for mutual support and defence, than to run the hazard of falling {{into the hands of the}} Spanish galleys in the Straits as they had done the year before. Bradshaw agreed and set out along with them all engaging mutually to stand by each other, if they chanced to fall in with any of the Spanish galleys. The Spanish meanwhile had sent six galleys from Cartagena, part of a squadron of twelve under Giovanni Andrea Doria, to convey the Spanish ambassador to Rome.|$|R

5000|$|On 14 November, the warship {{passed between}} Capes Henry and Charles and laid {{in a course}} for the Mediterranean Sea. Steaming in company with a quartet of DesRon 32 destroyers that {{included}} Beales sister ship and frequent colleague , she arrived in Pollensa Bay, Majorca, on the 24th. She spent the bulk of her last deployment in the western Mediterranean, sailing east of the Italian [...] "boot" [...] only once when she entered the Adriatc in late January 1968 to call at Split, Yugoslavia. Her activities in the western basin consisted of a mix of exercises - unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral in composition - and visits {{to a variety of}} French and Italian ports, as well as one brief call at Malta. After being relieved by [...] at Málaga, Spain, Beale got underway for Norfolk on Easter Sunday 1968. A note of sadness, however, intruded upon the satisfaction usually associated with a homeward <b>bound</b> <b>voyage.</b> Of the four DesRon 32 ships that had accompanied her to the Mediterranean the previous fall, only three joined her in the return trip. A storm at Rhodes early in February had reduced Bache, her frequent comrade over the years, to an unsalvageable wreck. Beale and her depleted complement of traveling companions arrived back in Hampton Roads on 23 April.|$|R
