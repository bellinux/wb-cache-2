During the first night, {{as he and his}} father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the Kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the <b>electric</b> <b>fence.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nairobi National Park is a {{national}} park in Kenya. Established in 1946, the national park was Kenya's first. It is located approximately 7 kilometres (4mi) south of the centre of Nairobi, Kenya's capital city, with an <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> separating the park's wildlife from the metropolis. Nairobi's skyscrapers {{can be seen from}} the park. The proximity of urban and natural environments has caused conflicts between the animals and local people and threatens animals' migration routes.|$|E

5|$|The {{state of}} grizzly bear populations in Banff {{is seen as}} a proxy for {{ecological}} integrity. To keep bears away from humans, an <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> was put up around the summer gondola and parking lot at Lake Louise in 2001. Bear-proof garbage cans, which do not allow bears to access their contents, help to deter them from human sites. The fruit of Buffaloberry bushes is eaten by bears, so the bushes have been removed in some areas where the risk of a bear–human encounter is high.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the invasion, {{significant}} numbers of Belgian men had attempted to flee the occupied territories to join the Belgian army on the Yser front, via the Netherlands which were neutral. In order to stop this, the Germans began work on a barbed wire and <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> across the length of the border. The fence, dubbed the Wire of Death (Dodendraad), was also guarded by German sentries. Between 2,000 and 3,000 civilians are believed to have been killed attempting to cross the border during the conflict.|$|E

25|$|Under close security, prisoners {{usually have}} one- or two-person cells {{operated}} from {{a remote control}} station. Each cell has its own toilet and sink. Inmates may leave their cells for work assignments or correctional programs and otherwise may be allowed in a common area in the cellblock or an exercise yard. The fences are generally double fences with watchtowers housing armed guards, plus often a third, lethal-current <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> in the middle.|$|E

25|$|After Carnegie's death, an <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> {{was built}} around Points North Landing's {{landfill}} {{to prevent future}} predatory animal incidents. Eleven years later, a lone timber wolf attacked a young male twenty-six-year-old worker in Cigar Lake. The worker was on his midnight break when it jumped and mauled him less than one hundred meters from the main camp. A nearby female security guard frightened the wolf away. She administered first aid and called for an air ambulance, which airlifted him six hundred and seventy-five kilometres {{to a hospital in}} Saskatoon, where he recovered. After the attack, authorities ordered that wolves in the area be tracked down and shot. In addition, authorities required food disposal systems and inspected the fence around Cigar Lake's landfill, as well as providing more education to the mining staff members.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} exotic water fleas have accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Great Lakes, such as the spiny waterflea, Bythotrephes longimanus, and the fishhook waterflea, Cercopagis pengoi, potentially having {{an effect on the}} zooplankton population. Several species of crayfish have also been introduced that may contend with native crayfish populations. More recently an <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> has been set up across the Chicago Sanitary and Ship Canal in order to keep several species of invasive Asian carp out of the area. These fast-growing planktivorous fish have heavily colonized the Mississippi and Illinois river systems. The sea lamprey, which has been particularly damaging to the native lake trout population, is another example of a marine invasive species in the Great Lakes. Invasive species, particularly zebra and quagga mussels, may be at least partially responsible for the collapse of the deepwater demersal fish community in Lake Huron, as well as drastic unprecedented changes in the zooplankton community of the lake.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>fences</b> {{are useful}} for {{controlling}} the movements of wild animals. Examples include deterring deer from entering private property, keeping animals off airport runways, keeping wild boar from raiding crops, and preventing geese from soiling areas used by people. <b>Electric</b> <b>fencing</b> has been extensively used in environmental situations reducing the conflict between elephants or other animals and humans in Africa and Asia.|$|R
5000|$|Changes in laws. In some jurisdictions, {{certain types}} of {{electrical}} outputs for fences were unlawful until the 1950s or 1960s. In other areas, signage requirements and other restrictions limited usability. Many US cities continue to have outdated laws prohibiting <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> to prevent agricultural fences from entering the city. Houston in Texas for example, changed their ordinance that prohibited <b>electric</b> <b>fencing</b> in 2008.|$|R
25|$|After his 2011 arrest, Jaishankar {{was kept}} at the Parappana Agrahara Central Jail in Bangalore. He {{was sentenced to}} 27 years in prison. At the Bangalore jail, he {{underwent}} treatment for psychiatric problems. On 31 August 2013, the police took Jaishankar to the court in Tumkur near Bangalore. After returning, Jaishankar feigned uneasiness and {{was admitted to the}} hospital within the prison premises. He managed to secure a duplicate key and used it at 2 am on 1 September 2013, when the daily change of guards took place. The police suspected that an insider helped him get the duplicate key. He scaled a 20-foot wall, then walked atop a 15-foot wall and finally scaled the 30-foot high compound wall. He managed to cross the <b>electric</b> <b>fence</b> safely, since it was not functional that night. He reportedly carried with him a bamboo pole balancing on the walls and a bedsheet to serve as a cushion over the glass pieces on the wall top. He was injured during the escape, and drops of blood were found outside the outer wall. He was reportedly wearing a police uniform during his escape. 11 Jail staff, including 3 wardens, 2 jailors and 6 security guards, were suspended following his escape.|$|E

40|$|Elephants {{are one of}} the 'big five' {{wildlife}} species; {{their survival}} is one of the 'holy grails' of conservation. Unfortunately, because of their size and migratory behaviour, elephants often come into conflict with people. This is especially true in densely populated Southeast Asia. This study from Sri Lanka looks at one strategy to address this problem - <b>electric</b> <b>fences.</b> It found that, although <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> do help to mitigate conflicts between elephants and humans, they do not completely eliminate the problem and do not offer a 'stand alone' solutions. The study looked at why <b>electric</b> <b>fences</b> do not work and found that poor, ad-hoc decisions were the key factor determining success or failure. This implies the need for an integrated approach {{to solve the problem of}} human-elephant conflict (HEC). Such an approach should involve comprehensive land use planning and habitat enrichment along side well-planned <b>electric</b> <b>fencing</b> where appropriate.
