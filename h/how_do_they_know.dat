60|$|That {{the animals}} do {{practice}} at times a rude kind {{of medicine and}} surgery upon themselves is undeniable. The only question about it is, <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>know?</b> To {{say it is a}} matter of instinct is but begging the question. It is also three-fourths foolishness, for many of the things that animals do are beyond the farthest scope of instinct. The case of the deer that moved about and so saved his life, instead of sleeping on heavily to his death, may be partly a case of instinct. Personally it seems to me more a matter of experience; for a fawn under the same circumstances, unless his mother were near to keep him moving, would undoubtedly lie down and die. More than that, it seems to be largely a matter of obedience to the strongest impulse of the moment, to which all animals are accustomed or trained from their birthday. And that is not quite the same thing as instinct, unless one is disposed to go to the extreme of Berkeley's philosophy and make instinct a kind of spirit-personality that watches over animals all the time. Often the knowledge of healing or of primitive surgery seems to be the discovery or possession of a few rare individual animals, instead of being spread widecast among the species, as instincts are. This knowledge, or what-you-may-call-it, is sometimes shared, and so hints at a kind of communication among animals, of whose method we catch only fleeting glimpses and suggestions--but that will be the subject of another article. The object of this is, not to answer the questions of how or whence, but simply to suggest one or two things I have seen in the woods as the basis for further and more detailed observations.|$|E

I grew moody, silent, and unsocial, but studied on doggedly and incessantly. The only person with whom I held any conversation was the worthy man in whose house I was quartered. He was honest and well meaning, but perfectly ignorant, and I believe would have liked me much better if I had not been so much addicted to reading. He considered all books filled with lies and impositions, and seldom could look into one without finding something to rouse his spleen. Nothing put him into a greater passion than the assertion that the world turned on its own axis every four-and-twenty hours. He swore it was an outrage upon common sense.

50|$|The {{debate of}} BeanBag Genetics has been {{occurring}} {{for many years}} now. One thing scientist have agreed on is that BeanBag genetics is too simplistic {{and needs to be}} built upon. Sir Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright are two scientist that were once apart of this debate. Fisher's assumptions were that traits are determined by many loci, populations are well mixed, and mating is random. Wright's assumptions were his Shifting balance theory that included: Random Drift, Individual selection, and Interdeme Selection. As both argue their theories, people agree with Fisher's theory because it works and is a well developed theory. Other people agree with Wright because his theory is closer to the real world and provides an aesthetically pleasing view of evolution. Even though both theories have parts that are right they both are wrong as well. Fisher's theory does not explain the diversity of the world and Wright's theory is just a metaphor not a well developed theory.

50|$|Over his career, he {{has worked}} {{on a wide variety}} of {{problems}} ranging from drug design to user interfaces to computer security. His current focus is on ways that computer science methods can help advance ecological science and improve our management of the Earth's ecosystems. This passion has led to several projects including research in wildfire management, invasive vegetation and understanding the distribution and migration of birds. For example, Dietterich's research is helping scientists at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology answer questions like: How do birds decide to migrate north? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> <b>know</b> when to land and stop over for a few days? How do they choose where to make a nest? Tens of thousands of volunteer birdwatchers (citizen scientists) all over the world contribute data to the study by submitting their bird sightings to the eBird website. The amount of data is overwhelming - in March 2012 they had over 3.1 million bird observations. Machine learning can uncover patterns in data to model the migration of species. But there are many other applications for the same techniques which will allow organizations to better manage our forests, oceans, and endangered species, as well as improve traffic flow, water systems, the electrical power grid, and more.|$|E
