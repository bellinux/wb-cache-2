40|$|Sustainability {{has become}} the key goal {{in every aspect of}} the {{environment}} especially in the diverse urban systems. Sustainable practices require a controlled setting within an urban system where their practicality and efficacy could be assessed. The aim of the thesis is to establish an environmental assessment tool based on urban metabolism approach to assist decision-making during environmental and economic assessment. The outcome provides understanding on the means of integrating carbon footprint and monetary factor to oversee the expenditure of a nation in general, or a household or an individual in particular, in relation to global warming potential. This study applied a retrospective cross sectional study to provide a form of environmental assessment in developing economic-environmental input-output model for greenhouse gases emission monitoring and climate change adaptation. Methodologically, the potential impact from economic sectors’ contribution on greenhouse gas emissions which eventually leads to global warming and climate change was quantitatively assessed. Firstly, the contribution of greenhouse gas emission from each economic activity was examined. Secondly, the association of greenhouse gas emissions with gross output value from each economic activity was assessed to ascertain the greenhouse gas intensity. Finally, a preliminary environmental-economic input-output tool were developed for potential global warming forecasting assessment and improving the surveillance system of each target <b>economic</b> <b>sector</b> <b>concerning</b> climate change. The input-output analysis method development found that Barcelona with 14 <b>economic</b> <b>sectors</b> has carbon dioxide emission to be 24. 44 kg CO 2 - eq. /cap/day. The method adaptation to Malaysia resulted with greenhouse gas emission of all 120 economic activities with 4. 87 kg CO 2 - eq. /cap/day. Greenhouse gases from waste management was not captured in the input-output matrices. The waste management section was managed but the introduction to Material Flow Analysis approach which resulted with 4. 5 kg/capita/ day of solid waste for Klang Valley. The economic input-output model of a nation or region is an analytical tool that describes the structure of one nation or region’s economy. A derived matrix from the economic input-output table is expanded to express global warming potential which describes its total global warming impact relative to carbon dioxide emission over a set period of time. The estimation of carbon footprint from monetary fluxes is vital in the environmental health impact assessment as sustainable urban planning and sustainable economy are complimentary of one another. This study contributes to quantitatively analyse the physical input-output relationships among the socioeconomic components with the findings on the distribution of environmental impacts, thereby providing scientific model support to guide restructuring of metabolic system especially urban metabolic system. The use of publicly available data to assemble the matrix representation enables comprehensive assessment of the environmental impacts of a product or service with effective cost, in a relatively fast and high-technology manner...|$|R

Ed-tech market totalled $ 8. 38 billion in the 2012 – 2013 {{academic}} year, which is up from $ 7. 9 billion the year before, and up 11. 7 per cent from 2009. K- 12 online course revenue including any digital curriculum increased some 320 % and the testing and assessment market, the largest single category, generated $ 2. 5 billion. The New Zealand business organisation EDTechNZ, indicates on its website that educational technology is the fastest growing sector of a global smart education market worth US$ 100 billion, forecast to grow to US$ 394 by 2019.

40|$|The {{objective}} of foresight (future studies) is to enlighten decision-makers, by exploring collectively {{the sphere of}} possible “futures” and bringing out different scenarios for the future. CETIOM has carried out such an approach {{in order to assess}} oilseed (rapeseed and sunflower) competitiveness in France and Europe, taking into account the European and worldwide context by 2010 - 2015. The competition between domestic oilseeds and other sources of fats takes place at all levels of production, transformation and consumption processes. Thus, this future study has involved about 150 people from several scientific fields, economic bodies and institutions. The overall methodology used has been designed by INRA and is based on a systemic view of the various issues addressed and requires graphic representation models. Seven strategic topics have been set {{up at the end of}} this work: agricultures and their relationships with the economic environment the role of information on fat consumption the consideration of nutritional recommendations made by the transformation industries the evolution of animal feeding models the place of oilseeds within production systems oilseeds and the environmental challenge the impact of non-food uses as a driven force for oilseed development. For each of these seven topics, various scenarios were drawn up as well as their consequences on oilseed competitiveness and on the future of the <b>economic</b> and social <b>sectors</b> <b>concerned...</b>|$|R
40|$|Jordi Escartín Department of Social Psychology, Facultad de Psicologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Passeig de la Vall d’Hebrón, Barcelona, Spain Abstract: Research on {{effectiveness}} of workplace bullying interventions has lagged behind descriptive studies on this topic. The literature on bullying intervention research {{has only recently}} expanded {{to a point that}} allows for synthesis of findings across empirical studies. This study addresses the question of whether workplace bullying can be reduced in prevalence and consequences, if so to what extent and by which strategies and interventions. It opens with a brief overview of the nature of bullying at work and discussion of some precursors and existing interventions. However, its principal focus is on the findings obtained from selected (quasi-) experimental longitudinal studies on antibullying interventions, drawing together the results of studies conducted in Europe, USA, and Australia, including several <b>economic</b> <b>sectors,</b> and <b>concerned</b> about primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention programs and strategies. Additional emphasis is considered from the psychosocial drivers highlighted both from prescriptive and cross-sectional studies and factual empirical studies. One randomized control study and seven quasiexperimental longitudinal studies were identified by searching electronic databases and bibliographies and via contact with experts. The majority of outcomes evidenced some level of change, mostly positive, suggesting that workplace bullying interventions are more likely to affect knowledge, attitudes, and self-perceptions, but actual bullying behaviors showed much more mixed results. In general, growing effectiveness was stated as the level of intervention increased from primary to tertiary prevention. However, methodological problems relating to the evaluation designs in most studies do not allow direct attribution of these findings to the interventions. Overall, the evaluation of antibullying interventions must flourish and be improved, requiring close cooperation between practitioners and academics to design, implement, and evaluate effective interventions based on grounded theoretical and methodological approaches. Finally, this systematic review highlights future directions for enhancing the adoption, high-quality implementation, and dissemination of evidence-based workplace bullying prevention and intervention programs.
