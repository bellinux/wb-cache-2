40|$|The {{continuous}} sulfur {{reduction in}} diesel fuel {{has resulted in}} poor fuel lubricity and engine pump failure, a fact {{that led to the}} development of a number of methods that measure the actual fuel lubricity level. However, lubricity measurement is costly and time consuming, and a number of predictive models have been developed in the past, based mainly on various fuel properties. In the present paper, a black box modeling approach is proposed, where the lubricity is approximated by a radial basis function (RBF) neural network that uses other fuel properties as inputs. The HFRR apparatus was used for lubricity measurements. In the present model, the variables used included the diesel fuel conductivity, density, kinematic viscosity at 40 degreesC, sulfur content and 90 % <b>distillation</b> <b>point,</b> which produced the smallest error in the validation data.

" Exhaust emissions from both gasoline- and diesel-fueled vehicles have been investigated with respect to regulated pollutants (carbon monoxide [CO], hydrocarbon [HC], nitrogen oxides [NOx], and particulate), unregulated pollutants, and in bioassay tests (Ames test, TCDD receptor affinity tests). Unregulated pollutants present in both the particle- and the semi-volatile phases were characterized.

It was confirmed that there exists a quantifiable relationship between diesel-fuel variables of the fuel blends, the chemical composition of the emissions, and their biological effects.

40|$|Mathematical {{expressions}} {{are presented}} in this paper that correlate the exhaust emissions from a single-cylinder diesel engine {{with some of the most}} important properties of the fuels used. Exhaust emissions measured were carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. The experiments were performed using a matrix of 68 fuels, The cetane number of the fuels covered the range 42 - 58, the density varied between 0. 84 and 0. 860 g/mL, and the sulfur content varied from 0. 05 to 0. 20 wt 40, All predictions were based on specific points of the distillation curve, the cetane number, and the density of the fuels. In the case of particulate matter emissions, sulfur content was also employed. Very good predictions were obtained for all the emissions considered.

50|$|Another {{method that}} fuel-users control quality is {{by using the}} cetane index (CI), which is a {{calculated}} number based on the density and distillation range of the fuel. There are various versions of this, depending on whether metric or Imperial units are used, and how many <b>distillation</b> <b>points</b> are used. These days most oil companies use the '4-point method', ASTM D4737, based on density, 10% 50% and 90% recovery temperatures. The '2-point method' is defined in ASTM D976, and uses just density and the 50% recovery temperature. This 2-point method tends to overestimate cetane index and is not recommended. Cetane index calculations {{can not account for}} cetane improver additives and therefore do not measure total cetane number for additized diesel fuels. Diesel engine operation is primarily related to the actual cetane number and the cetane index is simply an estimation of the base (unadditized) cetane number.|$|R

Two types of diesel fuels – low sulfur diesel (LSD) and {{ultra low sulfur diesel}} (ULSD) fuels with 500 ppm and 50 ppm sulfur contents respectively and 3 driving modes corresponding to 25 %, 50 % and 100 % power were used. Elements {{present in the}} tailpipe emissions were quantified by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and those found in measurable quantities included Mg, Ca, Cr, Fe, Cu, Zn, Ti, Ni, Pb, Be, P, Se, Ti and Ge. Multivariate analyses using multi-criteria decision making methods (MCDM), principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) facilitated the extraction of information about the structure of the data. MCDM showed that the emissions of the elements were strongly influenced by the engine driving conditions while the PCA loadings plots showed that the emissions factors of the elements were correlated with those of other pollutants such as particle number, total suspended particles, CO, CO 2 and NOx. Partial least square analysis revealed that the emission factors of the elements were strongly dependent on the fuel parameters such as the fuel sulfur content, fuel density, <b>distillation</b> <b>point</b> and cetane index. Strong correlations were also observed between these pollutants and the engine power or exhaust temperature.

40|$|Achieving robust {{combustion}} {{while also}} yielding low hydrocarbon (HC) emissions {{is difficult for}} the first cycle of cranking during the cold start of a Port Fuel Injected (PFI) Spark Ignition (SI) engine. Cold intake port wall and valve temperatures, near-atmospheric manifold pressure, and low port air velocity combine to create an adverse environment for fuel delivery - the process of injecting and vaporizing liquid fuel to create a combustible air-fuel mixture. As a result, {{only a small fraction}} of the injected fuel mass contributes to the combustible mixture; the fraction is less than 10 % at cold ambient temperatures. With fast light off catalysts, the first cycle produces a significant portion of the total trip emissions. The low fuel delivery fraction results in high residual liquid fuel in both the port and cylinder; this fuel contributes significantly to the exhaust HC emissions. Since the first cycle engine control is open-loop, the Engine Control Unit (ECU) must determine how much fuel to inject under given conditions - temperature, pressure, and for a given fuel. Fuel properties play a significant role in first cycle fuel delivery, since the energy available for vaporization is a limiting factor in fuel delivery. The effect of fuel properties on fuel delivery for the first cycle was quantified at a wide range of cold start temperatures by using a skip-firing strategy to simulate the first cycle of cranking on a production PFI engine. Four fuels between 1083 and 1257 Driveability Index (DI) were tested, and the fuel delivery results have been correlated to properties of the ASTM distillation curve. The fractional <b>distillation</b> <b>point</b> that correlates to fuel delivery is a function of temperature - at colder temperatures, the results(cont.) correlate with the more volatile end of the distillation curve. Fuel delivery results for the fuels were also simulated with a thermodynamics-based fuel delivery model based on partial equilibrium with the charge air. by Kevin R. Lang. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The <b>distillation</b> <b>point</b> {{efficiencies}} for the alcohol-water binary, ternary and quaternary {{systems were}} measured using a modified Oldershaw column. This column is expanded above the tray {{to separate the}} newly formed bubbles from the column wall, thus eliminating the surface tension induced wall effects for positive systems and discouraging wetted wall effects. The excessive and recirculating foam and froth found in the conventional Oldershaw column is due to these wall effects and does not represent conditions in large scale distillation. The point efficiencies measured using this column for the system methanol/water were lower than the point efficiencies deduced from the composition profiles across a large and narrow rectangular distillation column using an eddy diffusion model. The narrow rectangular column had a liquid flow path length of about one meter, thus avoiding stagnant zones and flow non-uniformities. The lower efficiencies were due to the shorter contact time between the gas and the liquid. This contact time was increased markedly by fitting an outlet weir to the modified Oldershaw column, thus increasing the tray liquid hold-up and the point efficiencies. These point efficiencies were about 10 per cent lower than those on the large tray at a similar value of the F. Factor. The eddy diffusion model predicted rectangular tray efficiencies about 10 to 20 per cent lower than those measured, when using the improved modified column point efficiencies. Using a suitable model, the improved point efficiencies were scaled-up to the conditions existing on the rectangular tray. This resulted in the large tray values of 2 to 4 per cent lower tray efficiencies than those measured. The surface tension effect on the point efficiencies of the binary systems MeOH/n. PrOH using the original modified Oldershaw column {{in the absence of}} wall effects using the concept of the Marangoni stabilising index. The surface tension of these systems were measured using a glass thermometer. The system MeOH/H 20 had the highest Marangoni index and showed the highest point efficiencies throughout the composition range, with the EtOH/H 2 O/n. PrOH, with low values of the Marangoni index, showed comparable point efficiencies throughout the composition range. These systems demonstrate all the possible types of surface tension behaviour. The effects of the outlet weir height and hole size on the point efficiencies in the rectangular column operating under similar hydrodynamic conditions were also investigated using the system MeOH/H 2 O. There was an increase in point and tray efficiencies on increasing the outlet weir height from 2 mm to 12. 7 mm. There was also small increase in point and tray efficiencies on decreasing the hole size from 6. 4 mm to 1 mm at the expense of higher pressure drops. The point efficiencies of these trays under different hydraulic conditions were in the range 85 to 95 per cent, with subsequent high tray efficiencies. This provides further evidence of the high tray efficiencies available to the design engineer if the detrimental effects of stagnant zones and flow non-uniformities were eliminated. Two highly non-ideal ternary systems and quaternary system were also studied using the original modified Oldershaw and the rectangular columns. Considerable differences between the individual component point efficiencies were observed. These differences are probably caused by the interactive nature of the mass transfer in these systems. These systems also exhibited equal component point efficiencies in parts of the composition range, which illustrates the composition dependency of these systems. The individual component tray efficiencies for these systems were noticeably different, even with equal component point efficiencies operating across the tray. These differences were simulated using the eddy diffusion model, highlighting the effects of limited liquid back mixing on the tray. The composition profile for the system MeOH/EtOH/H 20 were predicted and compared with the measurements across the rectangular column using three methods derived from the original Maxwell and Stephan mass transfer equations. These predictions were in good agreement with the measurements. However, as the comparison is only based on a one meter flow path length, the actual design of distillation column using these methods would be conservative. The prediction of the composition profiles using the point efficiencies from the original version of the modified 0 ldershaw column yielded a similar observation for both the ternaries and the quaternary system. An expanded aluminium tray (Expamet 607 A) was also subject to preliminary efficiency tests in the rectangular column. This material has corrugated angled holes, thus encouraging the liquid flow across the tray by using the vapour momentum. This material showed much lower pressure drops, due to its high open area compared with conventional sieve trays, and discourages weeping and entrainment...|$|E

Below the bottom trace, only the liquid phase is in equilibrium. The top trace illustrates the vapor composition above the liquid at a given temperature. Above the top trace, only the vapor is in equilibrium. Between the two traces, liquid and vapor phases exist simultaneously in equilibrium: for example, heating a 25% X : 75% Y mixture to temperature AB would generate vapor of composition B over liquid of composition A. The azeotrope is the point on the diagram where the two curves touch. The horizontal and vertical steps show the path of repeated <b>distillations.</b> <b>Point</b> A is the boiling point of a nonazeotropic mixture. The vapor that separates at that temperature has composition B. The shape of the curves requires that the vapor at B be richer in constituent X than the liquid at point A. The vapor is physically separated from the VLE (vapor-liquid equilibrium) system and is cooled to point C, where it condenses. The resulting liquid (point C) is now richer in X than it was at point A. If the collected liquid is boiled again, it progresses to point D, and so on. The stepwise progression shows how repeated distillation can never produce a distillate that is richer in constituent X than the azeotrope. Note that starting {{to the right of}} the azeotrope point results in the same stepwise process closing in on the azeotrope point from the other direction.|$|R

Alcohol is a chemical that is produced from raw materials such as starch mangandun crodp cassava, sweet sago jalardan usually called bioethanol. Alcohol has a boiling point of 78 ᵒC while the water 100 ᵒC. Therefore when heated alcohol will evaporate first from the water. In the alcoholic fermentation of 10 %, a simple distillation process at a temperature of 79 - 82 ᵒC will result in 40 - 45 % alcohol content.

Comparisons of FID and NPD peak areas {{as a function of}} temperature are given for 0 %, 10 %, 15 % and 30 % oxygen. The NPD peak areas, as well as the FID peak areas, are contrasted separately. ^ The initial development of a method for distinguishing condensed ring aromatic systems from alkyl substituted aromatic systems was accomplished. N, 2, 4, 6 -tetrachloroacetanilide was reacted with standards and with an aromatic fraction of shale oil. Mass spectral analysis and specific element detection (for carbon and chlorine), with a microwave emission detector (MED), were performed on the reaction products. Chlorination of alkyl groups occurred. The formation of olefins was documented, contrary to literature reports. ^ Gas and liquid chromatographic methods for several organoarsenic compounds were developed. The stability of some pentacoordinate organoarsenic compounds was investigated by thermogravimetry. The concentration of arsenic in boiling <b>point</b> <b>distillation</b> cuts of shale oil and in concentrated fractions from liquid chromatographic class separations were obtained by x-ray fluorescence and by inductively coupled plasma with hydride generation. The analysis of shale oil on the GC-MED system was attempted and although a detection limit of 0. 4 picograms/second was obtained on the arsenic 228. 8 nanometer line no arsenic species could be identified. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, oils {{extracted}} from four crops, Jatropha curcas L., Croton megalocarpus Hutch, Calodendrum capense (L. f.) Thunb. (cape chestnut) and Cocos nucifera L. (coconut) were transesterified in methanol using sodium hydroxide as a catalyst. Methyl esters obtained {{were characterized by}} GC-MS and further tested for fuel properties relative to convectional diesel fuels (automotive and kerosene). Methyl esters of commercial oils: sunflower and soybean were also tested for fuel properties for comparison. Some of parameters tested included kinematic viscosity, flash <b>point,</b> <b>distillation</b> temperatures, copper corrosion, cetane number, ash content, and gross heating value. The results showed hexadecanoate and octadecanoate were common fatty acids esters identified in the four analyzed methyl esters. Total unsaturation was highest for Croton ester with 86. 6 %, Jatropha and C. capense esters had unsaturation of 65. 2 % and 61. 2 %, respectively, while coconut ester recorded only 2. 8 %. The ester viscosities at 40 ° C were with range of 4. 16 - 4. 63 mm 2 /s except coconut ester with viscosity 2. 71 mm 2 /s, which is close to that of kerosene 2. 35 mm 2 /s. The esters {{were found to be}} less volatile that diesel fuels with coconut esters registering as most volatile among the esters. Esters of sunflower and soybean have their volatility very close to that of Jatropha ester. The flash points of the esters were typically much higher (> 100 ° C) than petroleum diesels, automotives and kerosene (74 and 45. 5 ° C, respectively). Jatropha, sunflower and soybean esters passed the ASTM standard D 6751 for flash point; 130 ° C minimum, all the esters however were within the European standard EN- 14214 for biodiesel of above 101 ° C. The density of the esters was found to be 2 - 4 % higher than that of petroleum automotive diesel and 10 - 12 % more than that of kerosene. The heating values of the esters were however 12 % lower than diesel fuels on average. In general, coconut esters were found to compare well with kerosene {{while the rest of the}} esters showed properties very close to that of automotive diesel and can thus be used as neat or blended fuels in diesel engines without any modifications...|$|R
