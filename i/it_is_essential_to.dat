5|$|Volcanic ashfall {{is likely}} to have major effects on these systems. Ash will clog intake structures, cause {{abrasion}} damage to pumps and block pipes, settling ponds and open filters. High levels of turbidity are very likely to interfere with disinfection treatment and doses may have to be adjusted to compensate. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> monitor chlorine residuals in the distribution system.|$|E
5|$|Using {{the power}} of a {{powerful}} substance known as aer, mankind is in an age of discovery and prosperity. The crystallized form of aer, which is known as Apatheia, {{is considered to be a}} very powerful energy source as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> human life. To protect towns from attacks by monsters, large amounts of Apatheia are being produced to create barriers around towns. One day, in a forest near the town of Shizontania, Yuri Lowell and Flynn Scifo, two knights who have just joined the Niren Corps, together with two of their senior knights and fellow Corps members, Hisca and Chastel, are sent on a mission to investigate an abnormal gushing of aer in the area.|$|E
5|$|No {{medications}} directly {{treat the}} core symptoms of AS. Although {{research into the}} efficacy of pharmaceutical intervention for AS is limited, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> diagnose and treat comorbid conditions. Deficits in self-identifying emotions or in observing effects of one's behavior on others can {{make it difficult for}} individuals with AS to see why medication may be appropriate. Medication can be effective in combination with behavioral interventions and environmental accommodations in treating comorbid symptoms such as anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, inattention and aggression. The atypical antipsychotic medications risperidone and olanzapine have been shown to reduce the associated symptoms of AS; risperidone can reduce repetitive and self-injurious behaviors, aggressive outbursts and impulsivity, and improve stereotypical patterns of behavior and social relatedness. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and sertraline have been effective in treating restricted and repetitive interests and behaviors.|$|E

25|$|Disturbance {{of native}} plant {{communities}} in desertification-threatened areas is often followed by degradation {{of physical and}} biological soil properties, soil structure, nutrient availability, and organic matter.

25|$|In shogi, strong {{defensive}} fortifications {{protecting the}} king {{are known as}} castles.

25|$|Administering a too-dilute or too-concentrated {{solution}} can {{disrupt the}} patient's balance of sodium, potassium, magnesium, and other electrolytes.

Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.|$|E
