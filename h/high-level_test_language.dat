Eighteen healthy subjects between 21 and 64  years participated in <b>language</b> ability <b>tests,</b> and subsequent functional MRI scans measuring brain activity {{in response to a}} sentence completion and a word fluency task. Performance in both reading and <b>high-level</b> <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> correlated positively with increased right-hemispheric activation in the inferior frontal gyrus (specifically Brodmann area 47), the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and the medial temporal gyrus (Brodmann area 21). In contrast, we found a negative correlation between performance and left-hemispheric DLPFC activation. Our findings indicate that the right lateral frontal and right temporal regions positively modulate aspects of language ability. funding agencies|Stahls Foundation||Strategic Research Area of the Center of Medical Image Science and Visualization (CMIV) at Linkoping University, Sweden|...|$|R
30|$|Overall, {{these results}} support the {{conclusion}} that setting the “proficiency test” bar too high may create unrealistic expectations for many and, in turn, de-motivate students unable to reach these high standards, an assertion supported {{by a number of}} studies that have investigated the relationship between testing and motivation among adolescent learners (Black and Wiliam, 1998; Crooks, 1988; Harlen and Deakin Crick, 2003). The pressure to take a <b>language</b> <b>test</b> that is beyond the cognitive capacity of most young adolescent students, it can be argued, is likely to have an adverse effect on the L 2 motivation of young adolescent learners who, while under the same pressure to perform well on <b>high-level</b> standardized <b>language</b> <b>tests,</b> are simply unable to do so. The “unwarranted pressure” created by these testing practices (Choi, 2008) may have appreciable long-term effects on young adolescent L 2 motivation; an issue in need of much further investigation, particularly in test-intensive educational contexts like the one examined here.|$|R

40|$|Test {{generation}} at the gate-level produces high-quality tests but is computationally {{expensive in}} the case of large systems. Recently, several research efforts have investigated the possibility of devising test generation methods and tools to work on high-level descriptions. The goal of these methods is to provide the designers with testability information and test sequences in the early design stages. The cost for generating test sequences in the high abstraction levels is often lower than that for generating test sequences at the gate-level, with comparable or even higher fault coverage. This paper first analyses several high-level fault models in order to select the most suitable one for estimating the testability of circuits by reasoning on their behavioral descriptions and for guiding the test generation process at the behavioral level. We assess then the effectiveness of <b>high-level</b> <b>test</b> generation with a simple ATPG algorithm, and present a novel highlevel hierarchical test generation approach to improve the results obtained by a pure <b>high-level</b> <b>test</b> generator...|$|R

It also supports the contention that large-scale high-stakes <b>language</b> <b>tests</b> can significantly impact young adolescents’ L 2 motivation in highly test-intensive environments like the one considered here. According to informants working within this context, middle-school students who have not demonstrated an ability to take a <b>high-level</b> <b>test</b> (based on their performance on simulated tests) are generally placed in lower level classes. Only students who demonstrate a fairly high level of proficiency are generally encouraged to take a university-level entrance test. These kinds of placement decisions, largely (mis) informed by the ability of middle-school students to complete proficiency tests well beyond their cognitive level, may have a lasting impact on students’ learning trajectories. As Roderick and Engel (2001) have noted, “students need to believe that they can achieve the goal given their skills” (p. 200).

40|$|In today's {{software}} development industry, <b>high-level</b> <b>tests</b> such as Graphical User Interface (GUI) based system and acceptance tests are mostly performed with manual {{practices that are}} often costly, tedious and error prone. Test automation has been proposed to solve these problems but most automation techniques approach testing from {{a lower level of}} system abstraction. Their suitability for <b>high-level</b> <b>tests</b> has therefore been questioned. <b>High-level</b> <b>test</b> automation techniques such as Record and Replay exist, but studies suggest that these techniques suffer from limitations, e. g. sensitivity to GUI layout or code changes, system implementation dependencies, etc. Visual GUI Testing (VGT) is an emerging technique in industrial practice with perceived higher flexibility and robustness to certain GUI changes than previous <b>high-level</b> (GUI) <b>test</b> automation techniques. The core of VGT is image recognition which is applied to analyze and interact with the bitmap layer of a system's front end. By coupling image recognition with test scripts, VGT tools can emulate end user behavior on almost any GUI-based system, regardless of implementation language, operating system or platform. However, VGT is not without its own challenges, problems and limitations (CPLs) but, like for many other automated test techniques, {{there is a lack of}} empirically-based knowledge of these CPLs and how they impact industrial applicability. Crucially, there is also a lack of information on the cost of applying this type of test automation in industry. This manuscript reports an empirical, multi-unit case study performed at two Swedish companies that develop safety-critical software. It studies their transition from manual system test cases into tests automated with VGT. In total, four different test suites that together include more than 300 <b>high-level</b> system <b>test</b> cases were automated for two multi-million lines of code systems. The results show that the transitioned test cases could find defects in the tested systems and that all applicable test cases could be automated. However, during these transition projects a number of hurdles had to be addressed; a total of 58 different CPLs were identified and then categorized into 26 types. We present these CPL types and an analysis of the implications for the transition to and use of VGT in industrial {{software development}} practice. In addition, four high-level solutions are presented that were identified during the study, which would address about half of the identified CPLs. Furthermore, collected metrics on cost and return on investment of the VGT transition are reported together with information about the VGT suites' defect finding ability. Nine of the identified defects are reported, 5 of which were unknown to testers with extensive experience from using the manual test suites. The main conclusion from this study is that even though there are many challenges related to the transition and usage of VGT, the technique is still valuable, flexible and considered cost-effective by the industrial practitioners. The presented CPLs also provide decision support in the use and advancement of VGT and potentially other automated testing techniques similar to VGT, e. g. Record and Replay...|$|R
