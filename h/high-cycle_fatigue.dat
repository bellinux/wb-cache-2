50|$|Porosity {{resulting}} from gas entrapment and solidification shrinkage {{is a significant}} problem in spray formed materials. A typical spray formed billet will contain 1-2% porosity with a pore size dependent on alloy freezing range and various process parameters. Hot isostatic pressing (HIPing) or thermo-mechanical processing can heal these pores if they are small (less than 30 µm). Despite these disadvantages, spray forming remains an economic process {{for the production of}} difficult to manufacture, niche alloys. Large-scale porosity is more difficult to heal effectively and must be minimised by careful process control. In some cases, porosity is controlled by alloy additions which react with dissolved and entrapped gas to form a solid phase e.g. titanium added to copper billets to form titanium nitride with dissolved and entrapped nitrogen gas. Porosity, even after consolidation, can limit the applications of spray formed material, for example rotating gas turbine components must have zero porosity because of the detrimental effect on <b>high-cycle</b> <b>fatigue</b> (HCF).|$|E

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of both the fifth and sixth year effort of a research program conducted for NASA-LeRC by The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA). The research included on-going development of methodology for a probabilistic material strength degradation model. The probabilistic model, {{in the form of a}} postulated randomized multifactor equation, provides for quantification of uncertainty in the lifetime material strength of aerospace propulsion system components subjected to a number of diverse random effects. This model is embodied in the computer program entitled PROMISS, which can include up to eighteen different effects. Presently, the model includes five effects that typically reduce lifetime strength: high temperature, <b>high-cycle</b> mechanical <b>fatigue,</b> low-cycle mechanical fatigue, creep and thermal fatigue. Statistical analysis was conducted on experimental Inconel 718 data obtained from the open literature. This analysis provided regression parameters for use as the model's empirical material constants, thus calibrating the model specifically for Inconel 718. Model calibration was carried out for five variables, namely, high temperature, high-cycle and low-cycle mechanical fatigue, creep and thermal fatigue. Methodology to estimate standard deviations of these material constants for input into the probabilistic material strength model was developed. Using an updated version of PROMISS, entitled PROMISS 93, a sensitivity study for the combined effects of <b>high-cycle</b> mechanical <b>fatigue,</b> creep and thermal fatigue was performed. Then using the current version of PROMISS, entitled PROMISS 94, a second sensitivity study including the effect of low-cycle mechanical fatigue, as well as, the three previous effects was performed. Results, in the form of cumulative distribution functions, illustrated the sensitivity of lifetime strength to any current value of an effect. In addition, verification studies comparing a combination of <b>high-cycle</b> mechanical <b>fatigue</b> and high temperature effects by model to the combination by experiment were conducted.

40|$|Based on {{the weakest}} link concept, a {{probabilistic}} approach in <b>high-cycle</b> multiaxial <b>fatigue</b> is developed to predict, {{for a given}} number of cycles, the probability distribution of the fatigue strength for metallic structural components. A three-parameter Weibull distribution is combined with the energy-based and volumetric <b>high-cycle</b> multiaxial <b>fatigue</b> criterion proposed by Banvillet et al. in 2002 [Banvillet A, Palin-Luc T, Lasserre S.

Whatever the stress state and the loading type are, the corresponding fatigue strength probability distribution can be deduced from three usual experimental fatigue limits. The scale effect is also predicted. Experimental probability distributions and theoretical predictions of the fatigue strength of smooth specimens are in good agreement for the five materials investigated: the 30 NiCrMo 16 and 35 CrMo 4 quenched and tempered steels, the C 20 annealed steel, the EN-GJS 800 - 2 nodular cast iron and the Ti– 6 Al– 4 V titanium alloy...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study pure rolling contact fatigue in 32 CrMoV 13 {{quenching}} and tempering steel. The study involves both experimental and numerical work. The influence of the roughness and the residual stresses on the mechanisms and zones of cracking were studied. The results show a rapid reduction in roughness during the first minute of test but even {{so there will be}} specimen deterioration. The residual stress profile after rolling contact tests have high compression values in the surface and at a depth of approximately 240 μm, which is related with the Hertzian maximal shear stress. The numerical simulation of the Hertzian loading was used both to determine the elastic shakedown of thematerial and to apply a <b>high-cycle</b> multiaxial <b>fatigue</b> criterion. The threedimensional finite element analysis used in the numerical calculation includes elastic-linear kinematic hardening plastic material and allows the introduction of an initial residual stress state. Taking into account the elastoplastic load induced by the Hertz pressure, low-cycle fatigue tests were used to characterize the mechanical properties of the material. In order to validate the numerical simulation, the results of the calculation after elastic shakedown were compared with the values measured by X-ray diffraction after rolling contact tests.

40|$|T-junction {{is one of}} the {{familiar}} components in the cooling system of power plants with enormous capability of <b>high-cycle</b> thermal <b>fatigue.</b> This research investigates the structure and mixing mechanism of turbulent flow in a T-junction area with a 90 deg bend upstream. According to the wide distribution of turbulent jets in the T-junction, a re-attached jet was selected previously as the best representative condition with the highest velocity fluctuation and the most complex structure. For considering the mixing mechanism of re-attached jet, T-junction is subdivided into few lateral and longitudinal sections, and each section is visualized separately by particle image velocimetry technique. Corresponding to the experimental data, the branch flow acts as a finite turbulent jet, develops the alternative type of eddies, and causes the high velocity fluctuation near the main pipe wall. Three regions are mainly subject to maximum velocity fluctuation: the region close to the jet boundaries (fluctuation mostly is caused by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability), the region above the jet and along the main flow (fluctuation mostly is caused by Karman vortex), and the re-attached area (fluctuation mostly is caused by changing the pressure gradient in the wake area above the jet). Finally, the re-attached area (near the downstream of wake area above the jet) is introduced as a region with strongest possibility to <b>high-cycle</b> thermal <b>fatigue</b> with most effective velocity fluctuation on the main pipe wall above the branch nozzle.
