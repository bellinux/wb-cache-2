To resolve the problem, the laser-guided deep-hole internal grinding tool is developed for finishing deep-holes with high straightness and surface quality. The tool {{consists of a}} grinding head, {{the front and rear}} actuators mounted on an actuator holder and a laser diode set in the back end of the holder. Tool attitude (position and inclination) is detected by the laser diode and two PSDs (Position-Sensitive Detector). The guiding axis is set using optical device located in front of the tool. In series 1, the performance of the tool is examined with respect to the grinding forces. When grinding the cemented carbide with a depth of cut of 30 μm and the high speed steel with a depth of cut of 30 μm, the torques are 8 % and 20 % of the maximum torque of the air motor, respectively. The stiffness of air motor spindle is 0. 6 μm/N. The displacement of the grinding motor when grinding cemented carbide with a depth of cut of 200 μm is 4 μm, which can be automatically corrected during grinding. In this paper, the performance of guidance of tool is examined with respect to its guidance. The results show that <b>deep</b> hole <b>grinding</b> is performed with precisely guided.

Use of scraper board along with rexine-covered wheel is found to reduce air pressure to a large extent such that it becomes close to air pressure noted around the solid wheel. It shows the beneficial effect of using scraper board and rexine-pasted wheel to suppress air layer effectively.

40|$|As {{the long}} {{arm of the}} <b>grinding,</b> <b>deep</b> {{financial}} crisis continues to haunt the global economy, the effects of inflation and time value of money cannot be oblivious to an inventory system. Inflation, defined as a general rise in the prices {{of goods and services}} over a period of time, has monetary depreciation as one of its major side effects. And, since inventories correspond to substantial investment in capital for any organization, it would be unethical if the effects of inflation and time value of money are not considered while determining the optimal inventory policy. Moreover, deterioration of items is a phenomenon which cannot be ignored, as it may yield misleading results. Further, under the inflationary conditions, the different cost parameters including the price are bound to vary from cycle to cycle over the planning horizon. Another important factor is shortages which no retailer would prefer, and in practice are partially backlogged and partially lost. In order to convert the lost sales into sales, the retailer offers such customers an incentive, by charging them the price prevailing at the time of placing an order, instead of the current inflated price. Therefore, bearing in mind these facts, the present paper develops an inventory model for a retailer dealing with deteriorating items under inflationary conditions over a fixed planning horizon. The objective is to derive the optimal number of cycles and cycle length that maximizes the net present value of the total profit over a fixed planning horizon. An appropriate algorithm has been proposed to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed model. Sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution with respect to major parameters is carried out and some managerial inferences have been presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{precision}} of feed drive systems depends strongly on the frictional behaviour of the bearing elements. Friction has two effects onto the feed drive system, {{on the one}} hand it improves the damping and reduces vibrations {{and on the other hand}} it induces nonlinear effects that affect the motion quality in terms of precision and smoothness. In this thesis, an idea is investigated that uses the good damping properties of sliding bearings and improves their frictional behaviour using high frequency oscillations. The phenomenon that friction is reduced in the presence of high-frequency oscillations was observed in various experiments since the 1950 ’s and found its way into industrial applications such as ultrasonic <b>deep</b> drawing, drilling, <b>grinding</b> and cutting. However, the idea to use this effect to come up with new bearing elements has not been investigated yet. The goal of this thesis is to develop a systematic design for sliding bearings that allow high-frequency oscillations. The theory of friction in the presence of vibrations is used to investigate the influence of vibration and motion parameters such as longitudinal, transversal, angluar and higher harmonic vibrations onto the friction force. Chapter 4 introduces the basic setup of high-frequency sliding bearings containing a vibration module with actuator resonator and sliding elements. Basic design principles for the different components are developed in Chapter 5. The design of the resonator plays a key role in transmitting the vibrations from the actuator to the sliding elements. The design is based either on a two-mass model or as an waveguide depending on the dimension of the bearing. An demonstrator is developed in Chapter 6 using FEM to optimize the stiffness an vibration characteristics of the bearing. Chapter 7 presents the results of experimental investigations of the vibrational and frictional properties of the developed bearing elements. It is shown, that the sliding and static friction can be reduced significantly and that the frictional force can be controlled using the acutator voltage and frequency. Thus, it is possible to actively design the frictional behaviour of the bearing element, giving the possibility to linearize the friction and thereby changing the damping and linearity properties of the bearing. Using this effects, experiments are made that show that the friction control allows to minimize and even eleminate the appearing of stick-slip during movement...|$|R

Therefore PC has become the preferred base to ensure rigidity in a machine tool. Hybrid polymer concrete beds composed of steel structures and polymer concrete are challenging for the grinding process, due to the completely different material properties of steel and PC.

40|$|High-speed <b>deep</b> <b>grinding</b> (HSDG) {{technology}} was developed based on high-speed and creep-feed grinding techniques. What mainly distinguishes HSDG from creep-feed grinding is its employment of {{a significantly higher}} wheel speed. Because the higher wheel speed results in {{a decrease in the}} undeformed chip thickness, HSDG is thus capable of achieving high stock removal rates and producing a high surface quality throughout the workpiece. However, the increase in wheel speed leads to the formation of a strengthened air barrier around the grinding wheel periphery, which is a great obstacle to the impinging of coolant into the grinding zone. Additionally, the higher wheel speed will also generate greater grinding heat in the grinding zone, thus resulting in a higher temperature. 2 ̆ 7 This increases the risk of thermal damage on the workpiece, such as burns and cracks, especially when grinding metals and alloys. In order {{to take advantage of the}} full potential of HSDG technology, effective cooling must be employed.

There are several drawbacks regarding these nozzles.

Due to their influence on the mechanical properties, the analysis of these residual stress fields by means of non destructive methods has become an important topic in materials science. Because the information depth achieved by different radiations (X-rays, neutrons) usually differs from each other by orders of magnitude, stress evaluation within the near surface region up to some millimeters requires the application of complementary methods. However, there remains a gap, which still has not been filled in detail. Depending on the material this concerns a range between about 15 µm and 100 µm, where the conventional methods are no longer efficient and the neutron methods are not yet sensitive.
