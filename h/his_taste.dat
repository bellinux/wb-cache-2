5|$|As well as {{straightforward}} {{details of}} each bird, Yarrell adds many stories, chosen {{from his own}} experience, from his correspondents, or from often recently published accounts, to enliven the description of each species according to <b>his</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bond {{also shows}} <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for aircraft: a gyrocopter—Little Nellie—features in You Only Live Twice, a Cessna 185 Seaplane in Licence to Kill, an Acrostar Jet in Octopussy, the Space Shuttle in Moonraker and an Aero L-39 Albatros in Tomorrow Never Dies.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Moore's {{personal}} preferences were transferred into his characterisation of Bond: <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for Cuban cigars and his wearing of safari suits {{were assigned to}} the character. Moore's use for cigars in his early films put him in contrast to the cigarette-smoking Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. By the time of Moore's fifth film, For Your Eyes Only, released in 1981, his characterisation had come to represent an old-fashioned character, in contrast to the fashionability Connery had brought to the role in the 1960s.|$|E

60|$|<b>His</b> <b>tastes</b> {{had never}} been much consulted; things had been done, in the kindest manner possible, solely for his good. James detested sweetness.|$|R
50|$|The fifth Earl {{displayed}} magnificence in <b>his</b> <b>tastes,</b> {{and being}} one of the richest magnates of his day, kept a very large household establishment.|$|R
5|$|Among other {{personal}} interests, Orr has {{a passion for}} fishing which he has had since childhood. He has a talent for solving jigsaw puzzles quickly. Orr is also known for <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> in clothes and style of dress. When living as a bachelor with Forristall during his years with the Bruins, Orr was also known for keeping a clean apartment and not drinking or smoking or going night-clubbing. Orr projected a clean image.|$|E
5|$|Baron Hector Hulot is {{a living}} manifestation of male sexual desire, {{unrestrained}} and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Valérie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; {{by the end of}} the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for female flesh that he even asks his wife– without irony– if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.|$|E
5|$|The Mexican Constitution of 1824 liberalized the country's {{immigration}} policies, allowing {{foreigners to}} settle in border regions such as Mexican Texas. People flocked to the area; an 1834 census estimated the Texas population at 7,800Mexicans and 30,000English-speaking people primarily from the United States. Among the immigrants was William Barret Travis, an Alabama native who had variously worked as a teacher, a newspaper publisher, and a lawyer. An avid reader, Travis often devoured a novel in a single day. <b>His</b> <b>taste</b> ran primarily to romantic adventure and history, especially the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Benjamin Disraeli and the historical works of Herodotus. Historians have speculated that Travis's choice of reading material may have affected his behavior—Travis {{was known for his}} melodramatic ways.|$|E

5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for administration, was further empowered by admission to the Grand Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born to the grand ducal couple.|$|E

25|$|Wren's {{later life}} was not without criticisms and attacks on his {{competence}} and <b>his</b> <b>taste.</b> In 1712, the Letter Concerning Design of Anthony Ashley Cooper, third Earl of Shaftesbury, circulated in manuscript. Proposing a new British style of architecture, Shaftesbury censured Wren's cathedral, <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> and his long-standing control of royal works. Although Wren {{was appointed to the}} Fifty New Churches Commission in 1711, he was left only with nominal charge of a board of works when the surveyorship started in 1715. On 26 April 1718, on the pretext of failing powers, he was dismissed in favour of William Benson.|$|E

25|$|Menander {{was the son}} of well-to-do parents; {{his father}} Diopeithes is {{identified}} by some with the Athenian general and governor of the Thracian Chersonese known from the speech of Demosthenes De Chersoneso. He presumably derived <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for comic drama from his uncle Alexis.|$|E
25|$|Unlike <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for adventurous modern {{experiment}} in painting, Klee, though musically talented, {{was attracted to}} older traditions of music; he neither appreciated composers of the late 19th century, such as Wagner, Bruckner and Mahler, nor contemporary music. Bach and Mozart were for him the greatest composers; he most enjoyed playing the works by the latter.|$|E
25|$|Born into {{a middle-class}} {{family from the}} Danube port of Galaţi, Tonegaru {{was the son of}} a lawyer, ship captain and amateur poet, who {{cultivated}} <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for literature and whom he accompanied on sailing trips to Greece, Turkey and Egypt. Although he was an exceptionally tall man, the young Tonegaru was also plagued with health problems, and was born with mitral stenosis.|$|E

50|$|Albert is a nerd. Way more {{intellectual}} {{than any}} of the others, lover of poetry and art. People tend to make fun of him because he's a little feeble and quite eccentric in <b>his</b> <b>tastes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Merrick left Greece in 1980, {{when the}} local tourism {{industry}} made Hydra too crowded for <b>his</b> <b>taste.</b> In that year he moved to Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka), having bought property there in 1974. But he returned to France occasionally, eventually purchasing a home in Tricqueville. For {{the rest of his}} life, he divided his time between the two countries.|$|E
25|$|Born in Bucharest, Topîrceanu {{began his}} {{schooling}} in the city, {{and then moved}} to the hilly countryside of the Argeş county, in the Șuici commune, where he formed <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for themes taken from nature. After completing secondary studies, he attended the University of Bucharest Law School, and then its Faculty of Letters, without ever finishing either. This was largely due to a hectic lifestyle punctuated by numerous affairs and heavy alcohol use.|$|E
25|$|By the 1860s, the {{pomp and}} glamour of earlier {{years of living}} at Thorndon had begun to fall away. The young John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton spent a weekend at Thorndon; he had been invited because Lady Petre had a bevy of “Good looking and divinely tall” daughters to marry off. The studious young man, however, did not enjoy himself much, finding the {{favourite}} pastime of roller skating in the ballroom too boisterous for <b>his</b> <b>taste.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Heppenstall's {{first novel}} The Blaze of Noon (1939), was {{critically}} praised. [...] Much later, in 1967, it received an Arts Council award. He was Francophile in literary terms, and his non-fiction writing reflects <b>his</b> <b>tastes.</b>|$|R

25|$|During {{the reign}} of King Oscar I, there was a renewed {{interest}} for older styles and when the Vita Havet (the White Sea Ballroom) was created from the designs of Per Axel Nyström in 1844–1850, a compromise between old and new was made. Fredrik Wilhelm Scholander was the royal curator of King Charles XV and shared <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> in interior design, this resulted in rooms like the Victoriasalongen (the Victoria Drawing room) in a lush revived Rococo style.|$|E
25|$|In January 2007, MacCorkindale {{was given}} a five-month sabbatical from Casualty because a plotline {{required}} that his character be temporarily removed from the series. He {{took the opportunity to}} tour the United Kingdom in a revival of the Agatha Christie murder mystery play The Unexpected Guest. He then returned to Casualty, but having re-discovered <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> for theatre, left the series permanently in 2008 to appear as Andrew Wyke in a UK tour Anthony Shaffer's Sleuth. By the time that MacCorkindale quit Casualty, he had appeared in 229 episodes of the series.|$|E
25|$|Gimblett briefly {{moved to}} London to work, but city {{life was not}} to <b>his</b> <b>taste</b> and he {{returned}} home, resuming cricket for the Watchet club. One of the patrons of Watchet cricket, the town tailor W. G. Penny, who was also prominent in Somerset County Cricket Club, recommended him for a trial with the county, though there {{appears to have been}} some reservations over his temperament and his impetuous batting. There is also, in the same source, some suggestion that Gimblett himself was reluctant to test himself against top-class cricketers.|$|E
50|$|Douglas {{has been}} {{described}} as spoiled, reckless, insolent and extravagant. He would spend money on men and gambling and expected Wilde to contribute to <b>his</b> <b>tastes.</b> They often argued and broke up, but would also always reconcile.|$|R

50|$|Saint-Georges was notably old-fashioned in his approach, {{typically}} {{depending on}} highly improbable coincidences and twists with little attempt at convincing characterisation. <b>His</b> <b>tastes</b> were {{reflected in his}} personal affectation of 18th-century costume and manners in his everyday life.|$|R
