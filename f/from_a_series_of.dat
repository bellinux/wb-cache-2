5|$|Operation Una was {{the only}} {{unsuccessful}} operation by the HV <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> offensives which had commenced in November 1994. It was controversial in the Croatian media, but was generally brushed aside as an aberration <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> successes. In 2006, Croatian authorities launched an investigation into alleged war crimes committed by HV soldiers during the operation, in which 40 Serb civilians were killed.|$|E

5|$|The college's other {{buildings}} are at Moatside Court, Owengate and Bailey Court. The developments at Moatside Court and Bailey Court {{date from the}} 1960s and 1970s, whilst Owengate was formed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> old houses in the 1950s. Of these, Moatside Court's rooms were of a notoriously poor quality, but have recently been renovated {{at the cost of}} over £1 million.|$|E
5|$|After {{publishing}} Prehistory of Scotland (1935), Childe produced one of {{the defining}} books of his career, Man Makes Himself (1936). Influenced by Marxist views of history, Childe argued that the usual distinction between (pre-literate) prehistory and (literate) history was a false dichotomy and that human society has progressed {{through a series of}} technological, economic and social revolutions. These included the Neolithic Revolution, when hunter-gatherers began settling in permanent farming communities, through to the Urban Revolution, when society progressed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> small towns through to the first cities, and right up to more recent times, when the Industrial Revolution changed the nature of production.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the number}} of {{navigation}} algorithms calculating simultaneously to provide all the information in real time, {{research has been conducted}} to improve the computation time of some numerical methods using field-programmable gate arrays. The research focused on visual perception. The first part was focused on the simultaneous localization and mapping with an extended Kalman filter that estimates the state of a dynamic system <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> noisy or incomplete measures. The second focused on the location and the detection of obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Gresley's initial Pacific {{project of}} 1915 was for an {{elongated}} {{version of the}} Ivatt Atlantic design with four cylinders. Finally realising {{that he was in}} a design impasse, he took as a model the new American Pennsylvania Railroad class K4 Pacific of 1914. This in turn had been updated <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> prototypes scientifically developed in 1910 under Francis J. Cole, Alco's Chief Consulting Engineer at Schenectady and the Pennsylvania's K29 Alco prototype of 1911, also designed by Cole. Descriptions of those locomotives appeared in the British technical press at the time and gave Gresley the elements necessary to design a thoroughly up-to-date locomotive.|$|E

The Centre, which is wheelchair-accessible throughout, was opened in 1994. It was founded by Mike Fitt OBE, who was then The Royal Parks' Superintendent of Richmond Park and later became Deputy Chief Executive of London's Royal Parks. A registered charity, the Holly Lodge Centre received the Queen's Award for Voluntary Service in 2005.|$|E

5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had been agreed by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> {{victories}} against the Arabs in the East that had led to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and even had the envoys beaten up. He followed this up with a show of military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E
5|$|In January 2001, al-Jamri was {{released}} {{along with other}} opposition activists. The new emir, Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, proposed a reform plan, the National Action Charter of Bahrain, which was accepted by the opposition and later gained widespread popular support. A year later, Hamad issued a new constitution which al-Jamri said fell short of the opposition's demands. Disappointed, al-Jamri soon fell ill, suffering <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> strokes and eventually dying of multiple organ failure.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{fishing is}} an {{important}} industry for Northern coastal towns. Major fishing ports include Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull and Whitby. At its height, Grimsby was the largest fishing port in the world, but the Northern fishing industry suffered greatly <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> events {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century: the Cod Wars with Iceland and establishment of the exclusive economic zone ended British access to rich North Atlantic fishing grounds, while the North Sea was badly overfished and the European Common Fisheries Policy put strict quotas on catches to protect the almost depleted stocks. Grimsby is now transitioning to the processing of imported seafood and to offshore wind to replace its fishing fleet.|$|E

5|$|The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) is {{an image}} of a small region in the {{constellation}} Ursa Major, constructed <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> observations by the Hubble Space Telescope. It covers an area about 2.6 arcminutes on a side, about one 24-millionth of the whole sky, which is equivalent in angular size to a tennis ball at a distance of 100metres. The image was assembled from 342 separate exposures taken with the Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 over ten consecutive days between December 18 and December 28, 1995.|$|E
5|$|The Origin of Birds is {{an early}} {{synopsis}} of bird evolution written in 1926 by Gerhard Heilmann, a Danish artist and amateur zoologist. The book was born <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> articles published between 1913 and 1916 in Danish, and although republished as a book it received mainly criticism from established scientists and got little attention within Denmark. The English edition of 1926, however, became highly influential at the time due to the breadth of evidence synthesized {{as well as the}} artwork used to support its arguments. It was considered the last word on the subject of bird evolution for several decades after its publication.|$|E
5|$|The River Hull is a {{navigable river}} in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. It rises <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> springs {{to the west of}} Driffield, and enters the Humber estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following a period when the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E

5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the lessons learned <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water was equally as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
5|$|The {{brothers}} often competed {{together in}} various promotions; in the Eastern Sports Association (ESA), which Jean-Louis (Rudy) owned, they scripted the feuds {{so that the}} four brothers often faced a common opponent. A heel (villain) wrestler would face Rudy and emerge victorious <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> matches; they would then {{do the same with}} Bobby and then Leo before facing The Beast. They also held numerous tag team titles together.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the River Hull is in the Yorkshire Wolds. It rises <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>series</b> <b>of</b> springs {{to the west of}} Driffield, near the site of the medieval village of Elmswell. The Elmswell Beck flows eastwards from these, and is joined by the Little Driffield Beck, which flows southwards from Little Driffield. It {{continues}} as the Driffield Beck, flowing around the south-western edge of Driffield, where it is joined by the Driffield Trout Stream. After the junction, it becomes the River Hull or the West Beck and flows to the east, before turning south to reach Corps Landing. For much of the route below Driffield, the Driffield Navigation runs parallel to the river.|$|E
