Domestic violence is recognized as the most entrenched and pervasive form of violence in society today. It {{is also one of the}} most serious social problems facing our communities, with enormous costs both to individuals and to society. Male Violence against female partners is a widespread practice and recognition of this fact is occurring. Women are most at risk of murder inside their own homes: most female homicide victims die at the hands of their male partner, usually after a history of domestic violence. The impact of the violence results in psychological and physical trauma for many <b>families.</b> <b>Violence</b> is generally seen as a manifestation of patriarchal values of male supremacy involving factors such as ownership, of property, power and control, female subordination, and the institution of marriage and the <b>family.</b> Male <b>violence</b> relates to gender inequity. Thus it is a political issue. It is not only women who are traumatized by the violence. Children do not only observe their parents' conflict, there is increasing evidence that the abuse of children is endemic in Australia...|$|R

25|$|A 2013 review {{examined}} {{studies from}} five continents and {{the correlation between}} a country's level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence.

Many organizations have made efforts to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetration and victimization. For example, using broader terms like <b>family</b> <b>violence</b> rather than violence against women.|$|E

25|$|Responses {{that focus}} on {{children}} suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individual’s propensity to engage in <b>family</b> <b>violence</b> (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest {{it is useful to}} think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person's current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.|$|E

25|$|Domestic {{violence}} (also named domestic abuse, battering, or <b>family</b> <b>violence)</b> is {{a pattern}} of behavior which involves violence or other abuse by one person against another in a domestic setting, such as in marriage or cohabitation. It may be termed intimate partner violence when committed by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner, and can take place in heterosexual or same-sex relationships, or between former spouses or partners. Domestic violence may also involve violence against children or the elderly. It takes a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious, reproductive, and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as choking, beating, female genital mutilation and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings, and dowry deaths.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{was not a}} part of the Brazilian criminal code until 2006, when the federal criminal domestic violence code was passed by President Lula. The Law of Domestic and <b>Family</b> <b>Violence</b> was the first official codification of domestic violence crimes, and tripled the previous punishments associated with domestic violence. Brazil's adoption of the domestic violence code was mainly influenced by its participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the urging of the international legal community, and the tenacity of local grassroots movements. The formation of women's police units and a federally funded hotline to serve victims of gender violence have significantly advanced the protections offered to women in Brazil, though domestic violence in Brazil remains prevalent and thus a major obstacle in attaining equal rights for women. In 2015, Brazil enacted a law against femicide.|$|E
