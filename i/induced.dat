5|$|In {{addition}} to the intrinsic magnetic moment, Ganymede has an <b>induced</b> dipole magnetic field. Its existence is connected with the variation of the Jovian magnetic field near Ganymede. The <b>induced</b> moment is directed radially to or from Jupiter following {{the direction of the}} varying part of the planetary magnetic field. The <b>induced</b> magnetic moment is an order of magnitude weaker than the intrinsic one. The field strength of the <b>induced</b> field at the magnetic equator is about 60 nT—half of that of the ambient Jovian field. The <b>induced</b> magnetic field of Ganymede is similar to those of Callisto and Europa, indicating that Ganymede also has a subsurface water ocean with a high electrical conductivity.|$|E

There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative defenses are constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize.

5|$|The Galileo orbiter {{found that}} Europa has a weak {{magnetic}} moment, which is <b>induced</b> by the varying {{part of the}} Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the <b>induced</b> moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior.
