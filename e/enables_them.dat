5|$|While most foods need batter {{coatings}} for protection, {{it is not}} {{as necessary}} for cooked noodles and potatoes because their high starch content <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to hold more moisture and resist shrinking. Meats may be cooked before deep frying to ensure that they are done inside while keeping juiciness.|$|E
5|$|A lyotropic {{liquid crystal}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} components that exhibit liquid-crystalline properties in certain concentration ranges. In the lyotropic phases, solvent molecules fill the space around the compounds to provide fluidity to the system. In contrast to thermotropic liquid crystals, these lyotropics have another degree of freedom of concentration that <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to induce a variety of different phases.|$|E
5|$|Great white sharks, {{like all}} other sharks, have an extra sense given by the ampullae of Lorenzini which <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to detect the {{electromagnetic}} field emitted by the movement of living animals. Great whites are so sensitive they can detect variations of half a billionth of a volt. At close range, this allows the shark to locate even immobile animals by detecting their heartbeat. Most fish have a less-developed but similar sense using their body's lateral line.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to their large compound eyes, wasps have several simple eyes known as ocelli, which are typically arranged in a triangle just forward of the vertex of the head. Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|Larvae {{of members}} of the family Glossosomatidae in the {{suborder}} Spicipalpia create dome-shaped enclosures of silk which <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to graze on the periphyton, the biological film that grows on stones and other objects, while carrying their enclosure around like turtles. In the family Philopotamidae, the nets are sac-like, with intricate structure and tiny mesh. The larvae have specialised mouthparts to scrape off the microflora that get trapped in the net as water flows through.|$|E
5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than in tropical waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant in tropical waters. Glass sponges {{are the most}} common in polar waters and in the depths of temperate and tropical seas, as their very porous construction <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to extract food from these resource-poor waters with the minimum of effort. Demosponges and calcareous sponges are abundant and diverse in shallower non-polar waters.|$|E

5|$|Waxwings can eat {{huge numbers}} of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the fruit seeds. Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|After {{some initial}} resistance, the Duke yields to Süß's {{request for the}} repeal of the law prohibiting Jews from living in Württemberg; a horde of dirty, disreputable Jews are then shown moving into the city. Süß <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to enrich {{themselves}} {{at the expense of the}} populace. The aged Rabbi Loew (Werner Krauss) criticizes Süß for his excessively opulent lifestyle as the Duke's finance minister and warns that it could be his downfall, warning that, “The Lord punishes Jews who forget who they are!” but Süß pays him no heed.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Paul Steiner (Bryant Haliday) and Dr. Christopher Mitchell (Ronald Allen) {{work on a}} {{projection}} device that <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to transmit any object within {{a few miles of}} the machine. While they find the device works with inanimate objects, the living creatures they use it on always seem to die. When Dr. Patricia Hill (Mary Peach) arrives, she helps them fix the error, making Steiner think the problem has been solved. Meanwhile, Dr. Blanchard (Norman Wooland), Steiner's boss and head of the institute he works for, is being blackmailed by Mr. Latham (Derrick De Marney), who wants credit for Steiner's discovery. He forces Blanchard to demand Steiner to give a premature presentation to Professor Lembach (Gerard Heinz).|$|E

5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine the output of many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E
5|$|In December 2009, it was {{announced}} that following the success of Bustracker, an application had been developed for the iPhone that is similar to the way Bustracker works. It allows people to download an application to their iPhone that <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to see where their nearest bus stop is and when the bus is due. Although not developed by Lothian Buses or The City of Edinburgh Council, the application has now won the backing of both companies. My Bus Edinburgh is an application developed for the Android platform which is similar in functionality to the iPhone application. Like the iPhone application, this application is developed by an independent developer, backed by Lothian Buses and The City of Edinburgh Council, and is available free of charge.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} found that the western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp has the ability to shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E

5|$|The class {{incorporates}} {{some major}} features including {{but not limited}} to the 'X'-shaped hull form to improve stealth, a raft-mounted propulsion system to reduce vibration, and an infrared signature suppression system. It also includes networks such as the Total Atmospheric Control System (TACS), Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS), Integrated Bridge System (IBS), Battle Damage Control System (BDCS) and Personnel Locator System (PLS). The ships also include technology that <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to fight in Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) warfare scenarios. The Indian Navy claims that the indigenization achieved in these ships is about 90%.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is set in}} {{the year}} 2084, in a futuristic version of Paris called Neo-Paris. The Memorize {{corporation}} has invented a new brain implant called Sensen, which enables 99% of the population to upload and share their memories on the net, as well as remove unhappy or unpleasant memories. This gives Memorize an immense degree of control over the population and <b>enables</b> <b>them</b> to establish a surveillance state, which leads a small group of rebels by the name of Errorists to attempt to bring down Memorize. The invention of the Sensen has also resulted in the creation of Leapers, memory-addicted humans who have absorbed so many memories that their Sensen has degraded and they have mutated into subhuman form, now living in the sewers of Neo-Paris.|$|E

Performa attracts beings called Mirages, who hail from an alternate dimension called the Idolasphere: while some Mirages harvest Performa for evil motives, others form alliances with humans to protect the real world.
