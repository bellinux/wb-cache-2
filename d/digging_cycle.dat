50|$|The {{razor shell}} lives under the sand, using its {{powerful}} foot to dig {{to a safe}} depth. Its digging activity comprises six stages, repeated cyclically. A <b>digging</b> <b>cycle</b> involves integration of the muscular foot (which takes up {{a large part of}} the body) with the opening and closing of the valve and one end. The foot is inflated hydraulically, extending down into the sand and anchoring the animal. Deflation of the foot then draws the shell down. The razor shell also squirts water down into the sand, removing loose sand from its path. The foot is thought to exert a pressure of about 196kPa (2 kgf/cm2).|$|E
40|$|A P&H 2800 XP {{electric}} mining shovel {{working in}} a Western Canadian surface coal mine was instrumented with microprocessor-based monitoring equipment, and its performance monitored as it excavated a series of test blasts. Hoist and crowd motor armature voltages and currents, dipper trajectories, cycle times and load weights were recorded. A diggability index has been established based on {{the responses of the}} hoist motor. Values of the diggability index correlated well with digging conditions as observed during monitoring and with muckpile fragmentation size distributions as determined by a photographic survey. This correlation establishes the ability of an instrumented shovel to diagnose the efficiency of ground preparation practices (blasting) by identifying variations in muckpile diggability. The data on dipper trajectory has demonstrated that variations in digging practices do exist amongst an experienced group of shovel operators, and that variation in trajectory significantly influences values of the recorded motor performance parameters. An approach is described to account for variations in digging practice on assessments of diggability. An allied investigation into the ability of time studies to define diggability, revealed <b>dig</b> <b>cycle</b> times to be operator dependant, and unrelated to levels of digging effort...|$|R
40|$|During burrow digging by {{the mole}} cricket Scapteriscus acletus Rehn and Hubbard, the burrow is {{enlarged}} and shaped {{in a series}} of <b>digging</b> <b>cycles,</b> each lasting 1 — 2 min, and song chirps are produced after every cycle. The song becomes up to 18 dB louder and acoustically purer during burrow building. The shape of the song pulse envelope changes so that its average power density becomes greater and its build-up and decay become more gradual. The forewings show a single resonance of the harp (Cu 1 cell) regions at 2 - 5 — 3 0 kHz: the normal song carrier frequency is 2 - 5 — 2 - 7 kHz. Removal of the outer parts of the forewings does not affect the radiated sound power. The singing burrow has an exponential horn opening at the soil surface and an internal bulb. The calculated cut-off frequency of the horn is 1 - 34 kHz and that of the first resonance is 2 - 5 - 2 - 7 kHz. The volume of the bulb is close to that required to tune the throat: obliteration of the burrow bulb causes a substantial decrease in the radiated sound pressure levels before singing ceases. The horn mouth acts as a finite sound source, with large acoustic reactance. The acoustics of the burrow were measured with a small doublet source inserted at the position at which the cricket sings. At this position, the burrow resonates at 2 - 75 - 3 kHz, with a quality factor (Q), measured both by the — 3 dB bandwidth and by the build-up and decay of tone bursts, of 2 - 5 - 2 - 7. The sound pressure produced by the doublet source is up to 24 dB louder when it is in the burrow than when it is in free air. Further in or out from the insect's singing position, the effective gain of the burrow is reduced and other resonances and anti-resonances are observed. Obliteration of the burrow bulb reduces the effective gain of the burrow by 6 — 10 dB and the burrow ceases to resonate at 2 - 75 kHz. It is proposed that the tuned burrow acts as a resistive load on the vibrating harps, so allowing good coupling between the small wings and the surrounding medium while allowing a pure carrier frequency to be radiated...|$|R
40|$|Excavators {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{energy-intensive}} elements of earthwork operations. Predicting the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of excavators is therefore critical in order to mitigate the environmental impact of earthwork operations. However, there is a lack of method for estimating such energy consumption and CO 2 emissions, especially during the early planning stages of these activities. This research proposes a model using an artificial neural network (ANN) to predict an excavator’s hourly energy consumption and CO 2 emissions under different site conditions. The proposed ANN model includes five input parameters: <b>digging</b> depth, <b>cycle</b> time, bucket payload, engine horsepower, and load factor. The Caterpillar handbook’s data, that included operational characteristics of twenty-five models of excavators, were used to develop the training and testing sets for the ANN model. The proposed ANN models were also designed to identify which factors from all the input parameters have the greatest impact on energy and emissions, based on partitioning weight analysis. The results showed that the proposed ANN models can provide an accurate estimating tool for the early planning stage to predict the energy consumption and CO 2 emissions of excavators. Analyses have revealed that, within all the input parameters, cycle time has the greatest impact on energy consumption and CO 2 emissions. The findings from the research enable the control of crucial factors which significantly impact on energy consumption and CO 2 emissions...|$|R

This paper presents a new hydraulic hybrid system layout for mobile machinery implemented on a middle size excavator. The hybridization procedure took advantage of a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm, which was also utilized for the hybrid components dimensioning and control strategy definition. A dedicated experimental activity on test bench {{was performed on the}} main components of the energy recovery system (ERS). The JCMAS working cycle was considered as the reference test for a fuel consumption comparison between the standard and the hybrid excavator.

40|$|Due to {{expensive}} mining equipment, operation {{times and}} productivity are key {{words in the}} indus-try. To reduce cycle times and avoid down time due to damage caused by collisions, CRC Mining (an Australian Government funded research center) is working on automation of electric mining shovels. Due to the high inertias involved there is a few seconds delay between input from the operator and the shovel’s response. When automate the <b>digging</b> <b>cycle</b> it is therefore important to predict collisions and avoid them on time. Within the used Model Predictive Control structure {{it is very important}} that the drive prediction models (swing, crowd and hoist) are accurate and take as less computational effort as possible. During this traineeship, low-complexity hybrid models have been developed which use PWA struc-tures to take the control system’s non-linearity’s into account. All models have been build in Matlab environment and together with the existing models (stiff ODE 1 s solver) validated against experimental data obtained from P&H BLE 2100 from different joystick step inputs. All models have been compared at different update frequencies and valuated on computational effort (FLOPS...|$|E

In this study, we optimized the protocol conditions for the detection of X chromosome-linked phosphoglycerate kinase- 1 (pgk- 1) gene in paraffin-embedded sections of mouse reproductive organs. The effects of various concentrations of proteinase K (PK) and PCR cycle numbers were examined. To label the amplified DNA, we used digoxigenin-dUTP (Dig), Cy- 3 -dUTP (Cy- 3), or FluorX-dCTP (FluorX). The optimal concentration of PK was 50 µg/ml for the ovary and 10 µg/ml for the testis. Ten PCR cycles were optimal for <b>Dig</b> and 25 <b>cycles</b> were optimal for FluorX and Cy- 3 in the ovary and testis. The signal-to-noise ratio of FluorX and Cy- 3 for ovarian tissue was better than that of Dig. Using the above conditions, we detected 1 – 4 and 1 – 2 spots of pgk- 1 in the nuclei of granulosa and germ cells, respectively. Our results indicate that in situ PCR is useful for detecting a specific gene in paraffin-embedded sections under optimized conditions of both PCR cycle number and PK concentration...|$|R
5000|$|With {{the scheme}} {{approved}} Codner and Williams set to work, a vaulting horse was constructed from stolen timber, plywood with cigarette package wrappings {{used for the}} top. After a period of legitimate use Codner and Williams started to dig a tunnel from the horse. One man {{was carried out in}} the horse and the tunnel started by digging a shaft, lined with plywood panels from Red Cross parcel boxes. After each session care was taken to secure the top of the shaft and to replace the surface sand on top. The digger and the sand excavated were carried back into a hut and the sand disposed off. Initially Philpot assisted in disposing of the sand but later on Codner and Williams asked him to join in the digging and become one of the escapers. [...] Digging was a cramped job and sand was dragged back {{to the bottom of the}} shaft by the digger and then placed into bags for lifting and disposal. Only 12 bags per session were lifted. After a while the team swapped to a four <b>cycle</b> <b>dig</b> and lift scheme where two men went out on the first trip and dug 36 bags of sand. For the next three trips one man went out and recovered 12 bags each time. As the tunnel grew longer a bowl and string were used for pulling the sand back. Although this was slightly slower i.e. 36 bags per cycle as opposed to 48 under the old system it meant three shorter sessions and one longer one for the volunteers using the horse for vaulting, an important change as the number of volunteers was small and becoming tired.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to devise and evaluate various implementable power management schemes for a novel hydraulic hybrid architecture (called the displacement-controlled series-parallel (DC S-P) hybrid architecture) for mobile, multi-actuator machine systems, with reduced engine power. Specifically, the power management schemes proposed were applied to a proto-type mini-excavator on which the DC S-P hybrid architecture was implemented {{as part of this}} work. ^ Previous work had demonstrated significant improvements in overall machine efficiency through transition from the current, standard load-sensing architecture to throttle-less, DC actuation. Measurements showed 40 % fuel savings on a prototype, mini-excavator with DC actuation, over a standard mini-excavator in side-by-side testing. Hybridization (through use of hydraulic accumulators) enables storage and re-use of braking energy recovered from the swing drive (and in general, from the rotary actuators), and drastic engine downsizing. A feasibility study undertaken in simulation showed that {{with the use of a}} conservative power management scheme, the DC S-P hydraulic hybrid excavator with 50 % reduced engine power, offered efficiency improvements over the prototype DC excavator. ^ This work focuses primarily on implementable power management schemes for such hybrid hydraulic multi-actuator machine systems with reduced engine power. A rule-based strategy was first studied that could exploit all available system degrees of freedom. This showed the potential to obtain higher fuel savings than the preliminary, conservative power management scheme wherein only one system degree of freedom was utilized, for both the parallel-hybrid DC architecture as well as the DC S-P hybrid architecture. ^ Patterns in optimal state trajectories and control histories obtained from dynamic programming were also analyzed and identified for various cycles. The rule-based approach lends itself well to replicate optimal results, while exploiting all system degrees of freedom. However, the rules employed for charging the accumulator through the primary unit vary with the duty cycle, and thus a practical solution entails offering the operator a set of rule-based supervisory controllers to choose from. ^ An instantaneous optimization-based approach was also studied, wherein an equivalent fuel consumption objective is minimized at every instant. The strategy proposed, called the equivalent consumption minimization strategy (ECMS), is a promising cycle-independent approach for near-optimal, implementable power management, and approximating optimal behavior for parts of the duty cycle. ^ Transition from the non-hybrid DC architecture on a prototype excavator toward the DC S-P hybrid hydraulic architecture was also achieved as part of this work. An appropriate motion control scheme for closed-loop speed control of the secondary-controlled swing drive was also designed and implemented on the prototype. Engine load-leveling or power limitation (by up to 50 %) was demonstrated in measurement through the use of the single-point strategy in a <b>digging</b> <b>cycle</b> (albeit the engine was not actually downsized on the actual prototype). The minimum-speed strategy was also demonstrated on the prototype, where all system degrees of freedom were exploited (including engine speed variation) while maintaining engine power output near 50 % engine power. ...|$|E
