25|$|The {{friendliness}} {{was carried}} on long after Defoe’s visit. Miss Parkin still retains a lively {{memory of the}} kindliness of William, 12th Baron, and has a photograph, taken by him in the Rectory garden, of Rector Parkin and his family. It {{is a matter for}} regret that of late years the great landowner <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> less in touch with the parish.|$|E
500|$|Li {{represented}} Singapore for {{the third}} time in the Olympic Games at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. She was the flag-bearer for Team Singapore at the opening ceremony of the Games on 8 August, having requested the honour. She explained: [...] "There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> debate over the foreign talent scheme. This is my way of showing everyone that everything I've ever achieved is because of Singapore." ...|$|E
500|$|Egan said: [...] "I love {{working with}} Michael Muhney. I heard about him because {{my mom had}} watched Y before I joined. So when I told her my {{character}} {{was going to be}} mixed up with Adam, she went, 'Oh! He is so good, but so bad'". Egan said that her mother [...] "told me he was a great character, but an evil one, so I was really excited. And now knowing Michael, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> fun." [...] She said that [...] "everyone seems to think we have good on-screen chemistry" [...] and that [...] "it's an interesting energy between Chelsea and Adam being the [...] "bad guys" [...] in town." [...] Egan said Adam was Sharon's biggest supporter when Chelsea had Billy's baby and gave him up.|$|E
60|$|I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> excited {{during the}} scenes through which I had just passed, and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> stimulated by grog, that, as yet, I had not felt {{much of the}} {{depression}} natural to such events. I even slept soundly that night, nor did I turn out until six the next morning.|$|R

500|$|Overmars was {{selected}} in the squad for the 1998 World Cup, staged in France. Before the tournament began, he scored two goals in a friendly against Paraguay. He was on the scoresheet in the national team's 5–0 win against South Korea in the group stage. As the tournament progressed, Overmars felt the Netherlands were [...] "getting better and better" [...] and believed they could win the World Cup: [...] "Believe me, we can do it. In the past, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> talk about our side {{and a lot of}} pressure with people calling us favourites. This time, nobody seemed to expect anything. In fact, people would come up to me in the street and say we were only dark horses to win." [...] While training before the quarter-final match against Argentina, he sustained an injury which seemingly ruled him out of contention. He did feature late into the game as a substitute, but aggravated his injury. He was subsequently forced to sit out the entire semi-final against Brazil, which the Netherlands lost on penalties.|$|E
2500|$|Jan Egeland, Special Advisor to the UN Special Envoy for Syria, {{stated in}} November 2016: [...] "I {{have not seen}} {{a place where there}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> politicization, {{manipulation}} of aid, as we have seen in Syria in recent months. It has to stop!". He also called the bombardment and destruction of the city a [...] "dark chapter" [...] in modern history: ...|$|E
2500|$|Maurice Richardson in the 10 November 1940 {{issue of}} The Observer started, [...] "The Queen of Crime's scheming {{ingenuity}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> praised {{that one is}} sometimes inclined to overlook the lightness of her touch. If Mrs Christie were {{to write about the}} murder of a telephone directory by a time-table the story would still be compellingly readable." [...] He did admit that the [...] "iend's identity is perhaps less obscured than usual; motivation a trifle shaky, but clue details are brilliant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Harvest Threshing {{represents}} a big subject, rich in plastic possibilities. The {{interest of the}} painting resides in its rich and complex fabric of interwoven latticework, with 'the institution of relations between straight lines and curves' or the 'thousand surprises of fire and of shadow' proposed in Du [...] "Cubisme" [...] (co-authored with Jean Metzinger in 1912). The subject matter is entirely, as Le Fauconnier and Gleizes himself says, 'a pretext'. A pencil transcription done to scale by Geneviève Dalban, as Peter Brooke points out, reveals the greatness of the construction. [...] "The 'duration' that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> talked about is entirely {{a matter of the}} length of time that can be spent looking at it, as one thing leads to another, in and out and round about, in an endless visual dance. It is a mark of the failure of the Cubist revolution – its hi-jacking by the champions of the subject – that nearly one hundred years later there are writers on art who can see in such a picture only peasants, a church tower, a rustic meal, mountains, clouds..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Behindwoods gave {{two and a}} half out of five stars citing that the film had a [...] "loose screenplay" [...] but was compensated by a [...] "power packed performance" [...] by the actors. The reviewer compared Arya and Vishal Krishna saying [...] "Unlike Vishal, Arya doesn’t have much scope over performance, but manages to remain under spotlights with his rib-tickling comedy tracks and dialogue delivery. Although we have the signature as ‘A Film By Bala’ during final credits, it’s worth mentioning that the film completely belongs to Vishal." [...] A reviewer from in.com gave three and half out of five and said that the movie is a [...] "definite watch for Bala's followers and to watch the new Vishal emerge as a performer". Further praising Vishal, the critic stats, [...] "there is no doubt that {{from the beginning of the}} making of the film, there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> riding on Vishal's character as he has been playing the role of a squint and has done a fab job." [...] Rohit Ramachandran of nowrunning.com gave it two out of five stars stating that [...] "Avan Ivan, in the end, is Vishal and Arya battling for recognition in the acting arena." [...] Supergoodmovies also gave three and a half stars and concluded that [...] "Avan Ivan will not let down the audience. Though not a typical Bala film, a feel of joy creeps as we watch the film. It is one of the best technically made movies by Bala so far." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Will {{you answer}} me some questions, Adrian?" [...] I asked. [...] "There <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> mystery around us lately, and, like a woman, I am curious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Sir,' she said, 'indeed it is. My poor darling <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> {{afraid he}} was too much set on your coming home, and yet so patient and quiet about it.' ...|$|E
