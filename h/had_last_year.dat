2500|$|A {{sluggish}} offensive {{performance and}} a narrow {{margin of victory}} over a team the Wolverines had beaten 55–0 in 1947 led some in the media to question Oosterbaan's selection as Michigan's new coach. [...] The New York Times opined that Michigan's performance [...] "lacked most of the precision which it <b>had</b> <b>last</b> <b>year</b> under H. O. Crisler." [...] H. G. Salsinger of The Detroit News wrote:"Michigan's first game under Oosterbaan [...] [...] [...] was not impressive. [...] They lacked the spark that distinguished them through the 1947 season. [...] The offense was dull and poorly directed[...] [...] [...] [...] The critics who had judged Oosterbaan's football coaching skills on his record as a basketball coach considered their appraisal justified.

60|$|Mrs. Arnott had {{at first}} been {{inclined}} {{to fear that}} her goddaughter was neglecting her own family, since {{she had not been}} at home this whole year, but the slightest betrayal of this suspicion roused Margaret to an eager defence. She had not a doubt that Flora would gladly have been with her, but she believed that she was not acting by her own choice, or more truly, that her husband was so devoted to her, that she felt the more bound to follow his slightest wishes, however contrary to her own. The season had been spent in the same whirl that <b>had,</b> <b>last</b> <b>year,</b> been almost beyond human power, even when stimulated by enjoyment and success; and now, when her spirits were lowered, and her health weakened, Meta had watched and trembled for her, though never able to obtain an avowal that it was an overstrain, and while treated most affectionately, never admitted within her barrier of reserve.|$|E

The last time she put him out of it he turned around and asked solemnly, 'When you are dead, Susan, can I sit in that chair?' Susan thought it quite dreadful, and I think that was when she began to feel anxiety about his possible ancestry. The other night I took Jims with me for a walk down to the store. It {{was the first time he}} had ever been out so late at night, and when he saw the stars he exclaimed, 'Oh, Willa, see the big moon and all the little moons!'
