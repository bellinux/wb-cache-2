5|$|During his voyage, Cook also visited New Zealand, first {{discovered}} by Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1642, and claimed the North and South islands for the British crown in 1769 and 1770 respectively. Initially, {{interaction between the}} indigenous Māori population and Europeans {{was limited to the}} trading of goods. European settlement increased through {{the early decades of the}} 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North. In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand. On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa had {{meanwhile}} instructed Toho {{to purchase}} the film rights to King's Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter Evan Hunter, under his pseudonym of Ed McBain, {{as one of his}} 87th Precinct series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled High and Low, was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). High and Low <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> commentators to be among the director's strongest works.|$|E
5|$|Ocarina of Times {{gameplay}} introduced {{features such}} as a target-lock system and context-sensitive buttons that have since become common in 3D adventure games.

During its lifetime, 1.14 million copies of Ocarina of Time were sold in Japan, and over 7.6 million copies were sold worldwide. The game won the Grand Prize in the Interactive Art division at the Japan Media Arts Festival, and won six honors at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. , it is the highest-rated game on review-aggregating site Metacritic, with a score of 99/100; in 2008 and 2010, Guinness World Records listed Ocarina of Time as the highest-rated game ever reviewed.

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} successes in film in the 1930s and the pride of MGM at the time, it was {{acclaimed}} as the greatest musical biography {{to be made in}} Hollywood and still remains a standard in musical film making. It won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture for producer Hunt Stromberg, Best Actress for Luise Rainer, and Best Dance Direction for Seymour Felix, and was nominated for four others. Although the film is still praised for its lavish production and as a symbol of glamor and excess during the Golden Age of Hollywood, today The Great Ziegfeld is generally seen less favorably and <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> critics to be excessively showy and long at just under three hours.|$|E
5|$|Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul, {{or simply}} Otis Blue, {{released}} September 15, 1965 on Stax Records, {{is the third}} studio album by soul singer Otis Redding.

Otis Blue was critically acclaimed upon release {{and became one of}} Redding's most successful albums; it reached number 6 on the UK Albums Chart, and was his first to reach the top spot of the Billboard R chart.

It <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> critics to be Redding's first fully realized album.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} the NFL draft, lasting six hours, eight minutes. One of the big stories of the draft was the fall of Notre Dame quarterback Brady Quinn. Quinn had been {{projected}} as a potential first overall pick in early mock drafts and had been invited to attend the draft in person, but he wasn't selected until the 22nd pick in the first round by the Cleveland Browns, who acquired the pick in a trade with the Dallas Cowboys. Louisiana State University quarterback JaMarcus Russell was selected first overall by the Oakland Raiders after he had replaced Quinn as the projected first selection among most analysts following his performance in the 2007 Sugar Bowl against Quinn and Notre Dame. Russell <b>is</b> <b>considered</b> <b>by</b> <b>many</b> as one of the biggest draft busts in NFL history, and Quinn also had a largely unsuccessful pro career.|$|E
