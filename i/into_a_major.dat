Until 2007 Shell Chemicals UK operated a major petrochemicals manufacturing complex in Carrington, Partington's closest neighbour, to the east. The gas storage facility in the north-eastern corner of the town was once a gasworks and another significant employer.|$|E

5|$|At the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, Howe outmaneuvered Washington {{and marched}} into the American capital at Philadelphia unopposed on September 26. Washington's army unsuccessfully {{attacked}} the British garrison at Germantown in early October. Meanwhile, to the north, Burgoyne {{was beyond the}} reach of help from Howe, trapped and forced to surrender after the Battles of Saratoga. This was a major turning point militarily and diplomatically—the French responded to Burgoyne's defeat by entering the war, allying with America and expanding the Revolutionary War <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> worldwide affair.|$|E

On hearing of David’s death he marched north-eastward to claim the lands David had promised to the emperor. The local Georgian and Armenian nobility submitted without any serious resistance.

5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>major</b> industrial enterprise.|$|E

Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the Treaty of Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776), and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E

Humbert's assignment in the Indies was changed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>major's</b> pension without assignment, so that Humbert was now free to work on archaeological projects.|$|R
5|$|Chadderton's {{urbanisation}} {{and expansion}} largely coincided with developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian era.

More than 50cotton mills had been built in Chadderton by 1914.|$|E

Nixon won the Republican-leaning district by over 15,000 votes and Voorhis refused to run against Nixon in 1948.|$|E
