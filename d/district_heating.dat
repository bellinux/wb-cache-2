5|$|In 2011, {{as part of}} Sheffield City Council's {{drive to}} become {{self-sufficient}} for energy, construction of a biomass power station began. It is operated by E.ON UK, and was completed in 2014.

5|$|In total, {{electrical}} plant {{construction and}} well drilling cost about €2–5million perMW of electrical capacity, while the break–even price is 0.04–0.10€ perkW·h. Enhanced geothermal systems {{tend to be}} on the high side of these ranges, with capital costs above $4million perMW and break–even above $0.054 perkW·h in 2007. Direct heating applications can use much shallower wells with lower temperatures, so smaller systems with lower costs and risks are feasible. Residential geothermal heat pumps with a capacity of 10kilowatt (kW) are routinely installed for around $1–3,000 perkilowatt. <b>District</b> <b>heating</b> systems may benefit from economies of scale if demand is geographically dense, as in cities and greenhouses, but otherwise piping installation dominates capital costs. The capital cost of one such <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> system in Bavaria was estimated at somewhat over 1million€ perMW. Direct systems of any size are much simpler than electric generators and have lower maintenance costs perkW·h, but they must consume electricity to run pumps and compressors. Some governments subsidize geothermal projects.|$|E

We investigated {{under what conditions}} a solar heating system become cost-efficient to integrate in <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production systems {{and the consequences of}} this integration. We considered a small-scale <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production system in the south of Sweden where district-heat production cost is higher and hence it is more cost efficient to integrate solar heating in such a <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production systems. The cost-efficiency of integrating solar heating in a minimum-cost renewable-based <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production system depends on future fuel prices and investment costs of solar heating systems.

40|$|Domestic heating {{represents}} {{the most dominant}} energy function in Dutch households nowadays. Using <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> from CHP (combined heat and power) {{by means of a}} NGCC (natural gas-fired combined cycle) plants is generally acknowledged as an effective option to reduce primary energy consumption for heating. However, methods to calculate energy savings from CHP differ widely. This paper compares a number of different methods, including the method from the EU CHP Directive, to estimate primary energy savings in comparison with the typically used domestic gas-fired condensing boiler. Real hourly CHP plant performance data is used. An estimation of the CO 2 mitigation cost of delivering <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> to Dutch dwellings is made. We find that supplying dwellings with <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> from an NGCC-CHP saves energy, regardless of the calculation method and for a rather wide range of reference efficiencies.

5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing and washing clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran {{from one of the}} hot springs outside the city. In 1943, the first <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> company was started with the use of geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{have been}} used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used the hot springs there to feed public baths and underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal <b>district</b> <b>heating</b> system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E
40|$|Swedish {{pulp and}} paper {{industry}} is facing a future with increased competition from manufacturers with access to faster-growing raw materials, cheaper labour and more modern mills. To survive and stay competitive, investments in more efficient production could be one option. This thesis addresses the potential for increased energy efficiency at Iggesund Paperboard - Iggesund mill. The mill is an integrated {{pulp and paper}}board mill that is almost self-sustaining in energy aspects, producing most of its own need for electricity, and is a provider of heat to the local <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> system. To evaluate the energy situation, pinch analysis was used for identifying and evaluating the energy saving potential. The analysis is limited to the pulping process and the chemical recovery cycle. A new recovery boiler will be in place by June 2012 and the energy situation has been adapted to these future conditions. Based on data collected on site, today’s energy situation was mapped and the potential for energy savings evaluated. The author can conclude that energy savings are possible. The pinch analysis shows that up to 18 MW of steam theoretically can be saved in the future process. Besides this there is also a wish to reduce the use of primary <b>heat</b> in the <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production. Available heat sources for process integration are mainly flue gases, hot bleach plant effluents and flash steam. In order to partly realise this saving potential, two stream saving retrofits are presented. By changing the preheating of boiler feed water, 7. 9 MW of steam can be saved, which is equal to 2. 6 % of the mill’s total steam demand. If a more extensive retrofit is constructed the savings increase to 13 MW, which is equal to 4. 4 % of the total steam demand. Increased process integration will reduce the capacity for <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production but still the more extensive retrofit has the opportunity to produce 44 % of the needed <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> peak load. Furthermore, this thesis also presents a retrofit evaluating the maximum potential for <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> production that aims to produce 22 MW of peak <b>district</b> <b>heat,</b> but without possibility for other steam saving actions. Finally, it is also concluded that when comparing the mill to others, there is a potential for reduction of the steam demand at the wood yard...|$|R

A deep geothermal well was used to heat greenhouses in Boise in 1926, and geysers were used to heat greenhouses in Iceland and Tuscany at about the same time. Charlie Lieb developed the first downhole heat exchanger in 1930 to heat his house. Steam and hot water from geysers began heating homes in Iceland starting in 1943.|$|E

5|$|The thermal {{efficiency}} of geothermal electric plants is low, around 10–23%, because geothermal fluids do {{not reach the}} high temperatures of steam from boilers.

Exhaust heat is wasted, unless {{it can be used}} directly and locally, for example in greenhouses, timber mills, and <b>district</b> <b>heating.</b> System efficiency does not materially affect operational costs as it would for plants that use fuel, but it does affect return on the capital used to build the plant. In order to produce more energy than the pumps consume, electricity generation requires relatively hot fields and specialized heat cycles. Because geothermal power does not rely on variable sources of energy, unlike, for example, wind or solar, its capacity factor can be quite large – up to 96% has been demonstrated.

A new refined supervision system must be developed. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate mathematical methods {{that can be used}} to find incorrect hourly measurements in <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> and electricity consumption, for each consumer. A simulation model and a statistical model have been derived. The model parameters in the simulation model are estimated by using historical data of consumption and outdoor temperature. By using the outdoor temperature as input, the consumption can be simulated and compared to the actual consumption. Faults are detected by using a residual with a sliding window. The second model uses the fact that consumers with similar consumption patterns can be grouped into a collective. By studying the correlation between the consumers, incorrect measurements can be found. The performed simulations show that the simulation model is best suited for consumers whose consumption is mostly affected by the outdoor temperature. These consumers are <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> consumers and electricity consumers that use electricity for space heating. The fault detection performance of the statistical model is highly dependent on finding a collective that is well correlated. If these collectives can be found, the model can be used on <b>district</b> <b>heat</b> consumers as well as electricity consumers...|$|R
