25|$|Gerber {{is used in}} PCB <b>fabrication</b> <b>data.</b> PCBs are {{designed}} on a specialized electronic design automation (EDA) or a computer-aided design (CAD) system. The CAD systems output PCB <b>fabrication</b> <b>data</b> to allow <b>fabrication</b> of the board. This data typically contains a Gerber file for each image layer (copper layers, solder mask, legend or silk...). Gerber is also the standard image input format for all bare board fabrication equipment needing image data, such as photoplotters, legend printers, direct imagers or automated optical inspection (AOI) machines and for viewing reference images in different departments. For assembly the <b>fabrication</b> <b>data</b> contains the solder paste layers and the central locations of components to create the stencil and place and bond the components.|$|R

By tightly focusing a laser pulse in the bulk of a transparent material nonlinear optical absorption occurs inside the material, leading to extreme high temperatures and material changes at the focus.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the abilities of acoustic emission testing and self-sensing fibres to detect damage in composite materials. This was achieved by performing acoustic emission testing on fibre samples and resin samples during tensile tests. In parallel to the acoustic emission testing the changes in strain for the resin samples was recorded using electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. Acoustic emission testing of Self-sensing fibre composites allowed the recorded changes in the light intensity transmitted by the fibres to be analysed in conjunction with the acoustic emission <b>data.</b> The <b>fabrication</b> of the three different sample types is presented as is the installation of the electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. The experimental procedure and method of data capture is detailed for tensile and acoustic emission testing, strain data and Self-sensing fibre <b>data.</b> The <b>fabrication</b> and testing of the samples was performed successfully. The testing procedure and analysis of results demonstrates the accurate use of acoustic emission and the potential of self-sensing fibres in detecting damage in composite materials...|$|R
