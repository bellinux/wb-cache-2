5|$|In a {{preliminary}} survey of nearly 400 seven-year-olds, 45% chose <b>even</b> <b>over</b> odd when asked the parity of zero. A follow-up investigation offered more choices: neither, both, and don't know. This time {{the number of}} children in the same age range identifying zero as even dropped to 32%. Success in deciding that zero is even initially shoots up and then levels off at around 50% in Years 3 to 6. For comparison, the easiest task, identifying the parity of a single digit, levels off at about 85% success.|$|E
5|$|Large Danubian {{complexes}} were {{in recent}} years excavated in the Targowisko and Szarów (Wieliczka County) area of fertile loessial hills. The settlements, which included massive post construction houses <b>even</b> <b>over</b> 50 meters long as well as industrial facilities, extended continuously over a stretch of land more than three kilometers long. Some of the identified structures functioned together, {{as was the case}} when the buildings were connected by a courtyard and protected by a common fence.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Crusade {{resulted}} in the disruption of Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial dominance of the Western Europeans in the eastern Mediterranean, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the Empire. The Palaiologoi tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, <b>even</b> <b>over</b> the minting of coins.|$|E

5|$|Due to an overcommitment of {{resources}} {{early in the}} war, the Australian economy suffered badly from manpower shortages as early as 1942. As a result, the government began the demobilisation process before the war was <b>even</b> <b>over,</b> and when it had finally come to an end, the government was necessarily very keen for the demobilisation process to be completed as quickly as possible. Understandably, defence issues were not given a high priority as people tried to rebuild their lives {{after the war and}} as such it was not until 1948 that the Citizen Military Forces (CMF) was reformed.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the Aksumite coins were also closely controlled, usually of high purity. For example, the lowest purity of gold {{recorded}} thus far for Aphilas is 90 percent. Early issues were often very close to their theoretical weights, and some were <b>even</b> <b>over.)</b> However, {{the weight of the}} coins tended to decrease over time (though not continuously or uniformly). This may have reflected a desire to conform to the Diocletian monetary reform of 301, when the aureus was decreased from 1/60 of a pound to 1/72. Despite decreases in weight, the purity of the gold was largely maintained, even by later kings. The relative abundance of Aksumite coins as well as the many that have yet to be found indicate that Aksum must have had access to large quantities of gold.|$|E
5|$|While most jumping spiders {{are active}} hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, {{generally}} resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree barks, {{pieces of wood}} or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or <b>even</b> <b>over</b> its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey {{for a week or}} more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs.|$|E

5|$|Herd numbers {{grew from}} 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and {{overgrazing}} negatively impacted their living environment. To manage population numbers, long-term, non-hormonal contraceptives have been employed, proving 95 percent effective over a seven-year field trial. The contraceptive, which {{began to be}} used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989, has also proven effective at improving the health and increasing the life expectancy of older mares through the removal of pregnancy and lactation-related stress. Since 1990, general herd health has improved, early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found, with many {{over the age of}} 20 and some <b>even</b> <b>over</b> 25. No horse has ever been injured during the dart-administered treatments, although there is a 0.2 percent rate of abscess at the injection site, which normally heals within two weeks. Each mare between two and four years old is given contraceptives, and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal. Once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within the herd, she is placed on a yearly treatment plan until her death. After the introduction of the contraceptive, herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005, but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009. In 2009, a study determined that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the herd was quite low, most likely due to their isolation, but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from the mainland.|$|E

25|$|Stellar {{evolution}} is not studied by observing {{the life of}} a single star, as most stellar changes occur too slowly to be detected, <b>even</b> <b>over</b> many centuries. Instead, astrophysicists come to understand how stars evolve by observing numerous stars at various points in their lifetime, and by simulating stellar structure using computer models.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{a design}} {{constraint}} {{is that the}} microwave beam must not be so intense as to injure wildlife, particularly birds. Experiments with deliberate microwave irradiation at reasonable levels have failed to show negative effects <b>even</b> <b>over</b> multiple generations. Suggestions {{have been made to}} locate rectennas offshore, but this presents serious problems, including corrosion, mechanical stresses, and biological contamination.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} application of ADP crystals were hydrophones for acoustic mines; the crystals were specified for low-frequency cutoff at 5Hz, withstanding mechanical shock for deployment from aircraft from , and ability to survive neighbouring mine explosions.

25|$|Such a {{transformation}} {{is called a}} diagonalizable matrix since in the eigenbasis, the transformation is represented by a diagonal matrix. Because operations like matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and determinant calculation are simple on diagonal matrices, computations involving matrices are much simpler if we can bring the matrix to a diagonal form. Not all matrices are diagonalizable (<b>even</b> <b>over</b> an algebraically closed field).|$|E
25|$|The sound {{perceived}} may {{range from}} a quiet background noise to {{one that can be}} heard <b>even</b> <b>over</b> loud external sounds. The specific type of tinnitus called pulsatile tinnitus is characterized by hearing the sounds of one's own pulse or muscle contractions, which is typically a result of sounds that have been created by the movement of muscles near to one's ear, or the sounds are related to blood flow of the neck or face.|$|E
25|$|Syrah, as it {{is known}} in France, is grown {{throughout}} the Rhône valley. The wines that are made from it vary greatly, <b>even</b> <b>over</b> small changes in the vines locations. The differences in the soil quality as well as the changes in the slope of the terrain tend to produce different styles of wine. Ranging from the mineral and tannic nature of Hermitage, to fruity and perfumed in the case of Côte-Rôtie.|$|E

25|$|Between 1902 and 1907, Arthur Korn invented {{and built}} the first {{successful}} signal-conditioning circuits for image transmission. The circuits overcame the image-destroying lag effect {{that is part of}} selenium photocells. Korn's compensation circuit allowed him to send still fax pictures by telephone or wireless between countries and <b>even</b> <b>over</b> oceans, while his circuit operated without benefit of electronic amplification. Korn's success at transmitting halftone still images suggested that such compensation circuits might work in television. Baird was the direct beneficiary of Korn's research and success.|$|E
25|$|The {{levelized cost}} of {{electricity}} (LCOE), also known as Levelized Energy Cost (LEC), is the net present value of the unit-{{cost of electricity}} over the lifetime of a generating asset. It is often taken {{as a proxy for}} the average price that the generating asset must receive in a market to break <b>even</b> <b>over</b> its lifetime. It is a first-order economic assessment of the cost competitiveness of an electricity-generating system that incorporates all costs over its lifetime: initial investment, operations and maintenance, cost of fuel, cost of capital.|$|E
