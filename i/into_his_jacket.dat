25|$|In March 1968, Lane {{was charged}} with {{importing}} marijuana into Australia. He was arrested at Sydney Airport and remanded in custody. He strenuously protested his innocence, claiming that the drugs were planted <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket by a former business associate who wanted revenge. He {{was found not guilty}} on all charges, being defended by barrister Marcus Einfeld.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{opened a}} {{cupboard}} for the police: amongst medicine bottles were [...] "chocolates – slabs stuck – butter, margarine, sugar". While the officers inspected it Adams walked to another cupboard and slipped two objects <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket. Hannam and Pugh challenged him and Adams showed them {{two bottles of}} morphine; one he said was for Annie Sharpe, a patient and major witness who had died nine days earlier under his care; the other said [...] "Mr Soden". He had died on 17 September 1956 but pharmacy records later showed Soden had never been prescribed morphine. Adams was later (after his main trial in 1957) convicted of obstructing the search, concealing the bottles and for failing to keep a Dangerous Drugs register.|$|E
2500|$|The {{officers}} {{testified that}} they loudly {{identified themselves as}} NYPD officers, but a witness, Schrrie Elliott, testified that they started shooting without any warnings. Diallo ran up the outside steps toward his apartment house doorway at their approach, ignoring their orders to stop and [...] "show his hands". The porch lightbulb was out and Diallo was backlit by the inside vestibule light, showing only a silhouette. Diallo then reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and withdrew his wallet. Seeing the man holding a small square object, Carroll yelled [...] "Gun!" [...] to alert his colleagues. The officers opened fire on Diallo, claiming that they believed {{he was holding a}} gun. During the shooting, lead officer McMellon tripped backward off the front stairs, causing the other officers to believe he had been shot. The four officers fired 41 shots, more than half of which went astray as Diallo was hit 19 times.|$|E
60|$|Massy, {{blocking}} the engine-room companion, jerked himself <b>into</b> <b>his</b> tweed <b>jacket</b> surlily, {{while the second}} waited with a scowl.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Detail of Conversation Piece (Portrait of Sir Andrew Fountaine with Other Men and Women) by William Hogarth, c. 1730-35 - Fountaine is {{probably}} the figure on the far left, with a red sash and his left hand tucked <b>into</b> <b>his</b> brown <b>jacket.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sherwani {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Hyderabad, although it has spread since {{to the rest of}} India and to Pakistan. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru adapted its design and turned it <b>into</b> <b>his</b> trademark Nehru <b>Jacket,</b> further popularizing the garment.|$|R
6000|$|... "It isn't a {{pleasant}} one, is it, Philippa?" [...] he observed, thrusting his hands <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pockets strolling away. [...] "If one doesn't feel the call--well, there you are, you see. Jove, that's a fine fish." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nod wriggled closer <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> [...] "Trouble not, Queen of Munza," [...] he said softly. [...] "I shouldn't {{have time}} to use them now." [...] He shut his eyes again, and all his pain seemed to be {{floating}} away in sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "These!" [...] was the answer, and {{the speaker}} thrust his hand <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket. [...] "If Mr. Thurston had not been of such tireless nature, I might have found leisure to admire {{the beauty of this}} most entrancing coast scenery, instead of puzzling over weary figures in a {{particularly}} stuffy saloon." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 19, 2003, Espinosa {{was arrested}} during the Black Spring after {{security}} agents reportedly spent 10 hours searching his apartment. At a trial on April 3, 2003, Espinosa {{was accused of}} [...] "activities against the integrity and sovereignty of the State". Authorities stated that Espinosa had received money from the U.S. government, and that US$13,600 had been discovered sewn <b>into</b> one of <b>his</b> <b>jackets.</b> Espinosa was subsequently {{convicted and sentenced to}} 20 years in prison. He was one of approximately 75 dissidents arrested and tried.|$|R
50|$|Ted {{comments}} {{that all of}} the photos in Lily's photo album show no signs of the fights and disagreements that happened only moments before they were taken. Lily turns the page to the first photo that she, Marshall, and Ted had taken together back in college, a result of Ted inviting her into the picture because he believed that her and Marshall's relationship would last. Lily apologizes to Ted and agrees to call back Amanda. When the time comes for the group photo, Robin tricks Barney <b>into</b> removing <b>his</b> suit <b>jacket</b> just before the picture is taken, but the finished product shows Barney in his usual pose, much to Robin's dismay.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll go {{back and}} be damned to it!" [...] said the captain recklessly, {{plunging}} <b>his</b> hands <b>into</b> the pockets of <b>his</b> pea <b>jacket</b> and plumping back <b>into</b> <b>his</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|Twelve {{days after}} leaving Liverpool they were, however, awakened {{early one morning}} by feeling the express-train {{suddenly}} slacken speed. The big cars shook with a violent jarring, and George hurriedly swung himself down from his upper berth. He had some difficulty in getting <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and putting on his boots, but he pushed through the startled passengers and sprang down upon the track before the train quite stopped. He knew that accidents were not uncommon {{in the wilds of}} northern Ontario.|$|E
60|$|BRASSBOUND (returning {{in his own}} clothes, getting <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> as he comes). Stand by, all. (They start asunder guiltily, {{and wait}} for orders.) Redbrook: you pack that clobber in the lady's portmanteau, and put it aboard the yacht for her. Johnson: you take all hands aboard the Thanksgiving; look through the stores: weigh anchor; and make all ready for sea. Then send Jack to wait {{for me at the}} slip with a boat; and give me a gunfire for a signal. Lose no time.|$|E
60|$|The man {{shook his}} fist, and, turning his face towards the pass, ran back towards his booth in the hills, {{intending}} {{to take the}} boy's first piece of advice, and quit {{that part of the}} country. But Billy had no idea of letting him off thus. He now became the pursuer. However fast the gypsy ran, the sailor-lad kept up with him. If the man halted, as he frequently did in a breathless condition, and tried to gain over his adversary, Billy also stopped, said he was in no hurry, thrust his hands <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pockets, and began to whistle. Thus he kept him in view until they once more stood in the pass. Here the man sat down on a large stone, thoroughly exhausted. The boy sat down on another stone opposite to him, looking quite fresh and jolly. Five years of hearty devotion to a noble calling had prepared the muscles of the little sailor for that day's exercise. The same number of years spent in debauchery and crime had not prepared the vagabond giant for that day's work.|$|E
60|$|The trouble {{vanished}} out of Tom's face. He opened <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> <b>His</b> shirt collar was securely sewed.|$|R
50|$|Yancy Derringer's {{weapons of}} choice were four-barrel Sharps pepperbox derringer handguns. He carried 3 of them concealed: one {{held by a}} clamp inside {{the top of his}} hat, one in his vest's left pocket under <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and one up <b>his</b> <b>jacket's</b> left sleeve in a wrist holster.|$|R

6000|$|There was {{a moment}} of {{surprised}} stillness. Then the forecastle floor disappeared under men whose bare feet flopped on the planks as they sprang clear out of their berths. Caps were rooted for amongst tumbled blankets. Some, yawning, buttoned waistbands. Half-smoked pipes were knocked hurriedly against woodwork and stuffed under pillows. Voices growled:--"What's up?... Is there no rest for us?" [...] Donkin yelped:--"If that's the way of this ship, we'll 'ave to change all that.... You leave me alone.... I will soon...." [...] None of the crowd noticed him. They were lurching in twos and threes through the doors, after the manner of merchant Jacks who cannot go out of a door fairly, like mere landsmen. The votary of change followed them. Singleton, struggling <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> came last, tall and fatherly, bearing high his head of a weather-beaten sage on the body of an old athlete. Only Charley remained alone in the white glare of the empty place, sitting between the two rows of iron links that stretched into the narrow gloom forward. He pulled hard at the strands in a hurried endeavour to finish his knot. Suddenly he started up, flung the rope at the cat, and skipped after the black tom which went off leaping sedately over chain compressors, with its tail carried stiff and upright, like a small flag pole.|$|E
60|$|Following her habit, {{my young}} lady descended early, and visited the kitchen: I watched her {{go to the}} door, on {{the arrival of a}} certain little boy; and, while the dairymaid filled his can, she tucked {{something}} <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket, and plucked something out. I went round by the garden, and laid wait for the messenger; who fought valorously to defend his trust, and we spilt the milk between us; but I succeeded in abstracting the epistle; and, threatening serious consequences if he did not look sharp home, I remained under the wall and perused Miss Cathy's affectionate composition. It was more simple and more eloquent than her cousin's: very pretty and very silly. I shook my head, and went meditating into the house. The day being wet, she could not divert herself with rambling about the park; so, at the conclusion of her morning studies, she resorted to the solace of the drawer. Her father sat reading at the table; and I, on purpose, had sought a bit of work in some unripped fringes of the window-curtain, keeping my eye steadily fixed on her proceedings. Never did any bird flying back to a plundered nest, which it had left brimful of chirping young ones, express more complete despair, in its anguished cries and flutterings, than she by her single 'Oh!' and the change that transfigured her late happy countenance. Mr. Linton looked up.|$|E
5000|$|Gangster Noodles Romanoff and his evil {{organization}} N.A.S.T.Y. (National Association of Spies, Traitors and Yahoos). Noodles wears dark glasses, a fedora, and {{a trench}} coat. His hands are always jammed <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pockets. His band of No Goods consist of several lookalike henchmen clad in hats and coats, who simultaneously utter incomprehensible phrases.|$|E
5000|$|Various {{explosive}} devices (i.e. smoke bombs, impact-flares, gas grenades, anti-lock key, explosive Putty etc.) carried in <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pockets, belt buckle, hat, a secret compartment in his holster, and the hollowed-out heels {{of one or}} both boots. Various lengths and types of fuses were sewn into the hem of <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> or the waistband of his pants.|$|R
5000|$|Knight was disqualified when {{he refused}} to take off <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> to wrestle Watson.|$|R

50|$|Mirra was {{discovered}} hours later by a beat officer from the NYPD, who believed Mirra was a vagrant {{asleep in his}} car. Inspecting Mirra's right side revealed a stream of blood draining {{out of his head}} and <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> So much blood had pooled inside of his clothing that when the coroner removed Mirra's clothes, his yellow boxer shorts at first appeared red.|$|E
50|$|When Xiang stopped {{shooting}} {{and moved to}} switch weapons, Lee Gordon-Brown, the injured lecturer, grabbed Xiang's hands as he reached <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b> Gordon-Brown and {{a student in the}} room, Alastair Boast, a trained wing chun practitioner, tackled him.Bradley Thompson later entered the room and discovered five guns in holsters around Xiang's waist, including two Berettas, a Taurus, and two revolvers, as well as two magazines from near his hip.|$|E
60|$|Then he felt in {{the pocket}} of <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> and brought out a sixpenny-piece.|$|R

60|$|There was no answer. Mr. Thomas Marvel stood bootless and amazed, <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> nearly thrown off.|$|R
5000|$|In the Dirty Harry spoof, Harry was {{downgraded}} to a {{video store}} detective. After chasing a suspect all over San Francisco, Harry finally cornered {{him in an}} alley. He reaches <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> and slowly pulls out a VHS movie, asking the suspect [...] "What I {{have here is a}} VHS video cassette, the most popular format in the world, and the question is, punk... did you rewind it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Arkady Makarovich Dolgoruky is {{the protagonist}} of the novel. He took the name Dolgoruky from his aged adoptive father, {{even though he is}} the illegitimate son of the {{dissipated}} landowner Versilov. Arkady's dream is to [...] "become a Rothschild" [...] (i.e. become fabulously wealthy like a member of the famed Rothschild family). In his quest for wealth Arkady becomes entangled with socialist conspirators and a young widow, whose future is somehow dependent on a document that Arkady has sewn <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket.</b>|$|E
50|$|Then, while Donald {{tries to}} begain the song, a bee harasses him. When the bee lands on Mickey's hat, Donald throws ice cream at the bee, which sends it into Peter Pig's trumpet and he hits it at Mickey, {{thinking}} that Mickey threw {{the ice cream}} at him. Mickey has the band play Ranz des Vaches and loses his temper when the bee interrupts the performance. Percussionist Horace Horsecollar tries to kill the bee with a hammer but accidentally hits Goofy's head instead, driving his head down <b>into</b> <b>his</b> <b>jacket,</b> but he continues playing his clarinet from inside it.|$|E
60|$|Timmy {{took off}} <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> {{and hung it}} on a twig; they worked away quietly by themselves.|$|R
60|$|Walthew stood still, {{his hand}} in <b>his</b> <b>jacket</b> pocket, as if about to take the despatches from it.|$|R
