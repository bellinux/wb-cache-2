5|$|Banking also {{developed}} in this period. The Bank of Scotland was suspected of Jacobite sympathies {{and so a}} rival Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727. Local banks began to be established in burghs like Glasgow and Ayr. These would make capital available <b>for</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> the improvement of roads and trade, which would help create the conditions for the Industrial Revolution that accelerated {{in the second half}} of the century.|$|E

5|$|Bedřich Smetana {{was born}} as Friedrich Smetana on 2March 1824, in Litomyšl, east of Prague near the {{traditional}} border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He {{was the third}} child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, <b>for</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of the correct literary Czech until much later in their lives.|$|E

Keynesian economics, they believed, was weakening Britain. The institute's pamphlets proposed less government, lower taxes, and more freedom <b>for</b> <b>business</b> <b>and</b> consumers.|$|E

5|$|Victor {{arrived in}} Genoa City, Wisconsin <b>for</b> <b>business,</b> <b>and</b> he {{eventually}} formed his own worldwide conglomerate, Newman Enterprises.

5|$|Prior {{to moving}} its {{headquarters}} to Chicago, aerospace manufacturer Boeing (#30) {{was the largest}} company based in Seattle. Its largest division is still headquartered in nearby Renton, and the company has large aircraft manufacturing plants in Everett and Renton, so it remains the largest private employer in the Seattle metropolitan area. Former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels announced a desire to spark a new economic boom driven by the biotechnology industry in 2006. Major redevelopment of the South Lake Union neighborhood is underway, {{in an effort to}} attract new and established biotech companies to the city, joining biotech companies Corixa (acquired by GlaxoSmithKline), Immunex (now part of Amgen), Trubion, and ZymoGenetics. Vulcan Inc., the holding company of billionaire Paul Allen, is behind most of the development projects in the region. While some see the new development as an economic boon, others have criticized Nickels and the Seattle City Council for pandering to Allen's interests at taxpayers' expense. Also in 2006, Expansion Magazine ranked Seattle among the top 10 metropolitan areas in the nation for climates favorable to business expansion. In 2005, Forbes ranked Seattle as the most expensive American city for buying a house based on the local income levels. In 2013, however, the magazine ranked Seattle No. 9 on its list of the Best Places <b>for</b> <b>Business</b> <b>and</b> Careers.|$|E
