He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health <b>governance</b> <b>system,</b> amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal <b>governance</b> <b>system</b> initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance of the Pipe rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E
40|$|Ownership {{structure}} {{is considered to}} be one of the key aspects of corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> because it influences their effectiveness and efficiency. This research provides systematic, empirical evidence to demonstrate how the complex ownership structure predominant in Saudi Arabia affects the corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> of petrochemical companies listed in the Saudi Capital Market. This thesis investigates the following research questions: What is unique about the ownership structures in the Saudi context and corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> within petrochemical companies listed in the Saudi capital market? What problems are associated with corporate governance in this context? What response to these problems will improve <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> in the Saudi petrochemical context? This research used the non-classical principal–principal conflict view of agency theory to describe how ownership structure affects corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> in the Saudi context (Young et al. 2008). Theoretical arguments are tested by gathering primary and secondary data via a mixed-method approach to gather both qualitative and quantitative data. Three methods were used: a demographic survey, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. One of the main features of this research is the Saudi context, with its unique ownership structure and its legal, economic, political, social and cultural systems. There is a gap in the literature examining the relationships between ownership structure and corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> in the Saudi context. Another feature of this research is the use of AHP, a sophisticated systematic mathematical methodology that analyses how people think and behave (Saaty 1980). The study findings demonstrate that Saudi Arabia has distinguishing factors that are associated with internal problems in its corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems.</b> The key findings show that participants relied extensively on external rather than internal <b>governance</b> <b>systems,</b> and paid almost no attention to external auditors, communication with minor shareholders, interference of others, the functions and process of the board of directors or board characteristics. The main contribution of this thesis to current knowledge is that it extends the literature on the effect of ownership structure on corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> in Saudi Arabia. These findings show that policy makers and companies should consider the uniqueness of the Saudi context. Further, the results can be used by participants in the Saudi Capital Market to evaluate current corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> and the role of major shareholders; they can also be used by regulators and companies to improve their corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

From these findings, first arguments are deduced for balancing formalized and more informal co-operations in cross-border <b>governance</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study takes a {{step forward}} to explore the dynamic {{relationship}} between cultural values and stock market development in the United Kingdom, during the period 1991 - 2004. Cultural values are represented by the cultural model of Hofstede (1980) which consists of five dimensions, which are: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism, masculinity and time horizon. Stock market developmenti s representedb y four indicators, which are: stock market activity, size, liquidity and concentration. Empirical results, using structural equation modelling (SEM), show that some cultural values have significant relationships with stock market development indicators. Power distance has a significant negative relationship with stock market size, while individuality has a significant positive relationship with stock market activity at the 0. 90 confidence level. Furthermore, since good corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> are considered as {{an important component of}} stock market development, this study has been extended to explore the impact of cultural values on corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> across twenty four countries in Western Europe, North America and Asia Pacific. Corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> are represented by 6 ght aspects, which are: board size, separation of chair and CEO, independence per board, independent audit committee, remuneration disclosure, women on board, code of ethics and ethics systems. The regression analysis results show that cultural values {{have a significant impact on}} several corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> across countries. Individuality has significant positive relationships with three corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems,</b> which are: independence per board, audit committee, and ethics systems. Power distance has a significant positive relationship with separation of chair and CEO. The interaction term, uncertainty avoidance/masculinity, has significant negative relationships with three corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems,</b> which are: independence per board, remuneration disclosure, and code of ethics. Moreover, the interaction term power distance/masculinity has a significant negative impact on women on board. This study concludes that several cultural values play an important role in the formation and behaviour of stock market development over time, and on corporate <b>governance</b> <b>systems</b> across countries.
