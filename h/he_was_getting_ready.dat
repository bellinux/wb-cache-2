500|$|Uchikoshi, who was freelancing at the time, came up {{with the}} {{original}} concept and pitch for the game after having started to research material in August 2001, including the Russian mathematician P. D. Ouspensky's book Tertium Organum. A month later, he took a trip to Bali, from which he got a lot of inspiration for the story. As <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to return to Japan, he saw live news coverage of the September 11 attacks; because the game's plot was conceived during this time, Uchikoshi said that the story was influenced by the [...] "spirit of the time" [...] following the attacks. He wrote it from September until February the next year, after which the story was divided among the scenario writers, who wrote the script over the course of three months, from March to May 2002.|$|E
2500|$|Eliade's former friend, the {{communist}} Belu Zilber, who was attending the Paris Conference in 1946, refused to see Eliade, arguing that, as an Iron Guard affiliate, the latter had [...] "denounced left-wingers", and contrasting him with Cioran ("They are both Legionaries, but [...] is honest"). Three years later, Eliade's political activities were brought into discussion as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> {{to publish a}} translation of his Techniques du Yoga with the left-leaning Italian company Giulio Einaudi Editore—the denunciation was probably orchestrated by Romanian officials.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an account}} {{recorded}} by Athenaeus, Timocreon {{ended up at}} the court of the Persian king where he distinguished himself as an athlete and glutton, eating so much that the king himself asked him {{what he was trying to}} do, to which Timocreon replied that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to beat up countless Persians. He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, just to show that [...] "he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on." [...] However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a topos of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes.|$|E

2500|$|On June 25, 2009, {{shortly after}} Michael Jackson {{had gone into}} cardiac arrest, Hilton posted {{an article about the}} star's illness, {{claiming}} it was a publicity stunt. Hilton's original post featured sarcastic comments such as [...] "Get your money back, ticket holders!!!!" [...] and [...] "Jacko pulled a similar stunt when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for his big HBO special in '95 when he 'collapsed' at rehearsal!", in response to Jackson's recently sold out tour through March 2010. Upon realizing Michael Jackson's death was not a hoax, Hilton immediately deleted the original news post and replaced it with a shorter message that linked to a story at entertainment news site TMZ, which said the singer had in fact gone into cardiac arrest. Hilton has received backlash for the incident, becoming entangled in a Twitter argument with Pete Wentz about the situation.|$|E

60|$|When he was twenty-eight, a thick-limbed, stiff, fair {{man with}} fresh complexion, {{and blue eyes}} staring very {{straight}} ahead, he was coming one day down from Cossethay with a load of seed out of Nottingham. It {{was a time when}} <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for another bout of drinking, so he stared fixedly before him, watchful yet absorbed, seeing everything and aware of nothing, coiled in himself. It was early in the year.|$|E
60|$|So I {{decided to}} put John to the test. It had been my habit every morning after he put his coat on {{to go to the}} office to let John have one kiss, just one weeny kiss, to keep him happy all day. So this day when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> I bent my head over a big bowl of flowers and pretended not to notice. I think John must have been hurt, as I heard him steal out on tiptoe.|$|E
60|$|That was {{the point}} at which his {{reflections}} always came up with a jolt. He was quite clear about the method of getting ready, but he hadn't the slightest idea of what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> for. The moment he had redecided to marry Claire, he saw that his only possible future would be celibate machinery-installing in Alaska; and the moment he was content with the prospect of an engineer's camp in Alaskan wilds, his thoughts went crazily fluttering after Claire.|$|E

The novel {{is set in the}} 1930s during the Great Depression. Most of the characters exist at the fringes of the Hollywood film industry, but Hollywood is merely the backdrop for Tod Hackett's revelation.

60|$|Johnny {{opened his}} mouth to say something, but he closed it again without {{speaking}} and meekly trotted after Polly Chuck to the place she had picked out. It was in a little hollow.

He looked this way and that way anxiously. Just as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to go hunt for her, she came hurrying back.|$|E

He {{was a member of}} the family with which I wasn't very well acquainted, but when I understood by the swinging of his tail that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to pounce on me I said, as if he were the best friend I ever had in the world: ...|$|E
60|$|I {{consequently}} urged Thomas in frequent dispatches {{sent from}} City Point(*41) {{to make the}} attack at once. The country was alarmed, the administration was alarmed, and I was alarmed lest the very thing would take place which I have just described that is, Hood would get north. It was all without avail further than to elicit dispatches from Thomas saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to move {{as soon as he}} could, that he was making preparations, etc. At last I had to say to General Thomas that I should be obliged to remove him unless he acted promptly.

60|$|When {{he was so}} {{very nearly}} breathless as {{to be able to}} run no more, but was forced to walk, Toby looked behind him, and there he could see the bright lights of the circus and hear the strains of the music as he had heard them on the night when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to run away from Uncle Daniel; and those very sounds, which {{reminded}} him forcibly of how ungrateful he had been to the old man who had cared for him when {{there was no one else}} in the world who would do so, made it more easy for him to leave those behind who had been so kind to him when he stood so much in need of kindness.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the hunter}} did {{nothing of the}} kind. You see, just as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to step out from his hiding-place, Sammy Jay arrived. He perched in a tree {{close to the end}} of Paddy's dam and at once he spied Reddy Fox. It didn't take him a second to {{discover}} what Reddy was hiding there for. [...] "Thief, thief, thief!" [...] screamed Sammy, and then looked down at Reddy with a mischievous look in his sharp eyes. There is nothing Sammy Jay delights in more than in upsetting the plans of Reddy Fox. At the sound of Sammy's voice, Mr. and Mrs. Quack swam hurriedly towards the middle of the pond. They knew exactly what that warning meant. Reddy Fox looked up at Sammy Jay and snarled angrily. Then, knowing it was useless to hide longer, he bounded away through the Green Forest to hunt elsewhere.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw himself}} into the {{attitude}} of a lunging fencer, to reach after his oilskin coat; and afterwards he staggered all over the confined space while he jerked himself into it. Very grave, straddling his legs far apart, and stretching his neck, he started to tie deliberately the strings of his sou'-wester under his chin, with thick fingers that trembled slightly. He went through all the movements of a woman putting on her bonnet before a glass, with a strained, listening attention, {{as though he had}} expected every moment to hear the shout of his name in the confused clamour that had suddenly beset his ship. Its increase filled his ears while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to go out and confront whatever it might mean. It was tumultuous and very loud--made up of the rush of the wind, the crashes of the sea, with that prolonged deep vibration of the air, like the roll of an immense and remote drum beating the charge of the gale.|$|E
5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic {{measures}} to protect his plans, programming the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew them up. In the bar, Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar is burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready,</b> Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain.|$|R

50|$|House arrives home. In {{pain from}} his leg, various wounds, Hanna's death and Cuddy's earlier comment, he rips his {{bathroom}} mirror {{out of the}} wall revealing a hidden cavity behind it, where he had a final stash of Vicodin. Collapsing, he opens a bottle and takes out two pills, thinking that vicodin is his only way of feeling better. As <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>getting</b> <b>ready</b> to take them, Cuddy arrives. She reveals that she ended the relationship with Lucas, because she realized that she truly loves House. Despite having a new fiancé, all she can think about is House, and couldn't live in peace without knowing if they could ever work as a couple. House stands up and walks over to Cuddy and then they share in a tender kiss. House stops and asks if <b>he</b> <b>is</b> hallucinating this and she asks if he took the Vicodin. Realizing it was still in his hand, House drops the pills on the floor. They both smile at each other, sharing another kiss and joining hands.|$|R
