500|$|Star Treks creator, Gene Roddenberry, who wielded {{significant}} influence despite his ill health, hated the script. Meyer's {{first meeting with}} Roddenberry resulted in Meyer storming {{out of the room}} within five minutes. As with Meyer's previous Star Trek film (The Wrath of Khan), the script had strong military overtones, with a naval theme present throughout. Far from being idealized, the characters were shown as bigoted and flawed. In contrast to Roddenberry's vision of the future, Meyer thought {{there was no evidence that}} bigotry would disappear by the 23rd century. When Roddenberry protested about the villainization of Saavik, Meyer replied that [...] "I created Saavik. She was not Gene's. If he doesn't like what <b>I</b> <b>plan</b> <b>on</b> doing with her, maybe he should give back the money he's made off my films. Maybe then I'll care what he has to say." [...] After the stormy first meeting, a group including Meyer, Roddenberry, and producer Ralph Winter discussed the revised draft. Roddenberry would voice his disapproval of elements of the script line by line, and he and Meyer would square off about them while Winter took notes. Overall, the tone of the meeting was conciliatory, but the producers ultimately ignored many of Roddenberry's concerns. By February 13, 1991, the film was officially put into production with the agreement it would be in theaters by the end of the year.|$|E
