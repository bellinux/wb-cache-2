5|$|End Georgie Ratterman {{was under}} {{treatment}} by a stomach specialist {{as the result}} of trouble supposedly caused by over-exertion during his confinement in a German prison during World War I. It was not known <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still play.|$|E
5|$|After the diagnosis, Ryan White was too ill {{to return}} to school, but by early 1985 {{he began to feel}} better. His mother asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> return to school, but was told by school {{officials}} that he could not. On June 30, 1985, a formal request to permit re-admittance to school was denied by Western School Corporation superintendent James O. Smith, sparking an administrative appeal process that lasted for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Although Fuchs {{had given}} Ruth his {{unconditional}} release, no major league team {{expressed an interest}} in hiring him in any capacity. Ruth still hoped to be hired as a manager <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not play anymore, but only one managerial position, Cleveland, became available between Ruth's retirement {{and the end of the}} 1937 season. Asked if he had considered Ruth for the job, Indians owner Alva Bradley replied negatively.|$|E

60|$|Then {{there was}} Winifred! <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be sure about her, <b>if</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be sure. Since {{the death of}} Diana, and the {{development}} of his illness, his craving for surety with regard to Winifred amounted almost to obsession. It was as <b>if,</b> even dying, <b>he</b> must have some anxiety, some responsibility of love, of Charity, upon his heart.|$|R
5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give {{up the idea of}} marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward was not prepared to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|Francis, {{convinced}} that he would regain his freedom <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> obtain a personal audience with Charles, pressed d'Avalos and Lannoy, who had intended to transport the king to the Castel Nuovo in Naples, {{to send him to}} Spain instead. Concerned by Bourbon's scheming, they agreed and Francis arrived in Barcelona on 12 June.|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Richard Garfield {{approached}} Wizards of the Coast {{with the}} idea for a new board game called RoboRally, but was turned down because the game would have been too expensive for Wizards of the Coast to produce. Instead, Adkison asked Garfield <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> invent a game that was both portable and quick-playing, to which Garfield agreed.|$|E

6000|$|He {{turned and}} glanced at his companion. Sophy was looking very sweet and very wistful. The warm touch of her fingers was grateful. Her sympathy was like some welcome flower in a wilderness. His heart ached with a new desire. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> make himself different! <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> stretch out his hand for the flowers which made the lives of other men so sweet! ...|$|R
5|$|Other {{possible}} medal contenders included Andriy Serdinov of Ukraine, {{who had won}} the Olympic {{bronze medal}} in 2004, and Venezuelan Albert Subriats, a bronze medalist at the 2007 World Championships and seen as a potential spoiler, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> match or improve on his 51.82 time, in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Since all {{meetings}} had to end by nightfall, {{a senator}} could talk {{a proposal to}} death (a filibuster) <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> keep the debate going until nightfall. Any proposed motion could be vetoed by a tribune, {{and if it was}} not vetoed, it was then turned into a final senatus consultum. Each senatus consultum was transcribed into a document by the presiding magistrate, and then deposited into the aerarium.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} typewritten {{copy of the}} speech, including King's {{handwritten notes}} on it, was discovered in 1984 {{to be in the}} hands of George Raveling, the first African-American basketball coach of the University of Iowa. In 1963, Raveling, then 26, was standing near the podium, and immediately after the oration, impulsively asked King <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have his copy of the speech. He got it.|$|E
60|$|Alfred {{glowered at}} us as <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never <b>could,</b> or would, forgive the injury of that night.|$|R
60|$|She {{was gone}} before Wrayson {{could ask for}} an explanation. The others! <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{discover}} who they were.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy's heart beat. Although {{he was not}} yet Laura's lover, her charm was strong. Still {{he ought}} to get to work, and <b>if</b> <b>he</b> went to Puget Sound with Laura, he might not {{afterwards}} bother about the ranch. Well, perhaps the ranch was not important; <b>if</b> <b>he</b> wanted, <b>he</b> <b>could,</b> no doubt, sell the land.|$|R
5|$|Also in 1956 he was {{selected}} at the Staff School run by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). His first trip outside Nigeria {{was an opportunity to}} advance his technical production skills, and to solicit feedback on his novel (which was later split into two books). In London, he met a novelist named Gilbert Phelps, to whom he offered the manuscript. Phelps responded with great enthusiasm, asking Achebe <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> show it to his editor and publishers. Achebe declined, insisting that it needed more work.|$|E
5|$|At age ten, {{his older}} brother Burnie {{recalled}} that he stopped coming home for supper, instead hurrying down to the riverfront and slipping aboard {{one or another of}} the excursion boats to play the Calliope. A friend remembered that the plots of the silent matinees Bix and his friends watched on Saturdays didn't interest him much, {{but as soon as the}} lights came on he would rush home to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played during the action.|$|E
5|$|From 11 to 14 February 1945, the Yalta Conference {{took place}} in the neighbouring, former {{imperial}} Livadia Palace; this was between representatives from the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. Winston Churchill and part}} of his British delegation were given temporary residence within the Vorontsov Palace. Within two weeks, construction workers had restored 22 rooms in the main palace, 23 rooms in the Shuvalov wing, and even replanted the palace gardens. The palace's English-inspired architectural style gained praise from Churchill himself: Churchill was so taken by the garden's Medici lions that he later asked Stalin <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take them home; Stalin declined the request.|$|E

5|$|George Holdcroft {{composed}} the score for The FP. He {{was invited to}} a screening of the film by producer Christian Agypt, and asked <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> compose the music for it. Holdcroft, who lived in Chicago at the time, spent 12 hours a day composing the score and e-mailed his compositions to the Trost brothers. To emulate {{the sound of a}} choir for one song, Holdcroft sang the same segment more than 200 times using different voices and melodies to achieve the desired result. For another song, he sang in falsetto and altered the pitch of his voice to make himself sound like a woman.|$|E
5|$|Gruban appealed {{against the}} {{internment}} order, and was called before a court consisting of Mr Justice Younger and Mr Justice Sankey. After reviewing {{the facts of}} the case and the stories of Gruban and Booth the judges ordered the immediate release of Gruban, and recommended that he seek legal advice to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> regain control of his company. After he was released Gruban found a solicitor, W.J. Synott, who gave the case to Patrick Hastings.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, Chain Reaction and Jam Band {{played at}} the same gig. Tyler {{immediately}} loved Jam Band's sound, and wanted to combine the two bands. In October 1970, the bands met up again and considered the proposition. Tyler, {{who had been a}} drummer and backup singer in Chain Reaction, adamantly refused to play drums in this new band, insisting he would only take part <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be frontman and lead vocalist. The others agreed, and a new band was born. The band moved into a home together at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue in Boston, where they wrote and rehearsed music together and relaxed in between shows.|$|E

5|$|It {{is unknown}} what mental element is {{expected}} in cases of trespass to goods; while trespass to the person requires intent, the requirements for trespass to goods have never been tested in court. The common remedy is damages, which may be awarded regardless of if any actual harm is suffered; where there is damage, the defendant will only be liable <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have reasonably foreseen it, as in Kuwait Airways Corporation v Iraqi Airways Co (No 5). Valid defences are those of statutory authority, consent, where {{it is necessary to}} interfere with the goods, or jus tertii.|$|E
5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt had endured bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have more creative control over it.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Hudson, Ohio, a small town in the northeastern part of the state. Both of his parents were Italian immigrants. His father Angelo Lavelli was a {{blacksmith}} who made shoes for horses on nearby farms. As a child, he practiced catching by throwing baseballs against walls and trying to catch them when they bounced back. He liked to have friends throw ping-pong balls at him to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> catch them.|$|E
6000|$|From far in {{the clear}} air the bells of the church where he and Irene had been married were pealing in 'practice' for the advent of Christ, the chimes ringing out above the sound of traffic. He felt a craving for strong drink, to lull him to indifference, or rouse him to fury. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> burst out of himself, out of this web {{that for the first}} time in his life he felt around him. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{surrender}} to the thought: 'Divorce her--turn her out! She has forgotten you. Forget her!' ...|$|R
6000|$|After that Lewisham went on his southward way alone. He {{did not go}} {{straight}} to his room in Chelsea, but spent some hours in a street in Battersea, pacing to and fro {{in front of a}} possible house. His passion changed from savageness to a tender longing. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see her to-night! He knew his own mind now. To-morrow he was resolved he would fling work to the dogs and meet her. The things Dunkerley had said had filled his mind with wonderful novel thoughts. <b>If</b> only <b>he</b> <b>could</b> see her now! ...|$|R
