5|$|Hearing {{the shark}} has been lured into the pipe, Michael and Kay {{go down to}} repair the {{underwater}} tunnel, so the technicians can restore air pressure and drain the water. Calvin orders the pump {{to be shut down}} to suffocate the shark, but this act instead allows her to break free from the pipe and attack Michael and Kay, but they are saved by the dolphins. They make their way back to the control room, but the shark appears <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> and smashes through the glass, flooding the room and killing a technician. Michael notices FitzRoyce's corpse still in the shark's throat with a grenade, and uses a bent pole to pull its pin, triggering the grenade's explosion and killing the shark. In the aftermath, Mike and Kay celebrate with the dolphins, who survived their brush with the shark.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2010, {{the anchor}} {{desk in the}} studio was {{relocated}} back <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> overlooking Times Square, {{where it had been}} when Good Morning America moved to the Times Square Studios facility in 1999; the news desk was also moved in front of a window. On May 3, 2010, the program debuted new [...] "light blue and sunny" [...] graphics, and new theme music by DreamArtists Studios. An entirely new set for the program was introduced on January 31, 2011; the monitor used for national weather segments (used mainly during the 7:00a.m. hour only) was moved closer to the anchor desk while the news desk remained in the same place. This was the first major set change since the show upgraded to high definition in November 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} begins with Scherzinger {{sitting in the}} back of a London hackney carriage. As the rain pours outside and raindrops cover the windows, she sings the first verse while {{changing}} her smart clothes for more casual ones. She stares longingly out of the carriage's window, watching the rain outside. During the chorus, there are two main scenes. In the first she is seen wrapped in blanket while in the second she walks across the room of an old house, in need of renovation. The lighting is cold and dim, and most of the furniture is covered in plastic wrap. Scherzinger stares resentfully at her surroundings while crossing the room. In the second verse, Scherzinger stands in front of a mirror in the bathroom of the house where she has a moment of realisation. After turning the taps on for a while, the sink overflows as she scornfully looks in the mirror, relating to the lyrics of the song. She is then scene walking towards the camera, through a hallway of the house. It is a confident independent walk towards the audience with lights flashing rhythmically behind her. The bridge sees Scherzinger sitting in one the house's empty rooms, in an old armchair and intersects some of the earlier carriage and bathroom scenes. As she sings the lyric [...] "The screen fades to black", the blanket seen earlier on falls in front of the camera, revealing a close up shot of Scherzinger's face. Her hair flows in the wind and she finally gets up from the armchair to stand in front of the room's open windows. In the final scene, she stands confidently <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>window</b> as wind and light flood the room. She sings the final verse of the song, looking directly at the camera and smiling for the first time in the video.|$|E

60|$|Torrance {{strode to}} an open window and blew a silver whistle. Its shrill note had {{scarcely}} died away when a mounted man came up at a gallop, and a band of others in haste on foot.

50|$|Until 1950 {{it was a}} {{practice}} to swear <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord after following a set of rituals.

60|$|I {{knew that}} he had not been to see Mrs. Haldin yet. Miss Haldin told me he was reluctant; moreover, the mental {{condition}} of Mrs. Haldin had changed.

60|$|It {{was very}} mysterious. My heart beat furiously. Fear {{for the safety}} of my {{precious}} papers held me in a death-like grip.

60|$|Northmour was on {{his feet}} in an instant, and he and I ran through the door of {{communication}} with the study. The room was illuminated by a red and angry light.
