The Pioneer missions obtained the first close-up images of Jupiter's atmosphere and several of its moons. They discovered that the radiation fields near the planet were much stronger than expected, but both spacecraft managed to survive <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> The trajectories of these spacecraft were used to refine the mass estimates of the Jovian system. Radio occultations by the planet resulted in better measurements of Jupiter's diameter {{and the amount of}} polar flattening.|$|E
5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment,</b> but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin have a similar colour for the same reason.|$|E

5|$|Isopods {{belong to}} the larger group Peracarida, which are united by the {{presence}} of a special chamber under the thorax for brooding eggs. They have a cosmopolitan distribution and over 10,000 species of isopod, classified into 11 suborders, have been described worldwide. Around 4,500 species are found in marine environments, mostly on the sea floor. About 500 species are found in fresh water and another 5,000 species are the terrestrial woodlice, which form the suborder Oniscidea. In the deep sea, members of the suborder Asellota predominate, to the near exclusion of all other isopods, having undergone a large adaptive radiation <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> The largest isopod is in the genus Bathynomus and some large species are fished commercially for human food in Mexico, Japan and Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, {{just as they}} do to a far more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing for the existence of complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

25|$|Two common {{environments that}} tend to favor neoteny are high-altitude and cool environments because neotenous {{individuals}} have a higher fitness than those that metamorphose into the adult form. This is because the energy required for metamorphosis is too costly for the individual’s fitness, also the conditions favor neoteny due {{to the ability of}} neotenous individuals to utilize the available resources more easily. This trend {{can be seen in the}} comparison of salamander species of lower and higher altitudes. The neotenous individuals have higher survivorship as well as higher fecundity than the salamanders that had gone to the adult form in the higher altitude and cooler environment. Insects in cooler environments tend to show neoteny in flight because wings have a high surface area and lose heat quickly, thus it is not advantageous for insects <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment</b> to metamorphose into adults.|$|E

25|$|The {{rationale}} behind these changes was {{to increase the}} effectiveness of infantry units by stripping them of elements which were not necessary in tropical terrain or those that were no longer required due to declining Japanese airpower and artillery. Equally it served {{to reduce the size}} of the Australian Army in order to free up manpower for civilian industry in the face of a growing manpower crisis as the wartime economy expanded. Indeed, a jungle division had an establishment of just 13,118 men, approximately 4,000 fewer than a standard division. The bulk of the reduction occurred among the administrative, transport and artillery units. In particular the nature of the fighting in the Middle East meant that the standard three field artillery regiments attached to each division had been essential; however, the difficulty of transporting guns and maintaining adequate ammunition supply in the Pacific led to a significant reduction in artillery, with only one field regiment per division considered viable. The greatest problem faced in New Guinea was logistical support as the island lacked roads and port facilities, while its terrain was amongst the most difficult in the world. Inland the main means of movement was on foot, and native porters were essential for the transport of supplies and the evacuation of the wounded. The jungle division optimised the Army for operations <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> Meanwhile, the armoured division and those infantry divisions defending Australia would maintain their existing order of battle.|$|E

500|$|The {{month after}} the plan took effect, the Canadian {{government}} announced that the country's sex industry {{would no longer be}} allowed to employ foreign workers because of the risks of exploitation, abuse, and trafficking <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>environment.</b> As part of this policy, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stopped issuing new temporary work permits for foreigners seeking work with escort agencies, massage parlours, and strip clubs. Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, said that he hoped that the NAP-CHT would be strengthened by this new policy, and said that its purpose was to protect foreigners [...] "from what they might not know will happen to them when they get to Canada." [...] That November, Status of Women Canada sought to support the NAP-CHT by soliciting the public for proposals of how to best support community organizations that serve female victims of sex traffickingthe most common victims of this form of trafficking. In late 2012, Smith launched the Joy Smith Foundation as a follow-up to the NAP-CHT; this nonpartisan, apolitical foundation is dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing support to human trafficking victims with counselling, housing, and clothing.|$|E
