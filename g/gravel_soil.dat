5|$|As the Brookwood {{site had}} been {{intentionally}} chosen for its distance from London, {{at the time}} of its opening the only practical way to reach the cemetery was by railway. William Cubitt decided that the terrain of the initial cemetery site was best suited to a railway branch from the LSWR at the west of the cemetery, and work began on the earthworks and rails for the new branch in early September 1854. The single-track branch was completed in time for the opening two months later. The junction with the LSWR, known as Necropolis Junction, was west-facing, meaning that trains to and from London were obliged to reverse in and out of the branch to the two stations in the cemetery.

5|$|In France, Sauvignon blanc {{is grown}} in the {{maritime}} climate of Bordeaux (especially in Entre-Deux-Mers, Graves and Pessac-Léognan as a dry wine, and in Sauternes as a sweet wine) {{as well as the}} continental climate of the Loire Valley (as Pouilly Fumé, Sancerre, and Sauvignon de Touraine). The climates of these areas are particularly favorable in slowing the ripening on the vine, allowing the grape more time to develop a balance between its acidity and sugar levels. This balance is important {{in the development of the}} intensity of the wine's aromas. Winemakers in France pay careful attention to the terroir characteristics of the soil and the different elements that it can impart to the wine. The chalk and Kimmeridgean marl of Sancerre and Pouilly produces wines of richness and complexity while areas with more compact chalk soils produces wines with more finesse and perfume. The <b>gravel</b> <b>soil</b> found near the Loire River and its tributaries impart spicy, floral and mineral flavors while in Bordeaux, the wines have a fruitier personality. Vines planted in flint tend to produce the most vigorous and longest lasting wines.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The design {{conception}} of composite liners {{consisting of a}} geomembrane(GM), geosynthetic clay liners(GCLs) and compacted <b>gravel</b> <b>soils</b> for landfill is presented based on the climate characteristic, <b>gravel</b> <b>soils</b> material storage in abundance, and GCLs having been exported {{all over the world}} for various applications. The analyses results suggested that the capacity to resist the collapse of wetting-drying and freezing-thawing, long-term barrier performance, and the general sliding stability of barrier system are enhanced obviously by using GCLs/GM as barrier and displacing clay by <b>gravel</b> <b>soils</b> as protector in this paper. It will be plausible as effective design for the barrier system of landfill under wet-dry and freeze-thaw alternating cycles in northwest China...|$|R

500|$|While the {{negotiations}} {{over the state}} taking control of burials were ongoing, an alternative proposal was being drawn up by Richard Broun and Richard Sprye. Broun and Sprye intended to use the emerging technology of mechanised land transport to provide a final {{solution to the problem}} of London's dead. They envisaged buying a single very large tract of land around [...] from London in Brookwood near Woking, Surrey, to be called Brookwood Cemetery or the London Necropolis. At this distance, the land would be far beyond the maximum projected size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards from miasma. In the 18thcentury this land had been nicknamed [...] "the Waste of Woking", and with poor quality <b>gravel</b> <b>soil</b> it was of little use in farming and thus available very cheaply. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)—which had connected London to Woking in 1838—would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Broun envisaged dedicated coffin trains, each carrying 50–60 bodies, travelling from London to the new Necropolis in the early morning or late at night, and the coffins being stored on the cemetery site until the time of the funeral. Mourners would then be carried to the appropriate part of the cemetery by a dedicated passenger train during the day.|$|E
500|$|Jack jumper ants live in open habitats, such as damp areas, forests, pastures, {{gardens and}} lawns, preferring fine gravel and sandy soil. Colonies {{can also be}} spotted around light bushland. Their {{preferred}} natural habitats include woodlands, dry open forests, grasslands and rural areas, and less common in urban areas. Their nests are mounds built from finely granular <b>gravel,</b> <b>soil</b> and pebbles, measuring [...] in diameter and can be as tall as half of a metre (20in) in height. Two types of nests for this species have been described: one being a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, the other being a complex structure surrounded by a mound. These ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials that heat in a quick duration, providing the nest with solar energy traps. They decorate their nests with seeds, soil, charcoal, stones, sticks, and even small invertebrate corpses. They also camouflage their nests by covering leaf litter, debris and long grass over the nest. Nests can be found hidden under rocks, where queens will most likely form their colony, or around small piles of gravel instead. Their range in southern Australia, like other regional ant species, appears {{like that of a}} relict ant. Jack jumpers have been found in dry sclerophyll forests, at elevations ranging from , averaging [...] Rove beetles in the genus Heterothops generally thrive in jack jumper nests and raise their brood within their chambers, and skinks have been found in some nests.|$|E

2500|$|Industrial {{brownfield}} sites can {{be valuable}} ecosystems, supporting rare species of plants, animals and invertebrates. [...] Increasingly {{in demand for}} redevelopment, these habitats are under threat. [...] "Brown roofs", also known as [...] "biodiverse roofs", can partly mitigate this loss of habitat by covering the flat roofs of new developments {{with a layer of}} locally sourced material. [...] Construction techniques for brown roofs are typically similar to those used to create flat green roofs, the main difference being the choice of growing medium (usually locally sourced rubble, <b>gravel,</b> <b>soil,</b> etc...) to meet a specific biodiversity objective. In Switzerland, it is common to use alluvial gravels from the foundations; in London, a mix of brick rubble and some concrete has been used. [...] The original idea was to allow the roofs to self-colonise with plants, but they are sometimes seeded to increase their biodiversity potential in the short term. Such practices are derided by purists. The roofs are colonised by spiders and insects (many of which are becoming extremely rare in the UK as such sites are developed) and provide a feeding site for insectivorous birds. [...] Laban, a centre for contemporary dance in London, has a brown roof specifically designed to encourage the nationally rare black redstart. [...] A green roof, 160m above ground level, and claimed to be the highest in the UK and Europe [...] "and probably in the world" [...] to act as nature reserve, is on the Barclays Bank HQ in Canary Wharf. [...] Designed combining the principles of green and brown roofs, it is already home to a range of rare invertebrates.|$|E

40|$|For <b>gravel</b> <b>soils,</b> {{water content}} changes {{at very low}} {{suctions}} (e. g., smaller than 1 kPa) are significant, and such changes affect the permeability and shear strength of the soils significantly. Difficulties in studying the soil-water characteristic curves (SWCCs) at very low suctions include {{the lack of a}} proper experimental device and the suction difference induced by the gravitational hydraulic gradient along the sample height. In this study, a large size modified axis translation device was developed. The device can control the soil suction accurately (i. e., a precision of 0. 005 kPa) using a water-head control method. A new interpretation procedure was also proposed to consider the suction difference along the sample height and to extend the minimum measurable suction from 0. 1 to 0. 01 kPa. The device was used to measure the SWCCs for two <b>gravel</b> <b>soils.</b> The experimental results demonstrate that the SWCCs for <b>gravel</b> <b>soils</b> in the low-suction range show bimodal features, where the water content decreases sharply at suctions smaller than I kPa. Such bimodal behavior may not be revealed using conventional SWCC devices. SWCCs at low suctions are sensitive to soil density.

Even if you {{have never been in}} Wood Hills, that suburban paradise is probably familiar to you by name.

Mrs. Willoughby Smethurst was under no such delusion. What Wood Hills needed to make it perfect, she realized, was Culture. Material comforts are all very well, but, if the summum bonum is to be achieved, the Soul also demands a look in, and it was Mrs. Smethurst's unfaltering resolve that never while she had her strength should the Soul be handed the loser's end. It was her intention to make Wood Hills a centre of all that was most cultivated and refined, and, golly! how she had succeeded. Under her presidency the Wood Hills Literary and Debating Society had tripled its membership.|$|E
