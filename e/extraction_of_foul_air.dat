It was only in the mid-19th century, with growing levels of urbanisation and industrial prosperity, that the flush toilet became a widely used and marketed invention.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a review on the fouling mechanism {{and its effect}} onto the performance of finned tube heat exchangers in HVAC systems.

40|$|A 2. 4 -m³ {{pilot plant}} MBR for {{wastewater}} treatment {{was designed and}} constructed for membrane biofouling studies. Three categories <b>of</b> membrane <b>fouling</b> study were carried out with this MBR pilot plant {{in order to obtain}} a better understanding of MBR performance and fouling. Firstly, critical flux assessment based on various defining concepts and influencing parameters was examined. The results showed small variations of critical flux values obtained from different defining concepts. Decline of critical flux as the step change <b>of</b> <b>fouling</b> <b>air</b> flow rate increased was observed, while step length had no obvious effects on the critical flux. A positive relationship between aeration rate and critical flux is observed, while higher sludge concentration caused lower critical flux. Secondly, fouling mechanisms under different sludge composition and different flux regimes were tested. Under supra-critical flux operation, cake resistance accounted for the main fouling contribution, while pore fouling was marginal in both supra-critical flux and sub-critical flux regimes. EPS carbohydrate in soluble and bound forms has greater impact on both pore fouling and cake fouling than protein. Finally, optimization of the MBR pilot plant was carried out. Based on equivalent permeate yield and equivalent energy consumption for each experimental run, three operational variables showed significant influence in membrane fouling rate increase. They were, in the order of importance, filtration mode > scouring frequency > regular aeration intensity. The optimum operating conditions determined by the proposed methodology were 11 L/m². min air intensity with continuous filtration and scouring 24 times per day for the pilot plant MBR...|$|R

Development of the CFD model for evaluating {{the efficiency of the}} building local protection from hazardous substantives ingress by using air curtain and sorption/desorption of hazardous substance on indoor surfaces. Methodology. To solve the problem of hydrodynamic interaction of the air curtain with wind flow and considering the building influence on this process the model of ideal fluid is used. In order to calculate the transfer process of the hazardous substance in the atmosphere an equation of convection-diffusion transport of impurities is applied. To calculate the process of indoors air pollution under leaking <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>air</b> Karisson & Huber model is used. This model takes into account the sorption of the hazardous substance at various indoors surfaces. For the numerical integration of the model equations differential methods are used. Findings. In this paper we construct an efficient CFD model of evaluating the effectiveness of the buildings protection against ingress of hazardous substances through the use of an air curtain. On the basis of the built model a computational experiment to assess the effectiveness of this protection method under varying the location of the air curtain relative to the building was carried out. Originality. A new model was developed to compute the effectiveness of the air curtain supply to reduce the toxic chemical concentration inside the building. Practical value.

40|$|The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) {{outbreak}} in 2003 triggered concerns regarding {{the ability of}} buildings to resist disease transmission. In particular, the outbreak {{that occurred in the}} high-rise residential blocks in the Amoy Gardens housing estate, sounded an alarm to the local practice of design, installation, commissioning, operation and maintenance of building services systems. Virus transmission through the vertical drainage stack {{is believed to have been}} one of the causes of disease transmission in Amoy Gardens. In this paper, the authors share their experiences and research findings on the building drainage system. The paper includes a review of the {{outbreak in}}cident in Amoy Gardens; and of the observations and site measurements <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>air</b> and water back flow in the drainage system of another vacant high-rise residential housing estate. In addition, tracer gas measurements were studied in order to verify the upwards flow of air in the vertical stack. These field studies allow comparisons between the gas flow from the drainage system to the living accommodation, and confirm the hypothesized infection route. Finally, the authors make recommendations on the proper design and operation of high-rise building drainage systems. Practical application: Sanitary drainage systems form a critic al engineering component in maintaining hygienic conditions in buildings. In fact the issue has been addressed over several hundreds of years, for example during the Black Death outbreak worldwide. Despite this, the SARS outbreak demonstrates that there is still room for improvement on the safety of soil waste disposal in buildings.

40|$|Improvements {{in public}} health through better {{sanitary}} plumbing systems has been mainly due to the prevention afforded by barrier technologies to the ingress <b>of</b> <b>foul</b> <b>air,</b> which can contain toxic gases and pathogens, notwithstanding the nuisance of malodour. The main defence against this ingress is the ‘trap seal’ which comes in two forms; the ‘water trap seal’ and the ‘waterless trap seal’. Whilst these devices form effective barriers, they are vulnerable to, or can produce, transient air pressure fluctuations in the system {{which can lead to}} seal loss. Greater understanding of the characteristics of these devices is essential for the development of better protection strategies. The development of novel analytical techniques is central to this research as it increases computer model resolution at these important system extremities. Current methods employ a laboratory only approach, whereby a single loss co-efficient is developed. These laboratory derived boundary conditions are inherently static {{and in the case of}} the waterless trap seal, ignore structure flexibility. This research has produced new methodologies to evaluate performance and generate dynamic boundary conditions suitable for inclusion in an existing 1 -D Method of Characteristics based model, AIRNET, which solves for pressure and velocity via the St. Venant equations of continuity and momentum in a finite difference scheme. The first novel technique developed uses photographic image and pressure data, transformed via photogrammetric and Fourier analysis to produce mathematical representations of the opening and closing of a waterless trap under transient pressures. The second novel technique developed focusses on the dynamic response of a water trap seal. Current boundary conditions use a steady state friction factor, ignoring separation losses. Analysis via ANSYS CFX allowed a frequency dependent dynamic representation of velocity change in the water trap seal to be developed, integrating unsteady friction and separation losses for the first time. Incorporation of these new boundary conditions in AIRNET confirms that frequency dependent whole system responses are possible and more realistic, reflecting both laboratory and on-site observations...|$|R
30|$|In the {{intensive}} system where the production is specialized {{and the limited}} land is available (and this is often occupied by humans), environmental impacts are caused by problems related to the (mis)management of livestock waste. The high nutritional concentrations in the excreta and urine of animals are either directly discharged into water systems or their storage time is limited. Throughout the world, livestock produces 13 billion tonnes of waste per year (Plachter and Hampick 2010). The high N and P loads result in environmental pressures that are very costly to mitigate to environmentally acceptable levels (Volume 2). Yet even in such systems, one cannot simply transfer standards {{from one part of}} the globe to another; this is a consequence of local systems which are often unique, coupled with land scarcity. A pressing issue related to animal waste management and presence of large populations of livestock in close proximity to high density human habitats is the problem of zoonotics: there are frequent outbreaks of these diseases in crowded human urban environments. The effect <b>of</b> the <b>foul</b> <b>air</b> with its heavy loads of pathogens is emphasized in most of the chapters.
