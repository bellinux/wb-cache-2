5|$|Cecil B. DeMille {{released}} This <b>Day</b> <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> in 1933, and {{it stands}} {{in stark contrast}} to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the Soviet Union, This <b>Day</b> <b>and</b> <b>Age</b> takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper. The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.|$|E

25|$|In the Daitōkan dojo in Hokkaidō, where Tokimune taught, the art {{had been}} {{organized}} differently due {{to differences in}} the way that Sōkaku had taught and changes which Tokimune had introduced into the system. Tokumine had systematized the art and given names to the techniques, resulting in a more rigidly organized curriculum. He had also pared down the wider sword system he had been taught by his father to concentrate on the Ono-ha Ittō-ryū system, albeit modified by techniques that Sōkaku had developed. Tokimune called this system Daitō-ryū 'Aiki Budō' as it emphasized a more than just jujutsu and other weapons and that in this <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> it was not merely not an art of fighting but a means of self-improvement or 'martial path'.|$|E

Data was analyzed by Bayesian procedures using Gibbs sampling. The heritability estimates for egg weight, egg production in 189 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> at first egg, were, respectively, for yellow line, 0. 31, 0. 84 and 0. 53; for blue line, 0. 14, 0. 82 and 0. 60; for red line, 0. 70, 0. 96 and 0. 75; and for meat line, 0. 73, 0. 96 and 0. 72. Genetic correlation between egg weight and egg production in 189 <b>days,</b> egg weight <b>and</b> <b>day</b> at first egg and egg production in 189 <b>days</b> <b>and</b> <b>day</b> at first egg were for yellow line, 0. 58, - 0. 77 and - 0. 90; for blue line, 0. 09, - 0. 01 and - 0. 95; for red line, 0. 09, 0. 03 and - 0. 76 and for meat line, - 0. 18, 0. 19 and - 0. 91, respectively. Based on the probabilities of posterior parameter distribution overlap, the lines are divided in two different groups: one group with the yellow and blue lines and another with the red and meat lines...|$|R

500|$|Drawing on André Maurois' Les Silences du colonel Bramble, Hergé {{presents}} Tintin as a big-game hunter, accidentally killing fifteen antelope {{as opposed}} to the one needed for the evening meal. However, concerns over the number of dead animals led Tintins Scandinavian publishers to request changes. A page of Tintin killing a rhinoceros by drilling a hole in its back and inserting a stick of dynamite was deemed excessive; Hergé replaced the page with one in which the rhino accidentally discharges Tintin's rifle while he sleeps under a tree. In 2007, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality called for the book to be pulled from shelves after a complaint, stating, [...] "It beggars belief that in this <b>day</b> <b>and</b> <b>age</b> that any shop would think it acceptable to sell and display Tintin in the Congo." [...] In August 2007, a Congolese student filed a complaint in Brussels that the book was an insult to the Congolese people.

500|$|Some legal {{scholars}} {{have criticized the}} Court's ruling in Schmerber for infringing too far upon civil liberty and privacy. E.

[...] Writing for the Notre Dame Law Review, Blake A. Bailey, Elaine M. Martin, and Jeffrey M. Thompson observed that although the Court limited the holding in Schmerber to {{the facts of the}} case, prior to Winston v. Lee, many lower courts relied upon the ruling to order criminal defendants to undergo surgery to remove bullets that may have been evidence of a crime. Other scholars have expressed concern that the Court's decision to exclude physical evidence from protections against self-incrimination may one day lead to the use of mind reading devices when prosecuting criminal suspects. For example, the Harvard Law Review suggested that the Court's decision may be used to justify monitoring brain waves. Additionally, {{in an article in the}} journal Developments in Mental Health Law, Benjamin Holley suggested that [...] "neurotechnological lie detection" [...] could be used in criminal prosecutions, as long as a suspect's words are not [...] "linked with the physical manifestations sought to be introduced at trial." [...] Likewise, in an article in the Journal of Legal Medicine, John G. New suggested that non-testimonial evidence gathered from electroencephalography or magnetic resonance imaging may be admissible to demonstrate a suspect's thoughts.|$|E
