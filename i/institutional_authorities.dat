50|$|Academic {{plagiarism}} {{is rising}} in India. A lack of oversight {{and a lack}} of proper training for scientists have led to the rise of plagiarism and research misconduct in India. India does not have a statutory body to deal with scientific misconduct in academia, like the Office of Research Integrity in the US, and hence cases of plagiarism are often dealt in ad-hoc fashion with different routes being followed in different cases. In most cases, a public and media outcry leads to an investigation either by <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> or by independent enquiry committees. The authors responsible for plagiarism have been at the receiving end of some severe punishments including suspension, removal and demotion. However, no fixed route has been prescribed to monitor such activities. This has led to calls for establishment of an independent ethics body.|$|E

40|$|Attitudes to <b>institutional</b> <b>authority,</b> {{strength}} {{of support for}} moral values and maturity of socio-moral reasoning have all been identified as potential predictors of adolescent delinquency. In a sample of 12 - 15 -year-old boys (N = 789), after checking for effects of age, IQ, social background and ethnicity, self-reported delinquency was significantly and independently predicted by attitudes to authority (r = -. 47) and moral values (r = -. 27), but not by a structural measure of moral reasoning level (r = -. 04). The findings argue for closer attention to the developmental determinants of attitudes to <b>institutional</b> <b>authority</b> and {{strength of}} moral value commitments than these have received hitherto.

40|$|Background. The current {{paper is}} based on two {{different}} approaches. One is the relational model of authority (Tyler & Lind, 1992), which addresses the effects of justice perceptions on the legitimacy of authorities and behavioural compliance. The other is Emler and Reicher’s theory (1995, 2005), which explains the involvement of adolescents in delinquency through {{their relationship with the}} <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> of society. Aims. To provide empirical evidence for the linkage of these perspectives, analysing the relationship between justice perceptions about teachers and the involvement of adolescents in deviant behaviour. Our hypotheses are that teachers’ justice is negatively related with deviant behaviour and that this relationship is mediated through the evaluation of <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities,</b> after controlling for school failure. Sample. Three hundred and ninety adolescents aged between 14 and 17 years. Methods. Participants completed the following scales: perceptions of justice about teachers, evaluation of <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities,</b> and deviant behaviour. Data were examined through correlation and bootstrap analyses. Results. Justice judgments about teachers were negatively related with deviant behaviour, and this relationship was partially mediated by the evaluation of <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities,</b> even after controlling for school failure. However, procedural justice revealed a much stronger relationship with deviance, compared to distributive justice. Conclusions. As predicted, these results suggest that when adolescents perceive school authorities as fair, other <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> are likely to be perceived in a similar way and the more those authorities are positively evaluated, the less often adolescents engage in deviant conduct. Results are discussed according to the theories underlying our hypothesis. Directions for future research are suggested...|$|E

40|$|Society {{is based}} on a set of norms and rules, {{compliance}} with which ensures the survival of that society. Within psychology, the two main issues of compliance with social norms are exhibition of violent behaviour and cooperation with authorities in order to promote further compliance. Extensive research suggests that among other social and psychological factors, relationships with <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> {{are one of the most}} prominent factors of compliance in childhood and adolescence. In this chapter we discuss the research available on the role of authorities and warning signs associated with violence and cooperation with <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities.</b> Finally, we explore theories proposed to explain the relationship between compliance and authorities, as well as their relevance to prevention of non-compliance with social norms. In short, this chapter outlines research and theory suggesting that negative experiences with authorities lead to negative attitudes to authorities and norms regarding compliance. In turn, these attitudes and norms lead to exhibition of violent behaviours and lower cooperation with authorities. As such, we suggest that focusing resources on improving the relationships between authorities and youth will prevent non-compliance with social norms, namely, violence and non-cooperation with authorities.

40|$|Many of the {{benefits}} that the housing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) transmit to homebuyers stem from an implied federal guarantee arising from the GSEs’ charter benefits and past supervisory forbearance. But this implicit guarantee also represents a risk to taxpayers if one of these GSEs—Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) System—becomes insolvent and the government provides financial assistance.; In {{the wake of a}} $ 5 billion accounting restatement by Freddie Mac in 2003, concerns about taxpayer liability associated with the housing GSEs have led to various legislative proposals to reorganize their regulatory oversight. This article discusses these proposals, drawing on lessons from U. S. banking regulation to identify and evaluate the points of contention.; The legislative proposals generally pertain to institutional design (where the safety-and-soundness regulator is located, how it is funded, and whom it should supervise) and <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> (for example, discretion to alter capital requirements and the ability to appoint conservators and receivers).; With respect to institutional design, the authors conclude that there may not be a clearly dominant approach.

Statistical analysis were conducted using MANOVAs and t tests. The classifi cation of overt aggression in three dimensions: pure, reactive and instrumental, proposed by Little, Henrich, Jones and Hawley (2003), was used to establish the analysis groups. Data suggested that those adolescents showing higher levels of aggression, informed of more feelings of loneliness, lower satisfaction with their lives, less respect for school rules and a more negative attitude towards <b>institutional</b> <b>authority,</b> in comparison to less aggressive adolescents. These results are consistent in all dimensions except for the feeling of loneliness, which is not present in the reactive dimension...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{heritage}} {{has been}} responsible for the visibility {{that a large number of}} cities around the world have been getting as regards affirmation and differentiation of places. This also increased the number of cultural tourists that visit those cities worldwide. In this struggle for affirmation and differentiation, Heidelberg has quite an advantage, since the city's cultural heritage, as well as its unique atmosphere, have been spread by the Romantic Movement in the 19 th century and it still happens nowadays, after more than two hundred years. But is Heidelberg indeed a city that receives cultural tourists? In this article, through an exploratory study, we intend to characterize the tourists that visit the city, to understand if the defined politics, actions and events taken by the different <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> (like the Heidelberger Marketing and City Town hall, among others) are getting the expected results. Through literature review and question­naires completed by the city's tourists, based on a probabilistic random sample and semi-structured interviews, we expect to trace the evolution of the policies defined, and compare those to the type of tourists that actually visit the city. As a preliminary result, we concluded that there is a difference between the tourist profile defined by the <b>institutional</b> <b>authorities</b> with responsibilities in the promotion and communication of the city's cultural heritage assets, comparing with the tourists that actually visit the city. This is the result not only of the motivations and effective length of the visits, but also in the lack of alternative or multiple visit narratives and routes for the cultural heritage city's assets...|$|E
