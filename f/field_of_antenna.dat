30|$|Full-duplex communications: Although the {{next-generation}} cellular {{networks are}} expected to migrate to the mmwave and terahertz bands, the microwave band will continue {{to play an important}} role in 5 G and beyond due to its favorable propagation characteristics. Hence, to achieve better bandwidth efficiency at microwave frequencies, full-duplex communication systems are considered for broad adoption in next-generation cellular systems [374]. Although significant research has been carried out [375, 376], the issue of synchronization in full-duplex communication systems continues to be an open area of research. This can be attributed to the challenges associated with estimating synchronization parameters in the presence of severe self-interference encountered in full-duplex communication systems. One solution could be to leverage the advancements in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>antenna</b> design and use reconfigurable and directional antennas at the transceiver to reduce self-interference.
