40|$|Channel belt {{deposits}} from meandering river systems commonly display {{an internal}} architecture of stacked depositional features with scoured basal contacts due to channel and bedform migration across {{a range of}} scales. Recognition and correct interpretation of these bounding surfaces is essential to reconstruction of palaeochannel dimensions and to flow modelling for hydrocarbon exploration. It is therefore crucial to understand the suite of processes that form and transfer these surfaces into the fluvial sedimentary record. Here the numerical model ‘NAYS 2 D’ is used to simulate a highly sinuous meandering river with synthetic stratigraphic architectures that can be compared directly to the sedimentary record. Model results highlight the importance of spatial and temporal variations in channel depth and migration rate to the generation of channel and bar deposits. Addition of net uniform bed aggradation (due to excess sediment input) allows quantification of the preservation of meander morphology {{for a wide range of}} depositional conditions. The present authors found that the effect of vertical variation in scouring due to channel migration is generally orders of magnitude larger than the effect of bed aggradation. This explains the limited <b>impact</b> <b>bed</b> aggradation has on preservation of meander morphology. Moreover, lateral differences in stratigraphy within the meander belt are much larger than the stratigraphic imprint of bed aggradation. Repeatedly produced alternations of point bar growth followed by cut-off result in a vertical trend in channel and scour feature stacking. Importantly, this vertical stacking trend differs laterally within the meander belt. In the centre of the meander belt, the high reworking intensity results in many bounding surfaces and disturbed deposits. Closer to the margins, reworking is infrequent and thick deposits with a limited number of bounding surfaces are preserved. These marginal areas therefore have the highest preservation potential for complete channel deposits and are thus best suited for palaeochannel reconstruction...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanistic}} model is derived for {{the rate of}} fluvial erosion into bedrock by abrasion from uniform size particles that <b>impact</b> the <b>bed</b> during transport in both bed and suspended load. The erosion rate is equated to {{the product of the}} impact rate, the mass loss per particle <b>impact,</b> and a <b>bed</b> coverage term. Unlike previous models that consider only <b>bed</b> load, the <b>impact</b> rate is not assumed to tend to zero as the shear velocity approaches the threshold for suspension. Instead, a given sediment supply is distributed between the bed and suspended load by using formulas for the bed load layer height, bed load velocity, logarithmic fluid velocity profile, and Rouse sediment concentration profile. It is proposed that the impact rate scales linearly with the product of the near-bed sediment concentration and the impact velocity and that particles <b>impact</b> the <b>bed</b> because of gravitational settling and advection by turbulent eddies. Results suggest, unlike models that consider only bed load, that the erosion rate increases with increasing transport stage (for a given relative sediment supply), even for transport stages that exceed the onset of suspension. In addition, erosion can occur if the supply of sediment exceeds the bed load transport capacity because a portion of the sediment load is transported in suspension. These results have implications for predicting erosion rates and channel morphology, especially in rivers with fine sediment, steep channel-bed slopes, and large flood events...|$|R

40|$|As {{products}} of {{both natural and}} social systems, rivers are highly complex historical objects. We show in this paper that historical analysis works on two different levels: one level, which we call "structural", shows the materiality of the riverine environment as the spatial-temporal product of natural factors and human <b>impacts</b> (<b>bed</b> and course alterations, pollution, etc.). On a second level – "semiotic" – we show that river systems are also social constructs and the subjects of ancient and diverse management practices. The quality of a river will {{be a function of}} the dialectical interaction between both levels. Historical analysis can uncover the inherited constraints that bear upon current management practices. To help substantiate this analytical framework, we analyse the case of the Moselle river in eastern France by using archival sources and statistical data. Severely impaired by industrial discharges from iron, coal and salt industries between the 1875 s and the early 1980 s, the waters of the Moselle became the subject of a social consensus between stakeholders that prevented the implementation of efficient pollution management policies until the 1990 s.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} the <b>impact</b> of <b>bedding</b> material on the faecal microflora of horses. Another objective was to investigate the hygienic and physical qualities of the bedding materials used and how these may change in the course of the trial period. The bedding materials used were sphagnum peat and wood shavings. Six horses had each material as bedding for a three week period in a change–over experiment. The horses’ ration of roughage was distributed directly on top of the bedding. Faecal samples were collected weekly for measuring of pH and for Terminal restriction length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis. T-RFLP analysis is a PCR based method were the size of 16 S rRNA fragments are determined in order to study microbial communities. Samples of bedding material were collected at the start up an end of each period and sent for hygienic analysing. Samples of the haylage fed to the horses were collected weekly and sent for analysis as one sample per period. Samples were also taken from both materials in the beginning and end of each period for determination of pH, dry matter and water holding capacity. Registrations of indoor and outdoor temperature and humidity were done on a daily basis. Bedding material did not influence the faecal pH. The T-FRLP analysis did not show any <b>impact</b> from <b>bedding</b> material on the microflora. Peat had significantly higher water holding capacity compared to wood shavings. Penicillium spp. was the most common mould found in peat and wood shavings. There was no difference in number of aerobic bacteria, yeasts, moulds and thermophilic fungi between peat and wood shavings. The number of aerobic bacteria had increased significantly in both bedding materials in the end of the periods. In conclusion, bedding material does not influence the faecal microflora with the conditions given in this study...|$|R

During summer, this SAV bed strongly attenuated wave energy, which contributed to growth-promoting feedback effects that improved light and nutrient availability for plants.

40|$|Background: Evidence of {{changing}} in biting and resting behaviour {{of the main}} malaria vectors has been mounting up {{in recent years as}} a result of selective pressure by the widespread and long-term use of insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs), and indoor residual spraying. The impact of resistance behaviour on malaria intervention efficacy has important implications for the epidemiology and malaria control programmes. In this context, a theoretical framework is presented to understand the mechanisms determining the evolution of feeding behaviour under the pressure of use of ITNs. Methods: An agent-based stochastic model simulates the <b>impact</b> of insecticide-treated <b>bed</b> nets on mosquito fitness by reducing the biting rates, as well as increasing mortality rates. The model also incorporates a heritability function that provides the necessary genetic plasticity upon which natural selection would act to maximize the fitness under the pressure of the control strategy. Results: The asymptotic equilibrium distribution of mosquito population versus biting time is shown for several daily uses of ITNs, and the expected disruptive selection on this mosquito trait is observed in the simulations. The relative fitness of strains that bite at much earlier time with respect to the wild strains, when a threshold of about 50 % of ITNs coverage highlights the hypothesis of a behaviour selection. A sensitivity analysis has shown that the top three parameters that play a dominant role on the mosquito fitness are the proportion of individuals using bed nets and its effectiveness, the <b>impact</b> of <b>bed</b> nets on mosquito oviposition, and the mosquito genetic plasticity related to changing in biting time. Conclusion: By taking the evolutionary aspect into account, the model was able to show that the long-term use of ITNs, although representing an undisputed success in reducing malaria incidence and mortality in many affected areas, is not free of undesirable side effects. From the evolutionary {{point of view of the}} parasite virulence, it should be expected that plasmodium parasites would be under pressure to reduce their virulence.
