5|$|The Jain writer Adikavi Pampa, widely {{regarded}} as one of the most influential Kannada writers, became famous for Adipurana (941). Written in champu (mixed prose-verse style) style, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> history of the first Jain tirthankara Rishabhadeva. Pampa's other notable work was Vikramarjuna Vijaya (941), the author's version of the Hindu epic, Mahabharata, with Arjuna as the hero. Also called Pampa Bharata, it is a eulogy of the writer's patron, King Chalukya Arikeseri of Vemulawada (a Rashtrakuta feudatory), comparing the king's virtues favorably to those of Arjuna. Pampa demonstrates such a command of classical Kannada that scholars over the centuries have written many interpretations of his work.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{previous}} instalments, {{the game}} is a tower defence game, similar to Clash of Clans. As with previous instalments, the game centres around dungeon construction and management, with players hiring and controlling minions. The dungeon heart <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> force, and its destruction ends the game. Imps are the dungeon's workforce, performing tasks such as digging tiles. Rooms have set sizes instead of being constructed by tiles, and minions are summoned manually instead of appearing at regular intervals. Which minions can be summoned depends on the dungeon's composition. Rooms include the workshop (which produces traps used to defend the dungeon) and the Dark Library. Rooms can be moved without reconstruction, and some have built-in defences against intruders. Minions include trolls and warlocks. In campaign mode, major events are triggered manually. At the start, players are given a tutorial by Horny, the Horned Reaper from the previous games. Raiding other dungeons (with {{the goal of the}} opponent's destruction) using the acquired minions is a regular occurrence, and players also frequently need to defend their dungeon from invasion. During raids, rooms can be claimed and used to deploy units.|$|E

Her cousin, who was the mayor of Weaverville, North Carolina, helped to get her the job. While she was {{employed}} by the embassy, Godwin completed a novel entitled Gull Key. Like many of her early works, the book focuses on a female character figuring out if marriage and being a parent <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> she wants for herself. Several publishers rejected the novel and the manuscript was lost when Godwin sent the only copy to a publisher that went out of business without returning it.|$|E

This segue between the two tracks remained a staple of the band's setlist for the rest of their career, and examples can be found on other live releases. The band had rearranged [...] "Still in Love with You" [...] to be slower and more emotional than the original studio version, and the version recorded on Live and Dangerous was considered by Putterford to be the highlight of Lynott's musical career.|$|E

500|$|The year 2006 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Genelia's career. She completed two Telugu movies in early 2006, one was the romantic comedy Happy, {{and the other was}} Raam.

The movie, a blockbuster at the box-office, grossed [...] in India, and also won the 2006 Golden Nandi award. Her character was well received, and garnered her the Telugu Filmfare Award for Best Actress, besides Nandi Special Jury Award and Santosham Award for Best Actress. Sify concluded about her acting in their review that, [...] "The scene stealer is Genelia with her innocent looks and cute mannerisms.

Songwriter Rivers Cuomo wrote that success had [...] "stirred up a lot of mixed feelings in me – 'Yay, I'm happy' as well as 'I'm not sure this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> I want to lead.'" [...] He had also developed a [...] "huge inferiority complex" [...] about rock music, saying: [...] "I thought my songs were really simplistic and silly, and I wanted to write complex, intense, beautiful music." [...] Touring with Weezer, he listened to the operas Aida (1871) and Madama Butterfly (1904), the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar (1970), and the musical Les Misérables (1980). Inspired by how these works married music and narrative, he decided to write a rock opera to explore his feelings about relationships, fame, and his life as a touring musician.|$|E

Tiffany Owens of World, a Christian magazine, {{praised the}} film, {{describing}} its storytelling as compelling and vivid. Jamie Rake of The Phantom Tollbooth called the [...] film [...] "an engrossing, sometimes appropriately gross, exposé [...] sounds a clarion cry against… modern slavery". Rake praises the re-enactments for being appropriately ominous, and for demonstrating the dehumanization and abuse that characterize sexual trafficking. He {{suggests that the}} film is a modern version of This <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Life,</b> a Christian television series that dealt with social issues, and that, if Nolot applied for a Motion Picture Association of America film rating, it would be given a PG-13 rating. Dan Preston of Godculture Magazine called the film [...] "a hands-on, grimy, honest, explorative piece of journalism". Preston praised Nolot's writing and directing.

500|$|Erlewine {{commented that}} on its release, Power {{received}} [...] "strong reviews".

Power has the oppressive detail of a novel. Though Ice-T indulges in gallows humor... he allows no release. If this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>life</b> of a gangster, it is also hell." [...] The review commented that along with Eazy-E's album Eazy-Duz-It, the rappers come off as [...] "unenlightened {{when it comes to}} women. Whatever their rough spots, Power and Eazy-Duz-It represent the makings of a brutal new music scene." [...] Robert Christgau, writing for the Village Voice, gave the album a B+ rating, noting that Ice-T had [...] "his own sound—flat, clipped, quick-lipped. And when he sticks to his subject, his narrative style is as gripping and understated as Islam's samples." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald opined that Ice-T's [...] "odd attempts at making a moral point become lost amidst the nauseating imagery, though the music's malevolent power is impossible to deny".|$|E
