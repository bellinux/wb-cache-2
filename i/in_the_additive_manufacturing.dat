40|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} {{processes such as}} Selective Laser Melting (SLM) appear very promising {{in view of the}} economic production of near-net-shape, complex and (almost) fully dense parts from metallic materials such as Ti alloys and stainless steels. Practically, in SLM, a metallic powder is deposited layer-by-layer in a powder bed and then molten locally according to the desired shape. An important feature of this process is that the structure undergoes an ultra-fast cooling once the beam leaves the working zone, thus giving rise to strongly out-of-equilibrium microstructures. In the case of Ti alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, in particular, the microstructural anisotropy resulting from the epitaxial growth of the newly deposited layer on the material previously solidified has been shown to exert a very strong influence on the mechanical properties [1] In the present work, the thermophysical behaviour of Ti-alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and of stainless steel 316 L has been characterised in details, in order to reach {{a better understanding of the}} phenomena controlling the microstructures and mechanical properties of parts.

40|$|Introduction At {{the current}} state of the art, endoprostheses are {{predominantly}} manufactured by cutting, forming or casting technologies. An innovative approach for manufacturing of endoprostheses can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Additive</b> <b>Manufacturing</b> (AM) technology of Beam Melting. With that, the implant gets manufactured by layer-wise, local melting of metal powder with a laser or electron beam, based on 3 D CAD data. Methods Two different approaches of a new implant design and implant functionality were realised. The first approach is the integration of internal functional channels and cavities. The second approach is the combination of Beam Melting technology with new materials. The target is to achieve a homogeneous force distribution at the implant-bone interface by using shape-memory-alloys. Results The inner channels and cavities (inner design features) can fulfil various functions within the implant, e. g. local supply of bio-resorbable filler, prevention and treatment of implant loosening even years after implantation, post-operative medical treatment through a medication depot and supply channels, post-operative drainage of blood and wound oozing through the implant, endoscopic examination of implant-bone interface and surrounding tissue and easier and quicker explantation with less damage to the bone structure through local application of soluble. In non-cemented hip implants, stem loosening is mainly caused by a change in force application and insufficient load transmission between implant and osseous anchor bedding. The active components were integrated in hip stems with a new designed surface and inner structures. The results proved that the frictional connection between a stem prosthesis anchored without cement and the femur can be achieved using shape memory alloy elements. So there is a potential to stabilize the prosthesis and increase its useful life. Conclusion Additive Manufacturing of implants by means of Beam Melting technologies allows undreamt-of possibilities in the geometric design of implants. In addition to patient specific design and surface or volume structuring of implants, the integration of value-added features in implants e. g. inner and outer structuring and the integration of active elements is a new field of application for Additive Manufacturing technologies in arthroplasty...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{influence}} of processing parameters on the resulting properties of {{laser metal deposition}} process cannot be overemphasized. <b>In</b> this research, <b>the</b> {{influence of}} laser power and powder flow rate on the dilution and surface roughness value produced are critically studied [...] The laser power was set between 1. 8 kW and 3. 0 kW, while the powder flow rate was set between 2. 88 and 5. 76 g/min. The scanning speed and the gas flow rate were maintained at constant values of 0. 05 m/s and 4 l/min respectively. The study revealed that, as the laser power was increased, the degree of dilution increases but the average surface roughness value decreases. Also, as the powder flow rate was increased, the dilution decreases and the average surface roughness increases. The study shows {{that it is important}} to keep the powder flow rare low so as to achieve a better surface finished and also not to use too high laser power as this will result in higher dilution, which is not desirable <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laser <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process because it will affect the dimensional accuracy of the part under processing...|$|R

40|$|GE Healthcare {{wants to}} {{investigate}} whether <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> would be an alternative method in their workshops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Umeå plant. <b>Additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> is called 3 D printing in everyday language and manufactures details by building them up layer by layer in an automated machine. The purpose of this work is therefore to investigate how mature <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> methods are and how they could be used at GE. The work has been divided into three parts. The first section investigates how <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> would work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> production workshop at GE. The production workshop mainly consists of CNC manufacturing. The other part that is being investigated is how <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> would work <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Tool Workshop at GE. The Tool Workshop produces toolsets and fixtures for the the production at GE. The Tools Workshop today uses both manual manufacturing as lathes, milling machines and drills, and CNC manufacturing. The {{last part of the}} work investigates how <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> as a production method would work at GE. What are the environmental and health risks that may be applicable, the post-processing methods that are relevant, and how quality assurance should be made on <b>additive</b> manufactured parts. <b>The</b> study results show that <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> would be a great compliment in both workshops. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> production workshop <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> could be especially beneficial for details that do not have any specific requirements, such as surface tolerances or regulatory requirements. <b>Additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> would also be useful as a backup method of details that are not delivered on time or otherwise not functioning as intended. The Tool Workshop could create <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> tools and fixtures with complex geometries and in one piece quantities. This would be benificial because it’s much faster to produce these kinds of details in an <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> than with CNC manufacturing or manual manufacturing. The results of the study also show that the health risks of <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> is material- related and that carefulness should be applied not to inhale powders, nano-particles or fumes from the material. The waste products may be either come <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of breaking away parts or emissions. Emissions should then be handled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same way as emissions are managed today. What post-processing method that is current for additively manufactured parts depends on the material to be used. Before choice of materials are made the manufacturer should keep this in mind. Since <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> can create complex parts measure instument that can verify the details are necessary. One proposal of instrument is a laser scanner. The largest delimitations made during the work are: The project does not consider geometries of details. The methods mentioned are the main methods that exist. In Tools Workshop assumed that from a specific <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> method. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> investigating part post processing, quality-, safety-, and environmental aspects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use of <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> are investigating two different <b>additive</b> <b>manufacturing</b> methods. ...|$|R
