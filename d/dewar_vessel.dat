40|$|Composting {{of sewage}} sludge is a common {{practice}} for sludge disposal. Some previous studies found high levels of polychorodibenzo-p-dioxins and polychorodibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) after composting, especially octachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (OCDD) but also 1234678 -heptachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1234678 -HpCDD) to a lesser extent. In this work, the concentrations of OCDD, 1234678 -HpCDD {{and the rest of}} the 17 toxic congeners of PCDD/Fs were determined in compost obtained under different conditions. Although the toxicity of the two compounds mentioned above is small, their generation may reach undesirable levels. The PCDD/F content was analyzed in a composting plant and in a laboratory test. In both cases, the composted material was a mixture {{of sewage sludge}}, straw and sawdust. The composting plant was a tunnel with air turbine aeration and with a turner to homogenize and move the mixture upwards. The laboratory tests were carried out with <b>Dewar</b> <b>vessels</b> (with air dispersion at the bottom and controlled temperature) and with small vessels inside a controlled oven with non-forced aeration. The laboratory runs were also carried out with the addition of pentachlorophenol in some runs, as a dioxin precursor. The highest OCDD levels were found in three samples of the composting plant (30000 – 90000 pg/g dry matter or dm), with toxicity values surpassing the limit level for soil amendment (17 pg I-TEQ/g dm). Their formation was analyzed considering their concentration vs. that of octachorodibenzofuran (OCDF), which is not formed during composting. In the laboratory, in experiments carried out in a vessel with non-forced aeration conditions and with the addition of pentachlorophenol, the formation of OCDD was significant (e. g. from 80 to 1500 pg/g dm). That means that these two factors, non-forced aeration and the presence of pentachlorophenol, can cause the OCDD formation.

The system consists of a flow cryostat and a flexible low-loss transfer line connecting a <b>Dewar</b> <b>vessel</b> with the flow cryostat. We have also tested liquid nitrogen (~ 77 K) as an alternative low-cost coolant. Using nitrogen, the microscope can operate at temperatures of about 100 K and higher. As the flow of the coolant through the cryostat can cause thermally induced two-phase flow fluctuations resulting in instability in temperatures, preliminary tests were done in order to find ways of avoiding the temperature oscillations and optimising the cooling process.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 106 - 109. This thesis {{describes}} {{techniques for}} the correction of spatial noise artifacts in a {{mercury cadmium telluride}} infrared camera system. The spatial noise artifacts {{are a result of}} nonuniformities within the infrared focal plane detector array. The techniques presented dispense with the need for traditional temperature references, and provide nonuniformity compensation by using only the statistics of the moving infrared scene and motion of the camera assembly for calibration. Frame averaging is employed, assuming that all of the detector pixels will eventually be irradiated with the same levels of incident flux after some extended period of time. Using a statistical analysis of the camera image data, the correction coefficients are re-calculated and updated. These techniques also ensure that the calculated coefficients continually track the variations in the dark currents as well as temperature changes within the <b>dewar</b> sensor cooling <b>vessel.</b> These scene-based reference free approaches to the calculation of compensation coefficients in the infrared camera are shown to be successful in compensating for the effects of fixed pattern spatial noise...|$|R
40|$|Astrophysical {{observations}} at millimeter wavelengths require large (2 -to- 5 - meter diameter) telescopes {{carried to}} altitudes above 35 km by scientific research balloons. The scientific performance is greatly enhanced if the telescope is cooled to temperatures below 10 K with no emissive windows between the telescope and the sky. Standard liquid helium bucket dewars can contain a suitable telescope for telescope diameter {{less than two}} meters. However, the mass of a dewar {{large enough to hold}} a 3 -to- 5 -meter diameter telescope would exceed the balloon lift capacity. The solution is to separate the functions of cryogen storage and in-flight thermal isolation, utilizing the unique physical conditions at balloon altitudes. Conventional dewars are launched cold: the vacuum walls necessary for thermal isolation must also withstand the pressure gradient at sea level and are correspondingly thick and heavy. The pressure at 40 km is less than 0. 3 % of sea level: a dewar designed for use only at 40 km can use ultra thin walls to achieve significant reductions in mass. This innovation concerns new construction and operational techniques to produce a lightweight liquid helium bucket dewar. The dewar is intended for use on high-altitude balloon payloads. The mass is low enough to allow a large (3 -to- 5 -meter) diameter dewar to fly at altitudes above 35 km on conventional scientific research balloons without exceeding the lift capability of the balloon. The lightweight dewar has thin (250 - micron) stainless steel walls. The walls are too thin to support the pressure gradient at sea level: the dewar launches warm with the vacuum space vented continuously during ascent to eliminate any pressure gradient across the walls. A commercial 500 -liter storage dewar maintains a reservoir of liquid helium within a minimal (hence low mass) volume. Once a 40 -km altitude is reached, the valve venting the vacuum space of the bucket dewar is closed to seal the vacuum space. A vacuum pump then evacuates the dewar vacuum space to provide the necessary thermal isolation. Liquid helium may then be transferred from the storage dewar into the bucket dewar to cool the telescope inside the bucket dewar. By splitting the functions of helium storage and in-flight thermal isolation, the parasitic mass associated with the <b>dewar</b> pressure <b>vessel</b> is eliminated to achieve factor-of-five or better reduction in mass. The lower mass allows flight on conventional scientific research balloons, even for telescopes 3 to 5 meters in diameter...|$|R
40|$|The aircraft-based Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) is a {{platform}} for multiple infrared astronomical observation experiments. These experiments carry sensors cooled to liquid helium temperatures. The liquid helium supply is contained in large (i. e., 10 liters or more) vacuum-insulated dewars. Should the dewar vacuum insulation fail, the inrushing air will condense and freeze on the dewar wall, resulting in a large heat flux on the dewar's contents. The heat flux results in a rise in pressure and the actuation of the dewar pressure relief system. A previous NASA Engineering and Safety Center (NESC) assessment provided recommendations for the wall heat flux that would be expected from a loss of vacuum and detailed an appropriate method to use in calculating the maximum pressure that would occur {{in a loss of}} vacuum event. This method involved building a detailed supercritical helium compressible flow thermal/fluid model of the vent stack and exercising the model over the appropriate range of parameters. The experimenters designing science instruments for SOFIA are not experts in compressible supercritical flows and do not generally have access to the thermal/fluid modeling packages that are required to build detailed models of the vent stacks. Therefore, the SOFIA Program engaged the NESC to develop a simplified methodology to estimate the maximum pressure in a liquid helium dewar after the loss of vacuum insulation. The method would allow the university-based science instrument development teams to conservatively determine the cryostat's vent neck sizing during preliminary design of new SOFIA Science Instruments. This report details the development of the simplified method, the method itself, and the limits of its applicability. The simplified methodology provides an estimate of the dewar pressure after a loss of vacuum insulation {{that can be used for}} the initial design of the liquid helium dewar vent stacks. However, since it is not an exact tool, final verification of the <b>dewar</b> pressure <b>vessel</b> design requires a complete, detailed real fluid compressible flow model of the vent stack. The wall heat flux resulting from a loss of vacuum insulation increases the dewar pressure, which actuates the pressure relief mechanism and results in high-speed flow through the dewar vent stack. At high pressures, the flow can be choked at the vent stack inlet, at the exit, or at an intermediate transition or restriction. During previous SOFIA analyses, it was observed that there was generally a readily identifiable section of the vent stack that would limit the flow e. g., a small diameter entrance or an orifice. It was also found that when the supercritical helium was approximated as an ideal gas at the dewar condition, the calculated mass flow rate based on choking at the limiting entrance or transition was less than the mass flow rate calculated using the detailed real fluid model 2. Using this lower mass flow rate would yield a conservative prediction of the dewars wall heat flux capability. The simplified method of the current work was developed by building on this observation...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{supercooled}} conductor as windings {{in a large}} power transformer, {{it should}} be expected that the transformer is lower in loss, smaller in size and lighter in weight. For such a conductor, Be (2 × 10 ^ Ωm at 77 °K of the liquid nitrogen), Al (3 × 10 ^ Ωm at 20 °K of the liquid hydrogen) and Nb (superconducting at 4. 2 °K of the liquid helium) can be cited but Nb and Be are less useful by the reason of its quenching in the leakage flux and its large magnetoresistance effect respectively. In this paper, a coreless transformer is considered and a supercooled Al conductor is employed in it. The merits of this transformer are that 1. there {{is not such a}} catastrophic heat generation as in a superconducting transformer and so fast circuit breaker is not necessary 2. simultaneously, to stop operating the transformer for a long time owing to such heat up can be avoided 3. it uses an inexpensive hydrogen gase 4. the <b>dewar</b> <b>vessel</b> is simplified because the transformer has not an iron core The rough calculations on a 3 -phase 190 MVA transformer show that this coreless transformer is about 25 % reduction of the conventional value in weight and 39 % reduction in volume...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{analysis}} of trace gases from fluid inclusions of minerals has been developed. The purge and trap GC-MS system is based on the system described by Nolting et al. (1988) and was optimized for the analyses of halogenated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) having boiling points as low as - 128. °C (carbon tetrafluoride). The sample preconcentration cold trap consists of a U-shaped glass lined steel tube (GLT™), that is immersed into a small liquid nitrogen <b>Dewar</b> <b>vessel</b> for cooling. A rapid desorption step heats up the preconcentration tube in < 30 s from - 196 °C to 200 °C. The process is carried out by using a pressurized air stream to dissipate the liquid nitrogen followed by resistive heating of the trap. The design of the cold trap and the direct transfer of desorbed analytes onto the GC column via a deactivated capillary column retention gap made sample refocusing within the GC oven unnecessary. Furthermore, a special air-tight grinding device was developed in which samples ranging from soft halite (hardness 2, Mohs scale) to hard quartz (hardness 7) are effectively ground to average diameters of 1000 nm or below, thereby releasing gases from fluid inclusions of minerals. The gases are then purged from the grinding chamber with a He carrier gas flow.

The MSG {{system is a}} device for observing a weak magnetic field accompanied by the neural activity of the spinal cord by using an array of low-temperature {{superconducting quantum interference device}} (SQUID) magnetic flux sensors. As in the case of other biomagnetic measurement systems such as the magnetoencephalography (MEG) system, the running cost of the MSG system is mainly dependent on the liquid helium (LHe) consumption of a <b>dewar</b> <b>vessel.</b> We integrated a cryocooler into the MSG system to reduce LHe consumption. A pulse tube cryocooler with a cooling power of 0. 5 Wat 4 K was placed adjacent to a magnetically shielded room and was directly connected to the thermal radiation shield of the dewar by an electrically isolated transfer tube. Cold helium gas was circulated between the cryocooler and the radiation shield. Consequently, the temperature of the radiation shield decreased below 40 K. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} detection of a weak magnetic field is often hindered by severe low-frequency band noise from the cryocooler. However, the band of the MSG signals is much higher than that of the cryocooler noise.

40|$|Abstract- After a {{cryogenic}} fluid has been liquefied and purified {{to the desired}} level; it must then be stored and transported. Cryogenic fluid storage-vessel and transfer line design has progressed rapidly {{as a result of}} the growing use of cryogenic liquids in many areas of engineering and science. The development of the <b>Dewar</b> <b>vessel</b> represented such an improvement in {{cryogenic fluid}} storage vessels that it could be classed as a “break-through ” in container design. The high performance storage vessels in use today are based on the concept of the Dewar design principle a double walled container with the space between the two vessels filled with an insulation and the evacuated from the space. The detailed conventional-cryogenic-fluid storage vessel design is covered in such standards as the American society of mechanical engineers (ASME) boiler and pressure vessel code, section VIII (1983), and British Standards Institution standards 1500 or 1515. Most users require that the vessels be designed, fabricated, and tested according to the code for sizes larger than about 250 dm 3 i. e. 66 U. S. gallons, because of the proven safety code design. Cryogenic storage vessels are pressure vessels are used for storage cryogenic liquids with minimum heat in-leak into the vessel from the outside as far as possible. The challenge of design is to use such materials that do not lose their desirable properties at such a low temperature.

40|$|Szilard and Chalmers [1] {{found that}} when {{beryllium}} was bombarded with the gamma-rays of radium in equilibrium with its decay products, neutrons were liberated, and could be detected {{by means of the}} radioactivity they excited in iodine. Meitner [2] showed that these neutrons excited radioactivity in I, Au and Ag, but not in Na, Si and Al. The former reactions involve the capture of a neutron, which, as Fermi [3] has shown, is most probable when the neutrons have little energy; while the latter three reactions involve the emission of an alpha-particle or proton, and probably have a higher probability when the bombarding neutrons have greater energies. Brasch and other [4], working with x-rays, have obtained this disintegration at voltages between 1. 5 and 2 mev. In the present experiment, beryllium was bombarded with the x-rays from the tube in the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory. The tube is self-rectifying, and was supplied with 50 cycle a. c. at 0. 9 mev peak. The electron current to the target was 2 m. a. The beryllium was located directly behind the tungsten target, in a bomb which was lowered inside the electrode. The ethyl iodide used as a detector for the neutrons was also in the bomb, just above the beryllium and in a <b>Dewar</b> <b>vessel</b> to prevent the heat generated at the target from reaching the ethyl iodide {{in the course of the}} irradiation, which lasted 40 minutes.

40|$|Paramagnetic {{resonance}} (p. r.) at {{low temperatures}} {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} substances in the solid state. Paramagnetic ions in the solid state are subjected to strong crystalline electric fields which profoundly modify the magnetic properties of the free ion. The orbital momentum of the free ion is completely or partially "quenched", leaving the spin momentum unaffected, except to a small extent due to spin-orbit coupling. The ground state consists of a number of levels, generally singlets or doublets. The separations of these levels may be varied by the application of an external magnetic field. If two levels have energies W 1 and W 2 and an external r. f. magnetic field, of frequency v such that h v = W 1 - W 2, is applied, transitions can be excited between the levels, within the limitations of certain selection rules. As the population of the two levels depends upon the Boltzman distribution there is a nett absorption of energy from the r. f. field when transitions occur. If this energy is lost to the crystal lattice quickly enough it is not reradiated. In practice a fixed frequency is chosen and the separation of the energy levels is adjusted by applying an external magnetic field so that the above condition is satisfied. By studying the fields at which the absorption occurs the position of the energy levels in zero field can be inferred. The energies of the levels may be expressed concisely {{in the form of a}} "spin hamiltonlan" which involves a number of parameters which have to be found experimentally. The general spin hamiltonian for an ion in a field of rhombic symmetry is: H = β(g x H x S x + g y H y S y + g z H z S z) + D [S 2 z - 1 ⁄ 3 S(S + 1) ] + E(S 2 x - S 2 y) + A x S x I x + A y S y I y + A z S z I z S is the effective spin chosen so that the multiplicity of the ground state is 2 S + l, β is the Bohr magneton, the g's are spectroscopic splitting factors along the axes of the crystal field. D represents the effect of the axial component of the field along the z axis and E represents the rhombic component of the crystal field. The transitions between the levels defined by these parameters give rise to the so-called fine structure lines. I is the nuclear spin and the terms in A, S and I represent the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and of the nucleus. This interaction splits each fine structure line into 2 I + l equally Intense, equally spaced hyperfine lines. Thus the number of hyperfine lines defines the nuclear spin unambiguously. Also the separatlon between the lines proportional to tbe nuclear magnetic moment so that in certain cases this can be estimated. The specimens used have usually consisted of single crystals of a diamagnetic salt containing about 1 % of an isomorphous paramagnetic salt. This dilution separates the paramagnetic ions and reduces tbe line width caused by their mutual interaction. Tbe experimental arrangement is of the standard type used in Oxford. Some refinements of technique have been used for particular experiments which needed them. Experiments have been performed at wavelengths between 10 em and 0. 8 mm. A klystron oscillator, run from a stabilised power pack, feeds power to a half wave resonant cavity which contains tbe sample placed in a position where the r. f. magnetic field is strong. This cavity can be placed in a <b>dewar</b> <b>vessel</b> of refrigerant and between tbe poles of an electromagnet. A wavemeter measures the wavelength and a crystal detector rectifies tbe power coupled out of the resonant cavity. The external field has a small 50 c/s modulation superimposed on it so that an absorption signal is swept through 100 times a second. The signal from the detector may then be amplified in a video-amplifier. If the amplified signal is fed to the Y-plates of an oscilloscope, which has a correctly phased 50 c/s time base, the trace displays a graph of absorption agalnst magnetic field within the region covered by the field modulation. This technique enables a spectrum to be analysed very rapidly. Complex Cyanides The p. r. spectra of two complex cyanides of divalent ions, K 4 V(CN) 6 3 H 2 O and K 4 Mn(CN) 6 3 H 2 O, have been studied. The orbital momentum of the vanadous ion is completely quenched so that it is in an S = 3 / 2 state and its behaviour resembles that of the same ion in ionic crystals. The g-value, 1. 992, is closer to the free spin value and the crystal field parameters, D = - 0. 0264 ± 0. 0004 em - 1 and E = - 0. 0072 ± 0. 0004 cm - 1, are smaller showing that the effect of higher levels is less than in the ionic salts. The hyperfine structure constant A = - 0. 00555 ± 0. 00003 cm - 1 is only 36 % smaller than in the ionic salts, showing that the configurational interaction which produces the hyperfine structure is not greatly modified by the covalent bonding. In the manganous ion the cubic field does not completely lift the orbital degeneracy of the ground state. The lowest triplet is split into a singlet and a higher doublet by the rhombic component of the crystal field so that the g-values differ widely from the free spin value. The ion behaves with effective spin S = 1 / 2 and has g-valuee g x = 2. 624 Â± 0. 008, g y = 2. 182 ± 0. 008 and g z = 0. 72 ± 0. 05. The hyperfine structure is also anisotropic and the hyperfine structure constants are A x = 0. 00845 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1, A y = 0. 00465 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1 and A z = 0. 0083 ± 0. 0013 cm - 1. The manganous ion in this type of compound resembles the titanic ion in ionic compounds and an attempt has been made to fit the parameters with the titanium theory of Abragam and Pryce (1951). This gives reasonable values for the configurational interaction constant and the mean value of the radius of the electron orbit. Nuclear spins The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of vanadium 50 has been measured in a crystal of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 3 H 2 O containing a few milligrams of vanadium enhanced to contain ~ 20 % 50 V. The spin was found to be six and the ratio of the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios of 50 V/ 51 V, 0. 380, agrees well with the value measured by nuclear resonance of 0. 3792. The spin and nuclear gyromagnetic ratio fit well with the values calculated by Hitchcock (1952) using a j-j spin-orbit coupling model of the nucleus and assuming &delta-function potential. The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of radioactive cobalt 57 have been measured in a crystal of K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 6 H 2 O containing > 0. 5 μgrams of 57 Co. The crystal also contains some stable 59 Co up to 2. 4 μgrams total cobalt content. Only one set of hyperfine structure lines is resolved so tnat the spin and magnetic moment of 57 Co are tht same as 59 Co; i. e. the spin is 7 / 2 and the magnetic moment is 4. 6 ± 0. 2 nuclear magnetons. Chromic methylamine alum Paramagnetic resonance measurements on crystals of Cr(CH 3 NH 3 (SO 4) 12 H 2 2 O show that the crystals undergo a change in strucure at 157 ± 3 °K. Above this temperature the crystal symmetry is cubic and the Cr +++ ions are in a crystal field which has a small component. Below this temperature there is an additional rhombic componant in the crystal field and the crystal symmetry is lower, probably tetragonal. At both 90 °k and 20 °K the parameters in the spin hamiltonian are g = 1. 975 ± 0. 010, D = 0. 0871 ± 0. 0007 cm - 1 and K = 0. 0092 ± 0. 0008 cm - 1. These values give a stark splitting in zero field of 0. 177 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 which disagrees with the value of 0. 188 ± 0. 007 cm - 1 calculated by Kurti and Gardner (1954) from adiabatic demagnetisation measurements. Measurements at frequencies near the Stark splitting give results which lie between the two values so that it is not possible to say whether this descrepency is real. Measurements of nearest neighbour lines and of line widths indicate that there is extremely little exchange interaction between neighbouring Cr +++ ions. The transition is possibly due to a freezing out of a random rotary motion of the methylamine radical as the substance is cooled through the transition temperature. This temperature is the same as that found by Griffiths and Powell (1952) at which there is a discontinuity in the value of the dielectric constant. Interactions between neighbouring ions The p. r. spectrum of two adjacent consists of a series of lines, corresponding to the various orientations of the spins with respect to one another, which occur as satellites to the iines by isolated ions, the number of acid separation these satellites depends upon the size and nature of the interaction between them. The magnetic interaction may be calculated if the distance between the ions is known, so that if allowance is made for this, the size and nature of exchange interaction may be inferred from the positions of the satellite lines. Investigations of this sort have been done in crystals containing about 10 % paramagnetic salt in an isomorphous diamagnetic one, so that there is considerable chance of having two ions adjacent. A study of lanthanum ethyl sulphate containing up to 30 % neodymium shows that there is a small anisotropic exchange interaction with the two nearest neighbours and undetectable exchange interaction with the six next nearest. There is however no exchange with the next nearest neighbours in concentrated neodymium ethyl sulphate. This discrepancy is not explained. A study of nearest neigbbour satellites was made in KCr(SeO 4) 2 12 H 2 O. the problem is complicated by there being four ions in the unit cell all of which have different crystal field axes. It has not been possible to make an unambiguous interpretation of the results and the best interpretation does not agree with the results of adiabatic demagnetisation experiments of Kurti and Gardner (unpublished). The results of this type of investigation are rather discouraging and seem to indicate that one can hope to obtain satisfactory results only in particular substances. Rare earth ethyl sulphates Paramagnetic resonance has been observed in terbium etbyl sulphate using the yttrium salt as a dilutant. The spectrum may be explained using the hamiltonian postulated for the praseodymium salt (Bleaney and Seovil, 1952) : H = g // βH z S z + AS z I z + AS x where g // = 17. 72 ± 0. 02, S = 1 / 2, I = 3 / 2, A = 0. 209 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 and Δ = 0. 387 ± 0. 001 cm - 1. The lowest level is a doublet J z = ± 6 which is admixed with J x = 0 by the crystal field. This admixes the + 6 and - 6 levels and ΔM = 0 transitions are obtained if the r. f. magnetic field is placed parallel to tbe external field. The nuclear spin of terbium 159 is estimated to be 1. 5 ± 0. 4 nuclear magnetons. The work of Bleaney and Seovil (1952) on praseodymium ethyl sulphate has been extended using yttrium ethyl sulphate as a dilutant. The assymmetrical line shape is explained as being tbe result of the splitting Δ in the above hatmiltonian not having a single value but a Gaussian distribution of values, the nuclear magnetic moment of praseodymium 141 is estimated to be 4. 5 ± 1. 1 nuclear magnetons. </p...|$|E
