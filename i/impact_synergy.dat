40|$|Our {{best hope}} of {{developing}} innovative methods to combat invasive species {{is likely to}} come from the study of high-profile invaders that have attracted intensive research not only into control, but also basic biology. Here we illustrate that point by reviewing current thinking about novel ways to control one of the world’s most well-studied invasions: that of the cane toad in Australia. Recently developed methods for population suppression include more effective traps based on the toad’s acoustic and pheromonal biology. New tools for containing spread include surveillance technologies (e. g., eDNA sampling and automated call detectors), as well as landscape-level barriers that exploit the toad’s vulnerability to desiccation—a strategy that could be significantly enhanced through the introduction of sedentary, range-core genotypes ahead of the invasion front. New methods to reduce the ecological impacts of toads include conditioned taste aversion in free-ranging predators, gene banking, and targeted gene flow. Lastly, recent advances in gene editing and gene drive technology hold the promise of modifying toad phenotypes in ways that may facilitate control or buffer <b>impact.</b> <b>Synergies</b> between these approaches hold great promise for novel and more effective means to combat the toad invasion and its consequent impacts on biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Muscle synergies {{calculated}} from electromyography (EMG) data identify weighted groups of muscles activated together during functional tasks. Research {{has shown that}} fewer synergies are required to describe EMG data of individuals with neurologic impairments. When considering potential clinical applications of synergies, understanding how EMG data processing impacts results and clinical interpretation is important. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate how EMG signal processing <b>impacts</b> <b>synergy</b> outputs during gait. We evaluated the impacts of two common processing steps for synergy analyses: low pass (LP) filtering and unit variance scaling. We evaluated EMG data collected during barefoot walking from five muscles of 113 children with cerebral palsy (CP) and 73 typically-developing (TD) children. We applied LP filters to the EMG data with cutoff frequencies ranging from 4 to 40 Hz (reflecting the range reported in prior synergy research). We also evaluated the impact of normalizing EMG amplitude by unit variance. We found that the total variance accounted for (tVAF) by a given number of synergies was sensitive to LP filter choice and decreased in both TD and CP groups with increasing LP cutoff frequency (e. g., 9. 3 percentage points change for one synergy between 4 and 40 Hz). This change in tVAF can alter the number of synergies selected for further analyses. Normalizing tVAF to a z-score (e. g., dynamic motor control index during walking, walk-DMC) reduced sensitivity to LP cutoff. Unit variance scaling caused comparatively small changes in tVAF. Synergy weights and activations were impacted less than tVAF by LP filter choice and unit variance normalization. These results demonstrate that EMG signal processing methods <b>impact</b> outputs of <b>synergy</b> analysis and z-score based measures can assist in reporting and comparing results across studies and clinical centers...|$|R

Two separate models are established to analyse (i) {{the interaction between}} agricultural technology and aggregate marketing margins in a Vietnamese context, and (ii) {{the relative importance of}} trade margins and transportation margins in explaining the importance of aggregate margins. The results show that a reduction in marketing margins is not a necessary complement for agricultural technology improvements to target welfare gains for rural households. Nevertheless, it remains a desirable complement since (i) it will allow for the reaping of significant synergy gains from interaction with agricultural productivity growth, and (ii) it will increase the targeting potential of agricultural productivity growth in terms of welfare improvements for poor rural households. Finally, the results show that a reduction in trade margins is a very potent instrument for reaping of synergy effects and targeting of rural household welfare. In contrast, transportation margins appear to be a surprisingly impotent instrument in these regards. 1 Vietnam, Agricultural Technology and Marketing Margins in Vietnam, Agricultural Technology...|$|R

40|$|Application {{of neural}} machine {{interface}} in individuals with chronic hemiparetic stroke {{is regarded as}} a great challenge, especially for classification of the hand opening and grasping during a functional upper extremity movement such as reach-to-grasp. The overall accuracy of classifying hand movements, while actively lifting the paretic arm, is subject to a significant reduction compared to the accuracy when the arm is fully supported. Such a reduction is believed to be due to the expression of flexion synergy, which couples shoulder abduction (SABD) with elbow/wrist and finger flexion, and is common in up to 60 % of the stroke population. Little research has been done to develop methods to reduce the <b>impact</b> of flexion <b>synergy</b> on the classification of hand opening and grasping. In this study, we proposed a novel approach to classify hand opening and grasping {{in the context of the}} flexion synergy using a wavelet coherence-based filter. We first identified the frequency ranges where the coherence between the SABD muscle and wrist/finger flexion muscles is significant in each participant, and then removed the synergy-induced electromyogram (EMG) component with a subject-specific and muscle-specific coherence-based filter. The new approach was tested in 21 stroke individuals with moderate to severe motor impairments. Employing the filter, 14 participants gained improvement in classification accuracy with a range of 0. 1 to 14 %, while four showed 0. 3 to 1. 2 % reduction. The remaining three participants were excluded from comparison due to the lack of significant coherence, thus no filters were applied. The improvement in classification accuracy is significant (p[*]=[*] 0. 017) when the SABD loading equals 50 % of the maximal torque. Our findings suggest that the coherence-based filters can reduce the <b>impact</b> of flexion <b>synergy</b> by removing the synergy-induced EMG component and have the potential to improve the overall classification accuracy of hand movements in individuals with poststroke flexion synergy...|$|R

Although certain combination therapies have long been known {{to be more effective}} in curing patients than single drugs, the impact of such treatments on the evolution of drug resistance is unclear. In particular, very little is known about how the evolution of resistance is affected {{by the nature of the}} interactions—synergy or antagonism—between drugs. Here we directly measure the effect of various inhibitory and subinhibitory drug combinations on the rate of adaptation. We develop an automated assay for monitoring the parallel evolution of hundreds of Escherchia coli populations in a two-dimensional grid of drug gradients over many generations. We find a correlation between synergy and the rate of adaptation, whereby evolution in more synergistic drug combinations, typically preferred in clinical settings, is faster than evolution in antagonistic combinations. We also find that resistance to some synergistic combinations evolves faster than resistance to individual drugs. The accelerated evolution may be due to a larger selective advantage for resistance mutations in synergistic treatments. We describe a simple geometric model in which mutations conferring resistance to one drug of a synergistic pair prevent not only the inhibitory effect of that drug but also its enhancing effect on the other drug.

The results show clear shifts in functional composition. Despite this, biomass increased during the study period. This suggests that shifting species composition in favour of drought-tolerant species increases the resilience of tropical forests to long-term drought. A strong El Niño event in 1983 led to widespread wildfires in the Ghanaian forest zone. To test the long-term impacts of these fires the structure and composition of seven burnt plots and three control plots were compared. 27 years after initial fires, stem density and biomass were reduced in burnt plots, and composition was characteristic of disturbed forest. Over the twenty year study period, forest structure showed evidence of regeneration, but no recovery of floristic composition was observed. In contrast to the large increase in lianas observed in the Neotropics, there was only a very slight increase in the percentage of infested trees over the study period. Forest structure was found to be the main driver of liana spatial distribution. Importantly, large lianas showed different spatial patterns, as forest turnover was the strongest predictor of large liana distribution. Overall, fire was found to be the strongest threat, having a large and long-term impact on forest structure and composition. The results highlight that the prevention of fire occurrence should be a priority in tropical forest regions, as should the maintenance of biodiversity to maximise the resilience of forest to external changes.

40|$|Workload {{management}} aims at {{the efficient}} execution of queries on a database. In this context, scheduling plays a crucial role. A {{vast number of}} scheduling approaches have been developed, most of them belonging {{to one of two}} categories: analysis and monitoring. However, they mainly either focus only on one possible kind of impact of queries on each other’s execution time, or require an offline phase for information gathering. In contrast, the approach we pursue does not require any offline phase and flexibly adapts to any database system or hardware configuration. It bases {{on the fact that the}} multiple requests that are executed concurrently in a database for performance purposes may have a positive impact on the execution of each other, e. g. due to caching or complementary resource consumption, or impede each other’s execution, e. g. in the case of resource contention. Both kinds of impacts are reflected by the execution time of the workload. We apply a monitoring approach to derive those <b>impacts</b> – called <b>synergies</b> – between request types fully automated at runtime from measured execution times. Thereby, our approach works completely independent from changing synergies or configurations and easily handles new query types. 1...|$|R
