Normal supplementation rate of Calliandra calothyrsus is around 20-40%.In Uganda, Calliandra calothyrsus is mostly mixed with other fodder for cows (grasses, tree species…). Calliandra calothyrsus leaves do not contain any toxic compounds but high condensed tannins concentrations, which could limit the digestibility for ruminants.

Monogastric animals seem to have more problems to metabolize the amount of tannins in Calliandra calothyrsus. Calliandra calothyrsus should not be used in grazing regions only, because the risk that animals destroy the tree bark is high, which leads to a high tree mortality. Animals should eat freshly cut Calliandra leaves that were cut between 0 and 1 meter. Apparently, dry leaves seem to be less palatable to animals. Some beneficial effects of using Calliandra calothyrsus as fodder have been observed in Uganda, where farmers noticed an increase in milk production.

In this work, we observe that in identical conditions amounted cow Holstein cattle to higher average daily milk production by up to 6. 89 kg per cow. Furthermore, we found a comparable fat and protein content, while we have not had the expected significant differences under the two breeds. Regarding the <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk,</b> the best result was recorded in 2013, when the Czech Simmental breed recorded an average <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> at 4. 00 % and 3. 95 % of Holstein breed.

40|$|The {{protein and}} fat content of Dutch bulk milk has been {{monitored}} since the 1950 s and has increased considerably, by 11 and 20 %, respectively, whereas milk yield {{has more than}} doubled. The change in protein and <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> is advantageous for the dairy industry, as these are the 2 most economically valuable constituents of milk. Increases in protein and <b>fat</b> <b>content</b> <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> have allowed increases in the yield of various products such as cheese and butter. However, for cheese and other applications where casein micelles {{play a crucial role}} in structure and stability, it is not only casein content, but also the properties of the casein micelles that determine processability. Of particular importance herein is the salt partition in milk, but it is unknown whether increased protein content has affected the milk salts and their distribution between casein micelles and milk serum. It was, therefore, the objective of this research to determine the salt composition and protein content for individual cow milk and bulk milk over a period of 1 yr and to compare these data to results obtained during the 1930 s, 1950 s, and 1960 s in the last century. Calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, and phosphorus content were determined by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry and inorganic phosphate, citrate, chloride, and sulfate content by anion-exchange chromatography in bulk milk and milk ultracentrifugate. In addition, ionic calcium and ionic magnesium concentration were determined by the Donnan membrane technique. We concluded that historical increase in milk yield and protein content in milk have resulted in correlated changes in casein content and the micellar salt fraction of milk. In addition, the essential nutrients, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus in milk have increased the past 75 yr; therefore, the nutritional value of milk has improved.
