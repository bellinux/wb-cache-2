5000|$|The Saracens {{called the}} {{crossbow}} qaws Ferengi, or [...] "Frankish bow", as the Crusaders used the crossbow against the Arab and Turkic horsemen with remarkable success. The adapted crossbow {{was used by}} the Islamic armies in defence of their castles. Later, <b>footstrapped</b> versions became very popular among the Muslim armies in Iberia. During the Crusades, Europeans were exposed to Saracen composite bows, made from layers of different material—often wood, horn and sinew—glued together and bound with animal tendon. These composite bows could be much more powerful than wooden bows, and were adopted for crossbow prods across Europe. Crossbow prods could be more easily waterproofed than hand bows, which was essential in the humid European climate.|$|R

40|$|The Inflatable Rescue Boat (IRB) {{is arguably}} the most {{effective}} rescue tool used by the Australian surf lifesavers. The exceptional features of high mobility and rapid response have enabled it to become an icon on Australia's popular beaches. However, the IRB's extensive use within an environment that is as rugged as it is spectacular, has led it to become a danger to those who risk their lives to save others. Epidemiological research revealed lower limb injuries to be predominant, particularly the right leg. The common types of injuries were fractures and dislocations, as well as muscle or ligament strains and tears. The concern expressed by Surf Life Saving Queensland (SLSQ) and Surf Life Saving Australia (SLSA) led to a biomechanical investigation into this unique and relatively unresearched field. The aim of the research was to identify the causes of injury and propose processes that may reduce the instances and severity of injury to surf lifesavers during IRB operation. Following a review of related research, a design analysis of the craft was undertaken as an introduction to the craft, its design and uses. The mechanical characteristics of the vessel were then evaluated and the accelerations applied to the crew in the IRB were established through field tests. The data were then combined and modelled in the 3 -D mathematical modelling and simulation package, MADYMO. A tool was created to compare various scenarios of boat design and methods of operation to determine possible mechanisms to reduce injuries. The results of this study showed that under simulated wave loading the boats flex around a pivot point determined by the position of the hinge in the floorboard. It was also found that the accelerations experienced by the crew exhibited similar characteristics to road vehicle accidents. Staged simulations indicated the attributes of an optimum foam in terms of thickness and density. Likewise, modelling of the boat and crew produced simulations that predicted realistic crew response to tested variables. Unfortunately, the observed lack of adherence to the SLSA <b>footstrap</b> Standard has impeded successful epidemiological and modelling outcomes. If uniformity of boat setup can be assured then epidemiological studies will be able to highlight the influence of implementing changes to the boat design. In conclusion, the research provided a tool to successfully link the epidemiology and injury diagnosis to the mechanical engineering design through the use of biomechanics. This was a novel application of the mathematical modelling software MADYMO. Other craft can also be investigated in this manner to provide solutions to the problem identified and therefore reduce risk of injury for the operators...|$|R
50|$|Kiteboarding is {{a surface}} water sport {{combining}} aspects of wakeboarding, snowboarding, windsurfing, surfing, paragliding, skateboarding and gymnastics into one extreme sport. A kiteboarder harnesses {{the power of}} the wind with a large controllable power kite to be propelled across the water on a kiteboard similar to a wakeboard or a small surfboard, with or without <b>footstraps</b> or bindings.|$|E

50|$|A Dirtsurfer is {{composed}} of an aircraft aluminium tube frame, a laminate or composite deck and two 20in or 16in diameter BMX style bicycle wheels. <b>Footstraps</b> are (optionally) attached to the deck to give more control to the rider. The board is unique in that it incorporates a patented steering geometry http://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6398237 where the front wheel pivots from a point in front of and below the axle of the wheel, via the 'Swingarm'. The rider's weight automatically centres and straightens the front wheel, creating stability and control.Another feature of the Dirtsurfer which is not found on other four-wheeled boards is that, much like a bicycle, the stability actually increases with speed.|$|E
5000|$|The flowboard is {{also known}} as the 'stand-up board' in flowriding. [...] Currently there are four {{mainstream}} board brands: Ash Flowboards, Mak Flowboards, Wave Loch, and Jaan Flowboards. These boards differ in shape, materials, lengths and the angle at which the board curves. Generally they take a similar appearance to that of a wakeboard and can be further categorized into strapped and strapless boards. Boards with <b>footstraps</b> are generally used only on the FlowBarrel, but strapless boards are used on both the FlowRider and FlowBarrel. Flowboards range in length from: 910 millimeters (36 inches) to 1070 millimeters (42 inches); and in width from 280 millimeters (11 inches) to 356 millimeters (14 inches). They weigh between 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) and 2.8 kilograms (6 pounds).|$|E
5000|$|A snakeboard is self-propelled, {{and there}} is no need to touch a foot on the ground. Moreover, it is {{considerably}} easier to generate and maintain momentum than on a skateboard. To perform a trick, one's feet must be strapped to the board, which makes it harder to [...] "bail out" [...] of a trick or dismount. It should also be noted that while the <b>footstraps</b> limit the amount a rider can manipulate the board, they also facilitate certain techniques. Much like a snowboarder, the rider can perform spins and somersaults higher and farther than any skateboarder. At the same time, this means a faster learning curve. While a skateboarder will spend weeks learning the most basic manoeuvres, such as the Ollie, or jump, a streetboarder (snakeboarder) simply has to strap himself to the board and jump as he would without the board attached.|$|E
5000|$|Kiteboard, a small composite, wooden, or foam board. There are now {{several types}} of kiteboards: {{directional}} surf-style boards, wakeboard-style boards, hybrids which can go in either direction but are built to operate better in one of them, and skim-type boards. Some riders also use standard surfboards, or even long boards, although without foot straps much of the high-jump capability of a kite is lost. Twin tip boards are the easiest to learn on and {{are by far the}} most popular. The boards generally come with sandal-type <b>footstraps</b> that allow the rider to attach and detach from the board easily; this is required for doing board-off tricks and jumps. Bindings are used mainly by the wakestyle riders wishing to replicate wakeboarding tricks such as KGBs and other pop initiated tricks. Kiteboards come in shapes and sizes to suit the rider's skill level, riding style, wind and water conditions.|$|E
5000|$|In planing {{conditions}} {{a harness}} is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider's weight {{to counter the}} force in the sail. As the wind increases, the rider continues to sheet the sail, the fin generates more lift, and the board gains speed, transitioning onto a plane. The volume of board in the water (displacement) decreases, and the rider moves rearward, stepping into the <b>footstraps</b> for improved control. When planing, the board skims on the surface rather than displacing water as it moves. Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider's weight, sail and fin size, wave conditions, and rider ability. With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around 12 knots. The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy, but once planing, water resistance decreases dramatically. This means {{that it is possible}} to continue to plane, although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane. A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement (thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control). Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone (generating more lift at higher speeds) and a centreboard is no longer used (smaller boards do not have one). A fin generates lift, transferring a strong load to the board, and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength. A low-pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin, which can lead to cavitation, leading to a sudden loss of lift, called [...] "spin-out" [...] (equivalent to [...] "stalling" [...] in flight terminology). Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is 15-25 knots of wind, but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions. Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport.|$|E
40|$|Inflatable Rescue Boats (IRBs) are {{utilised}} by the Surf Life Saving Association (SLSA) in Australia {{to perform}} rescue operations and in regional competitions between surf clubs. These activities {{have resulted in}} a number of serious foot and ankle injuries which reflect the high impact of this activity in heavy and unpredictable surf. We have retrospectively reviewed 12 significant injuries relating to IRB usage presented to our regional hospital emergency department over a 3 -year period. These include 6 Lisfranc fracture dislocations of the midfoot, 4 ankle fracture variants, one tibial shaft fracture, and one traumatic rupture of the peroneal retinaculum leading to peroneal tendon dislocation. Analysis of IRB <b>footstraps</b> in current usage shows they are directly related to the patterns of injury seen. We have recommended modifications to <b>footstraps</b> and handgrips currently in use with the aim of minimising or preventing these injuries...|$|E
