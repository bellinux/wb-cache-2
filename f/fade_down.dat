50|$|The next morning, {{the heat}} and the cicadas finally <b>fade</b> <b>down</b> with the coming of rain, and Douglas is well enough to write in his tablet again of his experience.|$|E
5000|$|The ‘danger zone’ may not, of course, signify death but {{it would}} take an act of faith - or “an act of lucidity” - to find out for sure. When Sidney Homan was rehearsing his version of Quad, {{to learn more about the}} piece the players improvised, what one of the actors called [...] "a real ending, {{something}} more than the final character’s just disappearing" [...] where the last character about the leave the stage, halts, turns, removes her hood and then, as if being beckoned by the centre, hesitantly makes her way there where the lights <b>fade</b> <b>down</b> on her.|$|E
5000|$|One of RRN's {{most popular}} daily {{features}} {{was a series}} of live weather reports from each of the hilltop transmitter sites, moving from west to east. At 12:15 PM, an announcer in the downtown Ithaca studio would introduce the [...] "roundup", then pause for a few seconds while the Bristol Center and Ithaca transmitters switched relay receivers. The engineer at Wethersfield would then <b>fade</b> <b>down</b> his relay receiver, switch on his mic, and report the readings of each of his weather instruments. By means of RRN's off-air relay system, this would be simulcast on the other five stations. After another pause, Bristol Center's engineer would go live—followed in turn by the Ithaca, DeRuyter, Turin and Cherry Valley transmitter staff—who would each flip the necessary switches to air their respective reports and relay the rest [...] "down the line".|$|E

5000|$|Stewart {{spent three}} weeks {{recording}} Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing [...] "ahhh" [...] 16 times for each {{note of the}} chromatic scale, building up a [...] "choir" [...] of 48 voices for each note of the scale. The main problem facing the band was {{how to keep the}} vocal notes going for an infinite length of time, but Creme suggested that they could get around this issue by using tape loops. Stewart created loops of about 12 feet in length by feeding the loop at one end though the tape heads of the stereo recorder in the studio, and at the other end through a capstan roller fixed {{to the top of a}} microphone stand, and tensioned the tape. By creating long loops the 'blip' caused by the splice in each tape loop could be drowned out by the rest of the backing track, providing that the blips in each loop did not coincide with each other. Having created twelve tape loops for each of the 12 notes of the chromatic scale, Stewart played each loop through a separate channel of the mixing desk. This effectively turned the mixing desk into a musical instrument complete with all the notes of the chromatic scale, which the four members together then [...] "played", fading up three or four channels at a time to create [...] "chords" [...] for the song's melody. Stewart had put gaffer's tape across the bottom of each channel, which meant it was impossible to completely <b>fade</b> <b>down</b> the tracks for each note; this resulted in the constant background hiss of vocals heard throughout the song. Composer and music theory professor Thomas MacFarlane considered the resulting [...] "ethereal voices" [...] with distorted synthesized effects that are an example of early synclavier music to be a major influence on Billy Joel's hit ballad [...] "Just the Way You Are", released two years later.|$|E

40|$|We propose in this {{contribution}} {{a method}} for l one regularization in prototype based relevance learning vector quantization (LVQ) for sparse relevance profiles. Sparse relevance profiles in hyperspectral data analysis <b>fade</b> <b>down</b> those spectral bands which are not necessary for classification. In particular, we consider the sparsity in the relevance profile enforced by LASSO optimization. The latter one is obtained by a gradient learning scheme using a differentiable parametrized approximation of the $l_{ 1 }$-norm, which has an upper error bound. We extend this regularization idea also to the matrix learning variant of LVQ as the natural generalization of relevance learning...|$|E

50|$|The Reds {{were coming}} off a {{successful}} season in 1898, earning a third-place finish with a 92-60 record. However, they once again <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch, as the team was in {{first place in the}} first week of September before slumping for the remainder of the season.|$|R
50|$|The 1997 Los Angeles Dodgers season, under manager Bill Russell, was {{a season}} in American baseball.

5000|$|Sir Henry Newbolt wrote later a ballad titled The Fighting Temeraire, {{describing}} the same scene: [...] "And she's <b>fading</b> <b>down</b> the river, But in England's song for ever, She's the Fighting Téméraire."

50|$|In {{the face}} of Super Bowl expectations, Miami <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch, and Johnson's {{relationship}} with Marino dissolved completely. The Dolphins still finished the season 9-7 and won in the wildcard round of the playoffs, but in the divisional they were crushed in an embarrassing 62-7 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Johnson resigned {{the day after the}} game and Marino soon thereafter announced his retirement. Johnson was succeeded by Dave Wannstedt.|$|R

Finishing last out of 48 entrants in her event, Bodden failed {{to advance to the}} semifinals.|$|R
50|$|There are {{dramatic}} {{shots of}} riders climbing mountains, often with breathtaking views, a struggle which Lelouch emphasises by slowly <b>fading</b> <b>down</b> the heartbeat-like music to near silence, stressing each rider's lone and silent battle with himself. In more light-hearted scenes, the team manager Raphael Géminiani is shown angrily realising {{he has been}} filmed while he has been asleep, and the soigneur Louis Guerlacher is shown kneading a rider's muscles {{as though they were}} soggy baguettes.|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} <b>fading</b> <b>down</b> {{in the deep}} rift when, winding round a spur through a tangle of {{clinging}} underbrush, they saw the timber thin off ahead. In a few minutes Vane stopped with an exclamation, and Carroll, overtaking him, loosened his pack. They stood upon {{the edge of the}} timber, but in front of them a mass of soil and stones ran up almost vertically to a great outcrop of rock high above.|$|R
50|$|U.S. swimmer Ryan Lochte, {{the reigning}} world champion, missed the podium by 11-hundredths {{of a second}} with a fourth-place time in 1:45.04. Germany's world-record holder Paul Biedermann <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch {{to pick up a}} fifth spot in 1:45.53, edging out British home {{favorite}} Robbie Renwick by a full body length with a highly-creditable, sixth-place effort (1:46.53). Australia's Thomas Fraser-Holmes (1:46.93) and Russia's Danila Izotov (1:47.75) also vied for an Olympic medal to round out the stellar championship field.|$|R
50|$|That {{would be}} Pittsburgh's last playoff game for 25 years. In the 1948 off season, coach Jock Sutherland died. The team {{struggled}} {{through the season}} (one quarterback, Ray Evans, threw 17 interceptions to only five touchdowns) and finished 4-8. The team once again <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch in 1949 after a strong start, ending with a 6-5-1 record. That was followed up in 1950 with a 6-6 season, and consecutive losing seasons in 1951 (4-7-1) and 1952 (5-7).|$|R
50|$|In 2016, she {{was officially}} named to Canada's 2016 Olympic team. In Rio, Kate O'Brien and Sullivan were {{eliminated}} in the repechage of the women's keirin. Sullivan couldn't recover in her heat race {{after she was}} boxed in, with Lyubov Shulika of the Ukraine racing by her while {{one of the two}} Spanish riders came over the top, and the Canadian <b>faded</b> <b>down</b> the stretch. Overall, her results in Rio included: 8th in team sprint, 17th in individual sprint and 25th in Keirin.|$|R
5000|$|The {{electric}} folk group Steeleye Span {{had a hit}} in 1973 (No. 14, UK singles chart) with an {{a cappella}} recording of the song. Guitarist Bob Johnson had heard the song when he attended a folk-carol service with his father-in-law in Cambridge, {{and brought it to}} the attention of the rest of the band. (Unlike the album version which fades up slowly and <b>fades</b> <b>down</b> slowly, the single was at the same volume for the entire length of the song.) ...|$|R
