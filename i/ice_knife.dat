5000|$|The <b>Ice</b> <b>Knife</b> SDS - Guanella Pass (USA) - 2 November 2013 - First ascent ...|$|E
50|$|Il coltello di ghiaccio was {{released}} in Italy in 1972. The film has also been distributed under the titles Vertigine, Dagger of <b>Ice,</b> <b>Knife</b> of Ice, Detr√°s del Silencio.and The Ice Pick.|$|E
50|$|Built by the Aarlborg Shipyard Pty Ltd in 1961, she {{incorporated}} all {{the features}} of her older sisters, the Thala Dan, Kista Dan and Magga Dan. An ice breaker stern, ice fins and <b>ice</b> <b>knife</b> were becoming regular features, but a novel addition was the double hull in the engine room {{and part of the}} holds. The ascent to the crow's nest was through the interior of the mast, and the ship supplied its own fresh water with an Atlas generator. At the time of her construction, the Nella Dan was regarded as setting the standard for polar vessels.|$|E
5000|$|We pray it {{does not}} get to that, or even make the women go full blast nudity, {{that would be a}} curse on the land, whose {{consequences}} cannot be quantified. There is indeed a palpable anger of the people, frustration and vexation [...] One can feel it in the air and smell the combustion as thick and clouded like cutting through an <b>ice</b> with a <b>knife.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... is a snow fairy {{who joins}} Tsukune's {{class in the}} second term. She is {{typically}} seen with a lollipop in her mouth, which is actually a special coolant. In her first school term, she confesses her love to gym teacher Okuto Kotsubo, but when he takes advantage of her, she freezes him and gets suspended for the term. She obsesses over Tsukune because of his news articles, and stalks him regularly, eventually joining the Newspaper Club in her second year. Besides freezing people outright, Mizore can shape claws of ice from her hands, throw <b>ice</b> kunai (Japanese <b>knives),</b> and make <b>ice</b> dolls (fragile mobile copies) of herself and of others. In the Japanese anime and drama CD, Mizore is voiced by Rie Kugimiya. In the English dub, she is voiced by Tia Ballard.|$|R
40|$|In 1987 and 1988, {{samples of}} {{preserved}} insects were {{extracted from the}} <b>ice</b> of <b>Knife</b> Point Glacier, Fremont County, Wyoming. The glacier lies {{at an altitude of}} 3500 m a. s. l. in the Shoshone National Forest, Wind River Range, and is known to contain preserved insects. Although the glacier has undergone extensive recession in the last 50 yr, some insect deposits are still embedded at 20 to 25 cm below the surface and perhaps much deeper. The frozen deposits appear to consist entirely of grasshoppers. A few, virtually intact, specimens and body parts were in a state of preservation that allowed their identification as Spharagemon campestris McNeill and Melanoplus spretus (Walsh) or M. sanguinipes (F.). The majority of the deposits consisted of partial bodies and isolated parts, including, in order of frequency: mandibles, tibiae, tentoria, femora, wings (primarily tegmina), and cingulae/epiphalli. Deposits from various depths and locations on the glacier were radiocarbon dated at 205 + 65 to 450 + 80 yr BP. Although access to the glacier is quite difficult, the insects are better preserved than any glacial deposit documented in recent history. Thus, the state of preservation and age of the frozen deposits would suggest that additional, intensive sampling may be valuable in obtain- ing information on the ecology of grasshoppers prior to European settlement of North America...|$|R
500|$|To obtain certain {{snow and}} ice sound effects, sound {{designer}} Odin Benitez traveled to Mammoth Mountain, California, to record them at a frozen lake. However, the foley work for the film was recorded on the foley stage on the Warner Bros. lot by a Warner Bros. crew. The foley artists received daily deliveries of 50 pounds (22.6kg) of snow ice while working, to help them record all the necessary {{snow and ice}} sounds for the film. Because the film's visuals were finalized so late, five separate versions of nearly every footstep on snow were recorded (corresponding to five different types of snow), then one was later selected during mixing to match the snow as rendered in {{the final version of}} each scene. One issue that the production team was [...] "particular" [...] about was the sound of Elsa's footsteps in the ice palace, which required eight attempts, including wine glasses on <b>ice</b> and metal <b>knives</b> on ice; they ended up using a mix of three sounds.|$|R
5000|$|The second Kansas City Electric Park, {{this time}} at 46th Street and the Paseo, opened 19 May 1907. Like the first one, it was a trolley park (this time served by the Troost Avenue, Woodland Avenue, and Rockhill lines of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company), but the {{successor}} {{was one of the}} largest (if not the largest) ever to be called Electric Park. It had [...] "band concerts, vaudeville, Electric Fountain, ballroom, natatorium, German village, alligator farm, chutes, Dips Coaster, Norton slide, penny parlors, novelty stand, Japanese rolling ball, scenic railway, pool room, a Hale's Tour of the World, Electric Studio, boat tours, old mill, a Temple of Mirth, Flying Lady, Double Whirl, Circle Swing, soda fountain and <b>ice</b> cream shops, <b>knife</b> rack, doll rack, shooting gallery, air gun gallery, giant teeter, boating, outdoor swimming, carousel, [...] cafe, Casino 5 cent theater, fortune telling and palmistry, covered promenade and horseless buggy garage." [...] Souvenirs from the park touted it as [...] "Kansas City's Coney Island," [...] which it matched by having 100,000 light bulbs adorn its buildings.|$|R
