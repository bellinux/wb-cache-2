We assume that the individual buys instantaneous term life <b>insurance</b> with a <b>premium</b> <b>payable</b> continuously. By contrast with Bayraktar et al.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the collection of social insurance which is pursuant to the Act of law number 582 / 1991 on the organization and implementation of social security which is entrusted to the Czech Social Security with the District Social Security Administration. It mainly specializes in the successfulness of the collection of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> and concerns about the application of the installment regime for the collection of <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> in the South Bohemian region to influence delinquency. The importance of the installment regime is especially for debtors to the effect that the debt in the installment regime is not recovered and the payment, is due to obligation, spread for 36 months. The aim of the thesis was to document the interest of payers and determine prognosis of the application of the installment regime with the aim to reduce delinquency. The research showed that the interest in allowing to pay owed <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> and penalties <b>payable</b> in installments was considerably influenced by the global economic crisis. This regime is not self-messianic and requires District Social Security Administrations individual treatment...|$|R

50|$|Community rating, as a {{basis for}} premium calculation, is {{fundamentally}} different from the usual method of determining <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums,</b> i.e. risk rating. In a risk rated insurance market, an insurer calculates the <b>premium</b> <b>payable</b> by a potential policy holder in order to enter into an insurance contract on the basis of various factors particular to that individual, such as the risk of a claim occurring, and the value of any such claims during the term of an insurance policy. In a community rated market, the insurer may not calculate premium {{on the basis of the}} risk factors attaching to the particular person wishing to purchase an insurance contract, but rather the risk factors applying to all persons within the market as a whole. Thus, in a community rated market, the insurer evaluates the risk factors of market population, and not those of any one person when calculating premiums. Some form of risk equalization also often exists in a community rated system.|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by a problem concerning the monotonicity of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> {{with respect to their}} loading parameter: the larger the parameter, the larger the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is expected to be. This property, usually called loading monotonicity, is satisfied by premiums that appear in the literature. The increased interest in constructing new <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> has raised a question as to what weight functions would produce loading-monotonic premiums. In this paper we demonstrate a decisive role of log-supermodularity in answering this question. As a consequence, we establish - at a stroke - the loading monotonicity of a number of well-known <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> and offer a host of further weight functions, and consequently of premiums, thus illustrating the power of the herein suggested methodology for constructing loading-monotonic <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This article {{considers}} {{the impact of}} risk management and monitoring costs on insurer’s monitoring activities and investigates the relationship between risk management and monitoring activities and setting {{the level of the}} <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> The main results of this article are as follows. First, a firm always undertakes risk management when the risk management cost is low. Second, when the insurer can spontaneously choose the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium,</b> the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm decreases, and risk management activities will not be promoted, because the cost of the accident can be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> In contrast, when the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> is exogenously decided, the insurer’s incentive to monitor the firm increases and risk management activities will be promoted, because the cost of accidents cannot be directly reflected in the level of the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium.</b> These results have the following implications for policy making. First, the results imply that policy should be designed to lower risk management costs by offering a platform for firms to exchange useful information with each other and/or reduce taxes for investments that lower risk management costs. Second, the results imply that both heavy <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> regulation and the <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> deregulation to realize a fierce competitive insurance market are desirable for promoting risk management activities...|$|R

5000|$|Where {{the life}} {{insurance}} is provided through a superannuation fund, contributions made to fund <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> are tax deductible for self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons and employers. However where life insurance is held {{outside of the}} superannuation environment, the premiums are generally not tax deductible. For insurance through a superannuation fund, the annual deductible contributions to the superannuation funds are subject to age limits. These limits apply to employers making deductible contributions. They also apply to self-employed persons and substantially self-employed persons. Included in these overall limits are <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> This means that no additional deductible contributions {{can be made for}} the funding of <b>insurance</b> <b>premiums.</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>premiums</b> can, however, be funded by undeducted contributions. For further information on deductible contributions see [...] "under what conditions can an employer claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of their employees?" [...] and [...] "what is the definition of substantially self-employed?". The <b>insurance</b> <b>premium</b> paid by the superannuation fund can be claimed by the fund as a deduction to reduce the 15% tax on contributions and earnings. (Ref: ITAA 1936, Section 279).|$|R
