50|$|Despite APP being {{considered}} Pakistan's “premier” news agency, for decades the agency ran on old, obsolete and unreliable equipment. News copy was being {{carried on a}} 50-baud <b>duplex</b> <b>circuit</b> between Islamabad, Karachi and Lahore.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} of the hotline used two full-time <b>duplex</b> telegraph <b>circuits.</b> The primary circuit was routed from Washington, D.C. via London, Copenhagen, Stockholm and Helsinki to Moscow. TAT-1, the first submarine transatlantic telephone cable carried messages from Washington to London. A secondary radio line for back-up and service messages linked Washington and Moscow via Tangier. This network was originally built by Harris Corporation.|$|R
50|$|TASI takes {{advantage}} of the fact that in typical person-person conversation, speech in a single direction occurs for approximately 40% of the time, the remaining time being occupied with pauses and/or silence. Statistical analysis demonstrated that for an average voice channel usage of 40%, over 74 speech conversations could be handled using 37 full <b>Duplex</b> speech <b>circuits</b> thereby doubling potential revenue for a small capital outlay relative to a highly expensive cable. e.g. £12.5 million (£263 million as of 2014) cost of the TAT-1 cable on which TASI was implemented.|$|R
50|$|Simplex {{signaling}} (SX) is signaling {{in which}} two conductors are used for a single channel, and a center-tapped coil, or its equivalent, is used to split the signaling current equally between the two conductors. The return path for the current is through ground. It is distinct from a phantom circuit in which the return current path for power or signaling is provided through different signal conductors.SX signaling may be one-way, for intra-central-office use, or the simplex legs may be connected to form full <b>duplex</b> signaling <b>circuits</b> that function like composite (CX) signaling circuits with E&M lead control.|$|R
5000|$|The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 {{showed the}} need for direct, timely, and private {{communications}} between {{the leaders of the}} world’s two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union. A <b>duplex</b> cable <b>circuit</b> (later augmented by a satellite hookup) between the two capitals known as the Moscow-Washington hotline or [...] "Red Telephone", became operational August 30, 1963. Program management and engineering for the “Hotline” was assigned to DCA. The system continues intact today with direct links to more than 40 foreign leaders. Another direct result of the Cuban Missile Crisis was the creation of the Worldwide Military Command and Control System (WWMCCS) to enable national command authorities to exercise effective command and control of their widely dispersed forces.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the semantics {{and implementation of}} a protocol stack that gives applications access to the Quality of Service guarantees available at the ATM level (a native-mode ATM protocol stack). The stack was designed using three principles: minimal functionality in the critical path, no logical multiplexing, and specific targeting to ATM. It allows applications to establish simplex or <b>duplex</b> virtual <b>circuits</b> with error control, leaky-bucket or feedback flow control and arbitrary size messages. In addition, a signaling component provides connection and Quality of Service management. The stack has been implemented in a simulator and two networks of Personal Computers interconnected respectively with Ethernet and ATM adaptors. We discuss our experiences with developing and porting the stack, and show how our design principles lead to rapid deployment {{as well as a}} small protocol overhead...|$|R
