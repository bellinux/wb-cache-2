Pace University subsequently operated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> its Pleasantville campus from 1977 to 2015.

He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–1890 season.

5|$|Following the forfeiture, most of Garmoran {{remained}} with the Scottish crown until 1469, when James III granted Lairdship {{of it to}} John of Ross, the new MacDonald leader, who passed it to his own half-brother, Hugh of Sleat. Clan Ranald objected to the transfer to Hugh, and appear to have retained some level of physical posession, {{regardless of whether they}} any legal authority to do so. The status of Rùm during this period is unclear, as surviving records do not mention <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Hugh's possessions.|$|E
5|$|In 1900, William Barber's {{successor}} {{as chief}} engraver, his son Charles E. Barber, slightly adjusted the design; other modifications to U.S. coins {{about that time}} suggest that he most likely did <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a plan to re-engrave all denominations. The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing {{the back of the}} eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Exorcist was re-released in a 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback, hardcover, and {{audiobook}} formats {{with new}} cover artwork.

The 40th Anniversary Edition of The Exorcist {{will have a}} touch of new material in <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> an all-around polish of the dialogue and prose. First time around I never had the time (meaning the funds) to do a second draft, and this, finally, is it. With forty years to think about it, a few little changes were inevitable – plus one new character in a totally new very spooky scene. This is the version I {{would like to be}} remembered for. Tor/Forge have also re-published The Ninth Configuration and Legion, with new, updated cover artwork.|$|E

5|$|In December 2015, Liam Lotter found a grey {{piece of}} debris {{on a beach}} in {{southern}} Mozambique, but only after he read in March 2016 about Gibson's find (some 300 kilometres from his find) did his family alert authorities. It was flown to Australia for analysis. It carried a stencilled code 676EB, which identified <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a Boeing 777 flap track fairing, and the style in which the lettering was painted onto the fairing matched stencils used by Malaysia Airlines, making it almost certain that the part came from 9M-MRO.|$|E
5|$|In early 1643, Parliament placed Newark under siege, and the {{garrison}} at Ashby {{was sent to}} relieve <b>it.</b> <b>As</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a larger force under Prince Rupert, they forced the surrender of the Parliamentary force. By late 1644, the war turned against the King, and the Parliamentary forces based at nearby Coleorton had contained {{the garrison}} in the castle. King Charles passed through the castle in May 1645 {{on his way to}} besiege Leicester, but the following month his forces were defeated at the Battle of Naseby; the King briefly stayed at the castle once again as he retreated west. By now, the Royalist cause was largely lost.|$|E
5|$|Its {{popularity}} has spread throughout Eastern Europe {{and the former}} Russian Empire, and – by way of migration – to other continents.

The acquisition program for the Leopard2E began in 1994, five years after the cancellation of the Lince tank program that culminated in an agreement to transfer 108 Leopard 2A4s to the Spanish army in 1998 and started the local production of the Leopard 2E in December 2003. Despite postponement of production owing to the 2003 merger between Santa Bárbara Sistemas and General Dynamics, and continued fabrication issues between 2006 and 2007, 219 Leopard2Es have been delivered to the Spanish army.|$|E
5|$|The {{potential}} political {{threat to}} Apollo blew over, {{due in large}} part to the support of President Lyndon B.

Kennedy in 1961, and was skilled at portraying <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Kennedy's legacy.|$|E
5|$|The text of {{the short}} work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a {{connecting}} recitative. The topic is to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.|$|E
