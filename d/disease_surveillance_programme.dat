40|$|India {{has made}} appreciable {{progress}} {{and continues to}} demonstrate a strong commitment for establishing and operating a <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme</b> responsive {{to the requirements of}} the International Health Regulations (IHR[2005]). Within five years of its launch, India has effectively used modern information and communication technology for collection, storage, transmission and management of data related to disease surveillance and effective response. Terrestrial and/or satellite based linkages are being established within all states, districts, state-run medical colleges, infectious disease hospitals, and public health laboratories. This network enables speedy data transfer, video conferencing, training and e-learning for outbreaks and programme monitoring. A 24 x 7 call centre is in operation to receive disease alerts. To complement these efforts, a media scanning and verification cell functions to receive reports of early warning signals. During the 2009 H 1 N 1 outbreak, the usefulness of the information and communication technology (ICT) network was well appreciated. India is using ICT as part of its Integrated Disease Surveillance Project (IDSP) to help overcome the challenges in further expansion in hard-to-reach populations, to increase the involvement of the private sector, and to increase the use of other modes of communication like e-mail and voicemail...|$|E
40|$|Background & objectives: India′s Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} {{programmes}} in the world in terms of quantities of vaccines administered, number of beneficiaries, number of immunization sessions, and geographical extent and diversity of areas covered. Strategic planning for the Programme requires credible information on the cost of achieving the objectives and the financial resources needed at national, State, and district levels. We present here expenditures on immunization services in India in 2012 (baseline) and projected costs for five years (2013 - 2017). Methods: Data were collected from the Immunization Division of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, and immunization partners, such as the World Health Organization and UNICEF. The cost components were immunization personnel, vaccines and injection supplies, transportation, trainings, social mobilization, advocacy and communication activities, <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance,</b> <b>Programme</b> management, maintenance of cold chain and other equipment, and capital costs. Results: Total baseline expenditure was ₹ 3, 446 crore [1 crore = 10 million] (US$ 718 million), including shared personnel costs. In 2012, the government paid for 90 per cent of the Programme. Total resource requirements for 2013 - 2017 are ₹ 34, 336 crore (US$ 5, 282 million). Allocations for vaccines increase from ₹ 511 crore in 2013 to ₹ 3, 587 crore in 2017 as new vaccines are assumed to be introduced in the Programme. Interpretation & conclusions: The projections show that the government immunization budget will be double in 2017 as compared to 2013. It will increase from ₹ 4, 570 crore in 2013 to ₹ 9, 451 crore in 2017...|$|E
40|$|Background: A {{diphtheria}} outbreak {{was identified}} from Vijayapura (formerly Bijapur) {{district in the}} South Indian state of Karnataka in 2011. There was a surge {{in the number of}} throat swab samples received under the Integrated <b>Disease</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Programme</b> (IDSP) in North Karnataka since then. Objectives: A microbiological study was undertaken to generate information on the status of resurgence of the disease in the region. Materials and Methods: Throat swabs from 432 suspected cases of diphtheria during 2012 – 2015 were obtained from government hospitals and primary health centres of 8 districts in North Karnataka and were processed for the culture and identification of Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Polymerase chain reaction for the presence of toxin gene (toxA and toxB) was carried out on the isolates. Antibiotic sensitivity tests were performed on the isolates with a panel of 14 antibiotics. Results: Thirty-eight (8. 79 %) out of 432 samples yielded C. diphtheriae on culture. All isolates possessed the diphtheria toxin gene. Out of the 38 confirmed cases, whereas 21 (55. 26 %) were between 1 and 5 years of age, 14 (36. 84 %) were aged between 5 and 10 years. Male children were three times more than females in confirmed cases. No information was available on the immunisation status of the cases. Emergence of resistance to penicillin was found with minimum inhibitory concentration reaching up to 6. 00 μg/ml. Conclusion and Discussion: Our study identified an upsurge in cases of diphtheria in North Karnataka, particularly in Vijayapura District, and {{to the best of our}} knowledge, reports the emergence of penicillin resistance for the first time in India. The study calls for enhanced surveillance for the disease, making antidiphtheritic serum available in key hospitals in the region and serves to provide a baseline for future assessment of the impact of the recently launched 'Mission Indradhanush' programme in strengthening Universal Immunisation Programme (UIP) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecurring {{epidemics}} and {{the emergence}} of new aquatic diseases are increasingly threatening the growth of aquaculture. The fast pace of aquaculture development and on-going global environmental, social and economic change are challenging epidemiologists in their capacity to surveil and control the spread of diseases and avert losses to farmers and impacts on their livelihoods and environment. By placing farmers as the starting point of <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance,</b> we contend that farmer-based syndromic <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> holds potential to overcome the current limitations of conventional <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance,</b> and demonstrate its relevance for aquaculture, particularly in resource constrained environments. Drawing on the literature on aquaculture, epidemiology, farmers' decision-making, technology adoption in animal health management and participation in animal <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance,</b> we highlight the complex interplay of behavioural (economic and social) factors behind farmers' reporting of disease. To this we add insights from institutional economics to analyse the constraints and dilemmas <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> poses to institutions. Whilst information technologies are playing a significant supporting role in <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance,</b> our central argument is that if data collection for epidemiological monitoring is about technology, surveillance itself is about people. Stakeholder involvement and perception of surveillance benefits, value of epidemiological data collected, farmers' knowledge, motivation and trust and institutions' functioning are key considerations in the design of successful syndromic <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes.</b> These human dimensions constitute important knowledge gaps in animal <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> in general, and in particular in aquaculture.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in the Greater Kruger National Park Complex (GKNP), which consists of the Kruger National Park (KNP) and adjacent private game reserves and focuses primarily on the following objectives: • To monitor and evaluate the standard of the existing disease surveillance programmes for the following diseases, Foot and Mouth, Anthrax, Tuberculosis, Brucellosis and Rabies, within the Kruger National Park and adjacent private game reserves by evaluating the level of competency and knowledge in field rangers, field guides and trails rangers with regard to these specific diseases. It can be stated that important differences exist between disease surveillance techniques used for domestic animals and those used for wildlife (Bengis, R. G., Kock, R. A., & Fischer, J., 2002). According to Morner, T., Obendorf, D. L., Artios, M., & Woodford, M. H., 2002, it is more difficult to monitor diseases in wildlife than in domestic animals because wild animals are not constrained by boundaries and can roam over large. distances. For significant diseases in wildlife, an active surveillance programme may be the preferred approach with the aim to collect a certain number of samples from a target population (live or dead animals) to determine the point prevalence of certain pathogens. Active veterinary participation is essential in protected area management, with emphasis on training of technicians, rangers and field biologists with regard to specific diseases and their clinical signs, surveillance and sampling techniques, data collection, and reporting. For the purpose of this study, data collection was conducted by means of a questionnaire drawn up according to the related critical points as described in the Dufour grid (Dufour, 1998). The results of this study clearly showed a need to address certain important aspects regarding a wildlife disease programme within the GKNP. A more efficient wildlife <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme,</b> which included more specific and “hands-on” trained staff, would definitely ensure a better early warning system which would detect new or emerging disease outbreaks.

40|$|The {{scientific}} {{connection between}} sanitation, {{water quality and}} health is well established. However, in the present Indian scenario, monitoring and governance of the three sectors is handled separately. At present, the need to integrate sanitation, water quality, and health is felt during waterborne disease outbreaks such as large-scale diarrhea, typhoid or cholera. Despite the general interest shown for a cross-sector integrated framework in outbreak control, numerous administrative and technical gaps exist preventing the implementation of this framework. This study attempts to address these implementation barriers through the analysis of governing institutions and data integration of large public databases for the selected districts of Gujarat, India. Interagency collaboration barrier is analyzed through a comprehensive institutional analysis on the water, sanitation and health monitoring sectors. The lack of administrative incentive due to the narrow definition of monitoring targets is identified as the primary barrier for collaboration. Districts that already achieved 100 % open-defecation-free status are identified as key entry points for potential pilot implementation of an integrated framework. National Informatics Center and Water and Sanitation Management Organization (WASMO) are considered key nodal points for building channels of interagency connections. Data integration and utilization barriers are analyzed through habitation-level matching of the 3 separate monitoring databases - namely, Swatch Bharat Mission (SBM) database for sanitation, Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) database for rural drinking water quality and Integrated <b>Disease</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>Programme</b> (IDSP) for outbreak data. The most critical data barrier is the discrepancy between administrative units across the databases, resulting in 25 % mismatched habitation data and variables with 30 % contradictory data entries. Quality concerns over inconsistent and missing data are also raised, especially for data collected by grassroots workers. A decision support model based on the integrated database is constructed through a Driver-Pressure- State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework. A significant correlation is observed between chains connecting sanitation initiatives and water quality. Significant risk factors associated with outbreak occurrence cannot be identified at the current stage. Even though implementing this model is within reach, and doing so promises to offer an efficient tool for integrated governance of the three sectors, incomplete datasets is currently the key barrier to a comprehensive assessment of model effectiveness. by Xiaoyuan "Charlene" Ren.

Schwartz, & G. W. Stevenson (Eds.), Diseases of swine (pp. 141 - 164). Chichester, England: Wiley-Blackwell. The New Zealand commercial pig industry is modern and highly productive. The industry is free {{from many of}} the important infectious diseases present in {{much of the rest of}} the world. However, alongside the commercial industry are a large number of non-commercial pig holdings operated with minimal attention to biosecurity. The extent to which the activities in the non-commercial sector might negatively impact the commercial sector was unknown therefore a series of projects was undertaken to explore the likelihood of an exotic disease occurring. A risk assessment was undertaken to determine the likelihood porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus would be introduced into New Zealand through imported fresh pork. The study estimated that at least 4. 3 pig herds per year were likely to become infected with PRRS and that 36 % of these incursions would spread to additional herds. It was recognized that the data describing the interactions between commercial and non-commercial pigs could be improved so a prospective study was undertaken to collect information about the movements of pigs and genetic material between farms. To assist in development of a national surveillance programme, two additional studies were then initiated. First, a study was conducted to determine the effect of blood sample mishandling on the performance of ELISA assays and second, a retrospective analysis of data from a national abattoir-based lesion recording system (PigCheck) was conducted. These studies were done with the realization that future surveillance activities would need to incorporate creative means of generating high-quality surveillance data, from various surveillance components, using both laboratory- and field-based staff. Investment Logic Mapping was then used to assist the industry in establishing a biosecurity and surveillance strategy. A single strategy ‘improve surveillance’ was identified as the key area for biosecurity investment. In response to this finding, modelling of potential surveillance activities was completed and a surveillance programme was proposed costing approximately $ 0. 50 per pig annually. The work presented in this thesis demonstrates the New Zealand pig industry is susceptible to introduction of an exotic disease and that the population of non-commercial pigs must be considered when developing biosecurity, and disease readiness or response plans for the commercial industry. The described studies show that a cost effective national <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme</b> can be implemented through use of a combination of existing and newly developed sources of surveillance information...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Patients with {{ulcerative}} colitis {{are at a}} higher risk of developing colorectal cancer than those without the <b>disease.</b> <b>Surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> are used routinely to detect dysplasia and cancer in patients with {{ulcerative colitis}}. However, such programmes are poorly effective. This article discusses possible improvements suggested by recent research. METHODS: Papers relating to cancer associated with ulcerative colitis and <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> to detect such cancer were identified using Medline searches. Further papers were identified from the reference lists of identified papers. RESULTS: The probability of cancer for all patients with ulcerative colitis regardless of disease extent was 2 per cent at 10 years, 8 per cent at 20 years and 18 per cent at 30 years; the overall prevalence of colorectal cancer in any patient was 3. 7 per cent. Indications for colonoscopic <b>surveillance</b> are extensive <b>disease</b> for 8 - 10 years, especially in those with active inflammation, a family history of colorectal cancer and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Problems affecting surveillance include the diagnosis of dysplasia, difficulty in differentiating 'sporadic' adenomas from a dysplasia-associated lesion or mass, and decision making based on surveillance findings. Molecular genetic and endoscopic advances to alleviate these problems are discussed. CONCLUSION: Rates of detection of dysplasia can be improved by chromoendoscopy.

40|$|Anthrax is endemic in Luangwa National Park and the {{adjoining}} Game Management areas. The first official {{case of the}} disease was reported in 1922 in Luambe National Park. In 1987 a large-scale anthrax epidemic ravaged almost the entire Luangwa Valley. Since then at least three epidemics of the disease have been reported. Localised sporadic cases of the disease occur almost annually. Despite the frequent epidemics little is known of anthrax {{in terms of its}} epidemiology and impact on conservation. Mortalities were not investigated as wildlife officials attributed the mortalities to natural factors, animal population densities were not estimated and a no systematic <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme</b> exists. The number of animals that have died of the disease is not known. Anthrax mortalities are estimated in thousands. For example it is estimated that 4200 hippos and 1000 other animals, including five wild dogs, succumbed to the disease in 1987. No wild dog has been reported in the area since the 1987 epidemic. The objectives of this study were: # to describe the epidemiology and the socio-economic impact of anthrax in the Luangwa Valley; # to examine the control measures adopted when epidemics occur; # to suggest alternative methods of dealing with disease outbreaks in the light of a quantitative risk and cost benefit analyses. Data was collected from reports was undertaken at the veterinary department, the wildlife offices and the national archives. Informal discussions were held with the local community on anthrax epidemics using the rapid rural appraisal technique. Data on animal demographics and rainfall were collected from National Parks and Wildlife Service and the National Meteorological Department. Soil, faeces, and bone samples were collected where large numbers of carcasses had been found during epidemics in the Luangwa National Park. These samples were examined for viable anthrax spores by the Department of Scientific Services in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Information gleaned from official and verbal reports were collated and are presented in tabular from. The information found is inadequate to enable comprehensive quantitative risk and cost/benefit analyses. The economic cost of the disease arises mainly from the trade embargo resulting from veterinary quarantine regulations and the value of animal carcasses. Different scenarios were developed and are examined to present a risk analysis for proposed alternative control measures that could be adopted by the veterinary department when anthrax occurs in the Luangwa Valley. The probability of spreading anthrax by allowing trade in game trophies after treatment with formalin is estimated to be 0. 0003 - 0. 5. Although the impact of the disease on the economic utilisation of wild herbivores and community based natural resource management in the area has never been investigated the potential cost of anthrax epidemics is significant. The estimated cost of anthrax epidemics, depending on the size, {{as a result of the}} current disease control strategy are 124, 3 – 2079, 5 million Zambian Kwacha. The proposed alternative disease control measures could decrease the cost to 43, 5 – 852, 6 million Zambian Kwacha. It is suggested that various measures be adopted to enable a better understanding of the dynamics of anthrax in the Luangwa Valley.

40|$|Rapid {{detection}} of infectious disease outbreaks is often crucial for their effective control. One example is highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) such as H 5 N 1 in commercial poultry flocks. There are no quantitative data, however, on {{how quickly the}} effects of HPAI infection in poultry flocks can be detected. Here, we study, using an individual-based mathematical model, time to detection in chicken flocks. Detection is triggered when mortality, food or water intake or egg production in layers pass recommended thresholds suggested {{from the experience of}} past HPAI outbreaks. We suggest a new threshold for caged flocks—the cage mortality detection threshold—as a more sensitive threshold than current ones. Time to detection is shown to depend nonlinearly on R 0 and is particularly sensitive for R 0 < 10. It also depends logarithmically on flock size and number of birds per cage. We also examine how many false alarms occur in uninfected flocks when we vary detection thresholds owing to background mortality. The false alarm rate is shown to be sensitive to detection thresholds, dependent on flock size and background mortality and independent of the length of the production cycle. We suggest that current detection thresholds appear sufficient to rapidly detect the effects of a high R 0 HPAI strain such as H 7 N 7 over a wide range of flock sizes. Time to {{detection of}} the effects of a low R 0 HPAI strain such as H 5 N 1 can be significantly improved, particularly for large flocks, by lowering detection thresholds, and this can be accomplished without causing excessive false alarms in uninfected flocks.

40|$|Most Pacific Island {{countries}} and territories (PICTs) have developing economies and face a critical shortage of veterinarians with limited financial resources allocated to their animal <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes.</b> Thus, animal health authorities have to set priorities for better focusing their scarce resources. The main objective {{of this study was}} to identify animal diseases perceived to be of importance by decision makers within selected PICTs, at the regional and national levels, to ensure better targeting of animal health resources. A second objective was to investigate whether the targeted <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> resulting from this rationalized approach would also benefit the local communities engaged in livestock production. A multi-criteria prioritization process was developed, involving local experts, to score and rank 132 animal diseases based on their priority at the regional and national levels for four PICTs: Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu, which form part of a regional Food Animal Biosecurity Network. In parallel interviews with farmers and field animal health and production workers were conducted to assess their perception of animal diseases. The list of the top-twenty ranked diseases for the Pacific Islands region shows a mix of endemic zoonotic diseases (such as leptospirosis ranked first; brucellosis third; tuberculosis sixth; and endoparasites and ectoparasites, respectively eleventh and thirteenth) with exotic diseases (such as HPAI ranked second, FMD fifth, and rabies ninth). There were different disease ranking lists for each of the four targeted PICTs, confirming different strategies of disease prevention and control may be required for each country, rather than a regional approach. Interviewed animal health and production workers were unfamiliar with most of the prioritized diseases and a majority acknowledged that they would not be able to recognize clinical signs if outbreaks were to occur in their area. Leptospirosis, which is endemic and identified as the top priority disease at the regional level, was never mentioned by any interviewed farmer. Farmers did not name any emerging infectious diseases as priorities. Instead, they identified endemic diseases (parasites, flu, coccidiosis, and scabies) as the most important. While animal disease priorities appear to differ widely between the targeted regions and countries, it also varies significantly between experts and farmers. Better targeted <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> may thus result in more rational and transparent allocation of resources, and thus enhanced food security, but may not directly match the needs of the local communities.

40|$|Background Oral {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the 15 th most common cancer worldwide but has poor five year survival (50 %). Late stage presentation and limitations of early diagnostic techniques are persistent clinical problems. Sixty percent of patients present with advanced stage disease and with the attendant increase in mortality, morbidity and risk of recurrent disease it is particularly burdensome for both patients and health economies. Early {{diagnosis and treatment of}} OSCC improves prognosis. There is an opportunity to diagnose OSCC early in patients with oral epithelial dysplasia however currently {{there is no way of}} accurately predicting which lesions will undergo malignant transformation. Aberrant methylation of tumour suppressor genes plays a significant role in the biology of early cancer and is detectable in both tumour and saliva. Saliva is a non-invasive method of longitudinal sampling and has potential as a tumour surrogate in <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes.</b> This study aims to compare rates of methylation of a panel of genes in OSCC patients and a normal cohort to establish a threshold by which we could determine future disease testing in a dysplastic population. Methods Saliva samples were collected from 219 individuals from three diagnostic groups: Normal (defined as no oral malignant or premalignant disease) n= 97, OSCC n= 62 and dysplasia n= 60. For statistical analysis the dysplasia cohort was sub-divided into lesions of low and high risk of malignant transformation based on the histological diagnosis of the index lesion. DNA was extracted and bisulphite treated from 258 saliva samples before duplex quantitative methylation specific PCR (qMSP) assays were performed on all samples to detect the frequency of methylation in saliva of a panel of genes. The five target genes (ADAMTS 9, CCNA 1, CYGB, P 16, TMEFF 2) were selected using a candidate approach on the basis of tumour specificity from studies on tumour/normal matched tissue pairs. Clinicopathological data was correlated with the qMSP data and analysed using SPSS v. 21 statistical software to look for associations with tumour and survival characteristics. Results Only 3 / 97 individuals from the control normal cohort had saliva samples with detectable methylation above the analytical sensitivity of the P 16 assay. Methylation of the remaining target genes (ADAMTS 9, CCNA 1, CYGB, TMEFF 2) was not detected in normal saliva at levels above the analytical sensitivity of the qMSP assays. The most significant finding in this study was that methylation of four of the target genes (CCNA 1, CYGB, P 16, TMEFF 2) in saliva, individually and when considered as a panel, was significantly associated with OSCC and as such could aid discrimination between malignant disease and normal saliva samples. Methylation of at least one gene in the panel was discovered in 29 / 67 of the binned OSCC saliva samples but only 3 / 97 of normal samples (Fisher’s exact p= 0. 001). Furthermore methylation of the gene panel is associated with high risk lesions when detected in saliva of patients with premalignant lesions (Fisher’s exact p= 0. 03). Conclusions This exploratory data supports the utility of duplex qMSP as a detection method for methylation markers in saliva. The detection of methylation of this gene panel in saliva is significantly more associated with oral malignancy and high risk premalignant lesions than normal and low risk disease. This implies saliva may have merit as a surrogate tissue in an adjunctive role to clinical assessment and biopsy. The assays are specific but have limited sensitivity. However with further work, inclusive of additional genes, this methodology may identify predictive biomarkers that can be introduced into a trial surveillance of premalignant lesions...|$|R

To reduce the burden of GI <b>diseases,</b> <b>surveillance</b> is recommended for some diseases, including for patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, Barrett's oesophagus, precancerous gastric lesions, colorectal adenoma, and pancreatic neoplasms. This review aims to provide an overview of the evidence on cost-effectiveness of surveillance of individuals with GI conditions predisposing them to cancer, specifically focussing on the aforementioned conditions. We searched the literature and reviewed 21 studies. Despite heterogeneity of studies in terms of settings, study populations, surveillance strategies and outcomes, most reviewed studies suggested at least some surveillance of patients with these GI conditions to be cost-effective. For some high-risk conditions frequent surveillance with 3 -month intervals was warranted, while for other conditions, surveillance may only be cost-effective every 10 years. Further studies based on more robust effectiveness evidence are needed to inform and optimise <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> for GI cancers...|$|R

40|$|Capture-recapture (CR) {{methods are}} used to study populations that are {{monitored}} with imperfect observation processes. They have recently been applied to the monitoring of animal diseases to evaluate the number of infected units that remain undetected by the surveillance system. This paper proposes three Bayesian models to estimate {{the total number of}} scrapie-infected holdings in France from CR count data obtained from the French classical scrapie <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme.</b> We fitted two zero-truncated Poisson (ZTP) models (with and without holding size as a covariate) and a zero-truncated negative binomial (ZTNB) model to the 2006 national surveillance count dataset. We detected a large amount of heterogeneity in the count data, making the use of the simple ZTP model inappropriate. However, including holding size as a covariate did not bring any significant improvement over the simple ZTP model. The ZTNB model proved to be the best model, giving an estimation of 535 (CI 95 % 401 - 796) infected and detectable sheep holdings in 2006, although only 141 were effectively detected, resulting in a holding-level prevalence of 4. 4 ‰(CI 95 % 3. 2 – 6. 3) and a sensitivity of holding-level surveillance of 26 % (CI 95 % 18 - 35). The main limitation {{of the present study was}} the small amount of data collected during the <b>surveillance</b> <b>programme.</b> It was therefore not possible to build complex models that would allow depicting more accurately the epidemiological and detection processes that generate the surveillance data.

Because the response of a health system in one country could have a direct and immediate impact on a neighboring country, or even continent, NTI developed projects that foster cooperation among public health officials across political and geographic boundaries. In 2003, NTI created the Middle East Consortium for Infectious <b>Disease</b> <b>Surveillance</b> (MECIDS) with participation from Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority. Despite tensions in the region, MECIDS continues to share official health data and conduct infectious disease prevention training. NTI also created and nurtured Connecting Organizations for <b>Disease</b> <b>Surveillance</b> (CORDS), which in 2013 launched as independent NGO that links international <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> networks.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Prospective {{national}} {{screening and}} <b>surveillance</b> <b>programmes</b> serve {{a range of}} public health functions. Objectively determining their adequacy and impact on disease may be problematic for rare disorders. We undertook to assess whether objective measures of <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> intensity could be developed for the rare disorder sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and whether such measures correlate with disease incidence. METHOD: From 10 countries with national human prion <b>disease</b> <b>surveillance</b> centres, the annual number of suspected prion disease cases notified to each national unit (n= 17 610), referrals for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 14 - 3 - 3 protein diagnostic testing (n= 28 780) {{and the number of}} suspect cases undergoing diagnostic neuropathological examination (n= 4885) from 1993 to 2006 were collected. Age and survey year adjusted incidence rate ratios with 95 % CIs were estimated using Poisson regression models to assess risk factors for sporadic, non-sporadic and all prion disease cases. RESULTS: Age and survey year adjusted analysis showed all three surveillance intensity measures (suspected human prion disease notifications, 14 - 3 - 3 protein diagnostic test referrals and neuropathological examinations of suspect cases) significantly predicted the incidence of sporadic CJD, non-sporadic CJD and all prion disease. CONCLUSIONS: Routine national surveillance methods adjusted as population rates allow objective determination of surveillance intensity, which correlates positively with reported incidence for human prion disease, especially sporadic CJD, largely independent of national context. The predictive relationship between <b>surveillance</b> intensity and <b>disease</b> incidence should facilitate more rapid delineation of aberrations in disease occurrence and assessment of the adequacy of disease monitoring by national registries...|$|R
