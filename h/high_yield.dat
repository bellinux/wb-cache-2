5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{the absence of}} an active <b>high</b> <b>yield</b> market {{prompted}} KKR to change its tactics, avoiding large leveraged buyouts in favor of industry consolidations through what were described as leveraged buildups or rollups. One of KKR's largest investments in the 1990s was the leveraged buildup of Primedia in partnership with former executives of Macmillan Publishing, which KKR had failed to acquire in 1988. KKR created Primedia's predecessor, K-III Communications, a platform to buy media properties, initially completing the $310 million divisional buyout of the book club division of Macmillan along with the assets of Intertec Publishing Corporation in May 1989.|$|E
5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern {{to appear in the}} leaves. The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a <b>high</b> <b>yield,</b> making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E

These demonstrated a number of previously unknown or underestimated effects, notably that nuclear fireballs grew to very large size and caused all of the air in or immediately below the fireball to become opaque to radar signals, an effect that became known as nuclear blackout. This was extremely worrying for any system like Zeus, which {{would not be able to}} track warheads in or behind such a fireball, including those of the Zeus' own warheads.|$|E
5|$|Short {{proteins}} {{can also}} be synthesized chemically by a family of methods known as peptide synthesis, which rely on organic synthesis techniques such as chemical ligation to produce peptides in <b>high</b> <b>yield.</b> Chemical synthesis allows for the introduction of non-natural amino acids into polypeptide chains, such as attachment of fluorescent probes to amino acid side chains. These methods are useful in laboratory biochemistry and cell biology, though generally not for commercial applications. Chemical synthesis is inefficient for polypeptides longer than about 300 amino acids, and the synthesized proteins may not readily assume their native tertiary structure. Most chemical synthesis methods proceed from C-terminus to N-terminus, opposite the biological reaction.|$|E
5|$|The buyout of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did not complete a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would not complete another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the <b>high</b> <b>yield</b> bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E

5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very <b>high</b> <b>yield,</b> which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very high beam density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E
