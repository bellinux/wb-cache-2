5|$|They {{concluded}} that the 'Greek lands' are located in a privileged <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> {{at the crossroads of}} three continents: Europe, Asia and Africa, however, as the Ottoman administration was incapable of reinforcing the rule of law, economic activity couldn't flourish. Thus, they addressed the political and economic instability of the Ottoman Empire that struggled to maintain control over different ethnicities and huge territories. As a consequence of that lack of control, many Greeks were impelled to seek protection outside the Ottoman Empire, while the ones that had not abandoned their lands, suffered under a terrible Ottoman regime, and had no educational rights.|$|E
5|$|Thunderstorms {{can form}} and develop in any <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> but most {{frequently}} within the mid-latitude, where warm, moist air from tropical latitudes collides with cooler air from polar latitudes.

Damage that results from thunderstorms is mainly inflicted by downburst winds, large hailstones, and flash flooding caused by heavy precipitation.

5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy return on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of the system.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{questions}} considered by the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta was the choice of provincial capital. The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital, {{but there was a}} movement to make Calgary the permanent choice. This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works William Henry Cushing, Cross's cabinet colleague, who argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital. Cross countered that Edmonton's history as capital of the Canadian fur trade and its <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim. Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8. It would not be the last issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed.|$|E

With over 40 million cubic yards of foundation excavation and 110 million cubic yards of embankment construction, {{the construction of the}} dams was the largest earthworks project in the United States. The shovels, loaders and trucks used on the project were the largest available and established a new standard for earth and rock movement. The two rock processing plants established for the project provided combined production exceeding the capability of any single commercial processing operation in California. Construction of the lake was the largest construction project by the MWD since building the Colorado River Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|Pluralists use {{the term}} Crusade of any {{campaign}} explicitly sanctioned by the reigning Pope.

5|$|The {{different}} species of Eucteniza are distinguished by differences in body size, limb proportions, number of tibial spines, and shape of female sperm receptacles, as well as <b>geographic</b> <b>location.</b> Most species are known from male specimens only, but E. rosalia and E. panchovillai are known only from female specimens. Eucteniza species are distributed throughout central and northern Mexico, much of Texas, and {{the lower part of}} the Baja Peninsula. Many species are only known from the type locality, the site where the type specimen or specimens were originally collected. The species with the largest range is E. relata, although Bond and Godwin assert the species is actually composed of multiple as-yet-unnamed cryptic species (distinct species erroneously grouped into one) that will require additional morphological or genetic research to distinguish.|$|E

Large massifs are located {{on either side of the}} valley, called the North and South massifs, respective to their <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> in relation to each other. The height of these massifs give the valley a depth greater than that of the Grand Canyon in the United States. Along the South Massif lies Bear Mountain, named after a mountain of the same name near Harrison Schmitt's hometown of Silver City, New Mexico. The sculptured hills and East massif make up the east edge of the valley and to the west, a scarp cuts across the valley floor and rises about two kilometres (1.2 miles) above it. The North and South massifs funnel into the main outlet of the valley into Mare Serenitatis, partially blocked by Family mountain.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of the city, {{with respect}} to the {{principal}} storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of Hurricane Isabel in 2003. Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. Spanish moss, for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at First Landing State Park, and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like Sabal palmetto, Pindo Palm, Windmill Palm, Hardy Citrus, and Oleander are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from being}} a close {{relative}} to the red rail, the relationships of the Rodrigues rail are uncertain and the two are commonly listed as separate genera, Aphanapteryx and Erythromachus, but have sometimes been united as species of Aphanapteryx. Günther and E. Newton first generically synonymised the two in 1879 because of their skeletal similarities. In 1945, the French palaeontologist Jean Piveteau found skull features of the two species different enough for generic separation, and in 1977, the American ornithologist Storrs L. Olson stated that though the two species were similar and derived from the same stock, they had also diverged considerably, and should possibly be kept separate. Based on <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> and the morphology of the nasal bones, Olson suggested that they {{were related to the}} genera Gallirallus, Dryolimnas, Atlantisia, and Rallus. Mourer-Chauviré and colleagues also considered the two as belonging to separate genera. Rails have reached many oceanic archipelagos, which has frequently led to speciation and evolution of flightlessness. According to the British researchers Anthony S. Cheke and Julian P. Hume, the fact that the red rail lost much of its feather structure indicates it was isolated for a long time. These rails may be of Asian origin, like many other Mascarene birds.|$|E
5|$|In Greek historiography, Herodotus (484–425 BC) {{had written}} brief {{descriptions}} of ancient Ethiopians, {{who were also}} mentioned in the New Testament. Although the Byzantine Empire maintained regular relations with Ethiopia during the Early Middle Ages, the Early Muslim conquests of the 7th century severed the connection between Ethiopia {{and the rest of}} Christendom. Records of these contacts encouraged medieval Europeans to discover if Ethiopia was still Christian or had converted to Islam, an idea bolstered by the presence of Ethiopian pilgrims in the Holy Land and Jerusalem during the Crusades. During the High Middle Ages, the Mongol conquests of Genghis Khan (r. 1206–1227) led Europeans to speculate about the existence of a priestly, legendary warrior king named Prester John, who was thought to inhabit distant lands in Asia associated with Nestorian Christians and might help to defeat rival Islamic powers. The travel literature of Marco Polo and Odoric of Pordenone regarding their separate journeys to Yuan-dynasty China during the 13th and 14th centuries, respectively, and fruitless searches in southern India, helped to dispel the notion that Prester John's kingdom existed in Asia. An Ethiopian diplomatic mission sent to Christian Europe by Ethiopian emperor Wedem Arad (r. 1299–1314) in 1306 allowed the chance for the priest and cartographer Giovanni da Carignano (1250–1329) to question the embassy as they stayed in Genoa, after which he published a work describing the <b>geographic</b> <b>location</b> of their kingdom and the nature of their Christian faith.|$|E
