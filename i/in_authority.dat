40|$|We {{explored}} the moderating role of trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> {{the positive effect of}} procedural {{fairness of the}} tax office on voluntary compliance with tax authorities. Building on fairness heuristic theory, we predicted that particularly low trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> makes people carefully attend to the fairness with which the tax office enacts procedures. This should result in positive procedural fairness effects on endorsement of norms prescribing taxpaying and, consequently, in voluntary tax compliance, particularly among citizens with low trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities.</b> Results from an experiment and a field study revealed converging support for these predictions. We conclude that high trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> forms an important boundary condition to the effectiveness of procedural fairness as a tool to enhance tax compliance.

30|$|High trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> reduces {{perceived}} risk (and {{may even}} lead occupants to underestimate a hazard in unprotected areas), whereas low trust (or distrust) increases perceived risk (Wachinger et al. 2012). The authors further note that trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> {{can be understood}} as a heuristic supporting decision-making in complex situations and when facing unknown or ambiguous threats. Trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities,</b> similar to credibility of information (see above), may also mediate the path between perceived risk and protective actions. Furthermore the authors hypothesize that damaging trust may increase perceived risk (Wachinger et al. 2012). Another hypothetical scenario study found a correlation between the degree of trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> and hazard appraisals for certain technological risks (Siegrist and Cvetkovich 2000). As most of the research on trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> and RP focusses on evacuation from natural disasters, further research with regard to fire evacuation is necessary.|$|R

The funeral ale {{was a way of}} socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance.

5|$|By 1858, Malo-Galipeau {{had become}} widely {{recognised}} as foundress of the Misericordia Sisters, {{partly due to}} her role as Mother Superior and {{partly due to the}} endowment she had brought to the community upon her arrival. This understanding was reflected in published works of the time, including a souvenir album prepared by the City of Montreal in 1853. However, during Bourget's visit to the Institute in late 1858, he made a speech to the assembled community confirming that in the eyes of himself and of the Church, Cadron-Jetté should receive credit as the foundress of the congregation. He also bestowed upon Cadron-Jetté the title of Mother (such that her religious name became Mother Mary of the Nativity, or Mère de la Nativité) and confirmed that she was second <b>in</b> <b>authority</b> only to the current Mother Superior of the community.|$|E
5|$|Further {{social changes}} {{brought about by}} the {{presence}} of American military personnel were exemplified in the storm's wake. The use of currency as a means for obtaining goods was first seen in Ulithi in 1956, four years before the typhoon. However, despite the total destruction of markets by Ophelia they were quickly rebuilt, depicting the quick entrenchment of currency in native culture. The reconstruction also accelerated a desire for new goods from trading. Store owners requested a wider range of material to have in stock than seen previously. From a societal standpoint, Ophelia prompted great advances in the Ulithian culture. Women, previously limited to agriculture, housework, and eventually shopping, were found to be doing heavy work (i.e. carpentry, chopping, digging, and lifting) in the immediate wake of the typhoon. A shift in government took place as well, with authority of King Malefich waning to greater power among younger individuals. Malefich also displayed great ineptitude during the storm and was subsequently disposed of as King following Ophelia's passage. The changes <b>in</b> <b>authority</b> occurred due to spontaneous leadership during the storm by the younger persons in order to protect others. Prior to the typhoon, younger members of tribes never spoke during council meetings; however, by 1961 they made their presence known in such meetings.|$|E
5|$|Ophelia devastated much of Ulithi {{during its}} passage, {{damaging}} or destroying most structures and killing two people. Agriculture across {{the area was}} decimated and geographic changes to coastlines were noted. In Ophelia's wake, dramatic societal changes in the Ulithian culture arose. Traditional values were abandoned {{in favor of more}} western ones, with younger individuals attaining a notable increase in power. The local King was disposed of shortly after the storm and a total change <b>in</b> <b>authority</b> took place. In addition to the severe impact in Ulithi, the typhoon was blamed for the deaths of five fishermen when their vessel collided with a coral reef. The name Ophelia was later retired, though unusually its removal was due to its meteorological significance due to its long track and prolonged time as a significant typhoon rather than for loss of life or damage.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance within a controlled laboratory setting. Embedded in two hypothetical tax systems with high and low power of authorities respectively, we gradually increase trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities</b> <b>in</b> form of tax knowledge about public expenditures and by allowing taxpayers to decide on what public goods they want their tax dollars to be spend for. To clearly disentangle any effects from factors that are known to influence tax compliance from previous studies, we control for tax commitment, risk attitude, income and effort exerted to earn the income which the taxpayers report truthfully or underreport to the tax authority. Non-parametric statistical analyses as well as multivariate regressions provide clear evidence that tax compliance is higher in tax systems with low power of authorities when providing complete transparency on public expenditures and when taxpayers are given the possibility {{to decide on the}} use of their taxes. With a powerful tax <b>authority</b> <b>in</b> place which is reflected in high audit rates, compliance does not change when increasing trust <b>in</b> <b>authorities.</b> Our results have important policy implications as the mere hypothetical possibility to express preferences on budget spending influences tax compliance...|$|R

5|$|The economic, {{social and}} {{cultural}} dislocation of ordinary people, the economic hardship of an economy in transition, and the pressures of meteorological disasters all contributed to growing problems in Central Europe. The failure {{of most of the}} governments to deal with the food crisis of the mid-1840s, caused by the potato blight (related to the Great Irish Famine) and several seasons of bad weather, encouraged many to think that the rich and powerful had no interest in their problems. Those <b>in</b> <b>authority</b> were concerned about the growing unrest, political and social agitation among the working classes, and the disaffection of the intelligentsia.
