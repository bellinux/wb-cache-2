5|$|The {{importance}} of another key social fact: the culture. Groups, when interacting, {{create their own}} culture and attach powerful <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> it. He {{was one of the}} first scholars to consider the question of culture so intensely. Durkheim was interested in cultural diversity, and how the existence of diversity nonetheless fails to destroy a society. To that, Durkheim answered that any apparent cultural diversity is overridden by a larger, common, and more generalized cultural system, and the law.|$|E
5|$|Carey's fifth studio album Butterfly, and the {{compilation}} album, #1's, {{were both}} certified five-times Platinum in the US; the latter remains the best-selling album in Japan by a non-Asian artist, selling 3.25 million copies. Rainbow (1999), Carey's sixth studio effort, received triple platinum certification from RIAA. But {{it was her}} first album since <b>Emotions</b> <b>to</b> not reach {{number one in the}} US. Carey parted from Columbia/Sony Music in 2001 and signed a contract with EMI's Virgin Records worth a reported US$100 million, the largest record contract ever signed. She released her next album, Glitter, which was the soundtrack to the film of same name. The album suffered from poor publicity and became a commercial failure.|$|E

5|$|Emotions are {{generally}} defined as two-step multicomponent processes involving elicitation, followed by psychological feelings, appraisal, expression, autonomic responses, and action tendencies. Attempts to localize basic <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> certain brain regions have been controversial, with some research finding {{no evidence for}} specific locations corresponding to emotions, and instead circuitry involved in general emotional processes. The amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, mid and anterior insula cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex, appeared {{to be involved in}} generating the emotions, while weaker evidence was found for the ventral tegmental area, ventral pallidum and nucleus accumbens in incentive salience. Others, however, have found evidence of activation of specific regions, such as the basal ganglia in happiness, the subcallosal cingulate cortex in sadness, and amygdala in fear.|$|E
5|$|The medieval {{doctrine}} of divine simplicity also poses problems for religious language. This suggests that God has no accidental properties– these are properties that a being can have {{which do not}} contribute to its essence. If God has no accidental properties, he cannot be as he is traditionally conceived, because properties such as goodness are accidental. If divine simplicity is accepted, then to describe God as good would entail that goodness and God have the same definition. Such limits can also be problematic to religious believers; for example, the Bible regularly ascribes different <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> God, ascriptions which would be implausible according to the {{doctrine of}} divine simplicity.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Karman, {{both men}} were PKI members and intent on making him join the party. They gave him {{communist}} pamphlets and indoctrinated him in Party philosophy. When Karman was late in telling Rifah his feelings, losing her to another man, the PKI manipulated his <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> make him leave Islam and hate Haji Bakir. Ultimately this was successful: Karman abandoned his mandatory prayers and began to espouse the Party's politics. After Karman was refused marriage to Rifah a second time, following her husband's death, he had Haji Bakir imprisoned. In this time Karman married Marni, intending to convert her family to communism.|$|E

5|$|Camille and {{executive}} producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner eventually convinced Cosby that the series should feature {{a family that}} resembled their own more closely, specifically one headed {{by a pair of}} successful parents with white-collar professions. Thus, Cosby relented and re-wrote Clair and Cliff into a lawyer and doctor, respectively. The idea of Clair being Dominican was abandoned before the pilot was filmed. However, the character still speaks some Spanish in the first episode and continues to speak the language periodically throughout the series, albeit not as frequently as Cosby had originally intended. Cosby borrowed several names from his real-life family for his fictional one; Clair's maiden name is Hanks, which she shares with Camille. The second season explores each character gaining more responsibility, none more-so than Clair, who is deliberately provided with more storylines to experience and new <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> expess in terms of her relationship with her husband and children.|$|E
5|$|Vaseegaran prepares Chitti for an {{evaluation}} by the Artificial Intelligence Research and Development (AIRD) Institute, which {{is headed by}} Bohra. During the evaluation, Chitti attempts to stab Vaseegaran at Bohra's command, which convinces the evaluation committee that the robot is a liability and cannot be used for military purposes. Vaseegaran's effort to prove Bohra wrong fails when he deploys Chitti to rescue people from a burning building. The robot saves most of them, including a girl named Selvi who was bathing at the time, but she is ashamed at being seen naked on camera and flees, only to be hit and killed by a truck. Vaseegaran asks for one month to modify Chitti's neural schema to enable it to understand human behaviour and <b>emotions,</b> <b>to</b> which Bohra agrees. While nearing the deadline, Chitti becomes angry with Vaseegaran, demonstrating to him that it can manifest emotions.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would not like to be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

50|$|Dr. W. Gerrod Parrott is a Professor of Psychology at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. His {{focus is}} on human {{emotions}} and how they affect thought processes. In his paper Positioning and the Emotions, he discusses the concept of counter-argument, in which a communicator projects an <b>emotion</b> <b>to</b> a receiver {{in an attempt to}} elicit a specific emotion, but the receiver instead projects a different <b>emotion</b> <b>to</b> deflect or disrupt the original intentions of the communicator. Oculesics can play a major part in these emotional projection strategies.|$|R
25|$|He {{recognised}} no activity without motion, and so referred {{all activities}} of the soul to motion: the desires and <b>emotions</b> <b>to</b> corporeal motion, judgment (kriseis) and contemplation to spiritual motion. The idea of a spirit entirely independent of organic activity, must therefore have appeared to him very doubtful; yet {{he appears to have}} contented himself with developing his doubts and difficulties on the point, without positively rejecting it. Other Peripatetics, like Dicaearchus, Aristoxenus, and especially Strato, developed further this naturalism in Aristotelian doctrine.|$|E
