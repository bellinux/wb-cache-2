5|$|A common belief {{regarding}} self-harm {{is that it}} is an attention-seeking behaviour; however, in many cases, this is inaccurate. Many self-harmers {{are very}} self-conscious of their wounds and scars and feel <b>guilty</b> <b>about</b> their behaviour, leading them to {{go to great lengths to}} conceal their behaviour from others. They may offer alternative explanations for their injuries, or conceal their scars with clothing. Self-harm in such individuals may not be associated with suicidal or para-suicidal behaviour. People who self-harm are not usually seeking to end their own life; it has been suggested instead that they are using self-harm as a coping mechanism to relieve emotional pain or discomfort or as an attempt to communicate distress. Alternatively, interpretations based on the supposed lethality of a self-harm may not give clear indications as to its intent: life risking behaviour may have no suicidal intent, whilst seemingly superficial cuts may have been a suicide attempt.|$|E
