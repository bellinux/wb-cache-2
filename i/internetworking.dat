25|$|The {{internet}} layer has {{the responsibility}} of sending packets across potentially multiple networks. <b>Internetworking</b> requires sending data from the source network to the destination network. This process is called routing.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{protocols}} carried by IP, such as ICMP {{which is used}} to transmit diagnostic information, and IGMP {{which is used to}} manage IP Multicast data, are layered on top of IP but perform <b>internetworking</b> functions. This illustrates the differences in the architecture of the TCP/IP stack of the Internet and the OSI model. The TCP/IP model's internet layer corresponds to layer three of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, where it {{is referred to as the}} network layer.|$|E
25|$|The Internet {{protocol}} suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received. This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers which classify all related protocols {{according to the}} scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing <b>internetworking</b> between independent networks; the transport layer handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, which provides process-to-process data exchange for applications.|$|E
25|$|IPv6 is not {{directly}} interoperable by design with IPv4. In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet {{not directly}} accessible with IPv4 software. Thus, translation facilities must exist for <b>internetworking</b> or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks. Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol. Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development. Aside from the complex array of physical connections that make up its infrastructure, the Internet is facilitated by bi- or multi-lateral commercial contracts, e.g., peering agreements, and by technical specifications or protocols that describe the exchange of data over the network. Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies.|$|E
25|$|When {{the term}} Internet {{is used to}} refer to the {{specific}} global system of interconnected Internet Protocol (IP) networks, the word is a proper noun that should be written with an initial capital letter. In common use and the media, it is often erroneously not capitalized, viz. the internet. Some guides specify that the word should be capitalized when used as a noun, but not capitalized when used as an adjective. The Internet is also {{often referred to as the}} Net, as a short form of network. Historically, as early as 1849, the word internetted was used uncapitalized as an adjective, meaning interconnected or interwoven. The designers of early computer networks used internet both as a noun and as a verb in shorthand form of internetwork or <b>internetworking,</b> meaning interconnecting computer networks.|$|E
25|$|The {{internet}} layer {{provides an}} unreliable datagram transmission facility between hosts located on potentially different IP networks by forwarding the transport layer datagrams to an appropriate next-hop router for further relaying to its destination. With this functionality, the internet layer makes possible <b>internetworking,</b> the interworking of different IP networks, and it essentially establishes the Internet. The Internet Protocol {{is the principal}} component of the internet layer, and it defines two addressing systems to identify network hosts' computers, and to locate them on the network. The original address system of the ARPANET and its successor, the Internet, is Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). It uses a 32-bit IP address and is therefore capable of identifying approximately four billion hosts. This limitation was eliminated in 1998 by the standardization of Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) which uses 128-bit addresses. IPv6 production implementations emerged in approximately 2006.|$|E

2500|$|On 23 February 2008 JAXA {{launched}} the Wideband <b>InterNetworking</b> engineering test and Demonstration Satellite (WINDS), also called [...] "KIZUNA." [...] WINDS will facilitate experiments with faster internet connections. The launch, using H-IIA launch vehicle 14, took place from the Tanegashima Space Center.|$|E
2500|$|The {{internet}} layer has {{the task}} of exchanging datagrams across network boundaries. It provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) of the underlying network connections. [...] It is therefore {{also referred to as}} the layer that establishes <b>internetworking,</b> indeed, it defines and establishes the Internet. This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which defines IP addresses. Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next IP router that has the connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.|$|E
2500|$|The {{design of}} the network {{included}} the recognition that it should provide only the functions of efficiently transmitting and routing traffic between end nodes and that all other intelligence should be located {{at the edge of}} the network, in the end nodes. This design is known as the end-to-end principle. Using this design, it became possible to connect almost any network to the ARPANET, irrespective of the local characteristics, thereby solving Kahn's initial <b>internetworking</b> problem. One popular expression is that TCP/IP, the eventual product of Cerf and Kahn's work, can run over [...] "two tin cans and a string." [...] Years later, as a joke, the IP over Avian Carriers formal protocol specification was created and successfully tested.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{international}} collaborations on the ARPANET were rare. European developers {{were concerned}} with developing the X.25 networks. Notable exceptions were the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) in June 1973, followed in 1973 by Sweden with satellite links to the Tanum Earth Station and Peter T. Kirstein's research group in the United Kingdom, initially at the Institute of Computer Science, University of London and later at University College London. In December 1974, RFC 675 (Specification of Internet Transmission Control Program), by Vinton Cerf, Yogen Dalal, and Carl Sunshine, used the term internet as a shorthand for <b>internetworking</b> and later RFCs repeated this use. [...] Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). [...] In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks.|$|E
2500|$|Even {{when the}} layers are examined, the {{assorted}} architectural documents—there {{is no single}} architectural model such as ISO 7498, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model—have fewer and less rigidly defined layers than the OSI model, and thus provide an easier fit for real-world protocols. One frequently referenced document, RFC 1958, does not contain a stack of layers. The lack of emphasis on layering is a major difference between the IETF and OSI approaches. It only refers {{to the existence of}} the <b>internetworking</b> layer and generally to upper layers; this document was intended as a 1996 snapshot of the architecture: [...] "The Internet and its architecture have grown in evolutionary fashion from modest beginnings, rather than from a Grand Plan. While this process of evolution {{is one of the main}} reasons for the technology's success, it nevertheless seems useful to record a snapshot of the current principles of the Internet architecture." ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{component of the}} Internet model is the Internet Protocol (IP), which provides addressing systems, including IP addresses, for computers on the network. IP enables <b>internetworking</b> and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself. Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4) is the initial version used on {{the first generation of}} the Internet and is still in dominant use. It was designed to address up to ~4.3billion (109) hosts. However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global address allocation pool was exhausted. [...] A new protocol version, IPv6, was developed in the mid-1990s, which provides vastly larger addressing capabilities and more efficient routing of Internet traffic. IPv6 is currently in growing deployment around the world, since Internet address registries (RIRs) began to urge all resource managers to plan rapid adoption and conversion.|$|E
2500|$|Research into packet {{switching}} by Paul Baran and Donald Davies {{emerged in the}} early to mid-1960s, and packet switched networks such as the NPL network, ARPANET, Tymnet, the Merit Network, Telenet, and CYCLADES, were developed in the late 1960s and 1970s using a variety of protocols. The ARPANET project {{led to the development of}} protocols for <b>internetworking,</b> by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a single network of networks. ARPANET development began with two network nodes which were interconnected between the Network Measurement Center at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science directed by Leonard Kleinrock, and the NLS system at SRI International (SRI) by Douglas Engelbart in Menlo Park, California, on 29 October 1969. The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, followed by the University of Utah Graphics Department. In an early sign of future growth, fifteen sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971. These early years were documented in the 1972 film [...]|$|E
