5|$|Though no {{terrestrial}} {{birds are}} {{found on the}} atoll, Ducie Island is known for the seabirds that breed there. Birds that have been recorded nesting on the atoll include the red-billed tropicbird, red-tailed tropicbird, fairy tern, great frigatebird, bristle-thighed curlew, masked booby and red-footed booby. A number of gull species, including the sooty tern, blue noddy, brown noddy, lesser noddy and white tern, have been recorded, as have {{several members of the}} Procellariidae family: <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel,</b> Trindade petrel, Murphy's petrel and Christmas shearwater.|$|E
5|$|Edisto Beach, South Carolina {{was changed}} forever by Gracie, due to human efforts to renourish the beach after its passage. Most {{of the shell}} hash beach {{currently}} at Edisto was placed there after Gracie. In order to expand the beach, an inland marsh was excavated {{and moved to the}} shoreline. This created highly desirable beach front property which led to new development along the coast seaward of Palmetto Boulevard, but also created an environmental catastrophe along the nearby ocean floor. A species of isopod which grows in coastal estuaries, the Cyathura Polita, disappeared after the passage of this hurricane from the Ashepoo River in South Carolina. The <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel,</b> a bird, was swept to Lookout Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania during Gracie, marking the first time it appeared in North America.|$|E
5|$|Fourteen {{species of}} seabirds breed on the island. Red-tailed tropicbirds {{can be seen}} in large numbers {{circling}} the Malabar cliffs where they perform acrobatic courting rituals. Between August and May thousands of flesh-footed and wedge-tailed shearwaters return to the island at dusk each day. From the Little Island Track between March and November one of the world's rarest birds, the providence petrel also performs courtship displays during winter breeding and it is extremely tame. The island was its only breeding location for many years after the breeding colony on Norfolk Island was exterminated in the late 19th century; though a small population persists on the adjacent Phillip Island. The <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel</b> was discovered breeding on Mount Gower in 1914 by ornithologist Roy Bell while collecting specimens for Gregory Mathews and the black-winged petrel was only confirmed as a breeder in 1971; its numbers have increased following the elimination of feral cats from the island.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> (Pterodroma neglecta) {{are shown}} to be {{resident}} in the Atlantic Ocean, breeding at Ilha da Trindade, off Brazil, South Atlantic Ocean and migrating to the North Atlantic. Previously mistaken for Trindade petrels (Pterodroma arminjoniana) at Ilha da Trindade, they were identified by the whitish shafts and largely white inner webs of their primaries and, at the colony, by their distinctive call. Records of five non-breeding <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> in the North Atlantic Ocean include the first Atlantic specimen from western United Kingdom in 1908. All of eight identifications of <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> from Atlantic waters were dark phase birds, like those identified from the Indian Ocean, though, in the Pacific Ocean, the species is polymorphic. Trindade petrels from Ilha da Trindade are mostly the light phase (59 %, n = 71), outnumber <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> there by about 20 : 1 in collections, and disperse into the North Atlantic Ocean. As 70 % (n = 43) of these two species combined observed at sea in the North Atlantic were dark phase, about 49 % of North Atlantic records may have been <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels.</b> As they are in Pacific waters, <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> may be more migratory and reach higher latitudes than do Trindade petrels. The Halipeurus feather louse hosted by <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> in the Pacific Ocean has been identified from both petrels in Atlantic waters, but that hosted by Trindade petrels elsewhere has not been reported from Atlantic waters, possibly indicating earliest colonisation by <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels.</b> The morphometrics of Trindade petrels in the Atlantic Ocean cannot be established accurately until the generally larger <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> are excluded from data sets...|$|R
50|$|Bell’s work on {{the island}} added {{significantly}} to {{our knowledge of the}} birds there. He discovered <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> breeding on Mount Gower. He also found that the white-bellied storm petrel bred on the island and added eight other species to Lord Howe’s bird list.|$|R
50|$|The four {{islands in}} the Pitcairn group have been {{identified}} by BirdLife International as separate Important Bird Areas (IBAs). Pitcairn Island is recognised {{because it is the}} only nesting site of the Pitcairn reed warbler. Henderson Island is important for its endemic land-birds as well as its breeding seabirds. Oeno's ornithological significance derives principally from its Murphy's petrel colony. Ducie is important for its colonies of Murphy's, herald and <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels,</b> and Christmas shearwaters.|$|R
2500|$|The Norfolk Island Group Nepean Island [...] is {{also home}} to {{breeding}} seabirds. The providence petrel was hunted to local extinction {{by the beginning of the}} 19th century, but has shown signs of returning to breed on Phillip Island. Other seabirds breeding there include the white-necked petrel, <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel,</b> wedge-tailed shearwater, Australasian gannet, red-tailed tropicbird and grey ternlet. The sooty tern (known locally as the whale bird) has traditionally been subject to seasonal egg harvesting by Norfolk Islanders.|$|E

5000|$|The {{island is}} a {{breeding}} site for {{large numbers of}} black-winged and white-necked petrels. Other seabirds recorded as breeding there include grey noddies, sooty terns, masked boobies, red-tailed tropicbirds, wedge-tailed shearwaters, Kermadec little shearwaters, <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels</b> and <b>Kermadec</b> storm-petrels. The island also holds a population of the Kermadec red-crowned parakeet. Former populations of goats and kiore have been eradicated. [...] The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International {{because it is an}} important site for nesting seabirds.|$|R
500|$|The {{island is}} {{particularly}} important for Murphy's petrel, as more than 90% of its world population breeds on Ducie. [...] Around 3000 pairs of Christmas shearwaters, about 5% of the world's total population, {{can be found on}} the island too. Meanwhile, the red-tailed tropicbirds and fairy terns that breed on Ducie are around 1% of the world population of each species. Phoenix petrels, which previously inhabited the atoll, apparently disappeared between the Whitney expedition in 1922 and the 1991–92 Pitcairn Scientific Expedition. [...] The island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) principally for its colonies of Murphy's, herald and <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrels,</b> and Christmas shearwaters.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{ground of the}} <b>Kermadec</b> Storm <b>Petrel</b> was discovered {{with the assistance of}} Te Mana in August 2006, when the ship transported an ornithologist to a rocky outcrop in the Kermadec Islands group, enabling him to find a nest. The ship was on the annual mission to resupply Raoul Island for the Department of Conservation.|$|R
5000|$|Pterodroma neglecta, <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel</b> (Pacific Ocean basin {{species with}} {{eccentric}} breeding locality in the Indian Ocean-Round Island, Mauritius) ...|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} monogamous and raises a single chick each year, which becomes {{independent}} after 100-130 days. The <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel</b> is unusual for its {{wide range of}} breeding times, with different colonies nesting from October to February or from February to March.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel</b> (Pterodroma neglecta) is {{a species}} of gadfly petrel in the family Procellariidae. It is 38 cm long with a {{wingspan}} of 100 cm. It is polymorphic, with light, dark and intermediate morphs known. It eats squid, fish and other marine creatures.|$|E
50|$|Apart from a short {{stretch of}} its west coast, {{the island is}} bordered by cliffs, making access from the sea difficult. It is rugged and rocky, with little woody {{vegetation}}. Between the two high points of the island is a central valley where the vegetation {{is dominated by the}} sedge Cyperus ustulatus, while the surrounding slopes are dominated by a mix of Parietaria debilis and Disphyma australe. The island forms part of the Kermadec Islands Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because it is an important site for nesting seabirds. Seabirds breeding on the island include <b>Kermadec</b> and black-winged <b>petrels,</b> <b>Kermadec</b> little shearwaters and sooty terns.|$|R
50|$|The island's only mammals are rodents and carnivorans. The {{reptiles}} recorded {{are three}} species of marine turtles and two terrestrial lizards, Lepidodactylus lugubris and Ablepharus boutoui poecilopleurus. Four bird species - three terrestrial and one marine - are {{found on the}} island. These are: Fregata nubor, red-tailed tropicbird (Phaethon rubricauda), and <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel.</b> Three micro-lepidopteran species are reported in the park which have no links to South American species; {{one of these is}} Asymphorodes trichogramma.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{environmental}} degradation, {{the lack of}} feral cats and rats on the island has allowed some animals to persist there after having become extinct on Norfolk; however, there are extinct species who lived on both islands such as the Norfolk kaka. Two terrestrial reptiles, a gecko (Christinus guentheri), and a skink (Cyclodina lichenigera), have been recorded. It is an important breeding site for 12 species of seabirds, including the providence petrel, <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel,</b> white-necked petrel, wedge-tailed shearwater, Australasian gannet, sooty tern (known locally as the whale bird), red-tailed tropicbird and grey noddy. The sooty tern has traditionally been subject to seasonal egg harvesting. Phillip Island has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA), separate from the Norfolk Island IBA, because it supports small but increasing populations of providence and white-necked petrels, as well as over 1% of the world population of grey noddies.|$|E
50|$|It breeds in the Pacific ocean from Lord Howe Island to the Juan Fernández Islands. Rarely is the <b>Kermadec</b> <b>petrel</b> {{recorded}} west of Lord Howe Island, {{where it}} maintains a small colony {{of less than}} 100 individuals on Balls Pyramid. In the past it also bred in some numbers on the main islands, however this is seen as unlikely today. Not much is known of the bird's breeding pattern at Balls Pyramid, however it usually nests there in late summer. This coincides with the breeding patterns of other birds in the Kermadec Islands. The larger of its two subspecies, P. n. juana, also breeds on Round Island, off Mauritius, where it may sometimes hybridise with the Trindade petrel. The species is a vagrant in Hawaii, Australia and New Zealand. Reported vagrants in Pennsylvania and North Carolina in the United States {{and also in the}} United Kingdom are thought to be dubious.|$|E
