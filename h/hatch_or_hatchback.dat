5000|$|The artist's {{choice of}} drawing strokes affects the {{appearance}} of the image. Pen and ink drawings often use hatching—groups of parallel lines. Cross-hatching uses <b>hatching</b> in two <b>or</b> more different directions to create a darker tone.

Stippling uses dots to produce tone, [...] and shade. Different textures can be achieved depending on the method used to build tone.|$|R
