500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Maurice Hurley thought that [...] "Heart of Glory" [...] was the closest experience he had on the show to directly place his own personal philosophy into a script. He later credited fellow executive producer Rick Berman with helping to write the script for [...] "Heart of Glory", saying [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem,</b> I could go in and we could sit there, close the door, yell and scream. I'd pace, he'd make suggestions. The two of us made stories work in that room {{that had to be}} shot within a couple of days. We were under enormous time pressure, and we were working hand in glove. We had a wonderful time, on that show, especially." [...] Hurley wrote the screenplay in two days from a story created by Herbert Wright and D. C. Fontana. Because of the delays, the Klingon language portions of the script didn't make any actual sense in translation and were simply Klingon sounding words created by Hurley.|$|E

I know <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> with being told what to do, and {{had a problem with}} being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it's important to know when you have it, too." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] is about [...] "judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not", and that [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called [...] "Evacuation" [...] a [...] "song about change", and stated in an interview that the moral of [...] "Insignificance" [...] is [...] "the ineffectiveness of political struggle." [...] Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing [...] "Grievance", and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song [...] "Rival" [...] is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E

5000|$|Cullinan's poetry, often (in {{his earlier}} works) {{permeated}} by the Transvaal landscape, {{is most often}} concerned with the personal rather than the political; with emotional and metaphysical themes, such as his poem [...] "My Predawn Owl". Exemplified by this poem, his work is carefully crafted, often lyrical, and at one with the tradition of W. B. Yeats. His work draws from the cultural tradition inspired by major figures such as Dante and Eugenio Montale. While he was inspired and informed by such European tradition, Cullinan firmly identified himself as an African writer: I spent seven years, {{from the age of}} 14 to 21 in Europe (mainly, because I had no choice, in England), so I certainly ingested a great deal of European-ness. Therefore, when I came back to South Africa at the age of 21, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem.</b> Was I in fact a European, or an African?

Plus, it was boring.Julian called us at about that time, volunteering to help us if we ever wanted to do some ads. I knew of PKL as the hottest shop on Madison Ave, so I candidly described the problem to him and said we really needed a new name. Something that could comfortably include moderates and political newbees while not alienating the seasoned activists we needed to enlist across the country to actually build the events. He said, [...] "Gimme a few days."A few days later, we received a set of tear sheets for a full-page newspaper ad to announce the campaign. He offered a bunch of possible names—Earth Day, Ecology Day, Environment Day, E Day—but he made it quite clear that we would be idiots if we didn't choose Earth Day. Over beer and pizza the following evening, my 20-something staff and I concurred, and quickly placed the ad in the NOTWIR section of the Sunday NYT.Thus was born what remains the strongest [...] "brand" [...] in {{the environmental}} field.

50|$|To Queen Pomare,Alii of TahitiRespectful {{greetings}} to you.I received {{your letter}} on the 25th day of September {{with a copy}} of your petition to the Christian King, Louis Phillippe, the King of France. As soon as I received it I quickly ordered these documents to be published in the Polynesian, in accordance with your idea that the people of this land should hear of it.I have frequently heard of your troubles and of the death of your Government and of your grief, but I don't have the power mana within me to help you. At one time, however, I thought of fetching you, and of bringing you to live here in Hawaii with us, but upon reflection I hesitate lest you soon become a refugee from your own country. Therefore I have put aside my thoughts to invite you to come here. Perhaps this latter thought is right pono because I have heard things may be right again. Perhaps it is better for you to rely upon the generosity of the King of France, in order that you might not prejudice your petition that seeks redress and affection from him.Just before this, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>problem</b> similar to yours, although yours is the graver situation. God was truly generous to me, and my Government emerged victorious at this time. In my time of trouble certain people stood by my side to aid me. I had a foreigner haole who had sworn an oath before me, to have no other Sovereign but myself, and he worked with vigor as is the foreigner's way, quickly deciding what was for our good and what should be done. There were other foreigners also, and including my man, T. Haalilio. They were in Britain and in France. As soon as they heard of the events here in Hawaii, they quickly petitioned the British Government in order to ascertain if their approval had been given. Here I reign with the support of some righteous foreigners and I think therein my Government shall endure in times when I am again troubled by foreign governments. My own people and those from foreign lands are equally protected under me. I reign in peace. I am not too frequently bothered by very burdensome tasks, but it is my duty to observe and supervise all the work that my Officers do.Please be generous to my Hawaiian people that travel to your land, as I am generous to your people of Tahiti. Indeed, as I generously care for your people that come here to HawaiiOh Sovereign, I deeply regret your trouble. May the Lord that is our Savior liberate you. May you be blessed through the Sacrifice of salvation.Fond farewell,Kamehameha III.|$|E
