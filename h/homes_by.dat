5|$|War with France and Scotland led Henry VIII to sell {{of some of}} the {{religious}} establishments and land to raise finances quickly. Later, they were granted or bestowed to leading families who were friends or supporters of the King. These former religious establishments were frequently developed into country <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> their new aristocratic owners. Notable examples of this include Calke Abbey, Longleat House, Syon House, Welbeck Abbey. and Woburn Abbey.|$|E
5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery {{indicates that it}} is the oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests it to be older. This plaque was part of a statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, {{due in part to}} the recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E

5|$|Clark's {{ultimate}} goal during the Revolutionary War was {{to seize the}} British-held fort at Detroit, but he could never recruit enough men and acquire sufficient munitions to make the attempt. Kentucky militiamen generally preferred to defend their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> staying closer to Kentucky, instead of making a long and potentially perilous expedition to Detroit. Clark returned to the Falls of the Ohio and Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued to defend the Ohio River valley {{until the end of}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{debris and}} waste being carried into {{waterways}} by flooding from Ernesto, Virginia officials closed the Chesapeake Bay to shellfishing {{for four days}} from the Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel {{to the mouth of}} the Potomac River. In Richmond, officials condemned 70homes, prompting city workers to establish temporary <b>homes.</b> <b>By</b> five days after the storm's passage through the state, most of the 600,000people who experienced power outages had their electricity restored. Dominion Resources's Tidewater Virginia area was among the most affected, requiring 2–3days to restore all areas. By two days after the storm moved through the area, all major roadways were opened, though secondary roadways took longer to be cleared from debris.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{restoration}} of the monarchy, in 1663 the non-conformist Reverend John Norman, vicar from 1647 to 1660, was one of several 'religious fanatics' confined to their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> Lord Stawell's militia. A large religious meeting house, thought to have been Presbyterian, was demolished and its furniture burned on the Cornhill in 1683. By 1688, matters had calmed down enough for a new chapel, Christ Church, to be founded in Dampiet Street, the congregation of which became Unitarian in 1815.|$|E

5|$|Globe Town was {{established}} from 1800 {{to provide for}} the expanding population of weavers around Bethnal Green, attracted by improving prospects in silk weaving. The population of Bethnal Green trebled between 1801 and 1831, with 20,000 looms being operated in people's own <b>homes.</b> <b>By</b> 1824, with restrictions on importation of French silks relaxed, up to half these looms had become idle, and prices were driven down. With many importing warehouses already established in the district, the abundance of cheap labour was turned to boot, furniture and clothing manufacture. Globe Town continued its expansion into the 1860s, long after the decline of the silk industry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} after the war the natural ice {{industry}} collapsed into insignificance. Industry turned entirely to plant ice and mechanical cooling systems and the introduction of cheap electric motors resulted in domestic, modern refrigerators becoming common in U.S. <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> the 1930s and more widely across Europe in the 1950s, allowing ice {{to be made in the}} home. The natural ice harvests shrunk dramatically and ice warehouses were abandoned or converted for other uses. The use of natural ice on a small scale lingered on in more remote areas for some years, and ice continued to be occasionally harvested for carving at artistic competitions and festivals, but by the end of the 20th century there were very few physical reminders of the trade.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} {{resulted in}} 178 dead, 588 wounded and 41 captured ARBiH troops. Bosnian Serb losses were 900 killed {{and more than}} 1,000 wounded. In September and October, 6,500 Bosniak and Croat civilians living {{in the area of}} Banja Luka or Prijedor were expelled from their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> Bosnian Serb forces. Changes of control of territory also allowed access to two mass graves near Sanski Most, believed to contain the bodies of 300 civilians killed by Bosnian Serb forces in April 1992.|$|E

5|$|Touching {{the names}} of the dead on {{memorials}} was common gesture of grieving in the inter-war period; sometimes mourners would also kiss the names. Visitors to the memorials on the Western front would often photograph or trace on paper the relevant names on the memorials, taking these reminders back with them to their <b>homes.</b> <b>By</b> contrast, the naming of the dead played a less significant role in Italy, where formal lists of the war dead were not established until the mid-1920s; local communities compiled their own lists, used to produce local memorial plaques, but the national lists remained inaccurate for many years.|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out of their homes.|$|E
5|$|Following the Italian intervention, Prpić {{was able}} {{to proceed with the}} task of {{clearing}} the wider area of Nevesinje from 3 July, ensuring NDH control of population centres and roads. On 5 July, he replaced his deputy Prohaska with Colonel Franjo Šimić, and assigned him a force consisting of the 6th, 11th, 15th and 17th Battalions, a company of the 18th Battalion and a troop of artillery. The force numbered 62 officers and 2,062 men, with heavy weapons including four 100mm Skoda houfnice vz 14 mountain howitzers, six heavy machine guns and twenty-seven light machine guns. Šimić seized the crossroads near Kifino Selo and Plužine, securing it with one company of the 11th Battalion, then sent the 15th Battalion to Gacko and the 17th Battalion to Berkovići. A half company of the 21st Battalion secured the Mostar–Nevesinje road. Once this was completed, the major roads in eastern Herzegovina were secured. These operations proceeded without significant fighting, as some of the rebels retreated over the border with Montenegro, and others hid their weapons in the mountains and returned to their <b>homes.</b> <b>By</b> 7 July, NDH forces had regained full control over all the towns and transport routes in eastern Herzegovina.|$|E

5|$|Further funds {{came from}} the United States Agency for International Development, which offered US$25,000 by mid-January. The French Polynesian {{assembly}} in Tahiti also provided US$770,000 worth of relief supplies and aid. The main industry of Tonga, tourism, was devastated by the storm as no tourists were allowed {{to travel to the}} region for at least two weeks after Waka's passage. The Government of Tonga requested a total of US$39.2million in international aid, most of which was dedicated to rehabilitation of infrastructure. Medical supplies and personnel were later deployed by the World Health Organization. In early March, a relief fund based on donations was set up by the United Methodist Committee on Relief to provide US$210,000 for 30 families impacted by the storm. About 180 people were given assistance in rebuilding their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> the Church World Service later that month. As food shortages became severe in April, emergency supplies were sent to the outlying Niuas islands of Tonga. In May, US$5.85million was approved for emergency funds by the World Bank to assist in infrastructural rehabilitation.|$|E
5|$|One {{explanation}} for the recent population decrease is the Croatian War of Independence. During the war, large sections of the population were displaced and emigration increased. In 1991, in predominantly Serb areas, more than 400,000 Croats and other non-Serbs were either removed from their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> the Croatian Serb forces or fled the violence. In 1995, during {{the final days of}} the war, more than 120,000 and perhaps as many as 200,000 Serbs fled the country before the arrival of Croatian forces during Operation Storm. Within a decade following the end of the war, only 117,000 Serb refugees returned out of the 300,000 displaced during the entire war. Most of Croatia's remaining Serbs never lived in areas occupied in the Croatian War of Independence. Serbs have been only partially re-settled in the regions they previously inhabited, while some of the settlements previously inhabited by Serbs were settled by Croat refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina, mostly from Republika Srpska.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The Omani army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the Omani government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their <b>homes.</b> <b>By</b> two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the NK 6th Division {{was ordered}} to await {{reinforcements}} before continuing the attack. From north to south, the division had its 13th, 15th, and 14th Regiments. The first replacements arrived at Chinju on about August 12. Approximately 2,000 unarmed South Koreans conscripted in the Seoul area joined the division by August 15. At Chinju, the 6th Division issued them grenades and told the recruits {{they would have to}} pick up weapons from killed and wounded on the battlefield. Another group of 2,500 replacements conscripted in the Seoul area joined the 6th Division on August 21, bringing the division strength to approximately 8,500 men. In the last week of August and the first week of September, 3,000 more recruits conscripted in southwest Korea joined the division. The 6th Division used this last body of recruits in labor details at first and only later employed them as combat troops. The South Korean conscripts were often forcibly taken from their <b>homes</b> <b>by</b> North Korean troops, and typically held very weak morale. The North Koreans realized they presented a weakness in the lines but were unable to acquire men using other means. The North Koreans placed rear-guard troops behind the conscripts' formations, who would threaten to shoot them if they attempted to defect, desert or surrender their positions.|$|E
