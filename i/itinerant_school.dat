40|$|The {{student support}} system is {{important}} for teachers to start supporting children based on advice given by the <b>itinerant</b> <b>school</b> consultants. The present study contends that if the <b>itinerant</b> <b>school</b> consultation service assists the special needs education coordinators, the key persons promoting special education systems in schools, {{it will be a}} great help for schools in the development of student support systems. We surveyed coordinators about the problems and solutions they had found. The results show that coordinators of both elementary and junior high schools have the same problems despite the differences in school cultures: a lack of time, skills, and information about how to serve as a coordinator and difficulties in gaining cooperation among teachers. We found that when coordinators and teachers work together to assess children and to write and evaluate the individualized education plans, coordinators find more cooperation among teachers. Further, when supporting coordinators, it is necessary for the itinerant consultants to care for them in the following ways: First, it is most important for the consultants to empower the coordinators. Second, the consultants must help the coordinators to work efficiently. Third, the consultants should offer step-by-step instructions to coordinators for overcoming difficulties in their work...|$|E

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis concerns the Acadian {{teachers in the}} public schools of the eastern counties of Nova Scotia between the years 1811 and 1864. The early Acadian public school teachers provided the Acadians, the French speaking population, in Nova Scotia, instruction in their own French language even under legal constraints to do otherwise. The region covered in this dissertation includes the counties found on Cape Breton Island and the counties of Antigonish and Guysborough on the mainland portion of the province between 1811 the year of adoption of the first Education Act in Nova Scotia concerning public education and concludes with the 1864 Education Act which created a homogenous unilingual school system in English. Acadian education would progress from small groups of children taught by <b>itinerant</b> <b>school</b> masters and visiting mission priests to formal one-room school houses where numbers were sufficient. Lay teachers being found in the communities would perpetuate the French language following their own education at the few available institutions for training. The work of these Acadian public school teachers, even when legislation prohibited it, resulted in the survival of the Acadian French communities in eastern Nova Scotia. In the preparation of this thesis, original sources were used including school reports, school commissioner reports, and colonial census records, private journals of the bishops and priests {{as well as those of}} community members. The original sources are invaluable as a record of the year to year work of the Acadian public school teachers where there are few other documentary sources remaining of their work. While the origins of the public schools in Nova Scotia has been documented as well as Acadian schools, this is the first look at the Acadian public school teachers who worked in the various communities of eastern Nova Scotia and their backgrounds.

5000|$|It was {{precisely}} because of his exceptional learning that Paulinus {{first came to the}} attention of Charlemagne in 774 when the King of the Franks conquered all of Lombard northern Italy for the Carolingian Empire. Moreover, because of his loyalty to Charlemagne during Duke Hrodgaud's rebellion in 776, Paulinus was rewarded with many favors, among them the gift of the property of Waldand, son of Mimo of Lavariano, by means of a diploma issued by Charlemagne from Ivrea. In the same year, Charlemagne also invited Paulinus to the palace court to be royal [...] "master of grammar (grammaticus magister)." [...] It was at the <b>itinerant</b> palace <b>school</b> (schola palatina) that Paulinus would stay for about ten years and make the acquaintance of other leading scholars of the age, including Peter of Pisa, Alcuin of York, Fardulf, Arno of Salzburg, Albrico, Bona, Riculph, Raefgot, Rado, Lullus, Bassinus, Fuldrad, Eginard, Adalard and Adelbert. He formed an enduring friendships with Alcuin as attested to by numerous letters.|$|R
