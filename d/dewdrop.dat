5|$|Upon {{returning}} home from an evening spent losing at poker, George Brown swears off gambling forever. However, his friend Bigelow convinces him to secretly continue attending the weekly poker game and to tell his wife Mary {{that he has been}} admitted to the Sons of the Morning, a fraternal lodge, to explain his absences. When George talks in his sleep, she becomes suspicious and has her cousin Freddie <b>Dewdrop</b> follow him, allowing her to learn the truth. Together with the wives of the other poker players, she enacts a plan to end the gambling. Freddie and the members of his Bible study group dress up as police officers and raid the game. The gamblers' wives then arrive, and the police leave the men to be scolded, purportedly in place of being arrested. As the film ends, the Browns reconcile.|$|E
5|$|While Ismail, who {{remained}} head of Perfini, went abroad to study cinematography at the School of Theater, Film and Television at the University of California, Los Angeles, Djajakusuma began taking {{a larger role}} in Perfini. He made his directorial debut in 1952 with Embun (<b>Dewdrop),</b> which showed the psychological troubles faced by soldiers upon returning to their village after the revolution. The film was shot in Wonosari, at the time {{in the middle of a}} drought, to provide a visual metaphor for the barren souls of the warriors. Because of its depiction of traditional superstitions, the film had trouble with both the censorship bureau and critics; superstition was considered incompatible with the new republic's need for modernisation. The release of Embun made Djajakusuma one of four directors to work for Perfini; the others were Ismail, Nya Abas Akup, and Wahyu Sihombing.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Hampshire and the French {{were quickly}} stopped by enfilade fire from Boritska/Baniska Trench {{opposite}} and from machine-guns hidden in shell-holes but when {{reinforced by the}} 1st Rifle Brigade, established posts north-west of the trench. To the left, the 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers joined with {{the left of the}} Hampshire, after capturing gun-pits and a strong point further on. The 1st Royal Warwick were to leap-frog through the Fusiliers but became mixed up and attempts to advance were defeated in hand-to-hand fighting and then flanking fire from both sides. The 12th Brigade on the left was defeated by machine-gun fire from <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench near the Lesbœufs–Le Transloy road, parties of the 2nd Essex who got into the trench being overwhelmed. The 1st King's Own captured the German part of Spectrum Trench to the north of <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench and then advanced further; help arrived from bombers of the 2nd Dukes but only Spectrum Trench could be held.|$|E

25|$|Like other arachnids, spiders {{are unable}} to chew their food, {{so they have a}} mouth part shaped like a short {{drinking}} straw that they use to suck up the liquefied insides of their prey. However, they are able to eat their own silk to recycle proteins needed in the production of new spider webs. Some spiders, such as the <b>dewdrop</b> spiders (Argyrodes), even eat the silk of other spider species.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{relatively}} large size of web, they are often infested with kleptoparasitic split-faced silver spiders (Argyrodes fissifrons). While able to build webs of their own, <b>dewdrop</b> spiders (genus Argyrodes) prefer to live and even reproduce in the webs of other spiders, stealing prey in the process. They can be permanently associated with one web or move around between several other tent webs in the immediate vicinity. The size of the web is directly proportional {{to the number of}} A. fissifrons inhabiting them. The relationships can sometimes be commensal or even mutual, as A. fissifrons eat prey entangled in the webs that are too small for the larger double-tailed tent spiders. However, they often help themselves to food stores or even food {{in the process of being}} consumed by the hosts as well. Larger individuals are more audacious, but they usually stay on the tangle webs and out of the way of their hosts. Double-tailed tent spiders seem to tolerate their presence though they sometimes have to shove them away when they catch larger prey.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{relieved}} the 4th Division on {{the night}} of 23/24 October, the 1st Middlesex and 4th King's Liverpool of the 33rd Division (Major-General Reginald Pinney) attacked at [...] and captured Rainy and <b>Dewdrop</b> trenches but by [...] both had been bombed back out of <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench. Next day the 19th Brigade attacked on the right of the division with the 1st Cameron and the 5/6th Scottish Rifles, to take more of Boritska Trench but were repulsed by fire from machine-guns in shell holes. During the day, the 17th Division (Major-General P. R. Robertson) relieved the 8th Division. On 30 October the 1st Anzac Corps (Lieutenant-General W. R. Birdwood) relieved the XV Corps between XIV and III corps.|$|E
2500|$|On most of {{the brigade}} fronts, {{assembly}} positions had been marked with white tape and compass bearings taken of the direction to the objectives but at zero hour, the British positions were flooded.

On the right the 4th Division attacked with the 11th Brigade to take Frosty, Hazy, Rainy and <b>Dewdrop</b> trenches, while in the French sector the attack began at [...] Groups of the 1st Rifle Brigade reached the gun-pits before Hazy Trench and were forced back, the 1st East Lancs were forced under cover in front of <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench, by the fire of hidden machine-guns. The 1st King's Own of the 12th Brigade and the German defenders mutually attacked and counter-attacked around Spectrum Trench and then the King's Own bombed along Spectrum for [...] towards <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench. In the 6th Division, the 9th Norfolk attacked Mild and Cloudy trenches but was bombarded before zero hour and moved so slowly through mud that it lost the barrage. The battalion captured the north-west end of Mild Trench and then repulsed a counter-attack as dark fell. (After dark on 19 October, a platoon of the 1st Somerset Light Infantry found Frosty Trench unoccupied and defeated a counter-attack.) ...|$|E

2500|$|In the 12th Brigade, the 1st King's Own {{tried to}} bomb down Spectrum Trench to <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench {{in the evenings}} of [...] October and in a pre-dawn attack on 15 October, the 2nd Sherwood Foresters in the 6th Division took the gun-pits {{in front of the}} British-held section of Cloudy Trench and took several prisoners. On the left of the {{division}} the 11th Essex overran Mild Trench and bombed up the Beaulencourt road before being forced back by a counter-attack. In the III Corps area, the 3rd South African Regiment attacked after dark on 14 October, captured the Pimple and [...] of Snag Trench. The rain gradually abated and 17 October began fair but clouded over and rain fell again during the night. The British bombardment had continued as planned but the German artillery reply was vigorous leading up to zero hour at [...] on 18 October.|$|E
2500|$|The {{temperature}} at the landing site was [...] and pressure of 1467.6 mbar (1.448 atm), implying a methane abundance of 5 ± 1% and methane relative humidity of 50% near the surface. Therefore, ground fogs caused by methane {{in the neighborhood}} of the landing site are unlikely. Thermometers indicated that heat was wicked away from Huygens so quickly that the ground must have been damp, and one image shows light reflected by a <b>dewdrop</b> as it falls across the camera's field of view. On Titan, the feeble sunlight allows only about one centimeter of evaporation per year (versus one meter of water on Earth), but the atmosphere can hold the equivalent of about 10 meters of liquid before rain forms vs. only a few centimeters on Earth. So Titan's weather is expected to feature torrential downpours causing flash floods, interspersed by decades or centuries of drought.|$|E

The 1st Royal Warwick advanced [...] and dug Antelope Trench south of Hazy Trench, in touch with the French and repulsed a counter-attack in the evening. The battalion advance was repulsed at Rainy and <b>Dewdrop</b> trenches north-east of Lesbœufs, along with the 1st Royal Irish Fusiliers further to the left. On the left of the division the 12th Brigade attacked Spectrum Trench after a Stokes mortar bombardment and parties of the 2nd Duke of Wellington got into the trench and linked with the 2nd Lancashire Fusiliers in {{the north end of the}} trench. An attempt by groups from both battalions to attack over the spur to Zenith Trench was repulsed.

2500|$|After {{the poor}} {{results of the}} attack on 12 October, Rawlinson {{concluded}} that the weather delays had enabled the defenders to recover and that a deliberate attack after methodical bombardment was necessary, before another attack on 18 October. On 13 October, he issued an operation order in which he stressed the necessity of improving routes to the front line and the preparation of good assembly trenches parallel to the German defences. A steady bombardment was to begin immediately and XIV Corps was warned to capture Zenith, Mild and the rest of Cloudy trenches, before the general attack. XV Corps was to capture the Gird lines south-east of the Eaucourt–Le Barque road and Snag Trench was to be captured by III Corps, all by night attacks supported by tanks, where practical. On 14 October, the XIV Corps attempted a surprise attack at [...] with the 2nd Seaforth of the 4th Division, which got into Rainy Trench and gun-pits south of <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench and were then forced out by a counter-attack. The 2nd Royal Dublin Fusiliers tried to capture gun-pits in front of Hazy Trench {{at the same time and}} were also repulsed.|$|E
2500|$|The XIV Corps {{objective}} was a trench line from [...] away {{and on the}} right flank the 56th Division (Major-General C. P. A. Hull) attacked with two brigades. On the right, in the 168th Brigade area, the 1/14th Battalion London Scottish {{found it difficult to}} maintain contact with the French on the right, who advanced eastwards rather than north-east. The Scottish captured a southern group of gun pits and pushed on to the south end of Hazy Trench [...] beyond. The 1/4th London was stopped by machine-gun fire from the northern gun pits and tried to outflank them on the right. On the left, the 1/12th London advance was stopped short of <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench to the north-east of Lesbœufs, which had only been bombarded by Stokes mortars as it was too close to the British front line. In the 167th Brigade area, the 1/1st London was repulsed in front of Spectrum Trench except on the left flank where bombers joined with the 1/7th Middlesex, after it captured Rainbow Trench, the south end of Spectrum Trench against determined resistance. The 1/14th London Scottish and the 1/4th London defeated a counter-attack but after dark the battalions were forced back, as were the French on the right.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 November, a 98th Brigade {{attack on}} a ridge east of <b>Dewdrop</b> Trench failed and on 5 November the 33rd Division {{attacked}} at [...] with the 2nd Worcester, who captured Boritska and Mirage trenches and joined with the 16th KRRC that had captured Hazy Trench. In the 19th Brigade area to the left, the 2nd Royal West Kent advanced along the Lesbœufs–Le Transloy road {{but was unable to}} hold on, after patrols of the 7th East Yorkshire and 7th Green Howards of the 50th Brigade on the left were repulsed. The 1st Anzac Corps attacked on the left at [...] with the 1st Australian Division in a downpour, against a salient north of Gueudecourt. In the 1st Brigade, the 3rd Battalion bombed forward but the repulse of the 1st Battalion during two frontal attacks and a bombing attack on Hilt Trench, forced a withdrawal on the 3rd Battalion. The 7th Brigade attacked with the 27th Battalion on the right flank, a composite battalion of the 25th Battalion and a company each from the 26th and 27th battalions in the centre and the 28th Battalion on the left, in which parties of the 27th Battalion entered Bayonet Trench and then retired at dusk. Troops of the composite battalion reached the Maze and held on but the 28th Battalion was repulsed twice and retired.|$|E

2500|$|The rain {{came back}} during the night and on 8 October, the Fourth Army {{divisions}} removed casualties and consolidated positions. On the left flank the 23rd Division attacked again at [...] with the Reserve Army. Two companies of the 8th York and Lancs from the 70th Brigade, captured the Flers trenches up to the army boundary and occupied an abandoned post [...] north-west of Le Sars. The 47th Division made a night attack on Snag Trench with the 1/21st and 1/22nd London, by crawling forward to rush the trench as the barrage lifted. The trench was entered on the left but the parties were forced out by fire from the right. The 1/22nd London set up posts on the Eaucourt–Warlencourt road and gained touch with the 23rd Division to the west. On the army boundary with the Sixth Army, the 56th Division moved back from Rainy Trench north-east of Lesbœufs and most of Spectrum Trench to the north, for a British preparatory bombardment and then attacked at [...] with the 169th Brigade on the right. The 1/5th London (London Rifle Brigade) captured Hazy Trench, despite losing contact with the French 18th Division {{on the right and}} machine-guns concealed in shell-holes stopped the 1/9th London and the 1/3rd London (167th Brigade) advance on <b>Dewdrop</b> and Spectrum trenches. After dark the battalions were withdrawn to the start line and German troops occupied Rainy trench unopposed.|$|E
