50|$|Arturo Toscanini made {{a series}} of {{recordings}} for RCA Victor with the orchestra in 1941 and 1942. The masters for these records were damaged during the electroplating process, resulting in unusually high surface noise and distortion and they were not approved for release.

50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of physically editing tapes were many. Some broadcasters decreed that edited tapes {{could not be}} reused, {{in an era when}} the relatively high cost of the machines and tapes was balanced by the savings involved in being able to wipe and reuse the media. Others, such as the BBC, allowed reuse of spliced tape in certain circumstances as long as it conformed to strict criteria about the number of splices in a given duration, usually a maximum of five splices for every half hour. The process required great skill, and often resulted in edits that would roll (lose sync) and each edit required several minutes to perform, although this was also initially true of the <b>electronic</b> <b>editing</b> that came later.|$|E

UPF has published almost 2,500 volumes with a staff of 41. It has undergone a total conversion to <b>electronic</b> <b>editing</b> and production and boasts efficient schedules and procedures in place to release about 100 new titles each year in the areas of international studies, archaeology, dance, history, literature, political science, and many others.

5000|$|The [...] "Quad" [...] head {{assembly}} rotates at 14,400 rpm (NTSC). The four head pieces (quad) are switched successively so that recorded stripes cross the video portion (most {{of the tape}} middle, audio is on one edge, control track is on the other) so that head to tape write speed is well {{in excess of the}} 15 inch per second physical motion. They wrote the video vertically across the width of a tape that was 2 inches (5 cm) wide and ran at 15 inches (38 cm) per second. This allowed hour-long television programs to be recorded on one reel of tape. In 1956, one reel of tape cost $300; and Ampex advertised the cost of the recorder as $45,000. A 7.5 inch per second version was released later, and this required a new, narrower headwheel. This vertical writing facilitated mechanical editing, once the control track was developed to display the pulse that indicates where a frame ends and the next one begins. Later, Ampex developed <b>electronic</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E

50|$|E-texts, or {{electronic}} documents, {{have been}} around since long before the Internet, the Web, and specialized E-book reading hardware. Roberto Busa began developing an electronic edition of Aquinas in the 1940s, while large-scale <b>electronic</b> text <b>editing,</b> hypertext, and online reading platforms such as Augment and FRESS appeared in the 1960s. These early systems made extensive use of formatting, markup, automatic tables of contents, hyperlinks, and other information in their texts, {{as well as in}} some cases (such as FRESS) supporting not just text but also graphics.|$|R
5000|$|Episode 10, [...] "Sgt. Wilson's Little Secret", {{survived the}} cull {{as it was}} {{recorded}} onto 35 mm film instead of videotape, either because it required additional editing (which was easier to do to film {{before the advent of}} <b>electronic</b> timecode <b>editing)</b> or because no videotape recording facilities were available in the recording period. This fortuitously assured the episode's survival: as a production made on film, it fell within the BBC Film Library's remit of retaining filmed productions. In 1998, David Croft made an appeal on BBC Two asking people if they held an off air video copy of the 5 remaining episodes.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{the family}} {{supposedly}} consists of thirteen members (13, 69, 124, 174, 230, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, 983, 1689, and 1709), although {{the most recent}} work of Drs. Barbara Aland, Klaus Wachtel, {{and others at the}} Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung in Münster, Germany, imply that some of these family members are more similar to the majority Byzantine Text, and therefore should not be included in this family at all. Research recently completed using phylogenetic software by American doctoral student Jac Perrin (through the auspices of ITSEE - Institute for Textual Scholarship and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Editing</b> at the University of Birmingham, UK) agrees with the conclusions of the Münster team that although the Albanian manuscripts 1141 and 2900 both contain some F13 readings, neither meet the full criteria of F13 membership. In his dissertation on the topic, Perrin lists the current family members as GA 13, 69, 124, 346, 543, 788, 826, 828, 983, and 1689. All of these manuscripts (except 1689) are without the Pericope Adulterae in St. John's Gospel. Most of them relocate the passage after Luke 21:38. This agrees with the historical criteria first established by Ferrar-Abbott in their 1887 publication. Perrin lists 590 distinct and significant non-Majority Text readings in St. John's Gospel which identify F13.|$|E
5000|$|O'Connell also {{extensively}} documented RCA's {{technical problems}} with the Philadelphia Orchestra recordings of 1941/42, which required extensive <b>electronic</b> <b>editing</b> before they could be issued (well after Toscanini's death, beginning in 1963, with the rest following in 1977). Harvey Sachs also recounts that the masters were damaged during processing, possibly because {{of the use of}} somewhat-inferior materials imposed by wartime restrictions. Toscanini had listened to some of the test pressings and had given his approval to some of the recordings, rejected others and was prepared to re-record the unsatisfactory sides. Unfortunately, the Petrillo/AFM recording ban from 1942 to 1944 prevented immediate retakes; by the time the ban ended, the Philadelphia Orchestra had left RCA Victor for Columbia Records and RCA apparently was hesitant to promote the orchestra any further. RCA had declared the defective masters unsalvageable and Toscanini eventually re-recorded all of the same music with the NBC Symphony. When told that RCA had finally decided to scrap the Philadelphia recordings, Toscanini vehemently exclaimed, [...] "I worked like a dog!". The best sounding of the recordings is the Schubert Symphony No. 9 (The [...] "Great"), which had been successfully restored and issued by RCA in 1963. In 1968, the Philadelphia Orchestra returned to RCA and the company was more favorable toward issuing all of the discs. When RCA finally released a complete edition of the recordings in 1977, Sachs and others suggested that some of the masters may have deteriorated further. As for the historic recordings, even on the compact disc issue, first released in 1991, some of the sides have considerable surface noise and some distortion, especially during the louder passages. Nevertheless, despite the occasional problems, the sound has been markedly improved on CD, and the entire set is an impressive document of Toscanini's collaboration with the Philadelphia musicians. A second RCA CD reissue from 2006 makes more-effective use of digital processing in an attempt to produce better sound. Longtime Philadelphia director Eugene Ormandy expressed his appreciation for what Toscanini achieved with the orchestra.|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decade {{activity}} theory has attracted a small but influential group of researchers in two fields that contribute to theory and research in technical communication: human-computer interaction and composition studies. In my STC-sponsored research into <b>electronic</b> <b>editing</b> in technical communication, I am applying activity theory to provide a coherent explanatory perspective {{on the findings of}} the qualitative portion of my study. This paper provides a brief introduction to activity theory and applies its analytical framework to help make sense of the qualitative data I gathered on <b>electronic</b> <b>editing</b> practices and attitudes in three different technical communication workplaces. BACKGROUND Activity theory (AT) is rooted in the cultural-historical school of psychology that first emerged and took form in Russia from the 1920 s to the 1940 s. Vygotsky, Leont’ev, and Luria provided the original conceptual framework, building directly on the theories of Marx and Engels relating to the primacy of practice in shaping human consciousness [1, 2]. AT as developed by Leont’ev provided a heuristic approach to ergonomic design in Russia. In the 1980 s, the theory as modified by Engeström began to be applied in human-computer interaction (HCI) research in Finland. Today, AT is an important theoretical perspective in HCI throughout Scandinavia, where it has influenced the movement toward user-involved design. Activity theory has gained a foothold in North America through the community of researchers and theorist...|$|E
