In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Sánchez revealed that when principal photography first wrapped, approximately $20,000 to $25,000 had been spent. Richard Corliss of Time magazine reported a $35,000 estimated budget. Other figures list a final budget ranging between $500,000 and $750,000.

5|$|A {{number of}} saints and {{historical}} <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> followed and presented specific approaches to Christian meditation. Both Eastern and Western Christian teachings {{have emphasized the}} use of meditation as an element in increasing one's knowledge of Christ. The Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola use meditative mental imagery, {{with the goal of}} knowing Christ more intimately and loving him more ardently. In The Way of Perfection, St. Theresa of Avila taught her nuns how to try to get to know Christ by using meditation and mental prayer. Hesychastic prayer and meditation continues {{to be used in the}} Eastern Orthodox tradition as a spiritual practice that facilitates the knowing of Christ.|$|E
5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> improved, median {{incomes and}} stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E
5|$|In Japan {{during its}} opening week, Path of Radiance sold over 100,357 copies, selling through 64.16% of its initial shipment. By {{the end of}} 2005, the game had sold 156,413 copies. In its UK debut, it {{reached the top of}} the GameCube charts. Although no exact sales <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> been published, Nintendo cited the game as being among its {{successful}} GameCube titles for 2005. According to the developers, the fact that it was released near the end of the GameCube's lifespan affected sales, but it still managed to help sell the hardware and convinced Nintendo that the Fire Emblem had selling power on home consoles.|$|E

5|$|Retaliatory punishments, or Qisas, are practised: for instance, an eye can be surgically removed at {{the insistence}} of a victim who lost his own eye. This {{occurred}} in a case reported in 2000. Families of someone unlawfully killed can choose between demanding the death penalty or granting clemency in return for a payment of diyya, or blood money, by the perpetrator. There has been a growing trend of exorbitant blood-money demands, for example a sum of $11 million was reported as being recently demanded. Saudi officials and religious <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> criticized this trend and said that the practise of diyya has become corrupted.|$|E
5|$|Several of Chicago's most {{important}} historical <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> {{lived on the}} street. This {{is especially true of}} the period of recovery from the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 when many of the {{most important}} families in the city moved to the street. Residents of the street have influenced the evolution of the city and have played prominent national and international roles. They have influenced the political history, the architecture, the culture, the economy, as well as the law and government of Chicago. The street has over time been influenced by the demographics of Chicago.|$|E

Two of the figures are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.|$|E

5|$|The Crucifixion {{itself is}} conspicuously absent, {{and there is}} no trace or shadow of its {{presence}} in the panels. Writing in 1996, Wieland Schmied noted that the three Furies have replaced Christ and the two thieves crucified on either side of him. The form of the Furies is borrowed directly from Picasso's late 1920s and mid-1930s pictures of biomorphs on beaches, in particular from the Spanish artist's The Bathers (1937). However, the eroticism and comedy of Picasso's <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> been replaced by a sense of menace and terror derived in part from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ.|$|E
5|$|The Slavs erected sanctuaries, created {{statues and}} other sculptures, {{including}} the four-faced Svetovid, whose carvings symbolize {{various aspects of}} the Slavic cosmology model. One 9th-century specimen from the Zbruch River in modern Ukraine, found in 1848, is on display at the Archeological Museum in Kraków. Many of the sacred locations and objects were identified outside Poland, for example in northeastern Germany or Ukraine. In Poland, religious activity sites have been investigated in northwestern Pomerania, including Szczecin, where a three-headed deity once stood, and the Wolin island, where 9th– to 11th-century cult figurines were found. Archeologically confirmed cult places and <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> also been researched at several other locations.|$|E
5|$|The {{common theme}} in {{conspiracy}} theories about a New World Order {{is that a}} secretive power elite with a globalist agenda is conspiring to eventually rule the world through an authoritarian world government—which will replace sovereign nation-states—and an all-encompassing propaganda whose ideology hails {{the establishment of the}} New World Order as the culmination of history's progress. Many influential historical and contemporary <b>figures</b> <b>have</b> therefore been purported {{to be part of a}} cabal that operates through many front organizations to orchestrate significant political and financial events, ranging from causing systemic crises to pushing through controversial policies, at both national and international levels, as steps in an ongoing plot to achieve world domination.|$|E
