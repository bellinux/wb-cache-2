The facial cystidia (called pleurocystidia) are {{club-shaped}} or elongated ellipses, up to 130–155µm in length. The pleurocystidia protrude <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the gill and act as guards, preventing adjacent gills from touching each other, and also ensuring that the basidia and spores have sufficient room for development. C.micaceus may also have scattered caulocystidia (cystidia on the stem) that are 60–100 by 5–10µm, but their presence is variable and cannot reliably be used for identification. Both De Bary and Buller, in their investigations into the structure of the cystidia, concluded that there is a central mass of cytoplasm formed where numerous thin plates of cytoplasm meet at the center of the cell. De Bary believed that the plates were filamentous branching processes, but Buller thought that they were formed in a process similar to the walls of foam bubbles, and that the central mass was able to slowly change form and position by altering the relative volumes of the vacuoles enclosed by the numerous thin cytoplasmic walls. In older cells, the cytoplasm may be limited to the periphery of the cell, with one huge vacuole occupying the cell center.|$|E

25|$|To {{create the}} mortise for the biscuit, a biscuit joiner is usually required. There are other methods of cutting the slot, {{such as a}} slot cutter bit in a router, but the biscuit joiner is the most common.

On the opposite side of the coast of the Biscay Bay, in Brittany, there are traditions related to the story of Ys, situated in the gulf of Douarnenez, in lands claimed from the sea and protected by a dam. The daughter of the king, Dahud, gave the keys of the city to Satan, who had disguised himself as a beautiful prince: This resulted in the flooding of Ys by the waters of the Ocean.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges to mankind always has been eradicating the presence of debilitating disease. Until just thirty years ago poliomyelitis occurred in the United States and throughout the world in epidemic proportions, striking tens of thousands and killing thousands in our own country each year. Dr. Jonas E. Salk changed all that. This year we observe the 30th anniversary of the licensing and manufacturing of the vaccine discovered by this great American. Even before another successful vaccine was discovered, Dr. Salk's discovery had reduced polio and its effects by 97 percent. Today, polio is not a familiar disease to younger Americans, and many have difficulty appreciating the magnitude of the disorder that the Salk vaccine virtually wiped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Earth.|$|E

500|$|In September 1836, Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt began sinking {{the working}} dies {{that would be}} used to strike the coins.

500|$|At Mantinea, Thebes {{had faced}} down the {{combined}} {{forces of the}} greatest states of Greece, but the victory brought it no spoils. With Epaminondas removed from the scene, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, {{and within a few}} years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system. [...] No Greek state ever again reduced Boeotia to the subjection it had known during the Spartan hegemony, but Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. Finally, at Chaeronea in 338 BC, the combined forces of Thebes and Athens, driven into each other's arms for a desperate last stand against Philip of Macedon, were crushingly defeated, and Theban independence was put to an end. Three years later, heartened by a false rumor that Alexander the Great had been assassinated, the Thebans revolted; Alexander squashed the revolt, then destroyed the city, slaughtering or enslaving all its citizens. A mere 27 years after the death of the man who had made it preeminent throughout Greece, Thebes was wiped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> <b>of</b> the Earth, its 1,000-year history ended {{in the space of a}} few days.|$|E
