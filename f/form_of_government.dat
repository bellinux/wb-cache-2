5|$|Missoula's {{system of}} {{government}} has changed four times since 1883 when an aldermanic <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> was approved with the town charter. The city adopted a commission-council <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in 1911 {{with the opening of}} new City Hall and a council–manager government in 1954 before returning to an aldermanic <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in 1959.

5|$|In 1760, Maria Theresa {{created the}} council of state, {{composed}} of the state chancellor, {{three members of the}} high nobility and three knights, which served as a committee of experienced people who advised her. The council of state lacked executive or legislative authority, but nevertheless showed the difference between the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> employed by Frederick II of Prussia. Unlike the latter, Maria Theresa was not an autocrat who acted as her own minister. Prussia would adopt this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> only after 1807.|$|E
5|$|Teaneck {{is governed}} within the Faulkner Act (formally {{known as the}} Optional Municipal Charter Law) under the Council-Manager <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> (Plan 12), {{implemented}} by direct petition as of July 1, 1988. Following its founding in 1895, Teaneck used the traditional township <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> led by a three-member Township Committee (later expanded to five seats) elected on a partisan basis. On September 16, 1930, Teaneck residents voted to establish a nonpartisan Council-Manager <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> {{under the terms of}} the 1923 Municipal Manager Law, with five members elected concurrently on an at-large basis. In 1962, the Council expanded to its current size of seven members and the position of Deputy Mayor was created. In 1987, a referendum to alter the form to a Faulkner Act Council-Manager <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> was approved, providing for staggered terms for the Council. With this change, Council elections now take place in even years on the second Tuesday in May. The Council's seven members are elected at-large in nonpartisan elections to serve staggered, four-year terms of office. The four seats elected in 2010 will expire in 2014 and the seats of the three who took office in 2012 will expire in 2016, etc.|$|E

In 1892, the Legislature again changed the term of office, extending it to five years. The city adopted a commission <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> under the Walsh Act in 1913. This form provided for five commissioners elected citywide. The Commissioners decided from among themselves which would serve as mayor. All terms were four years.

5|$|In 1911 {{the city}} adopted a {{commission}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> which had three members elected by at-large voting. Considered to be progressive, {{as it would}} reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile {{was one of the}} last cities to retain this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored single-member districts in order to elect candidates of their choice.|$|E

5|$|Mobile's city {{commission}} <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> {{was challenged}} and finally overturned in 1982 in City of Mobile v. Bolden, which was remanded by the United States Supreme Court {{to the district}} court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> in 1911 and at-large positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the {{three members of the}} city commission should be elected from single-member districts, likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a mayor-council <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> with seven members elected from single-member districts. This was approved by voters. As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice. Since the change to single-member districts, more women and African Americans were elected to the council than under the at-large system.|$|E

5|$|Lafayette was a {{firm believer}} in a {{constitutional}} monarchy. He believed that traditional and revolutionary ideals could be melded together by having a democratic National Assembly work with a monarch, as France had always had. His close relationships to Americans such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, who both happened to be Founding Fathers of the United States, gave Lafayette the ability to witness the implementation of a democratic system in a country. His views on potential government structures for France were directly influenced by the American <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> which was in turn influenced by the British <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> For example, Lafayette believed in a bicameral legislature, as the United States had. The Jacobins, however, detested the idea of a monarchy in France; this led to it ultimately being voted against by the National Assembly. This idea only helped lead to his fall from favor, especially when Maximilien Robespierre took power.|$|E
