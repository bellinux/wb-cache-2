Consequently, {{relatively}} few buildings survive from its earlier history and those that <b>do</b> <b>are</b> protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} the polysporangiophytes, more {{formally}} called Polysporangiophyta, {{was first published in}} 1997 by Kenrick and Crane. (The taxobox at the right represents their view of the classification of the polysporangiophytes.) The defining feature of the clade is that the sporophyte branches and bears multiple sporangia. This distinguishes polysporangiophytes from liverworts, mosses and hornworts, which have unbranched sporophytes each with a single sporangium. Polysporangiophytes {{may or may not have}} vascular tissue – those that <b>do</b> <b>are</b> vascular plants or tracheophytes.|$|E

While the Codex Vaticanus {{does not include}} it, the other major manuscripts that <b>do</b> <b>are</b> the Codex Sinaiticus (4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (5th century), and Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus (5th century). In addition, there are numerous papyri, especially that of p47 (3rd century); the minuscules (8th to 10th century), plus fragmentary quotations in the Church fathers of the 2nd to 5th centuries and the 6th century Greek commentary on Revelation by Andreas.|$|E
25|$|Some scholars, such as Carsten Peter Thiede, dispute this presentation. Early Christian leaders did {{not have}} to visit Qumran to have heard of Essene beliefs and read their texts. The various Jewish groups, {{including}} Christians and Essenes, were interconnected and simultaneously adopted some practices and beliefs while rejecting others. While some similarities exist, there are many differences and similar parallels can be also drawn between the early Christians and Pharisees, and other Jewish sects. Many features of Christian faith have no parallels in the texts from Qumran, and some that <b>do</b> <b>are</b> fundamentally distinct from Essene practices and beliefs. Notably, John's act of penitent baptism bears little resemblance to the daily baptismal ritual of the Essenes.|$|E

A cat possesses a very fair sense of the ridiculous, and will put her paw down kindly but firmly upon any nonsense of this kind. Dogs, however, seem to like it. They encourage their owners in the tomfoolery, and the consequence {{is that in the}} circles I am speaking of what [...] "dear Fido" [...] has done, does do, will do, won't do, can <b>do,</b> can't <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>is</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>is</b> going to <b>do,</b> shall do, shan't <b>do,</b> and <b>is</b> about to be going to have <b>done</b> <b>is</b> the continual theme of discussion from morning till night.|$|R
25|$|Since {{linear algebra}} is a {{successful}} theory, its methods have been developed and generalized {{in other parts of}} mathematics. In module theory, one replaces the field of scalars by a ring. The concepts of linear independence, span, basis, and dimension (which is called rank in module theory) still make sense. Nevertheless, many theorems from linear algebra become false in module theory. For instance, not all modules have a basis (those that <b>do</b> <b>are</b> called free modules), the rank of a free module is not necessarily unique, not every linearly independent subset of a module can be extended to form a basis, and not every subset of a module that spans the space contains a basis.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to <b>do</b> <b>are</b> usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|According to ECPAT International, when sex {{industry}} {{women and children}} victims are held in police custody or remand homes, denied freedom and access to information, or abused by police, they are encouraged to lie about their situation and try to escape, so community assistance services are substantially less useful. Similar failures occur when court procedures do not allow victim testimony or representation or, when they <b>do,</b> <b>are</b> neither victim-friendly nor children-friendly; or when decisions on children's futures seldom include the opinions of children, or when {{the right to privacy}} is violated by media reporting, or by stigmatization of and discrimination against children exploited in prostitution. Governments have the duty to provide services to children, but sharing that duty with nonprofits by coordination, monitoring, and support, especially with respect to periodic review of placement, is likely to have the best results. Protection measures for children at all stages of the legal process has not been sufficiently implemented through children-friendly courts, justice systems and law enforcement agencies. Decriminalization of children exploited in prostitution is a substantial gap in addressing survival sex worldwide. Successful law enforcement partnerships have included a campaign of brothel-based prostitutes who policed the recruitment of under-age girls in Bangladesh.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} World War the carpets {{started to be}} {{produced}} for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class {{of the twentieth century}} aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their 'best' room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred mainly in the Midlands around the towns of Wilton and Kidderminster and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist and the few that <b>do</b> <b>are</b> either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce bespoke (custom-made) luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.|$|E
