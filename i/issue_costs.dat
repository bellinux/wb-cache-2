40|$|Debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> {{generally}} are incurred {{in connection with}} the issuance of debt securities or other short- or long-term borrowings. Opinion 21 requires that debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> be reported in the balance sheet as deferred charges. Generally, debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> are capitalized as an asset and amortized over the term of the debt. Statement 95 requires that cash receipts and payments in a statement of cash flows be classified as operating, investing, or financing activities. However, some believe that Statement 95 does not provide specific guidance on the classification of debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> in the statement of cash flows. Because debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> have aspects of more than one class of cash flows, diversity in practice has arisen. Some companies have reported the cash outflow for debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> as a financing activity, while others have reported the outflow for those costs as an operating activity. The issue is how cash payments for debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> should be classified in the statement of cash flows. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that cash payments for debt <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> should be classified in the statement of cash flows as a financing activity.

40|$|Prior {{research}} of common stock offerings reaches different conclusions concerning {{the impact of}} <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> on stock value. We identify factors that can best explain the different findings—most prominent are the <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> measure and the listing. We investigate 323 common stock offerings and find that $ 61 of every $ 100 fall in stock value {{can be attributed to}} <b>issue</b> <b>costs.</b> The respective dollar amounts for the samples of OTC, AMEX, and NYSE firms are $ 72, $ 69, and $ 38. These findings suggest that the collective impact of the negative wealth effects from managerial signaling may be less important than generally assumed. Mikkelson and Partch (1986) and Hull and Fortin (1993 / 1994) are the only studies to examine in detail the impact of <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> on announcement period stock returns for equity offerings.

I find that banks' holding loans {{have a negative effect}} on price discounts and no effect on underwriting fees. However, banks' equity holdings have no effect on discount rates and a positive effect on underwriting fees. Furthermore, issuers with unhealthy banks pay higher discount rates, are more likely to be weak in their ex-post operating performance, and are less willing to switch underwriters.

The study focuses {{on the impact of}} such regulatory change on <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> for corporations raising seasoned common equity. The findings indicate that although regulatory reform per se has had no effect on <b>issue</b> <b>costs,</b> costs for issues handled by a bank-owned underwriter are lower than those handled by an independent underwriter. The lower cost may be indicative of the availability of economies of scope between underwriting and commercial banking.

However {{the responsibility}} for this work, and any possible shortcomings, remain the authors’. U. S. -bound IPOs: <b>Issue</b> <b>Costs</b> and Market Selectivity We examine initial public offerings (IPOs) by foreign firms in the U. S. market between 1990 and 1997, and compare their direct and indirect <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> to IPOs by U. S. firms. Our results indicate that foreign IPOs involve approximately the same costs on average as domestic IPOs, for all except those experiencing strong demand and upward revisions in the offer price {{over the course of}} the road show. For upwardly revised IPOs, foreign IPOs have significantly lower underpricing compared to domestic IPOs. For these offers, we find that lower underpricing is associated with less risk due to the generally greater quality of foreign issuers. It is also the case that these offers are sold more frequently in multiple markets. In addition, we observe lower underpricing for IPOs from emerging markets, which is consistent with demand being driven to some extent by diversification. Overall, we uncover no evidence to suggest that foreign IPOs experience greater capital raising costs than domestic IPOs. 1 U.

40|$|We examine Japan's 1997 {{introduction}} of book building {{as an alternative}} to a previously required hybrid auction method. Despite higher cost for some issuers, all issuers in Japan now select book building. Book building enables more accurate valuation of firms, but gains from accurate valuation are partly redistributive. Thus book building can drive auction-method offerings from the market even if it yields no aggregate benefit. Compared to the auction regime, book building reduces <b>issue</b> <b>costs</b> for large issuers. Auctioning is less costly for small issuers, but appears to foreclose some small firms from issuing. The aggregate costs of book building and auctioning are similar. Copyright 2004, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E
