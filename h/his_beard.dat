5|$|After his defeat, Macrinus {{sent his}} son Diadumenian to Artabanus V of Parthia, while he himself {{returned}} to Antioch, proclaiming himself victorious over Elagabalus in battle. News spread of Macrinus' defeat, however, and many civilians who had supported him were slain {{in the city}} and on the roads. Macrinus then shaved off <b>his</b> <b>beard</b> and hair to disguise himself {{as a member of the}} military police. Fleeing the city at night on horseback, he reached Cilicia along with a few companions, masqueraded as a military courier, and secured a carriage to drive to Eribolon, near Nicomedia. From there he set sail for Chalcedon.|$|E
5|$|Sviatoslav's {{appearance}} {{has been}} described very clearly by Leo the Deacon, who himself attended the meeting of Sviatoslav with John I Tzimiskes. Following Deacon's memories, Sviatoslav was a blue-eyed male of average height but of stalwart build, much more sturdy than Tzimiskes. He shaved his blond head and <b>his</b> <b>beard</b> but wore a bushy mustache and a sidelock {{as a sign of}} his nobility. He preferred to dress in white, and it was noted that his garments were much cleaner than those of his men, although he had a lot in common with his warriors. He wore a single large gold earring bearing a carbuncle and two pearls.|$|E
5|$|Textiles dyed with royal purple, {{a symbol}} of social status, {{were found in the}} royal hypogeum. Judging by the royal statues found in the royal hypogeum antechamber, a king of Qatna wore clothes {{different}} from those worn in Mesopotamia; his robes would have reached his ankles and the hem on his shawl {{would have been in the}} shape of a thick rope, while <b>his</b> <b>beard</b> was short and his headdress consisted of a broad band. For royal primary burials, several steps were followed: constructing the burial container, anointing the body with oil, heating the body, leading the burial procession, laying the sarcophagus floor with textiles, burying the body with another layer of textiles, and finally depositing a layer of plants and herbs. Elephants, which lived in western Syria, were esteemed in Qatna and connected to the royal family; they were apparently hunted by the royals and the king himself, as there is evidence that their bones were displayed in the palace; thus, elephants were part of the royal ideology and hunting an elephant was {{a symbol of}} prestige that glorified the strength of the king.|$|E

5|$|Vikram {{began his}} {{professional}} career by modelling in advert films for brands including Chola Tea, TVS Excel and Alwyn watches {{as well as}} appearing in a six episode television serial titled Galatta Kudumbam which aired between November and December 1988. During {{the final year of}} his M.B.A programme at Loyola College, he was recognised by the film industry, with veteran director C. V. Sridhar approaching him for a lead role in a film. Vikram made his film debut in 1990 by appearing in En Kadhal Kanmani, a small budget love story featuring him alongside Rekha Nambiar, with Sridhar's Thanthu Vitten Ennai opposite Rohini being his next release. He then signed on {{to be a part of}} cinematographer P. C. Sriram's college love story, Meera with high expectations, however the three films failed to launch his career. His appearances in Meera and in Kaaval Geetham, with another veteran director S. P. Muthuraman, helped him secure film offers from the Malayalam and Telugu film industries. In 1993, he almost signed on to appear in Mani Ratnam's Bombay and featured in the initial photo shoot alongside Manisha Koirala. However Mani Ratnam wanted Vikram to remove <b>his</b> <b>beard</b> for the role, and Vikram could not do so due to continuity problems with another film he had signed and hence was dropped from the project.|$|E

25|$|Having {{previously}} instructed Hasan {{to follow}} Army regulations and shave a beard he had grown, the judge, Colonel Gregory Gross, {{found him in}} contempt in July 2012 and fined him.
