Oven control system has {{the characteristics of}} non-linearity, time delays and setpoint response. It is difficult to overcome {{the effects of these}} factors and get the satisfactory results without appropriately tuning of the PID controller gains required for stability and good transient performance. The Ziegler-Nichols closed loop, Good Gain and Skogestad’s are the PID tuning methods implemented in this paper to control the output temperature of the <b>gas-fired</b> <b>oven</b> system. The PID tuning methods are compared, based on their rise time, maximum overshoot and settling time. The performance of Skogestad’s tuning method at different temperature set point is superior to Ziegler-Nichols closed loop and Good Gain PID tuning method...|$|E

Refined soybean oils were degraded at 190 C for 60 hours. It was observed that degradation time correlated well with free fatty acid contents, total polar materials, convective heat transfer coefficient, color, specific gravity, viscosity, and surface tension. The off-flavor and foaming developed during frying suggested that the soybean oil should have been discarded after 25 hours of use when the amount of total polar materials reached 27 %. The abused soybean oil (degraded for 60 hr) showed a different temperature profile during frying as compared with the fresh oil. The levels of oil degradation did not pose any significant effects on oil content, moisture content, and fracturability. Tortillas were prepared under different pre-frying conditions, i. e., oven-baked in an air forced oven at 190 C for 3. 5 min (OBL), oven-baked in a 3 -tiered <b>gas-fired</b> <b>oven</b> at 343 'C, 190 C, and 190 C for the top, middle, and bottom,, respectively, for 71 sec (OBH), raw, and freezing OBH at- 12 C for 24 hours (FT). These tortillas were fried in fresh soybean oil for 60 sec at 190 'C and quality of the final products were analyzed. The initial moisture content of the tortilla affected the final oil content of the chip, significantly. The pre-frying treatments affected the final oil and moisture contents of tortilla chips. Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) pictures demonstrated that the starch/protein matrix {{and the size of the}} pores throughout the chip were the most important factors affecting the force needed to break through the tortilla chips...|$|E
40|$|Obesity, glucose {{intolerance}} or insulin resistance and elevated blood pressure are now {{prevalent in the}} U. S. Increased intake of dietary fiber, omega- 3 fatty acids, and antioxidants may help prevent or manage these diseases. Tortillas {{are now part of}} the American diet, and are excellent carriers of higher amounts of fiber and other nutraceutical ingredients. This study was conducted {{to determine the effects of}} incorporating nutraceutical ingredients (flaxseed, sorghum bran, oat flour, buckwheat flour) on whole white wheat tortilla quality. Tortillas were prepared using a hot-press, <b>gas-fired</b> <b>oven</b> and were evaluated for physical properties, texture and shelf-stability. Objective and subjective tests demonstrated that whole white wheat and multigrain tortilla doughs were harder, rougher and less extensible than refined flour tortilla dough. Multigrain flour tortillas were thinner, larger and more translucent than the refined flour treatment. Incorporation of whole multigrain flours affected color of the product, giving darker tortillas. Tortilla flexibility decreased over time. After 16 days of storage rollability scores of tortillas decreased drastically. The most pronounced decrease in tortilla flexibility was observed for 5 % sorghum bran, 10 % buckwheat, and for the treatment prepared with of 5 % flax, 5 % sorghum, 5 % oat, 5 % buckwheat. The flexibility loss was higher for whole white wheat and multigrain tortillas than for the refined one which was confirmed with objective and subjective tests. To extend shelf stability of whole multigrain tortillas various amounts of commercial hydrocolloid and ?-amylase were added to the formulation. Tortillas with 75 ppm, 100 ppm of ?-amylase, 1 % and 1. 5 % of gum retained their flexibility during 16 days of storage. Consumer acceptability of the whole multigrain tortillas (5 % flaxseed, 5 % sorghum bran, 5 % oat, 5 % buckwheat) was compared with commercial multigrain tortillas and whole white wheat flour tortillas using an untrained sensory panel. The multigrain tortillas were liked by the panel as much as the other samples. Prepared multigrain tortillas had improved nutritional value. Each multigrain treatment contained at least 3 g of dietary fiber, 0. 29 g of ?- linolenic fatty acid, lignans and antioxidants. It makes possible to claim them as a ?good source of dietary fiber? and ?an excellent source of ?-linolenic fatty acid?. The formulations tested, together with future refinements, provide more options to consumers seeking healthier alternatives to refined wheat flour tortillas...|$|E

40|$|This study {{presented}} {{the development and}} optimization of operational parameters of an indigenous <b>gas-fired</b> bread-baking <b>oven</b> for small-scale entrepreneur. It is an insulated rectangular box-like chamber, made of galvanized-steel sheets and having a total dimension of 920 mm× 650 mm× 600 mm. This oven consists of two baking compartments and three combustion chambers. The oven characteristics were evaluated {{in terms of the}} baking capacity, baking efficiency and weight loss of the baked bread. The physical properties of the baked breads were measured and analyzed using Duncan multiple range test of one way ANOVA at significant level of p< 0. 05. These properties were optimized to determine the optimum baking temperature using 3 D surface response plot of Statistical Release 7. The baking capacity, baking efficiency, weight loss and optimum baking temperature were: 12. 5 kg/hr, 87. 8 %, 12. 5 g, 200 - 220 oC, respectively. The physical properties of baked bread dough were found to correspond with the imported product (control sample). These results showed that, the developed <b>gas-fired</b> baking <b>oven</b> can be adopted for baking of bread at domestic and commercial levels...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two primary}} {{technologies}} using the Hall-Héroult process: Söderberg technology and prebake technology.In Söderberg or self-baking anodes using cells, {{there is a}} single anode per electrolysis cell. The anode is in a frame and as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into CO2 during the electrolysis the anode loses mass and being amorphous it slowly sinks within its frame. More material {{to the top of the}} anode is continuously added in the form of briquettes made from coke and pitch. The lost heat from the smelting operation is used to bake the briquettes into the carbon form required for reaction with alumina. This baking process in Söderberg anodes during electrolysis releases more carcinogenic PAHs and other pollutants than electrolysis with prebaked anodes and partially for this reason prebaked anodes using cells have become more common in aluminum industry. More alumina is added to the electrolyte from the sides of the Söderberg anode after the crust on top of the electrolyte mixture is broken.Prebake technology is named after its anodes, which are baked in very large <b>gas-fired</b> <b>ovens</b> at high temperature before being lowered by various heavy industrial lifting systems into the electrolytic solution. There usually are 24 prebaked anodes in two rows in one cell. Each anode is lowered vertically and individually by a computer as the bottom surfaces of the anodes are eaten away during the electrolysis. Compared to Söderberg anodes computer controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis. This smaller distance decreases the resistance caused by the electrolyte mixture and increases the efficiency of prebaked anodes over Söderberg anodes. Prebake technology also has much lower risk of the anode effect (see below) happening, but cells using it are more expensive to build and labor-intensive to use as each prebaked anode in a cell needs to be removed and replaced once it has been used. Alumina is added to the electrolyte from between the anodes in prebake technology using cells.|$|R
40|$|A {{new method}} is {{described}} for computer management of baking ovens, installed by Burtons Gold Medal Biscuits {{as part of}} a company program for building quality assurance into their production operations. The method incorporates data from in-line colour and moisture sensors. The scheme was applied first to a direct <b>gas-fired</b> five zone <b>oven,</b> of a style used in many biscuit and cookie plants in Britain and the USA. The paper reviews the technical features of this type of oven, and describes in detail the introduction of closed-loop computer control. The method includes feedforward as well as feedback control; an advantage of the method is that the oven is automatically reset to a low heat input pattern during a break in production, and full heat input is automatically restored on restart...|$|R
