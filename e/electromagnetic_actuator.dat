50|$|Electromagnetic {{clutches}} {{are most}} suitable for remote operation since no mechanical linkages are required to control their engagement, providing fast, smooth operation. However, because the activation energy dissipates as heat in the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuator</b> when the clutch is engaged, {{there is a risk}} of overheating. Consequently, the maximum operating temperature of the clutch is limited by the temperature rating of the insulation of the electromagnet. This is a major limitation. Another disadvantage is higher initial cost.|$|E
50|$|Crew lives {{depended}} on {{the integrity of the}} gondola skin: pressure suits, developed by Evgeniy Chertovsky since 1931, were not operational yet. Life support consisted of pressurized oxygen tanks and chemical carbon dioxide absorption packages; all crewmembers carried personal parachutes. Radio transceiver was carried within the gondola; most scientific instruments externally. The latter included sets of ingeniously designed bottles for taking samples of air; their sealed necks were broken open by an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuator</b> and re-sealed by heating the neck with an electric current running through an exposed platinum wire. New pyranometers designed for USSR-1 were not used on its first mission.|$|E
40|$|AbstractModern <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuators,</b> in {{particular}} proportional solenoids, are complex mechatronic systems, including both an actuator and its control system. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>actuators</b> {{are often used}} in control systems of increased liability and therefore continuously evolving.

50|$|Active {{vibration}} isolation systems contain, {{along with the}} spring, a feedback circuit which consists of a sensor (for example a piezoelectric accelerometer or a geophone), a controller, and an actuator. The acceleration (vibration) signal is processed by a control circuit and amplifier. Then it feeds the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuator,</b> which amplifies the signal. As {{a result of such}} a feedback system, a considerably stronger suppression of vibrations is achieved compared to ordinary damping. Active isolation today is used for applications where structures smaller than a micrometer have to be produced or measured. A couple of companies produce active isolation products as OEM for research, metrology, lithography and medical systems. Another important application is the semiconductor industry. In the microchip production, the smallest structures today are below 20 nm, so the machines which produce and check them have to oscillate much less.|$|E
50|$|In 1994 Aura Systems {{launched}} the Interactor Vest, conceived by Aura's VP of Audio and Video Technologies, Larry Shultz to feel sound from {{video games and}} TV shows. The Interactor was a wearable force-feedback device that monitors an audio signal and uses Aura's patented <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuator</b> technology to convert bass sound waves into vibrations that can represent such actions as a punch or kick. The Interactor vest plugs into the audio output of a stereo, TV, or VCR and the user is provided with controls that allow for adjusting of the intensity of vibration and filtering out of high frequency sounds. The Interactor Vest is worn over the upper torso and the audio signal is reproduced through a speaker embedded in the vest. Sales numbers are unclear, but have numbers as low as 5000 of its Interactor Vest sold in Toys R Us and other electronics stores. Aura later began shipping the Interactor Cushion, a device which operates like the Vest but instead of being worn, it's placed against a seat back and the user must lean against it. Both the Vest and the Cushion were launched with a price tag of $99.|$|E
50|$|To {{circumvent}} the transonic problems encountered by spin-stabilized projectiles, projectiles can theoretically be guided during flight. The Sandia National Laboratories announced in January 2012 it has researched and test-fired 4-inch (102 mm) long prototype dart-like, self-guided bullets for small-caliber, smooth-bore firearms that could hit laser-designated targets at distances {{of more than}} a mile (about 1,610 meters or 1760 yards). These projectiles are not spin stabilized and the flight path can be course adjusted with an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuator</b> 30 times per second. The researchers also claim they have video of the bullet radically pitching as it exits the barrel and pitching less as it flies down range, a disputed phenomenon known to long-range firearms experts as “going to sleep”. Because the bullet’s motions settle the longer it is in flight, accuracy improves at longer ranges, Sandia researcher Red Jones said. “Nobody had ever seen that, but we’ve got high-speed video photography that shows that it’s true,” he said. Since Sandia is seeking a private company partner to complete testing of the prototype and bring a guided bullet to the marketplace, the future of this technology remains uncertain.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn {{adaptive}} control algorithm of a fast <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>actuator</b> {{has been developed}} without using position, velocity, or acceleration sensors.
