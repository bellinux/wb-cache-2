40|$|An energy {{dissipation}} mechanism is an indispensable {{part of a}} tuned mass damper system, since it reduces the mass stroke of a system to a manageable level. Dry friction is a natural source of {{energy dissipation}} for tuned mass dampers. Nevertheless, {{there is no difference}} between a <b>friction-type</b> tuned mass damper and a dead mass added to the primary structure if static friction force inactivates the mass damper. To overcome this disadvantage, this paper proposes a novel semi-active <b>friction-type</b> multiple tuned mass damper (SAF-MTMD) for vibration control of seismic structures. Using variable friction mechanisms, the proposed SAF-MTMD system is able to keep all of its mass units activated in an earthquake with arbitrary intensity. A comparison with a system using passive <b>friction-type</b> multiple tuned mass dampers (PF-MTMDs) demonstrates that the SAF-MTMD effectively suppresses the seismic motion of a structural system, while substantially reducing the strokes of each mass unit, especially for a larger intensity earthquake. This means that applying the SAF-MTMD requires less installation space than a PF-MTMD system. The current study also shows that the SAF-MTMD performs well in a low-intensity earthquake, in which the PF-MTMD is inactivated due to friction. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

While the acceleration amplitude of such long-period ground motion is small, the velocity amplitude is fairly large. It is expected that high-rise buildings and base-isolated buildings with long fundamental natural periods are greatly influenced by these long-period ground motions. Especially base-isolated high-rise buildings with <b>friction-type</b> bearings may have remarkable mechanical characteristics unfavourable for these long-period ground motions. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reveal that the long-period ground motions recorded in Japan have the intensity to make base-isolated high-rise buildings in resonance with long-period components and that careful treatment is inevitable in the structural design of these base-isolated high-rise buildings.

Three different modal analysis methods are investigated.

Energy dissipation via friction mechanisms is an effective means for mitigating the vibration of seismic structures. A <b>friction-type</b> TMD, i. e. a nonlinear TMD, has the advantages of energy dissipation via a friction mechanism without requiring additional damping devices. However, a passive-friction TMD (PF-TMD) has such disadvantages as a fixed and predetermined slip load and may lose its tuning and energy dissipation abilities when it is in the stick state. A novel semi-active-friction TMD (SAF-TMD) is used to overcome these disadvantages. The proposed SAF-TMD has the following features. (1) The frictional force of the SAF-TMD can be regulated in accordance with system responses. (2) The frictional force can be amplified via a braking mechanism. (3) A large TMD stroke can be utilized to enhance control performance. A non-sticking friction control law, which can keep the SAF-TMD activated throughout an earthquake with an arbitrary intensity, was applied. The performance of the PF-TMD and SAF-TMD systems in protecting seismic structures was investigated numerically. The results demonstrate that the SAF-TMD performs better than the PF-TMD and can prevent a residual stroke that may occur in a PF-TMD system. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|E
40|$|A {{dissertation}} report Submitted in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of engineering in ElectricalFrictionless braking of wind turbine is a robust technique which is used {{in order to provide}} effective braking for wind turbines which is a non-conventional source. It provides safety against failures like over-speeding of wind turbines. It is advantageous because it provides suitable braking by frictionless brake. Most of the braking systems utilize friction forces to transform the kinetic energy of a moving body into heat that is dissipated by the braking pads. The over use of <b>friction-type</b> braking systems causes the temperature of the braking pads to rise, reducing the effectiveness of the system. There relative motion between the magnet and the metal (or alloy) conductor produces an eddy current that induces a reverse magnetic field and results in deceleration. This braking is provided by generation of eddy current phenomena. This eddy current is produce in the stationary plate which opposes the rotary motion of rotating plate and finally rotating plate is being stopped. The many of advantages it having non-contact, no wear, no electric actuation,light in weight so it can be very useful for wind turbine. Without using friction, an eddy-current braking system transforms the kinetic energy of the moving body into heat energy that is dissipated through the eddy current in the conductor. This concept is used for the braking of wind turbine to avoid the failure of wind turbine...|$|E

In {{the context of a}} free precession model, this corresponds to a decrease in the precession period P_fp. We investigate how a precession model can account for such a decrease in P_fp, in terms of an increase over time in the absolute biaxial deformation (|ϵ_p|∼ 10 ^- 8) of this pulsar. We perform a Bayesian model comparison against the 'base' precession model (with constant ϵ_p) developed in Ashton et al (2016), and we obtain decisive odds in favour of a time-varying deformation. We study two types of time-variation: (i) a linear drift with a posterior estimate of ϵ̇_p∼ 10 ^- 18 s^- 1 and odds of 10 ^ 75 compared to the base-model, and (ii) N discrete positive jumps in ϵ_p with very similar odds to the linear ϵ_p-drift model.

A viscous damper {{is used as}} a passive control device and a variable damper, developed from an MR (magnetorheological) damper, {{is used as a}} semi-active control device. The study is based on the simplified lumped-mass finite-element model of the 91 / 5 highway bridge in Southern California. The prime aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of viscous dampers and variable dampers with a <b>friction-type</b> damping force scheme and a two-step viscous damping force scheme, with important parametric variation. Velocity-and displacement-dependent models of a variable damper are used. Numerical simulations are conducted by installing the devices between the deck and abutments of the bridge.

The results of the investigation clearly indicate that the base shear and mid-span displacement are reduced substantially by these protective devices. It is concluded that variable dampers are quite effective in considerably reducing the large bearing displacements, thereby eliminating the isolator damages. The control effect of a viscous damper, and the two pre-set damping schemes of a variable damper in particular, is quite satisfactory in reducing the peak response quantities of the bridge to a level comparable to or better than that of the sample passive, semi-active and active controllers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} {{interfacial}} shear strength (ISS) on the mechanical and damping properties of carbon nanotube reinforced composites (CNT-RCs) is investigated {{in the present}} study using a multiscale simulation. The atomic lattice of CNTs is modeled with the modified molecular structural mechanics (MMSM) approach and reduced to an equivalent beam element (EBE) which is used as the basic building block for the construction of full length CNTs embedded in the polymer. Linear material properties are assigned to the EBEs, while a Maxwell–Wiechert material model is used for modeling the viscoelastic behavior of the polymer. The interfacial load transfer mechanism between the lateral surface of the carbon nanotube and the surrounding matrix is taken into account with a nonlinear bond-slip <b>friction-type</b> model. Finite element models of representative volume elements (RVEs) are constructed comprised of two independent meshes: a structured with solid elements for the matrix and a series of embedded EBEs for the full length CNTs inside the matrix.

In the case of wavy CNTs, random CNT geometries are generated using the spectral representation method with evolutionary power spectra (EPS) which are derived from processing scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. Stochastic average properties were derived with Monte Carlo simulation. The mechanical and damping properties of the CNT-RCs are assessed on the basis of sensitivity analyses with respect to various weight fractions and interfacial shear strength (ISS) values.

40|$|Impingement after reverse {{shoulder}} arthroplasty (RSA) {{is believed}} to occur from repetitive contact in adduction between the humeral component and the inferior scapular pillar. The primary purpose of this biomechanical study was to confirm the presence {{of different types of}} impingement and to examine which daily-life movements are responsible for them. A secondary aim was to provide recommendations on the type of components that would best minimize notching and loss of range of motion (ROM). The study included 12 fresh frozen shoulder specimens; each had a computed tomography (CT) image of the entire scapula and humerus in order to acquire topological information of the bones before RSA implantation. Cyclic tests were run postimplantation with 3 shoulders in each modalities. To quantify bone loss due to impingement, 3 -dimensional anatomical models of the scapula were reconstructed from the CT scans and compared to their intact states. We found 8 bony impingements in 7 specimens: 2 at the lateral acromion, 1 at the inferior acromion, 4 scapular notching, and 1 with the glenoid resulting to wear at the 3 : 00 to 6 : 00 clock-face position. Impingements occurred in all kinds of tested motions, except for the internal/external rotation at 90 ° of abduction. The 3 specimens tested in abduction/adduction presented bone loss on the acromion side only. Scapular notching was noted in flexion/extension and in internal/external rotation at 0 ° of abduction. The humeral polyethylene liner was worn in 2 specimens- 1 at the 6 : 00 to 8 : 00 clock-face position during internal/external rotation at 0 ° of abduction and 1 at the 4 : 00 clock-face position during flexion/extension. The present study revealed that 2 types of impingement interactions coexist and correspond to a frank abutment or lead to a scapular notching (<b>friction-type</b> impingement). Scapular notching seems to be caused by more movements or combination of movements than previously considered, and in particular by movements of flexion/extension and internal/external rotation with the arm at the side.

Relevant performance assessment procedures, based on effective experimental verification methods [1] and refined numerical simulation models [2], are quickly evolving as well. New or improved building materials and innovative protection technologies offer updated solutions to the constantly increasing capacity requirements in structural, geotechnical, plant, and mechanical engineering design and rehabilitation.

The objective of this special issue was to provide readers with a representative outlook of the latest achievements in this field, including emerging aspects in modelling, testing, manufacturing, and practical implementation studies. The response {{of the scientific community}} was encouraging, with over 100 manuscripts submitted. The published papers offer a selected and articulated overview of the examined topics. Several papers are dedicated to concrete, reinforced concrete (R/C) members, and cement composites. J. Zhang and J. Li develop a semi-implicit constitutive integration algorithm for elastoplastic damage models, specially implemented for concrete. Literature mechanical tests of reinforced concrete components are numerically simulated, showing the effectiveness of the numerical method in history-dependent energy estimation within this class of nonlinear problems. H. Ding et al. examine the failure criteria and the constitutive relation of early-age concrete,with the aimof providing a theoretical basis for a novel strategy in early dismantling formwork construction of floors, aimed at accelerating formwork recycling as well as at reducing construction costs. Y. Shen et al. propose a paper spool-inspired anchoring method and a pretension procedure for carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) sheets, for themanufacturing of prestressed concrete flat slabs. Laboratory flexural tests confirm the feasibility of this novel reinforcement technique, showing that uniformity of the fiber stress during tensioning is a key aspect for the successful application of prestress. Improved flexural calculation models for R/C members built with ultrahigh performance concrete (i. e., with cubic compressive strength exceeding 200 MPa) are presented by B. -I. Bae et al., who revise the normal stress distribution schemes adopted for standard concrete classes. The models are verified and validated by means Hindawi Publishing Corporation Advances in Materials Science and Engineering Volume 2016, Article ID 1854839, 3 pages [URL] 2 Advances in Materials Science and Engineering of laboratory flexural tests on representative specimens in this case too. High strength concrete materials, with cubic compressive strength ranging fromabout 80 MPa to 110 MPa, are examined in the paper of L. Zeng et al., as constituting materials of R/C beam-to-column joints encasing I-shaped hot-rolled steel profiles. An extensive campaign of cyclic tests on half-scale weak-type joints allows evaluating the beneficial influence of the adopted concrete classes in terms of strength {{and at the same time}} a minimal decrease in ductility, as compared to the cyclic performance of similar joints cast with standard concretes. Composite concretesteel tubular columns are the topic of the article by S. Jayaganesh et al. An experimental programme is carried out to evaluate the effects of the partial compression of square and circular cross sections, highlighting a reduction in strength in comparison to full compression, more accentuated in the case of the square shape. The correlation of the test results with the predictions of the analytical models proposed in the literature to account for these effects seems rather satisfactory. Another experimental activity is reported in the paper by J. Deng et al., dedicated to a campaign of pseudostatic cyclic tests of one-fifth scale prototype R/C bridge piers, damaged and repaired by means of a steel-tube jacketing traditional technique, or by wrapping interventions based on the use of CFRP or basalt fiber reinforced polymer (BFRP) sheets. The results attest satisfactory performance in all cases, with a significant increase in lateral stiffness and strength provided by jacketing as compared to the original response capacity, and its complete restoration in the case of the two FRP-based retrofitmeasures. The advantages of the lattermethod consist in lower physical intrusion and quicker installation times. The postprocessing study of an experimental programme carried out by the pseudodynamic method on a set of 13 R/C shear walls is presented in the article of F. J. Molina et al., where the results of the seismic tests are elaborated by an innovative strategy that allows deriving a capacity-linemodel. With this approach it is possible to understand better the different safety margins that are observed in the experiments depending on the assigned eigenfrequency in relation to the earthquake response spectra. The effects of the amount of reinforcement and normal load are also assessed. Enhanced cement composite materials are investigated in the articles by H. Choi et al. and J. Lai et al. The former deals with the experimental characterization of an innovative Portland cement mortar, prepared by incorporating multiwalled carbon nanotubes in the mixture. The experimentally measured compressive strength is greater than the one offered by standard Portland mortars, as a consequence of the bridging action of the nanotubes, which prevents the progression of microcracks and helps reducing the space between the voids in the hydration material. In J. Lay et al. ’s paper, cement fly ash gravel is examined as constituting material of pile composite foundations, for their updated use in saturated tailing dams. A finite element analysis of the settlements of this type of foundation, calibrated on the experimental investigation carried out by other authors, assesses a stable and rather homogeneous response under the design embankment loads. Three articles are dedicated to advanced seismic protection technologies. In the paper byM. Ismail et al., a numerical study of a base isolation system incorporating Roll-in-Cage devices recently developed by the authors is carried out by simulating its incorporation in a three-span prestressed R/C box girder-type bridge. The results show a remarkable global performance of the system, also in comparison with other seismic isolation solutions, highlighting its benefits in the potential application to bridge structures. The article of F. Mazza and A. Vulcano reports a shaking table testing programme developed on a one-third scale base-isolated steel frame structure equipped with an in-parallel combination of steel-PTFE sliders and elastomeric bearings (HDRBs). The experimental response confirms the high level of protection offered by the isolation technology and establishes a database for a refined numericalmodelling of the constituting devices. J. W. Hu and M. -H. Noh present a study on selfcentering friction dissipative steel braces including special components fabricated with shape-memory alloy wires and <b>friction-type</b> dampers. A numerical investigation carried out on single-degree-of-freedom models allows formulating a design methodology aimed at mutually optimising the recentering and energy dissipation capacities of the passive protection system, with a view to its practical implementation. Two more papers deal with the application of innovative FRP composite materials in various fields of engineering. N. B. Baba et al. examine the mechanical and physical behaviour of a hybrid glass FRP (GFRP) fabricated with three different types of glass fibers— 3 D, woven, and chopped— combined with a mixture of polyester resin and hardener. Fiber arrangement and volume are varied to evaluate the combination capable of providing the best performance in terms of tensile strength and water absorption, which is identified by means of the characterisation test developed in the study. In the article by M. E. Tas¸delen et al. the torsional behaviour of novel braided sleeve composite shafts consisting of carbon and glass fibers is investigated. Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding and vacuum bagging are adopted as manufacturing methods. The results of the experimental programme and the relevant finite element simulations underline that, for the same configuration of layup sequences, the highest torque and tensile strengths are obtained for test specimens manufactured with the former method. Furthermore, hybrid carbon-glass solutions strike the best balance between strength performance and costs. Special issues are dealt with in the remaining three articles. By considering the growing applications of piezoelectric structures in innovative technical areas, L. M. Zhou et al. implement a mixed cell-based smoothed/extended finite element method for a careful electromechanical crack analysis of the constituting material. The case study examples presented in the paper show that this mixed method is more accurate and quickly converging than a standard finite element calculation, also bypassing the mapping process inherent to the latter, which significantly increases the complexity of the calculation. J. Chen et al. report an on-site experimental study of the cooling effect of crushed rock-based embankments on slope wetlands situated along a railway line. A monitoring system installed in an embankment of notable dimensions allows reconstructing the temperature fields and the freezing Advances in Materials Science and Engineering 3 history with time. The surveyed data show that only the embankment shady side can be effectively cooled down in a warm permafrost region, and the crushed rock-based embankment can cool the entire embankment in a cold permafrost region. Finally, in the paper by Y. Ou et al. an innovative self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS) process to prepare amorphous boron powder, which is an attractive material in several enhanced engineering applications, is discussed. The new technique proposed in this study consists in combining the SHS process and the traditional magnesium thermal reduction method. The effectiveness of the resulting technique suggests its possible industrial application and adoption as a common approach to prepare various inorganic materials. JRC.
