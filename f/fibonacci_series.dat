40|$|We {{consider}} the lacunary Dirichlet series obtained {{by taking the}} reciprocals of the s-th powers of the <b>Fibonacci</b> numbers. This <b>series</b> admits an analytic continuation to the entire complex plane. Its special values at integral arguments are then studied. If the argument is a negative integer, the value is algebraic. If the argument is a positive even integer, the value is transcendental by Nesterenko’s work. This {{is a result of}} Duverney, Ke. Nishioka, Ku. Nishioka and Shiokawa. We present a simplified proof of their result. If the argument is 1, the value {{has been shown to be}} irrational by André-Jeannin. We present a slight modification of Duverney’s proof of this fact. At the same time, we highlight the “modular connection ” of these questions as well as signal some new results in the theory of special values of q-analogues of classical Dirichlet L-functions. ...|$|R
40|$|Atmospheric flows exhibit cantorian fractal space-time {{fluctuations}} signifying long-range spatiotemporal correlations. A {{recently developed}} cell dynamical system model shows that such non-local connections are intrinsic to quantum-like chaos governing flow dynamics. The dynamical evolution of fractal structures {{can be quantified}} in terms of ordered energy flow described by mathematical functions which occur {{in the field of}} number theory. The quantum-like chaos in atmospheric flows can be quantified in terms of the following mathematical functions / concepts: (1) The fractal structure of the flow pattern is resolved into an overall logarithmic spiral trajectory with the quasiperiodic Penrose tiling pattern for the internal structure and is equivalent to a hierarchy of vortices. The incorporation of <b>Fibonacci</b> mathematical <b>series,</b> representative of ramified bifurcations, indicates ordered growth of fractal patterns. (2) The steady state emergence of progressively larger fractal structures incorporates unique primary perturbation domains of progressively increasing number equal to z/lnz where z, the length step growth stage is equal to the length scale ratio of large eddy to turbulent eddy. In number theory z/lnz gives the number of primes less than z. The model also predicts that z/lnz represents the normalised cumulative variance spectrum of the eddies and which follows statistical normal distribution. The important result of the study is that the prime number spectrum {{is the same as the}} eddy energy spectrum for quantum-like chaos in atmospheric flows. Comment: 17 pages, 3 figures.

40|$|The {{study of}} special {{features}} of a new molecular DNA structure synthesis {{based on the fact}} that monomers transpositions can occur in the backbone of polymer chains according to the mathematical law known as a <b>Fibonacci</b> numerical <b>series</b> and «the Golden ratio» was performed. The example of the formation of a new DNA model demonstrates that there are dimers of three types in DNA structure: • Dimers with phosphodiester bond P-O-C, [(s-p) + (s-p) ]; [(p-s) +(p-s) ]; • Dimers with phosphatic bond P-O-P, [(s-p) + (p-s) ]; • Dimers with glycosidic bond C-O-C, [(p-s) +(s-p) ]. Dimers of the [(s-p) + (p-s) ] type are of special importance for the process of replication. For example, if an enzyme catalyst (DNA polymerase) interacts in the backbone of matrix thread with a dimer of [(s-p) + (p-s) ] type during the replication process it leads to a thread break. The growth of the daughter thread does not occur until the enzyme catalyst finds the transition point to another matrix thread of DNA, which contains in its backbone monomers similar to those, necessary for the activity of the given DNA polymerase. Thus, during the process of replication the genetic material is redistributed in the cell, and each daughter thread gets the information about genes belonging to both matrix threads of DNA molecule. This pattern of cell genome changing may manifest itself in phenotype or genotype of the body in different ways...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 This work {{sets forth}} a {{reformulation}} of Levins' loop {{analysis for the}} qualitative modeling of complex dynamical systems. Relationships between members of ecological communities can be analyzed through a qualitatively specified community matrix, whereby + 1, - 1, or 0 represent effects of one species upon another. A contribution is made {{to the analysis of}} ambiguity in predictions of system response to disturbance and system stability. The equilibrium response of a perturbed model system is determined by the countervailing balance of complementary feedback cycles, which are composed of all direct and indirect effects. The degree to which the correct sign or direction of a response can be predicted is determined by the proportion of countervailing feedback, as detailed in a 'weighted predictions' matrix. Similarly, the potential for qualitative stability is determined by a countervailing balance of overall system feedback, through the measure of 'weighted stability'. These measures are determined by system structure, are independent of system size, and are derived through the use of the matrix permanent, and classical adjoint matrix. These qualitative techniques are tested against an array of ecological systems selected from the published literature, and are used to pose falsifiable hypotheses for previously unexplained results, and provide novel insights into system behavior. Further validation is accomplished through simulations that suggest the weighted measures of prediction and stability are a robust means to assess system ambiguity. A discovery was made of the occurrence of the <b>Fibonacci</b> number <b>series</b> embedded within the prediction matrices. The reciprocal relationship between community members can be described, in a dynamical sense, by a convergent value of Phi. This work supports Levins' original theme that a qualitative understanding of community structure can provide critical insights into biological complexity...|$|R
50|$|Many of his {{installations}} were {{accented with}} words or numbers in neon. The numbers counted off the Fibonacci progression, the mathematical formula (named for the Italian monk and mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci who discovered it) for growth patterns {{found in many}} forms of life, including leaves, snail shells, pine cones and reptile skins. The pattern is identifiable as a sequence of numbers in which any given number {{is the sum of}} the two numbers that precede it: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc., ad infinitum. From 1969 Merz employed the Fibonacci sequence in performances and installations throughout his career to represent the universal principles of creation and growth: climbing up the Guggenheim Museum in New York (1971) or the spire of a Turin landmark (1984), or perched in neon on a stack of newspapers among the old masters of Naples' Capodimonte Gallery (1987). In 1972 he illustrated the Fibonacci progression with a series of photographs of a factory workers' lunchroom and a restaurant progressively crowded with diners. His 1973 show at the John Weber Gallery in New York expressed the <b>Fibonacci</b> in a <b>series</b> of low modular tables. In 1990 the sequence determined the form of a spiral assembled from sticks, iron and paper across 24 meters of a hall in Prato, near Florence. An installation of Fibonacci numbers by Merz is the landmark of the Centre for International Light Art in Unna, Germany.|$|R
