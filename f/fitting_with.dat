5|$|Conceived from a name {{idea for}} a Swedish character, Lars was given a moveset <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> other strong {{characters}} in the series, to make him easy to use by newcomers to the franchise. Lars had a mixed reception from video game reviewers. While some critics praised his fighting style, even suggesting him to new players of the franchise, his design was met with a negative response; most reviewers found it ridiculous, often referring to his spiky hair. Nevertheless, he has been popular among fans of the franchise, often ranking {{as one of its}} most popular characters.|$|E
5|$|The {{other four}} members of the initial order made by the Southern Railway, Nos. 360025, were at varying stages of {{construction}} {{by the end of the}} development period. No. 36002 was almost complete, No. 36003 was without its outer casing, and Nos. 360045 were little more than sets of frames, although most of their major components had been constructed at Eastleigh and Brighton and were stored ready for <b>fitting.</b> <b>With</b> no prospect of further money being allocated by the Railway Executive for their completion, the unfinished locomotives were put into store at various depots around the former Southern Railway network pending a decision on their future.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interviewer}} further {{asked of}} the developers of the removals of other features from previous {{entries in the}} series, including dual screen play, leveling up, Survival mode, Combat mode, and Hard mode. The dual-screen play was removed, with the developers commenting that while {{it could have been}} implemented, it did not need to be, and the full use of the dual screens for viewing intel on units and terrain allowed the gameplay to proceed more seamlessly. The ability to level up players' Commanding Officers was introduced in Days of Ruins predecessor, , the developers commenting that the gameplay centered around how well players used their commanding officer. This mechanic was replaced by the ability to level up individual units, commenting that this mechanic required players to work strategically with how they deploy their units. The Survival and Combat modes were removed due to not <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> the redesign of the world, preferring to have a more focused game. Finally, Hard mode was removed due to the developers feeling that the Normal mode was designed {{in such a way that}} a widespread audience could enjoy it. They also commented that earning a high ranking in this mode by doing a good job was effectively the same as Hard mode.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the growth}} of phylogenetic studies in the 1980s, Coelurus has usually {{been found to be}} a coelurosaurian of {{uncertain}} affinities, not <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> the better-known clades of the Cretaceous. Along with several other generalized coelurosaurians such as the compsognathids, Ornitholestes, and Proceratosaurus, it has had multiple placements around the base of Coelurosauria. The phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut (2003) and Smith et al. (2007) found that Coelurus was more closely related to compsognathids than to other coelurosaurs. Oliver Rauhut (2003) proposed that Coeluridae was composed of Coelurus plus the compsognathids, but he and others have not since found the compsognathids to group with Coelurus. However, a work published by Phil Senter in 2007 following the description of Tanycolagreus found it and Coelurus to be closely related at the base of Tyrannosauroidea. Senter proposed that Coelurus and Tanycolagreus were the only coelurids and were actually tyrannosauroids, but the phylogenetic analysis of Turner et al. (2007b) found that Coelurus was a basal coelurosaur, although more derived than the tyrannosaurids. Zanno in 2010 recovered Coelurus as a basal maniraptoran. Coelurus is sometimes put into its own family, Coeluridae, although the membership of the family has not been stable.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent this}} merger of the Austrian forces, Masséna {{established}} a forward line centred at Winterthur, and under overall {{command of the}} experienced Jean Victor Tharreau. The French forces were arrayed in an uneven semicircle, in which Winterthur formed the central part. The command of the Winterthur brigades was the most important. If the center could not hold its position, the flanks would be isolated and crushed. Masséna sent newly promoted General of Division Michel Ney to Winterthur on 27 May 1799 to take command of the center. Masséna recalled him from his assignment commanding an outpost of Claude Lecourbe's force in central Switzerland, {{and gave him a}} command more <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> his new rank. Ney arrived with the reputation for boldness considered typical of cavalry officers, but with minimal experience in commanding mixed forces. Anxious to prove himself but aware of protocols, he had hurried to Tharreau's headquarters, but had to wait for his letters of service before he could take command. These arrived on 25 May. The troops at Winterthur included a brigade of four battalions commanded by Dominique Mansuy Roget, a weak brigade commanded by Théodore Maxime Gazan, and a cavalry brigade commanded by Frédéric Henri Walther.|$|E

25|$|In May 1956, Oakley was one {{of seven}} frigates {{selected}} for transfer to the new West German Navy for use as training ships, with the seven ships (Oakley, two Type II Hunts and four Black Swan class) being designated as Type 138 frigates by West Germany despite their dissimilar nature. Oakley was purchased by Germany on 11 November 1957, and refitted at Harland and Wolff at their Liverpool yard before being taken over on 2 October 1958. She was re-commissioned as Gneisenau (with the Pennant number F212) at Bremerhaven on 18 October 1958, serving {{as part of the}} Naval Gunnery School along with Scharnhost (ex-). Early changes included <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> stabilisers, radar and a cowl funnel, with close-in anti-aircraft armament changing to two 40 mm Bofors guns. Gneiseneau was further modified in 1961, with anti-submarine armament being removed and the main gun armament being reduced by the removal of a 4-inch mount.|$|E

25|$|Pharmacokinetics {{is often}} studied using mass {{spectrometry}} {{because of the}} complex nature of the matrix (often blood or urine) {{and the need for}} high sensitivity to observe low dose and long time point data. The most common instrumentation used in this application is LC-MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectrometry is usually employed for added specificity. Standard curves and internal standards are used for quantitation of usually a single pharmaceutical in the samples. The samples represent different time points as a pharmaceutical is administered and then metabolized or cleared from the body. Blank or t=0 samples taken before administration are important in determining background and ensuring data integrity with such complex sample matrices. Much attention is paid to the linearity of the standard curve; however {{it is not uncommon to}} use curve <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> more complex functions such as quadratics since the response of most mass spectrometers is less than linear across large concentration ranges.|$|E
25|$|The {{valley in}} which Petra resides {{is known as}} the Wadi Musa, meaning valley of Moses, and at the {{entrance}} to the Siq is the Ain Musa, meaning spring of Moses; the 13th century Arab chronicler Numari stated that Ain Musa was the location where Moses had brought water from the ground, by striking it with his rod. The Jebel al-Madhbah was evidently considered particularly sacred, as the well known ritual building known as The Treasury is carved into its base, the mountain top is covered with a number of different altars, and over 8 metres of the original peak were carved away to leave a flat surface with two 8 metre tall obelisks sticking out of it; these obelisks, which frame the end of the path leading up to them, and are now only 6 metres tall, have led to the mountain being colloquially known as Zibb 'Atuf, meaning penis of love in Arabic. Archaeological artifacts discovered at the top of the mountain indicate that it was once covered by polished shiny blue slate, <b>fitting</b> <b>with</b> the biblical description of paved work of sapphire stone; biblical references to sapphire are considered by scholars to be unlikely to refer to the stone called sapphire in modern times, as sapphire had a different meaning, and wasn't even mined, before the Roman era.
