5|$|Genetics is {{believed}} {{to be involved in the}} majority of cases, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> or indirectly. Some epilepsies are due to a single gene defect (1–2%); most are due to the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors. Each of the single gene defects is rare, with more than 200 in all described. Most genes involved affect ion channels, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> or indirectly. These include genes for ion channels themselves, enzymes, GABA, and G protein-coupled receptors.|$|E

5|$|A protocarnivorous plant (sometimes also paracarnivorous, subcarnivorous, or {{borderline}} carnivore), {{according to}} some definitions, traps and kills insects or other animals but lacks the ability to <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> digest or absorb nutrients from its prey like a carnivorous plant. The morphological adaptations such as sticky trichomes or pitfall traps of protocarnivorous plants parallel the trap structures of confirmed carnivorous plants.|$|E
5|$|Complications are <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> {{caused by}} obesity or {{indirectly}} related through mechanisms sharing {{a common cause}} such as a poor diet or a sedentary lifestyle.

Excess body fat underlies 64% of cases of diabetes in men and 77% of cases in women.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{power is}} the {{conversion}} of energy from sunlight into electricity, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> using photovoltaics (PV), indirectly using concentrated solar power, or a combination. Concentrated solar power systems use lenses or mirrors and tracking systems to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.|$|E

5|$|Solar {{technologies}} are characterized as either passive or active {{depending on the}} way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator.

Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, {{with the remainder}} being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.|$|E
5|$|The {{avifauna}} of Puerto Rico {{is composed}} of 349 species, 18 of which are endemic to the archipelago. Almost half of the species (166) are accidental, meaning {{that they have been}} sighted only once or twice, and 42 of the species have been introduced, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> or indirectly (mainly through habitat alteration), by humans. Approximately 120 species, including both native and introduced, breed regularly in the archipelago.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by degassed magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E

5|$|The normal {{function}} of the adrenal gland may be impaired by conditions such as infections, tumors, genetic disorders and autoimmune diseases, or as {{a side effect of}} medical therapy. These disorders affect the gland <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> (as with infections or autoimmune diseases) or {{as a result of the}} dysregulation of hormone production (as in some types of Cushing's syndrome) leading to an excess or insufficiency of adrenal hormones and the related symptoms.|$|E

BART tickets are not accepted on these buses, {{with the exception of}} BART Plus tickets (which are no longer accepted on AC Transit, Muni, SamTrans, or VTA beginning in 2013), and each of the four bus systems that provide All-Nighter service charges its own fare, which can be up to $3.50; a four-system ride could cost as much as $9.50 as of 2007.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion. It {{relies on the}} very high rate of nuclear fission of 242mAm, which can be maintained even in a micrometer-thick foil. Small thickness avoids the problem of self-absorption of emitted radiation. This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a fluid and generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

5|$|Eyes: Kayser–Fleischer rings (KF rings), a {{pathognomonic}} sign, may {{be visible}} in the cornea of the eyes, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea. They are due to copper deposition in Descemet's membrane. They do not occur in all people with Wilson's disease. Wilson's disease is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule. Neither cause significant visual loss. KF rings occur in approximately 66% of diagnosed cases (more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems).|$|E
5|$|Hennessy {{concludes that}} if the un{{dissolved}} and dissolved gas content of a tissue cannot be independently measured <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> or indirectly then the safe maximum limits relative to the ambient pressure cannot be accurately determined through decompression trials {{and it will not}} be possible to systematically develop a comprehensive biophysical model for gas exchange. He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, <b>either</b> <b>directly</b> or as feed for {{domestic}} animals. Agriculture {{deals with the}} production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as peas and beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E
