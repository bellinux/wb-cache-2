40|$|<b>Interference</b> <b>field</b> in {{wireless}} networks {{is often}} modeled by a homogeneous Poisson Point Process (PPP). While it is realistic in modeling the inherent node irregularity and provides meaningful first-order results, it falls short in modeling {{the effect of}} interference management techniques, which typically introduce some form of spatial interaction among active transmitters. In some applications, such as cognitive radio and device-to-device networks, this interaction may result {{in the formation of}} holes in an otherwise homogeneous <b>interference</b> <b>field.</b> The resulting <b>interference</b> <b>field</b> can be accurately modeled as a Poisson Hole Process (PHP). Despite the importance of PHP in many applications, the exact characterization of interference experienced by a typical node in a PHP is not known. In this paper, we derive several tight upper and lower bounds on the Laplace transform of this interference. Numerical comparisons reveal that the new bounds outperform all known bounds and approximations, and are remarkably tight in all operational regimes of interest. The key in deriving these tight and yet simple bounds is to capture the local neighborhood around the typical point accurately while simplifying the far field to attain tractability. Ideas for tightening these bounds further by incorporating the effect of overlaps in the holes are also discussed. These results immediately lead to an accurate characterization of the coverage probability of the typical node in a PHP under Rayleigh fading. Comment: 15 pages.

This Letter introduces a new method based on discrete chirp-Fourier transform for accurate and direct estimation of phase derivatives, even {{in the presence of}} noise. The method is introduced {{in the context of the}} analysis of reconstructed interference fields in digital holographic interferometry. We present simulation and experimental results demonstrating the utility of the proposed method. c ○ 2009 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: 120. 2650, 090. 1995, 090. 2880 Estimation of phase derivatives from interference fringe patterns has an important utility in many engineering applications as it directly provides the information on the strain distribution. Recently, increasing attention has been paid to the development of analysis methods [1 – 4] for obtaining a direct estimation of the phase derivatives. This Letter introduces a discrete chirp-Fourier transform based analysis method for accurate and direct estimation of phase derivative distributions. As an application, the method is here introduced in the context of analyzing reconstructed interference fields in digital holographic interferometry (DHI) [5]. Its applicability to other types of commonly used interferometers is also discussed. DHI has emerged as a powerful non-invasive measurement and testing tool with applications in diverse areas of science and engineering. In DHI, the key parameter of interest is the phase of the reconstructed <b>interference</b> <b>field,</b> as the information on the measurand is encoded in it. The reconstructed <b>interference</b> <b>field</b> is given by: A(x, y) =b(x, y) exp[jΔφ(x, y) ] + η(x, y) (1) where b(x, y) represents the amplitude variations, Δφ(x, y) is the interference phase whose derivative is to be estimated, and η(x, y) is the noise term. The proposed technique relies on modeling each row/column of the reconstructed <b>interference</b> <b>field</b> as a piecewisepolynomial phase signal embedded in additive complex white Gaussian noise (ACWGN) ...|$|E
