The pyrolysis and oxidation of distillers <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> solubles were completed at 650 °C and 850 °C, respectively, which were independent of the heating rate and the initial moisture content. The residual weights of distillers <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> solubles after pyrolysis and oxidation were 27. 15 % and 5. 49 % of the original dry mass of distillers <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> solubles. Thermogravimetrical analysis data was used to determine kinetic parameters of the thermal degradation of distillers <b>grains</b> <b>and</b> solubles.
