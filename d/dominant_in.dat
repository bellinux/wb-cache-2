5|$|N. lasiopterus is understudied {{due to its}} rarity; {{very little}} is known of its mating habits, {{reproductive}} pattern, life cycle and sex ratio. N. lasiopterus, as a Nyctalus species, has an outstanding capability for migration which can possibly result in considerable seasonal changes in sex ratio. The studies in North-East Hungary indicates that the sex-ratio differs greatly depending on the location. Males were exceedingly <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> Greece and the Czech Republic while females were <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> NE Germany, the Moscow-region, Voronezh, and NE Hungary. This sexual segregation is due to difference in sex-specific thermoregulatory and energetic requirements. The females are <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> warmer locations because it is optimal for fetal development and milk production. On the other hand, males are <b>dominant</b> <b>in</b> cooler locations because of lower energetic demands. These results verified that N. lasiopterus have nursing colonies located in Hungary.|$|E

40|$|The excitability {{of the leg}} {{postural}} {{circuit and}} its response to serotonin (5 -HT) were studied in vitro in thoracic nervous system preparations of dominant and subordinate male crayfishes. We demonstrate {{that the level of}} spontaneous tonic activity of depressor and levator motoneurons (MNs) (which control downward and upward movements of the leg, respectively) and the amplitude of their resistance reflex are larger <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> than <b>in</b> subordinates. Moreover, we show that serotonergic neuromodulation of the postural circuit also depends on social status. Depressor and levator MN tonic firing rates and resistance reflex amplitudes were significantly modified in the presence of 10 M 5 -HT <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> but not <b>in</b> subordinates. Using intracellular recording from depressor MNs,we show that their input resistance was not significantly different <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> and subordinates <b>in</b> control conditions. However, 5 -HT produced a marked depolarization <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> and a significantly weaker depolarization in subordinates. Moreover, in the presence of 5 -HT, the amplitude of the resistance reflex and the input resistance of MNs increased <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> and decreased <b>in</b> subordinates. The peak amplitude and the decay phase of unitary EPSPs triggered by sensory spikes were significantly increased by 5 -HT <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> but not <b>in</b> subordinates. These observations suggest that neural networks are more reactive <b>in</b> <b>dominants</b> than <b>in</b> subordinates, and this divergence is even reinforced by 5 -HT modulation...|$|R
