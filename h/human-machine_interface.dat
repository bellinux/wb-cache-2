GNOME, for example, has its human interface guidelines as a design guide, which gives the <b>human–machine</b> <b>interface</b> an important role, not just when doing the graphical design, but also when considering people with disabilities, and even when focusing on security.|$|E
25|$|In Steven Johnson's book, Everything Bad Is Good for You, {{he argues}} that video games in fact demand far more from a player than {{traditional}} games like Monopoly. To experience the game, the player must first determine the objectives, {{as well as how}} to complete them. They must then learn the game controls and how the <b>human-machine</b> <b>interface</b> works, including menus and HUDs. Beyond such skills, which after some time become quite fundamental and are taken for granted by many gamers, video games are based upon the player navigating (and eventually mastering) a highly complex system with many variables. This requires a strong analytical ability, as well as flexibility and adaptability. He argues that the process of learning the boundaries, goals, and controls of a given game is often a highly demanding one that calls on many different areas of cognitive function. Indeed, most games require a great deal of patience and focus from the player, and, contrary to the popular perception that games provide instant gratification, games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms of entertainment such as film or even many books. Some research suggests video games may even increase players' attention capacities.|$|E
500|$|While the Su-27M design had the {{avionics}} to {{give the}} aircraft the nominal designation as a multi-role fighter, flight tests with the Russian Air Force revealed difficulties in efficiently deploying the aircraft's armament. According to Aviation Week & Space Technology, air force pilots described weapons trials with the aircraft in Akhtubinsk and Lipetsk as a [...] "negative experience", with a particular emphasis on {{the layout of the}} cockpit and its adverse impact on the workload of the single pilot. Designers, test pilots and avionics software specialists therefore worked together to redesign the cockpit and its attendant systems and improve the <b>human-machine</b> <b>interface.</b> The information management system of aircraft's avionics suite had been changed so that it now has two digital computers which process information from the flight- and weapons-control systems. The information is then displayed on two [...] multi-function liquid crystal displays, which replaced the smaller multi-function cathode-ray tube displays found on the Su-27M. The pilot can also view critical flight information on the head-up display, and is [...] equipped with Hands On Throttle-And-Stick (HOTAS) controls.|$|E

2500|$|Interface {{design and}} its {{specification}} {{are concerned with}} assuring that the pieces of a system connect and inter-operate with {{other parts of the}} system and with external systems as necessary. Interface design also includes assuring that system interfaces be able to accept new features, including mechanical, electrical and logical interfaces, including reserved wires, plug-space, command codes and bits in communication protocols. [...] This is known as extensibility. Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) or <b>Human-Machine</b> <b>Interface</b> (HMI) is another aspect of interface design, and is a critical aspect of modern systems engineering.

For offshore oil & gas operations, the rotorcraft can be fitted with weather/search radars, emergency floatation aids (including an automated external life raft), energy-absorbent seating, class-D certified external hoists, and crash-resistant fuel cells. An external hook can be installed to carry underslung loads of up to 272kg for cargo missions.
