5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} today may once have existed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed {{much of the}} original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was intended to prevent the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This {{may also have been}} fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E
5|$|Severe Tropical Storm Cyprien (JTWC designation: 08S) was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that caused minor damage in Madagascar. Forming on December 30, 2001, Cyprien quickly strengthened <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> favorable environment. By January2, the storm attained its peak intensity with winds of 100km/h (65mph) according to Météo-France and 95km/h (60mph) {{according to the}} Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Later that day the storm made landfall in Morombe, at a weaker intensity, and dissipated early on January3. Throughout the affected areas, Cyprien destroyed 957 structures, leaving 1.16billion Malagasy franc (2002 MGF; US$181,000) in damages. No fatalities were reported; however two people were listed as missing.|$|E
5|$|The first {{forecast}} {{for the year}} was issued by CSU on December 11, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. The scenario considered most likely was that Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and thermohaline circulation (THC) would be stronger, but effects from El Niño would remain, resulting <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> above average season. The next most likely scenario was that both the AMO and THC would strengthen and the El Niño effects would cease to exist, causing a well above average season. In the other two scenarios, which were given the same probability of occurrence, the AMO and THC would weaken {{and the effects of}} El Niño would either disappear or some would remain, resulting in either a near average or well below average season.|$|E

5|$|Herpetiform ulcers, (also termed {{stomatitis}} herpetiformis, or herpes-like ulcerations) is a subtype of aphthous stomatitis {{so named}} because the lesions resemble a primary infection with herpes simplex virus (primary herpetic gingivostomatitis). However, herpetiform ulceration is not caused by herpes viruses. As with all types of aphthous stomatitis, it is not contagious. Unlike true herpetic ulcers, herpetiforme ulcers are not preceded by vesicles (small, fluid filled blisters). Herpetiforme ulcers are less than 1mm in diameter and occur in variably sized crops up to one hundred at a time. Adjacent ulcers may merge to form larger, continuous areas of ulceration. Healing occurs within fifteen days without scarring. The ulceration may affect keratinized mucosal surfaces in addition to non keratinized. Herpetiform ulceration is often extremely painful, and the lesions recur more frequently than minor or major aphthous ulcers. Recurrence may be so frequent that ulceration is virtually continuous. It generally occurs <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> older age group than the other subtypes, and females are affected slightly more frequently than males.|$|E
5|$|To {{the north}} of this engagement, the trapped Pompée and Hannibal were under heavy fire from the {{anchored}} Formidable {{and an array of}} Spanish batteries and gunboats, both ships taking severe damage without being able to effectively reply as their main broadsides now faced away from the enemy. On Hannibal the situation seemed hopeless: as casualties mounted, the main and mizen masts were shot away and the ship remained firmly and irretrievably grounded. Pompée was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> better position: Sterling's rigging was in tatters, but his masts held and his ship was at least afloat, although totally becalmed. At one stage, Pompées colours were shot away, leading to French claims that the ship had surrendered, although they were quickly replaced. At 11:30, no longer able to contribute to the battle with rigging torn and more than 70 casualties, Saumarez ordered the remainder of the squadron to send their remaining boats to tow Pompée out of danger, the boats coming under heavy fire as they did so, with a number sunk.|$|E
5|$|Another side {{trade was}} {{smuggling}} along the Pacific {{coast of the}} Spanish Empire, where foreign trade was prohibited by Spanish law. This trade peaked in the 1810s, then faded in the 1820s. Traders concentrated on Alta California, which produced a surplus of grain, beef, tallow, and hides, but was chronically short of manufactured goods. American ships brought goods to the missions of Alta California in exchange for grain, beef, and Californian sea otter skins. The grain, beef, and other provisions were taken to Sitka, which was perennially short of foods supplies. After Mexico gained independence in 1821 the American trade with Alta California continued <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>slightly</b> modified form. American traders brought mostly clothing, cottons, silks, lace, cutlery, alcohol, and sugar, which were traded for hides and tallow at a profit generally between 200% and 300%. The California Hide Trade became a major industry in its own right. By the 1830s, however, the missions of Alta California had been secularized by Mexican authorities and deserted by Indian labourers. The trade slid into unprofitability. The decline of the American trade with Alta California left just one significant alternative to the ever-dwindling sea otter trade—the provisioning of the settlements of Russian America, which lasted until the Americans abandoned the North West Coast altogether in the early 1840s. From {{the first decade of}} the 19th century until 1841 American ships visited Sitka regularly, trading provisions, textiles, and liquor for fur seal skins, timber, and fish. This trade was usually highly profitable for the Americans and the Russian settlements depended on it. Thus when Tsar NicholasI issued the ukase of 1821, banning foreign trade north of the 51st parallel, the Russian colonies in America were forced to ignore the ban and engage in smuggling.|$|E
