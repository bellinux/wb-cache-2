Here, we determined the solution structures of the recombinant protein RaPrPC-(91 - 228) and its S 173 N variant and detected the backbone dynamics of their structured C-terminal domains-(121 - 228). In contrast to many other mammalian PrP(C) s, loop 165 - 172, which connects beta-sheet- 2 and alpha-helix- 2, is well-defined in RaPrPC. For the first time, order parameters S- 2 are obtained for residues in this loop region, indicating that loop 165 - 172 of RaPrPC is highly ordered. Compared with the wild-type RaPrPC, less hydrogen bonds form in the S 173 N variant. The NMR dynamics analysis reveals a distinct increase in the structural flexibility of loop 165 - 172 and helix- 3 after the S 173 <b>N</b> <b>substitution,</b> implying that the S 173 <b>N</b> <b>substitution</b> disturbs the long range interaction of loop 165 - 172 with helix- 3, which further leads to a marked decrease in the global conformational stability. Significantly, RaPrPC possesses a unique charge distribution, carrying a continuous area of positive charges on the surface, which is distinguished from other PrP(C) s. The S 173 <b>N</b> <b>substitution</b> causes visible changes of the charge distribution around the recognition sites for the hypothetical protein X. Our results suggest that the ordered loop 165 - 172 and its interaction with helix- 3, together with the unique distribution of surface electrostatic potential, significantly contribute to the unique structural characteristics of RaPrPC.

CMT is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and four aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been implicated in disease etiology. Mutations in the YARS gene encoding a tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) lead to Dominant Intermediate CMT type C (DI-CMTC). Three dominant YARS mutations were so far associated with DI-CMTC. To further expand the spectrum of CMT causing genetic defects in this tRNA synthetase, we performed DNA sequencing of YARS coding regions in a cohort of 181 patients with various types of peripheral neuropathy.

This requires a fundamental {{understanding of the}} relationship between atomic bonding and property variation. Thin films of reactive sputter deposited Cr-O-C-N are compositionally graded to produce specific attenuation and phase shift of optical radiation. The above mentioned relationship was determined for these films. ^ Compositions resolved on a sub-nm scale were measured in 120 – 150 nm thick CrOCN films by sputtered neutral mass spectroscopy. Near edge structure in electron energy loss from transmission electron microscopy and Cr core level shift in X-ray photoemission spectroscopy further support this conclusion. Extended X-ray analysis of fine structure was determined the nearest neighbor distances consistent with proposed bonding configurations and to confirm the lack of long range order in the system. Four point resistivity measurements characterized the transport properties of CrOCN. Variable angle spectroscopic ellipsometry gave film optical properties. ^ The existence of a ternary continuous random network in CrOCN was demonstrated. The ternary network was based on the substitution of nitrogen for oxygen in the octahedral Cr 2 O 3 bonding configuration. The ternary network lacked order beyond fourth chrome nearest neighbors. The limits of <b>N</b> <b>substitution</b> for O in the ternary were determined for eight compositions of CrOCN. It was also shown that the composition of this network at high [O] is very close to the stoichiometry of Cr 2 O 3.

In particular, <b>N</b> <b>substitution</b> for O in a CrON ternary compound in the system decreases the width of a gap in the density of electronic states in the material.
