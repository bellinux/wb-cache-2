25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Renormalization Group Theory of the instanton vacuum one can form a general <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> where the topological sectors are {{represented}} by attractive fixed points. When scaling the effective system to larger sizes, the system generally flows to a stable phase at one of these points and as we can see in the <b>flow</b> <b>diagram</b> on the right, the longitudinal conductivity will vanish and the Hall conductivity takes on a quantized value. If we started with a Hall conductivity that is halfway between two attractive points, we would end up on the phase transition between topological sectors. As long as the symmetry isn't broken, the longitudinal conductivity doesn't vanish and is even able to increase when scaling to a larger system size. In the <b>flow</b> <b>diagram,</b> we see fixed points that are repulsive {{in the direction of the}} Hall current and attractive in the direction of the longitudinal current. It is most interesting to approach these fixed saddle points as close as possible and measure the (universal) behavior of the quantum Hall transitions.|$|E

40|$|Designers of {{software}} for real-time systems often use models, {{in the form}} of data flow/control <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams,</b> to express system behavior in a graphical notation that can be understood easily by users and by programmers, and from which designers can generate a software architecture. The research described in this paper is motivated by the desire to provide an automated designer's assistant that can generate software architectures for real-time systems directly from models expressed as data flow/control <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams.</b> To achieve this goal, an automated designer's assistant must be capable of interpreting <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> in semantic, rather than syntactic, terms. Unfortunately, <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams,</b> with a limited number of syntactic elements, are seldom expressive enough to depict the semantic concepts that a designer intends; instead, most design methods that include <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> allow the designer to augment those diagrams with a textual description to express semantic information.

40|$|Using {{operational}} semantic techniques, {{an extended}} variant of structured analysis style data <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{is given a}} formal semantics. This semantics allows one to describe both how information is processed and the dynamic behavior of the system. The ability to describe dynamic behavior is an extension to the traditional notion of data <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams.</b> This semantics {{can serve as a}} target for giving meaning to specification languages that use a graphical notation similar to data <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams...</b>|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} shown in [SB 96] that a {{particular}} subclass of Formalized Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (FDFD's) is Turing equivalent. We call this Turing equivalent subclass of FDFD's persistent flow [...] free Reduced Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (PFF [...] RDFD's). PFF [...] RDFD's do not contain persistent flows, reference only values whose types have finite domains, and have enabling conditions that contain no tests for empty flows. In addition, FDFD's do not contain (direct) representations of stores. This raises the question whether any of these common features of traditional Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> elevates the expressive power of FDFD's, or whether the various subclasses have the same expressive power as FDFD's with these features. This paper addresses this issue of whether persistent flows, arbitrary domains, tests for empty flows or stores are essential features with respect to the expressive power of Formalized Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams.</b> 2 1. 1 Introduction Traditional Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (DFD's) are probably the most widely [...] ...|$|R

25|$|The {{residual}} {{gas from the}} Claus process is commonly called tail gas and that gas is then processed in a tail gas treating unit (TGTU) to recover and recycle residual sulfur-containing compounds back into the Claus unit.

2500|$|The raw gas is then pipelined to a gas {{processing}} plant where the initial purification {{is usually the}} removal of acid gases (hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide). There are many processes that are available for that purpose {{as shown in the}} <b>flow</b> <b>diagram,</b> but amine treating is the process that was historically used. However, due to a range of performance and environmental constraints of the amine process, a newer technology based on the use of polymeric membranes to separate the carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide from the natural gas stream has gained increasing acceptance.

During analysis phase, context <b>diagram</b> and data <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> are used to produce the process model of a system. A consistency of the context diagram to lower-level data <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> {{is very important in}} smoothing up developing process of a system. However, manual consistency check from context diagram to lower-level data <b>flow</b> <b>diagrams</b> by using a checklist is time-consuming process. At the same time, the limitation of human ability to validate the errors is one of the factors that influence the correctness and balancing of the diagrams. This paper presents a tool that automates the consistency check between Data <b>Flow</b> <b>Diagrams</b> (DFDs) based on the rules of DFDs. The tool serves two purposes: as an editor to draw the diagrams and as a checker to check the correctness of the diagrams drawn.
