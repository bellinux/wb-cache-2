5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators of morality and that morality is a priori. They argue that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
5|$|An {{approach}} to supporting the possibility premise in Plantinga's {{version of the}} argument was attempted by Alexander R. Pruss. He started with the 8th–9th century AD Indian philosopher Sankara's dictum that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> impossible, we cannot have a perception (even a non-veridical one) {{that it is the}} case. It follows that if we have a perception that p, then even though it might not be the case that p, it is at least the case that possibly p. If mystics in fact perceive the existence of a maximally great being, it follows that the existence of a maximally great being is at least possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they feel as <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of the}} Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E

25|$|To sum up: Wittgenstein asserts that, <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> a language, it {{cannot be}} (logically) private; and <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> private, {{it is not}} (and cannot be) a language.|$|E

25|$|By {{the same}} reasoning, this {{statement}} is evidence that (2) <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> not black then {{it is not a}} raven. But since (as above) {{this statement is}} logically equivalent to (1) all ravens are black, it follows that the sight of a green apple is evidence supporting the notion that all ravens are black. This conclusion seems paradoxical, because it implies that information has been gained about ravens by looking at an apple.|$|E

25|$|The classicist John Burnet doubts this account, however, as both Diogenes Laërtius and Cicero wrote {{hundreds}} of years later and as no such persecution of Protagoras is mentioned by contemporaries who make extensive references to this philosopher. Burnet notes that even if some copies of the Protagoras books were burned, enough of them survived to be known and discussed in the following century. A claim has been made that Protagoras is better classified as an atheist, since he held that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> not able to be known it does not exist.|$|E
25|$|Assistive Technology for Cognition (ATC) {{is the use}} of {{technology}} (usually high tech) to augment and assist cognitive processes such as attention, memory, self-regulation, navigation, emotion recognition and management, planning, and sequencing activity. Systematic reviews of the field have found that the number of ATC are growing rapidly, but have focused on memory and planning, that there is emerging evidence for efficacy, that a lot of scope exists to develop new ATC. Examples of ATC include: NeuroPage which prompts users about meetings, Wakamaru, which provides companionship and reminds users to take medicine and calls for help <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and telephone Reassurance systems.|$|E

500|$|The 14th Dalai Lama {{was quoted}} by the Los Angeles Times as saying, [...] "Forgiveness doesn't mean forget what happened.... <b>If</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> serious {{and it is}} {{necessary}} to take counter-measures, you have to take counter-measures." [...] This was widely reported as an endorsement of bin Laden's killing and was criticized in Buddhist circles, but another journalist cited a video of the discussion to argue that the comment was taken out of context and the Dalai Lama only supports killing in self-defense.|$|E
500|$|The {{conclusion}} {{relies on}} a form of modal axiom S5, which states that <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> possibly true, then its possibility is necessary (it is possibly true in all worlds). Plantinga's version of S5 suggests that [...] "To say that p is possibly necessarily true is to say that, with regard to one world, it is true at all worlds; but in that case it is true at all worlds, {{and so it is}} simply necessary."

Hagström notes that [...] "it doesn't really matter <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> hard to play or not. The thing is, {{what does it}} do to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?" [...] A trademark of Thordendal is jazz fusion-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a [...] "breath controller" [...] device. Haake is known for his cross-rhythm drumming with [...] "jazzlike cadence". The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between hardcore-style shouts and [...] "robotic" [...] death metal vocals.|$|E

500|$|To {{illustrate}} the philosophical method, consider one grouping of {{many kinds of}} animal, [...] 'birds': all {{members of this group}} possess the same distinguishing features—feathers, wings, beaks, and two bony legs. This is an instance of a universal: <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> a bird, it will have feathers and wings; if something has feathers and wings, that also implies it is a bird, so the reasoning here is bidirectional. On the other hand, some animals that have red blood have lungs; other red-blooded animals (such as fish) have gills. This implies, in Aristotle's reasoning, that if something has lungs, it has red blood; but Aristotle is careful not to imply that all red-blooded animals have lungs, so the reasoning here is not bidirectional.|$|E

Doggett and Harrison pull up {{her shirt}} to reveal moving bulges in her stomach, as <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> {{trying to get}} out. Harrison then begins to bleed from her eyes. Doggett {{approaches}} Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. [...] Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but falls down into a blackened abyss, where he is attacked by the insects. [...] However, due to Doggett's skepticism, {{he is able to}} fight off the illusion. [...] Because he does not believe they are real, they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the [...] "sheriff" [...] who had no organs, and Reyes' and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real.|$|E
500|$|The Act is {{relatively}} short, divided into 5 sections, the fifth covering {{the extent of}} the Act and its commencement date. Section 1 covers the test to determine <b>if</b> <b>something</b> <b>is</b> obscene; an article is taken to be obscene if the entire article [...] "is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it". The test is based on [...] "persons"; DPP v Whyte [...] AC 849 established that it was not sufficient for an individual to be depraved or corrupted, it must be that a significant number of people likely to read it would become corrupt. [...] "article" [...] is defined within Section 1 as anything containing material that is read or looked at, any sound recordings and any film or other picture record. A publisher, as used in the Act, is also defined in Section 1; [...] "publisher" [...] is taken to mean anyone who [...] "distributes, circulates, sells, lets on hire, gives, or lends it, or who offers it for sale or for letting on hire", or [...] "in the case of an article containing or embodying matter to be looked at or a record, shows, plays or projects it". The Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 amended this section to include the transmission of the article electronically.|$|E

2500|$|The Post Res or eliminative {{variant of}} {{structuralism}} is anti-realist about structures {{in a way}} that parallels nominalism.

However, it is merely convenient to talk of structures being [...] "held in common" [...] between systems: they in fact have no independent existence.|$|E
