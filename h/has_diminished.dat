While travelling {{on a train}} during their honeymoon, he notices a man (an electrician who was indirectly responsible for his sister's death several years ago) drinking amidst fellow passengers. Suffering a relapse, he transforms into Anniyan and throws the man off the train, killing him. However, he hides the incident from Nandini, indicating that he has successfully blended his personalities into one instead of eradicating them.|$|E

5|$|After the {{economic}} slump of the 1990s, {{the economy of}} the oblast started to rebound during {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, although at a rate below the country's average. Today the Kola Peninsula is the most industrially developed and urbanized region in northern Russia. The major port of the peninsula is Murmansk, which serves as the administrative center of Murmansk Oblast and does not freeze in winter. Although the strategic importance of the Kola Peninsula <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> since the Cold War, the peninsula nevertheless still has the highest concentration of nuclear weapons, reactors, and facilities in Russia, with the number of nuclear reactors alone exceeding any other region of the world.|$|E

5|$|The Coatbridge accent {{has been}} {{categorised}} as making less {{use of the}} Scots tongue and exhibiting a tendency to stress the 'a' vowel differently from general Scots usage. Examples of this are seen the pronunciation of the words stair (sterr), hair (herr), fair (ferr) and chair (cherr). This different enunciation {{has been attributed to}} the impact of successive influxes of Ulster Catholic immigrants into Coatbridge. However, the distinctiveness of the Coatbridge accent and pronunciation <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> as the various surrounding populations (especially Glasgow) have mingled with that of Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The Sun {{is roughly}} middle-aged; {{it has not}} changed {{dramatically}} {{for more than four}} billion years, and will remain fairly stable for more than another five billion years. After hydrogen fusion in its core <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> to the point at which it is no longer in hydrostatic equilibrium, the core of the Sun will experience a marked increase in density and temperature while its outer layers expand to eventually become a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable.|$|E
5|$|When the National Freeway {{was built}} in western Maryland {{paralleling}} the old National Road, parts of US40 were bypassed. The part of the bypassed road between Keyser's Ridge and Cumberland became Alt US40, and other bypassed sections east of Cumberland became Maryland Route 144 (MD144) and U.S. Route 40 Scenic. Although Alt US40 <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> in importance from its original status as the National Road {{with the construction of}} I-68, it remains an important route for local traffic and serves as the Main Streets of Grantsville and Frostburg.|$|E

5|$|Although {{skeptical of}} New World Order conspiracism, {{political}} scientist David Rothkopf argues, in the 2008 book , {{that the world}} population of 6 billion people is governed by an elite of 6,000 individuals. Until the late 20th century, governments of the great powers provided most of the superclass, accompanied by a few heads of international movements (i.e., the Pope of the Catholic Church) and entrepreneurs (Rothschilds, Rockefellers). According to Rothkopf, in the early 21st century, economic clout—fueled by the explosive expansion of international trade, travel and communication—rules; the nation-state's power <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> shrinking politicians to minority power broker status; leaders in international business, finance and the defense industry not only dominate the superclass, they move freely into high positions in their nations' governments and back to private life largely beyond the notice of elected legislatures (including the U.S. Congress), which remain abysmally ignorant of affairs beyond their borders. He asserts that the superclass' disproportionate influence over national policy is constructive but always self-interested, and that across the world, few object to corruption and oppressive governments provided they can do business in these countries.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans roughly 1500 to 2000years ago, lemurs were found all across the island. However, early {{settlers}} quickly converted the forests to rice paddies and grassland through slash-and-burn agriculture (known locally as tavy), restricting lemurs to approximately 10% of the island's area, ~60,000km2 (23,000sq mi). Today, the diversity and complexity of lemur communities increases with floral diversity and precipitation and is highest in the rainforests of the east coast, where precipitation and floral diversity are also at their highest. Despite their adaptations for weathering extreme adversity, habitat destruction and hunting have resulted in lemur populations declining sharply, and their diversity <b>has</b> <b>diminished,</b> with the recent extinction of at least 17species in eight genera, known collectively as the subfossil lemurs. Most of the approximately 100species and subspecies of lemur are either threatened or endangered. Unless trends change, extinctions are likely to continue.|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} people have lived {{on or near the}} St. Johns, {{including}} Paleo-indians, Archaic people, Timucua, Mocama, French and Spanish settlers, Seminoles, slaves and freemen, Florida crackers, land developers, tourists and retirees. It {{has been the subject of}} William Bartram's journals, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings' books, and Harriet Beecher Stowe's letters home. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, it was the last U.S. territory on the east coast to be developed; it remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. When attention was turned to the state, however, much of the land was rapidly overdeveloped in a national zeal for progress. The St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers. It suffered severe pollution and human interference that <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> the natural order of life in and around the river. In all, 3.5 million people live within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River. The St. Johns, named one of 14 American Heritage Rivers in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008. Restoration efforts are under way for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida continues to deal with population increases in the river's vicinity.|$|E
5|$|Moncton has a {{warm summer}} {{continental}} climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) with uniform precipitation distribution. Winter days are typically cold but generally sunny with solar radiation generating some warmth. Daytime high temperatures usually range {{a few degrees}} below the freezing point. Major snowfalls can result from nor'easter ocean storms moving up {{the east coast of}} North America. These major snowfalls typically average 20–30cm (8–12in) and are frequently mixed with rain or freezing rain. Spring is frequently delayed because the sea ice that forms in the nearby Gulf of St. Lawrence during the previous winter requires time to melt, and this will cool onshore winds, which can extend inland as far as Moncton. The ice burden in the gulf <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> considerably {{over the course of the}} last decade (which may be a consequence of global warming), and the springtime cooling effect has weakened as a result. Daytime temperatures above freezing are typical by late February. Trees are usually in full leaf by late May. Summers are hot and humid due to the seasonal prevailing westerly winds strengthening the continental tendencies of the local climate. Daytime highs sometimes reach more than 30°C (86°F). Rainfall is generally modest, especially in late July and August, and periods of drought are not uncommon. Autumn daytime temperatures remain mild until late October. First snowfalls usually do not occur until late November and consistent snow cover on the ground does not happen until late December. The Fundy coast of New Brunswick occasionally experiences the effects of post-tropical storms. The stormiest weather of the year, with the greatest precipitation and the strongest winds, usually occurs during the fall/winter transition (November to mid-January).|$|E
5|$|Puerto Rico's {{avifauna}} <b>has</b> <b>diminished</b> due {{to extinction}} and extirpation, either by natural forces or human intervention. For example, fossil evidence was discovered for {{a species of}} swift, Tachornis uranoceles, dated to the late Pleistocene (between 17,000 and 21,000 years ago). The species {{is believed to have}} become extinct as a result of habitat alteration after the Wisconsin glaciation. At least six endemic species have become extinct in the last millennia: Puerto Rican barn owl (Tyto cavatica), Puerto Rican caracara (Polyborus latebrosus), Puerto Rican conure (Aratinga chloroptera maugei), Puerto Rican woodcock (Scolopax anthonyi), Puerto Rican quail-dove (Geotrygon larva), and the Antillean cave rail (Nesotrochis debooyi). With a population of 13 individuals in 1975, the Puerto Rican parrot almost became the seventh, but conservation efforts helped save the species from extinction. However, it {{is still one of the}} ten most critically endangered birds in the world. Four Puerto Rican birds, the Hispaniolan parakeet, the white-necked crow, the Cuban crow, and the limpkin, became extirpated after Puerto Rico's population expansion in the latter half of the nineteenth century and three more species, the black-bellied whistling duck, the black rail, and the American flamingo, no longer breed in the archipelago.|$|E
