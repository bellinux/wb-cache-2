5|$|Stebbins started {{graduate}} studies at Harvard in 1928, initially working on flowering plant taxonomy and biogeography—particularly {{that of the}} flora of New England—with Merritt Lyndon Fernald. He completed his MA in 1929 and continued to work toward his Ph.D. He became interested in using chromosomes for taxonomic studies, a method that Fernald did not support. Stebbins chose to concentrate his doctoral work on the cytology of plant reproductive processes in the genus Antennaria, with cytologist E. C. Jeffrey as his supervisor and Fernald on his supervisory panel. During his Ph.D. candidature, Stebbins sought advice and supervision from geneticist Karl Sax. Sax identified several errors in Stebbins's work and disapproved of his <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> that, while in accordance with Jeffrey's views, were inconsistent {{with the work of}} contemporary geneticists. Jeffrey and Sax argued over Stebbins's dissertation, and the thesis was revised numerous times to accommodate their differing views.|$|E

40|$|The {{role for}} {{laboratory}} <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> microbiologic <b>results</b> remains controversial, and many laboratories leave the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> culture <b>results</b> entirely to physicians. We {{examined the effects}} of furnishing a laboratory <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> sputum quality on physician decision making. Quality of sputum was determined on Gram-stained smears by using a modification of the criteria of Bartlett (R. C. Bartlett, Medical Microbiology: Quality, Cost, and Clinical Relevance, p. 24 - 31, 1974). A total of 301 poor-quality specimens were randomized either to receive written <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> Gram stain <b>results</b> or to a control group for which Gram stain results were reported without interpretation. Physicians were more likely to follow up a poor-quality specimen with a second specimen if they had been furnished an <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>results</b> from the original Gram stain (22 versus 12 %; P = 0. 025). We conclude that laboratory-based <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> microbiologic <b>results</b> can improve physician decision making...|$|R

25|$|Mering was an X-ray {{crystallographer}} {{who applied}} X-ray diffraction {{to the study}} of rayon and other amorphous substances, in contrast to the thousands of regular crystals that had been studied by this method for many years. He taught her the practical aspects of applying X-ray crystallography to amorphous substances. This presented new challenges in the conduct of experiments and the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> Franklin applied them to further problems related to coal, in particular the changes to the arrangement of atoms when it is converted to graphite. She published several further papers on this work which {{has become part of the}} mainstream of the physics and chemistry of coal. This work was covered in a 1993 monograph, and in the regularly-published textbook Chemistry and Physics of Carbon. Mering continued the study of carbon in various forms, using X-ray diffraction and other methods.|$|E

2500|$|The TMAS {{scale was}} {{frequently}} {{used in the}} past, however, its use has declined over the years due to problems with the validity of this self-report measure. [...] Participants use their own judgement when answering questions, which causes internal and construct validity issues, which makes the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> difficult. Another possible reason this scale has declined in its use over the years is that researchers seemed to only get results of anxiety from participants under threat conditions and not under non-threat conditions, which again questioned the scale's validity.|$|E
