5|$|Richards {{found one}} dog alive in its cage and {{released}} it. Webb found another suffering from burns and hiding behind a farmyard. An RSPCA inspector later arrived {{and took the}} injured dog to a vet in Abingdon. One badly injured dog was put down. Six dogs were found dead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b>|$|E
5|$|Seven men {{lost their}} lives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of several Cuban schooners at Punta Gorda. Nearby, one man and a baby drowned {{as a result of}} the storm surge, and another died while {{attempting}} to cross a flooded river. A French steamship, the Louisiane, went ashore with 600passengers; all people aboard the vessel were rescued by the Forward, a Revenue cutter.|$|E
5|$|A team of {{researchers}} discover remains of a crashed spaceship in the Arctic Circle, finding several humanoids with cybernetic implants frozen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Two bodies are taken to a nearby compound to be studied. The scientists marvel at the nanoprobes that begin to repair the long dead aliens. Suddenly one of the seemingly dead subjects attacks the scientists, assimilating them. Using scavenged wreckage to enhance the transport, they then escape into space, upgrading it with a faster than standard warp drive and weapons.|$|E

50|$|Full Circle is a 2008 {{full-length}} {{documentary film}} about the INS Dakar, an Israeli Sea Corps submarine that disappeared <b>in</b> 1968, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of which was found in 1999.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} six deaths in {{incidents}} related to Patricia were reported in the state. Two of these deaths occurred when a tree toppled over in the storm's powerful winds. A woman was also hospitalized after sustaining injuries in the same incident. Another four {{people were killed in}} an automobile accident in southern Jalisco. Two of the victims died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and the other two died after being brought to a hospital.|$|E
5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{charged with}} {{investigating}} the accident, examined the wreckage at Long Island MacArthur Airport. Reports from witnesses {{of the crash}} indicated the aircraft appeared {{to have made a}} normal takeoff and began climbing normally. But, moments later it began banking sharply to the right. Investigators examined the four charred engines and concluded all were producing power at the point of impact. They could not conclusively determine the amount of power being produced, but stated there was no evidence found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> that suggested the engines might have suffered an operational failure.|$|E
5|$|Chief Rubin {{initially}} confirmed four fatalities (including {{the train}} operator) and 74 injuries, 14 {{of which were}} considered moderate and 6 critical. Five of the dead were discovered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and removed {{from the site of}} the collision on the morning of June 23, as cranes dismantling the wrecked trains revealed the bodies. Nine fatalities were eventually confirmed. Major General (ret.) David F. Wherley, Jr. of the District of Columbia Air National Guard – known for deploying fighter jets to defend Washington, D.C. during the September 11 attacks – was killed in the collision along with his wife, Ann; the other passengers killed in the crash were Lavonda King, Veronica DuBose, Cameron Williams, Dennis Hawkins, Mary Doolittle, and Ana Fernandez.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1969 <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of <b>the</b> {{plane was}} {{discovered}} in a jungle in New Guinea with skeletal remains <b>in</b> it. <b>The</b> plane still contained Melikian's signature {{on the side of}} it.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 2012, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of Amatsukaze {{was found}} by a Chinese {{engineering}} ship. About 30 tons of <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> was salvaged, cut into pieces and sold as scrap metal before the intervention of local relics administration departments.

5|$|<b>In</b> 1986, <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of an Avenger {{was found}} off the Florida coast during {{the search for}} <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of <b>the</b> Space Shuttle Challenger. Aviation {{archaeologist}} Jon Myhre raised this wreck from <b>the</b> ocean floor <b>in</b> 1990. He mistakenly believed {{it was one of}} the missing planes.|$|R
5|$|Hundreds {{of people}} worked <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> {{all day and}} into the night {{in an effort to}} find and rescue any {{children}} pinned underneath. Area contractors had sent all their men to assist, and many other people came to the scene in response to the pleas for help. Eventually, 34 firefighters and the Chief of the Lansing Fire Department arrived on the scene, as did several Michigan State Police officers who managed traffic to and from the scene. The injured and dying were transported to Sparrow Hospital and St. Lawrence Hospital in Lansing. The construction of the St. Lawrence facility had been financed in large part by Lawrence Price, Nellie Kehoe's uncle and formerly an executive in charge of Oldsmobile's Lansing Car Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Seeds of Evil {{begins with}} the new Turok, Joshua Fireseed, {{appearing}} through a portal to face a female alien named Adon. She explains he has been called by the Elders of the Lost Land, the Lazarus Concordance, to defeat the Primagen, a powerful alien entity that was imprisoned <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of his own Lightship after attempting to witness {{the creation of the}} universe. This incident {{led to the creation of}} the Lost Land, a bizarre and barbarian world where time has no meaning. Awakened by the events of Dinosaur Hunter, the Primagen mobilizes several races of primitive creatures from the Lost Land to destroy five Energy Totems, powerful devices that bound the Primagen to his Lightship. The destruction of these Energy Totems would allow the Primagen to escape the confines of his Lightship, and the resulting shockwave would destroy the known universe.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{invocation}} {{and the performance}} of the National Anthem, three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmer Ryan Lochte commanded the drivers to start their engines. Edwards maintained his pole position lead going into the first corner with Earnhardt, Jr. in second. On lap two, Tony Stewart passed Edwards around the outside to take the lead. Edwards, with assistance from Bayne, moved in front of Stewart going into turn three to reclaim the first position two laps later. On the fifth lap, Earnhardt moved into the lead and Ambrose moved into second place. Edwards temporarily moved back into first before Earnhardt reclaimed the position. Bayne, who also battled for the lead, had moved down the field by lap seven. On lap nine, Michael McDowell made contact with David Gilliland's left-rear quarter panel between turns one and two; Gilliland went up the track towards the outside wall, and collected Menard and Montoya, triggering the first caution of the race and the appearance of the pace car. Keselowski was also caught up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> and his car sustained minor damage. Most of the drivers, including Earnhardt, made pit stops for fuel. Earnhardt was required to make an additional pit stop after one of his pit crew went over the wall too soon, dropping him down the field.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} was destroyed and an intense fuel and oil fire followed the impact. The {{search for the}} aircraft included an RAF Shackleton and Royal Norwegian Navy ships investigating <b>the</b> fjords <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> was found fifteen hours after the crash by a Royal Norwegian Air Force helicopter, 15 miles east from the ILS track.|$|R

5|$|Rome's {{control over}} the city ended {{following}} {{the chaos of the}} Crisis of the Third Century, when the empire nearly disintegrated as a series of generals seized and lost power through civil wars, palace coups and assassinations. Around 280, Roman rule collapsed in much of Mauretania and was never re-established.In 285, the emperor Diocletian reorganised {{what was left of the}} province to retain only the coastal strip between Lixus, Tingis and Septa (modern Ceuta). Although a Roman army was based in Tingis, it was decided that it would simply be too expensive to mount a reconquest of a vulnerable border region. Occupation of the city continued, however, as fine mosaics such as that of a chariot race conducted by animals in the House of Venus can not have been created earlier than the fourth century. The end of the Roman city probably came in the form of an earthquake towards the end of the century, which buried numerous bronze statues <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of the houses.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine units <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> of the base, {{and tries}} {{to break through the}} black operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one second later by the cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage,</b> indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} DTCE, part of the French Military, which was responsible for accidents involving prototype aircraft <b>in</b> France. <b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> was recovered to a hangar at Le Bourget, with some of it being flown by Antonov An-22 to the Soviet Union.|$|R
2500|$|Eyewitnesses {{told reporters}} that the plane [...] "circled desperately" [...] {{in search of a}} safe landing place before plummeting into a deep gulch. [...] Local woodsmen {{observed}} the plane's landing attempts and later heard the crash, but were unable to summon help or report it {{due to the lack of}} telephones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area. <b>The</b> <b>wreckage</b> was discovered <b>the</b> following morning by woodcutter John Durison.|$|R
2500|$|Three {{members of}} the public and a {{policeman}} attempted to rescue the passengers and crew on board the aircraft. One female passenger was pulled from <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> but discovered to be dead. The pilot had been thrown clear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crash and killed. The mechanic and the other four passengers were all killed instantly and trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> burning <b>wreckage.</b> During <b>the</b> rescue attempts, a petrol [...] tank exploded and <b>the</b> <b>wreckage</b> was left to burn itself out.|$|R
5|$|On 31 August 1937, three Hawker Demon {{aircraft}} of No.1 Squadron were on {{a training}} flight, during which they landed at an air base in Hamilton, Victoria. The exercise coincided with the local agricultural show, and the planes briefly provided a stationary display for the public. Recommencing their journey, the first aircraft had already taken off when the second was seen to have difficulties. The pilot, Pilot Officer Kenneth McKenzie, had attempted a climbing turn when the aircraft's engine stalled, sending the machine into a dive. McAloney—who was a passenger in the third aircraft—witnessed the incident and signalled for his pilot to stop. On doing this, McAloney immediately leapt out of his plane and ran across the airfield. Out of control, the second aircraft struck the ground and rapidly became engulfed in flames. The first on scene, McAloney dashed into the wreckage {{in an effort to}} extradite the two crew members, and was able to grab hold of McKenzie who was sprawled over the flaming main fuel tank. McAloney pulled McKenzie free of the cockpit and down on to the aircraft's wing, though McKenzie's leg became trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wreckage.</b> Despite this, McAloney continued his efforts to free McKenzie, burning his hands on the pilot's smouldering clothes. At this point, one of the wing tanks burst, rendering McAloney unconscious. He was pulled from the aircraft suffering severe burns, and spent the next four weeks in hospital undergoing treatment. Both McKenzie and his observer-gunner, Sergeant Norman Torrens-Witherow, perished and it was later ascertained that, owing to the injuries sustained on impact, they would not have survived even if the rescue attempt had been successful.|$|E
