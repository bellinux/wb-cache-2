My mule made a <b>dead</b> <b>point.</b> ‘’Tis the pipe and tambourine,’ said I—‘I never will argue a point with one of your family as long as I live;’ so leaping off his back, and kicking off one boot into this ditch and t’other into that, ‘I’ll take a dance,’ said I, ‘so stay you here.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Nigel {{declined}} the courteous proffer, and intimated by his manner, {{while he did}} so, that he desired no intrusion on the privacy of his own apartment; which, indeed, he was the more entitled to maintain, considering the cold reception he had that morning met with when straying from its precincts into those of his landlord. But the open casket contained matter, or rather metal, so attractive to old Trapbois, that he remained fixed, like a setting-dog at a <b>dead</b> <b>point,</b> his nose advanced, and one hand expanded like the lifted forepaw, by which that sagacious quadruped sometimes indicates {{that it is a}} hare which he has in the wind. Nigel was about to break the charm which had thus arrested old Trapbois, by shutting the lid of the casket, when his attention was withdrawn from him by the question of the messenger, who, holding out the letter, asked whether he was to leave it at Mr. Lowestoffe's chambers in the Temple, or carry it to the Marshalsea? ...|$|E

60|$|Suddenly, before daybreak, a {{discharge}} of firearms, and a struggle and tramp of horses, made every one start to his feet. The first move was {{to secure the}} horses. Some were gone; others were struggling, and kicking, and trembling, for there was a horrible uproar of whoops, and yells, and firearms. Several trappers stole quietly from the camp, and succeeded in driving in the horses which had broken away; the rest were tethered still more strongly. A breastwork was thrown up of saddles, baggage, and camp furniture, and all hands waited anxiously for daylight. The Indians, in the meantime, collected on a neighboring height, kept up the most horrible clamor, in hopes of striking a panic into the camp, or frightening off the horses. When the day dawned, the trappers attacked them briskly and drove them to some distance. A desultory fire was kept up for an hour, when the Indians, seeing nothing was to be gained, gave up the contest and retired. They {{proved to be a}} war party of Blackfeet, who, while in search of the Crow tribe, had fallen upon the trail of Captain Bonneville on the Popo Agie, and dogged him to the Bighorn; but had been completely baffled by his vigilance. They had then waylaid the present detachment, and were actually housed in perfect silence within their fort, when the mule of the trapper made such a <b>dead</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E
6000|$|A {{phrase of}} Edward Garnett's is, {{as a matter}} of fact, {{responsible}} for this book. The first of the friends I made for myself by my pen it was but natural that he should be the recipient, at that time, of my confidences. One evening when we had dined together and he had listened to the account of my perplexities (I fear he must have been growing a little tired of them) he pointed out that {{there was no need to}} determine my future absolutely. Then he added: [...] "You have the style, you have the temperament; why not write another?" [...] I believe that as far as one man may wish to influence another man's life Edward Garnett had a great desire that I should go on writing. At that time, and I may say, ever afterwards, he was always very patient and gentle with me. What strikes me most however in the phrase quoted above which was offered to me in a tone of detachment is not its gentleness but its effective wisdom. Had he said, [...] "Why not go on writing," [...] it is very probable he would have scared me away from pen and ink for ever; but there was nothing either to frighten one or arouse one's antagonism in the mere suggestion to [...] "write another." [...] And thus a <b>dead</b> <b>point</b> in the revolution of my affairs was insidiously got over. The word [...] "another" [...] did it. At about eleven o'clock of a nice London night, Edward and I walked along interminable streets talking of many things, and I remember that on getting home I sat down and wrote about half a page of [...] "An Outcast of the Islands" [...] before I slept. This was committing myself definitely, I won't say to another life, but to another book. There is apparently something in my character which will not allow me to abandon for good any piece of work I have begun. I have laid aside many beginnings. I have laid them aside with sorrow, with disgust, with rage, with melancholy and even with self-contempt; but even at the worst I had an uneasy consciousness that I would have to go back to them.|$|E

5|$|With {{highways}} in {{and near}} Moab {{back in the}} 1960s limited to just two state-maintained highways, there was no state route built to access <b>Dead</b> Horse <b>Point.</b> The only two highways in the area were U.S. Route 160 (now U.S. Route 191) and State Route 128. There were two routes assigned {{in the direction of}} <b>Dead</b> Horse <b>Point</b> in the 1960s, SR-278 and SR-279. The route that SR-313 runs along was mapped by 1969, stretching all the way to <b>Dead</b> Horse <b>Point</b> as an unmarked county highway. Though SR-279 was completed in 1962, SR-278 was never constructed. In 1975, the proposal for SR-278 was cancelled. In its place, the Utah Department of Transportation assigned SR-313, assuming maintenance for what was local roads.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{suggests}} a new {{implementation of the}} active set method for solving linear programming problems. The proposed method {{is based on the}} observation that the search direction can be obtained via the solution of a linear least squares subproblem. It is shown that the steepest descent direction can be computed by solving the same least squares subproblem but with simple bounds on the variables. This direction is used to prevent cycling at degenerate <b>dead</b> <b>points.</b> Numerical experiments illustrate the feasibility of the new approach...|$|R
