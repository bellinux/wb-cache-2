5|$|Residual lead <b>in</b> <b>soil</b> {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination <b>in</b> <b>soil.</b> Lead content <b>in</b> <b>soil</b> may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries that no longer have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E

40|$|Summary: The {{relative}} abundance of entomopathogenic nematodes and fungi was estimated for 10 sites {{in each of}} indigenous forest, pasture, and cropland habitats by baiting soil samples with Galleria larvae. The steinernematid Steinernema feltiae (Filip) was the dominant nematode, occurring <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from all three habitat types. The heterorhabditid Heterorhabditis zelandica Poinar was recovered only from soils of podocarp (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (A. Rich.)) forests. Galleria infection by nematodes was higher <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from forest habitat than <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from pasture and cropland. Among the sampled forests, nematode infection was higher <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from podocarp stands than those from broadleaf stands. The deuteromycete fungi Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin, Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin, and Paecilomyces cf. cicadae (Miquel) Samson, and a Entomophthorales zygomycete, tentatively identified as a Tarchium species, were recovered from the Galleria baits. Infection of Galleria by B. bassiana and M. anisopliae occurred <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from all habitat types, while that by P. cicadae occurred only <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from forest habitats. Tarchium was recovered from a single pasture site. The frequency of Galleria infection by these entomopathogenic fungi collectively, and by B. bassiana alone, was higher <b>in</b> pasture <b>soils</b> than <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> from either forest or cropland. These results are discussed in relation to disturbance effects of land use changes and the potential role of generalist entomopathogens as biological indicators of soil health...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSoluble organic {{fractions}} from soils of two agricultural {{sites from}} Brittany (France) have been analyzed to (i) identify {{the source of}} polar compounds <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> and (ii) evaluate the impact of organic fertilization and crop type on the distribution and concentration of polar compounds <b>in</b> <b>soils.</b> The main sources of polar compounds <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> are higher plants; they represent > 70 % of the polar compounds from the experimental sites and mainly originate from crop residues and animal manure. Crop type and animal manure application significantly increase the polar compound concentrations <b>in</b> <b>soils.</b> Among polar compounds, fatty acids cannot be used as specific markers because their distributions <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> whatever the crop type or organic fertilization type are the same. On the other hand, analysis of steroids provides interesting information. Cow and poultry manure applications increase only the concentration of steroids.

40|$|In this study, eight {{soil samples}} were {{collected}} from organic and conventional farms in a central area of South Korea. Spore communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and glomalin, a glycoprotein produced by AMF, were analyzed. Spores of Glomus clarum, G. etunicatum, G. mosseae, G. sp., Acaulospora longula, A. spinosa, Gigaspora margarita, and Paraglomus occultum were identified at the study sites, based on morphological and molecular characteristics.

Soils were spiked with soluble MoO(4) (2 -) at quantities sufficient to inhibit barley root growth by 10 % (EC(10)) or 90 % (EC(90)) and incubated for up to 18 months. The labile pool of MoO(4) (2 -) (E value) was observed to decrease <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> with incubation time, particularly <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> with high clay content. A strong relationship was observed between measures of MoO(4) (2 -) lability <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> determined using E and L value techniques (R(2) = 0. 98) suggesting E values provided a good measure of the potential plant available pool of MoO(4) (2 -) <b>in</b> <b>soils.</b> A regression model was developed that indicates clay content and incubation time were the most important factors affecting the labile pool of MoO(4) (2 -) <b>in</b> <b>soils</b> with time after addition (R(2) = 0. 70 - 0. 75).
