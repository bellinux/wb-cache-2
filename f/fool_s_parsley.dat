40|$|Graduation date: 2001 I {{evaluated}} {{the response of}} the federally listed endangered plant species Bradshaw's desert parsley (Lomatium bradshawii) to livestock grazing and small mammal depredation at Oak Creek, Linn County, Oregon, 1997 - 1998. I established six study blocks (three each in wooded and herbaceous pastures) with plots in each block {{randomly assigned to one of}} four intensities of livestock grazing based on biomass remaining after grazing (no grazing [1, 746 kg/ha], high biomass [969 kg/ha], moderate biomass [670 kg/ha], and light biomass [318 kg/ha]). Small mammals were live-trapped in each of the study blocks pre and post application of the livestock grazing treatments. I mapped and measured 2, 807 Bradshaw's desert parsley plants (n 1, 366 in the wooded and n = 1, 441 in the herbaceous pastures) over the two year period to determine changes in schizocarp production, morphological structure (conical surface area and height), population composition (plant stage), survival, emergence of new plants, and effects of small mammal herbivory pre and post application of livestock grazing. Grazing reductions in standing crop biomass appeared to have a positive effect on emergence of new Bradshaw's desert parsley plants, while having no detectible effect on total plant density or survival. Differences in total plant density, survival, schizocarp production, morphological structure, and population composition were related to pasture type. residual standing crop biomass may reduce small mammal use of an area, and thus may serve to reduce the impacts of small mammal herbivory. I found differences in small mammal depredation of Bradshaw's desert parsley between pastures and among livestock grazing treatments. Standing crop biomass and peak vole abundance were significant covariates in plant depredation rates. Livestock grazing initially appears to have increased Bradshaw' <b>s</b> desert <b>parsley</b> plant emergence and density of several plant stages, but did not enhance survival at the Oak Creek site. I examined only the initial response of Bradshaw' <b>s</b> desert <b>parsley</b> to livestock grazing; long-term impacts of this management practice are unknown. Direct comparisons between livestock grazing and other forms of vegetation management, such as mowing and prescribed burning, currently do not exist for Bradshaw's desert parsley and warrant further investigation...|$|R
50|$|Yan Mei Neong was admired greatly by {{many and}} became {{attracted}} to Cheung Sing because he's {{the only man}} that couldn't be enthralled by her charms. Realizing he is missing badly for Tao Fa, Mei Neong easily <b>fooled</b> Cheung <b>Sing</b> by mimicking her younger sister and spent the night with him, leading her to be pregnant. When the real Tao Fa returned, Cheung Sing wasn't sure how to explain himself and things got complicated when Mei Neong reunited with Tao Fa as sisters. After the secret was blown, Tao Fa was hurt and decided to leave Cheung Sing {{to make it easier}} for him to love her sister and take care of his child. However, Cheung Sing was ever loyal to his wife and even publicly embarrassed himself by officially making it a court case to prove he was duped into sleeping with Yan Mei Neong and not because he was unfaithful. Once it was proven he was tricked into infidelity, Tao Fa returned to Cheung Sing's side, but earned the ire and wrath of Mei Neong.|$|R

Finally, there is a brief coda that explores the other striking similarities that the two plays have in common...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{antibacterial}} effects of several essential oils (EOs) alone and in combination against different Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria associated with food products. Parsley, lovage, basil, and thyme EOs, as well as their mixtures (1 : 1, v/v), were tested against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium. The inhibitory effects ranged from strong (thyme EO against E. coli) to no inhibition (parsley EO against P. aeruginosa). Thyme EO exhibited strong (against E. coli), moderate (against S. typhimurium and B. cereus), or mild inhibitory effects (against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus), and basil EO showed mild (against E. coli and B. cereus) or no inhibitory effects (against S. typhimurium, P. aeruginosa, and <b>S.</b> aureus). <b>Parsley</b> and lovage EOs revealed no inhibitory effects against all tested strains. Combinations of lovage/thyme and basil/thyme EOs displayed antagonistic effects against all bacteria, parsley/thyme EOs against B. cereus, S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and E. coli, and lovage/basil EOs against B. cereus and E. coli. Combinations of parsley/lovage and parsley/basil EOs exhibited indifferent effects against all bacteria. The combination of lovage/basil EO showed indifferent effect against S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, and S. typhimurium, and the combination parsley/thyme EO against S. typhimurium. Thyme EO has the highest percentage yield and antibacterial potential from all tested formulations; its combination with parsley, lovage, and basil EOs determines a reduction of its antibacterial activity. Hence, it is recommended to be used alone as the antibacterial agent...|$|R

40|$|Insects are {{the main}} pests of many crops despite many {{different}} control measures. There {{is a need for}} {{a better understanding of the}} factors that affect the relationship between insects and plants. It is important to investigate how insects find and choose their host plants. One factor affecting the relationship between insects and plants is plant-derived chemical cues. Many plants release increased levels of volatiles after insect herbivory. How the so-called induced volatiles affect the herbivore when it is about to oviposit is not well known. Avoidance of plants that release herbivore-induced plant volatiles in relation to oviposition have been found in some Lepidoptera species. Anderson & Alborn (1999) showed that females of Spodoptera littoralis choose to lay eggs on undamaged cotton plants, in two-choice test with damaged plants. In these bioassays the females showed that they were able to discriminate between damaged and undamaged cotton plants, until 10 days after the herbivory was terminated. This study has investigated how the induced defence, in cotton and maize, respectively affect the pattern of oviposition in S. littoralis. Herbivory by S. littoralis larvae induce changes in female decision of oviposition on cotton plants. My bioassays in cotton showed that S. littoralis is affected by the induced defence: the females prefer to oviposit on undamaged plants over damaged plants. My bioassays in the maize variety Pactol showed partly the same pattern as in the cotton, while in the variety Delprim there was no response from the females to larval feeding. From the literature it is known that if herbivory by S. littoralis on maize is ceased, the emissions of the induced plant volatiles drop rapidly already 10 hours after the stop and the emissions of plant volatiles from damaged maize plants are reduced to almost zero until day 3 after the damage occurred. In comparison, the induced defence in cotton lasts longer than in maize. S. littoralis larvae faeces only made a difference in the bioassay with the ongoing damage on cotton, in the sense that the females oviposited more on the side with undamaged plants compared to the side with the ongoing damage. In the bioassays with the ceased herbivory, with the damaged leaves still left on the plants, there was no impact on choices of the females. In a bioassay with the dummy paper plants, the females did not oviposit. In this case, the females lacked at least one of the cues needed for oviposition on a plant, such as the odour and the contact with the texture of the leaves. It was obvious that the dummies did not <b>fool</b> <b>S.</b> littoralis of being a host plant good enough to oviposit on. It seems like the decision by the female on how many eggs to oviposit could be controlled at two levels. S. littoralis can control both the number of egg batches as well as the number of eggs per egg batch in their choice between different oviposition places; this was shown in the case with the maize variety Pactol...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{microbiological}} quality of fresh vegetables collected from several regions in Bekaa Valley areas. A total of 63 vegetable samples irrigated from Litani River in Bekaa Valley in Lebanon namely lettuce, parsley and Malva samples and other control vegetables samples irrigated from ground water wells were examined to assess microbial contamination level. The microbiological quality of fresh vegetables ranged from 4. 3 to 10. 4 log 10 CFU g - 1 (aerobic bacteria); 2. 0 to 0. 71 log 10 CFU g - 1 (coliforns); 1. 0 to 8. 77 log 10 CFU g - 1 (E. coli) and 1. 47 to 8. 77 log 10 CFU g - 1 (S. aureus). Lettuce samples had significantly higher microbial loads including coliforms, E. coli and <b>S.</b> aureus than <b>parsley</b> samples collected from different locations in Bekaa Valley. Neither E. coli nor S. aureus had been detected on Malva samples. In addition, Barelias had higher microbial loads, coliform, E. coli and S. aureus than any other location investigated in Bekaa Valley. Moreover, E. coli was significantly higher in lettuce samples (42. 30 %) than in parsley samples (13. 8 %) and S. aureus was significantly more often detected in lettuce samples (51. 5 %) than in parsley samples (38 %). This study demonstrated that lettuce and parsley which are usually consumed raw may contain pathogenic microorganisms and represent a risk for human health...|$|R
6000|$|I say {{it seems}} odd {{that such a}} writer should not be {{appreciated}} in a flash; but upon this point there is evidently a real difference of opinion, and it constitutes for me the strangest difficulty of the subject. I hear many people complain that Bernard Shaw deliberately mystifies them. I cannot imagine what they mean; {{it seems to me}} that he deliberately insults them. His language, especially on moral questions, is generally as straight and solid as that of a bargee and far less ornate and symbolic than that of a hansom-cabman. The prosperous English Philistine complains that Mr. Shaw is making a fool of him. Whereas Mr. Shaw is not in the least making a fool of him; Mr. Shaw is, with laborious lucidity, calling him a <b>fool.</b> G. B. <b>S.</b> calls a landlord a thief; and the landlord, instead of denying or resenting it, says, [...] "Ah, that fellow hides his meaning so cleverly that one can never make out what he means, it is all so fine spun and fantastical." [...] G. B. S. calls a statesman a liar to his face, and the statesman cries in a kind of ecstasy, [...] "Ah, what quaint, intricate and half-tangled trains of thought! Ah, what elusive and many-coloured mysteries of half-meaning!" [...] I think it is always quite plain what Mr. Shaw means, even when he is joking, and it generally means that the people he is talking to ought to howl aloud for their sins. But the average representative of them undoubtedly treats the Shavian meaning as tricky and complex, when it is really direct and offensive. He always accuses Shaw of pulling his leg, at the exact moment when Shaw is pulling his nose.|$|R
40|$|In the {{introduction}} to this volume, Alan Velie and Gerald Vizenor claim that these essays, by both native and non-native authors, represent 2 Ì† 2 American Indian perspectives. 2 Ì† 2 By making this claim they indicate that particular American Indian perspectives exist while acknowledging {{that they are not}} limited to tribal members. The volume brings together articles previously published in the journal Genre and Volume 19 of the University of Oklahoma 2 Ì† 7 s American Indian Literature and Critical Studies. This fine collection of essays presents scholarship that is sympathetic to Native experiences and foregrounds problems of American identity. The essays cover a range of contemporary Native American issues and literature and also represent recent important works in Native American studies. Robert Allen Warrior 2 Ì† 7 s analysis of Vine Deloria Jr. 2 Ì† 7 s work in 2 Ì† 22 Ì† 7 Temporary Visibility 2 Ì† 7 : Deloria on Sovereignty and AIM 2 Ì† 2 presents one aspect of the larger argument he makes in his recent book Tribal Secrets. James Ruppert 2 Ì† 7 s 2 Ì† 2 Mediation in Contemporary Native American Writing 2 Ì† 2 is similar to the theoretical introductory chapter of his survey, Mediation in Native American Fiction. Kimberly M. Blaeser 2 Ì† 7 s analysis of Gerald Vizenor 2 Ì† 7 s work in 2 Ì† 2 The New 2 Ì† 7 Frontier 2 Ì† 7 of Native American Literature: Dis-Arming History with Tribal Humor 2 Ì† 2 is a good introduction to her recent literary biography, Gerald Vizenor: Writing in Oral Tradition. Vizenor 2 Ì† 7 s writings and his 2 Ì† 2 shadow plays 2 Ì† 2 are also discussed by Juana Marie Rodriguez. Additionally, the collection includes a pair of essays by well-established critics of Native American Literature, Helen Jaskoski and Alan Velie. Velie offers an historical analysis of James Welch 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>Fools</b> Crow and Vizenor 2 Ì† 7 s The Heirs of Columbus while Jaskoski discusses 2 Ì† 2 autoethnography 2 Ì† 2 in 2 Ì† 2 Andrew Blackbird 2 Ì† 7 s Smallpox Story. 2 Ì† 2 Kurt Peters offers an oral history discussion of Lagunas working for the Santa Fe railroad. Perhaps the weakest essay in the collection is Robert Berner 2 Ì† 7 s 2 Ì† 2 American Myth: Old, New, Yet Untold. 2 Ì† 2 By suggesting that Native Americans have appropriated language of genocide and holocaust, Berner dismisses much of contemporary criticism that uses such language to explain the enormity of destruction that has occurred to native peoples on this continent. The final and provocative essay, 2 Ì† 2 Native American Indian Identities: Autoinscriptions and the Cultures of Names, 2 Ì† 2 is by Vizenor. Here he unmasks 2 Ì† 2 post Indian 2 Ì† 2 pretenders like Jamake Highwater who have appropriated Indianness into literatures of dominance. This concluding essay reaffirms the central importance of American Indian perspectives. Vizenor advocates the literature of survivance. The selected essays in this volume likewise reject literatures of dominance while demonstrating Native American survivance...|$|R
