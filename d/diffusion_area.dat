40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we report the {{determination}} of the <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> for oxygen reduction in porous electrode structure having a controlled platinum loading and based on capped platinum electrocatalysts and carbon nanotubes. Such a parameter is expected to be higher than the macroscopic geometrical area of the active porous layer. The oxygen <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> is determined by cyclic voltammetry after impregnation of the electrode structure by the electrolyte, and using the equations available for peak potential and peak current as a function of scan speed for irreversible redox couple. First it is found first that the oxygen <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> is dependent on the total amount of platinum in the electrode. Second, for a given platinum loading, the <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> is higher when the mass ratio of platinum to carbon nanotube decreases. This point indicates that the accessibility of platinum capped electrocatalyst is better in such cases. It is thus concluded that the oxygen <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> determination in porous electrode structures may be used to characterize the accessibility of the capped electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction.

30|$|A {{method for}} growing in situ organic nanoflakes or nanofibers on a {{transistor}} platform was demonstrated in this work. The {{results show that}} the morphology of the nanostructures is strongly influenced by the drain and source electrodes width. When the gold electrodes are narrow, the p- 6 P molecules form high and narrow flake-like structures. This could be explained by topographical boundaries for p- 6 P diffusion on these substrates, which leads to more vertical aggregation. On wider gold electrodes, the larger surface <b>diffusion</b> <b>areas</b> lead to nanofiber growth, similar to growth on plane gold surfaces [21] (faceted morphology). The nanofibers start to conduct electrical current at lower VDS than the nanoflakes. The proposed explanation for this behavior is that the p- 6 P nanofibers have a bigger contact area with the electrodes, which reduces the contact resistance. Both kinds of structures present typical electrical characteristics of an organic semiconductor connected to a metal electrode in which a current starts to flow after application of a certain voltage.|$|R
40|$|Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) plays a {{key role}} in {{analyzing}} the physi-cal structures of biological tissues, particularly in reconstructing fiber tracts of the human brain in vivo.

The <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> {{is one of the}} most complex area in the fab. A significant number of lots has to be processed while satisfying complex equipment process and line management constraints. The purpose of this study is to investigate approaches to group lots in batches, to assign the batches on the equipment and to sequence these batches. Three indicators are used to evaluate the quality of a solution: the total number of moves, the batching coefficient and the X-factor. The problem is modeled through the disjunctive graph formulation. A constructive algorithm is proposed and improvement procedures based on iterative sampling and simulated annealing are developed. Computational experiments, carried out on actual industrial problem instances, show the ability of iterative sampling to improve significantly the initial solution. The proposed simulated annealing method brings in turn important enhancements to the results of iterative sampling.

Doubling the gas <b>diffusion</b> <b>area</b> by adding an additional air cathode or a diffusion cloth significantly increased the ammonia and COD removal rates (by up to 115 % and 39 %), ammonia removal efficiency (by up to 134 %), the cell voltage and cathode potentials, and the power densities (by a factor of approximately 2). When the COD/N ratio was lowered from 13 to 3, we found up to 244 % higher ammonia removal rate but at least 19 % lower ammonia removal efficiency. An increase of COD removal rate by up to 27 % was also found when the COD/N ratio was lowered from 11 to 3. The Coulombic efficiency was not affected by the additional air cathode, but decreased by an average of 11 % {{with the addition of a}} diffusion cloth.

A MegaLibrary {{is a very}} large standard cell library in terms of logic functions and variants in terms of drive strength and relative transistor sizing (such as P/N ratio or tapered inputs).

As a typical standard cell library contains only a small subset of the possible Boolean functions, 2 or more standard cells are needed to implement functions not found in the library. As an example, there are 3984 Boolean P-equivalent functions with 4 inputs and about 37 million with 5 inputs. The concept of automatic generation of footprint-compatible cells was also introduced.
