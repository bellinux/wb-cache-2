The investigation was performed during periods of high (May, 2002) and low (October, 2002) water conditions. Meio- and macrozoobenthos were observed. Qualitative, quantitative, and saprobiological analyses were performed. The sampling area covered five stations along 66 km of the river. The community was represented by 26 species. Aquatic worms were the principal component of the benthos with respect to both species richness (six species) and abundance (58. 39 - 99. 47 % of the total community). Gastropods were also diverse (six species). Snails were found to be subdominant as far as participation in the total community density is concerned. Structure of the benthic community and the saprobity index (S = 2. 78 - 3. 43) indicated the presence of organic pollution. No notable differences of estimated environmental quality were observed between a station upstream from Belgrade and one situated below <b>the</b> <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> broader <b>territory</b> of Belgrade. Since Belgrade is {{recognized as one of the}} main contaminants in regard to biodegradable pollutants in the Middle Danube, this finding points to an impressive self-purifying ability of this huge river...|$|R
40|$|The Fourth Gospel is inordinately {{involved}} with places and spaces, valuing some, but dis-valuing others. The task of interpreting all such references is greatly {{aided by the}} use of the anthropological model of "territoriality” which shows how all peoples 1) classify space, 2) communicate this and 3) control access to or <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> this <b>territory.</b> <b>The</b> classifications might be: public-private, sacred/profane, honorable/shameful, clean/unclean, fixed/fluid, center/periphery and the like. Where appropriate, these classifications are used  to interpret the Johannine data on spaces and places, particularly 1) Galilee/Judean, 2) public/in secret, 3) not on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, 4)   whence/whither, 5) in my Father’s house there are many rooms, 6)   “in-dwelling” and “being-in” another;  and 7) two different worlds...|$|R

5000|$|The law [...] "On {{the legal}} status of foreign {{citizens}} in the USSR" [...] was used by the Russian Federation. Action extended from 1 January 1993. Chapter III of the law [...] "entry into the USSR and exit from the USSR Foreign citizens" [...] was replaced adopted the Federal Law No.114-FZ 1996 [...] "On the Order of Exit from the Russian Federation".The law was repealed with the adoption of the Federal Law 115-FZ on 25 Jul 2002 On the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the Russian Federation.The laws establishes that as a general rule all foreign citizens and stateless persons need visas for entry and <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> of Russia and the period of temporary stay (90 days within 180). It also establishes a number of exceptions addressing certain groups of travelers.It {{should be noted that the}} basis of {{the legal status}} of foreign citizens and stateless persons are secured primarily by the Constitution of the Russian Federation 1993 - Art. 62 and Art. 63.|$|E
50|$|According to Clark, Golder, and Golder, an {{application}} of Albert O. Hirschman's exit, voice, and loyalty model is that if individuals have plausible exit options, then a government {{may be more likely}} to democratize. James C. Scott argues that governments may find it difficult to claim a sovereignty over a population when that population is in motion. Scott additionally asserts that exit may not solely include physical <b>exit</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>territory</b> of a coercive state, but can include a number of adaptive responses to coercion that make it more difficult for states to claim sovereignty over a population. These responses can include planting crops that are more difficult for states to count, or tending livestock that are more mobile. In fact, the entire political arrangement of a state is a result of individuals adapting to the environment, and making a choice as to whether or not to stay in a territory. If people are free to move, then the exit, voice, and loyalty model predicts that a state will have to be of that population representative, and appease the populous in order to prevent them from leaving. If individuals have plausible exit options then they are better able to constrain a government’s arbitrary behaviour through threat of exit. For instance, Alex Tabarrok argues that the reverse of this occurred in Ferguson, Missouri; those who could left the township, but ultimately the local government abused its power as people could not exit in part due to a string of excessive fines which forced them to stay.|$|E
