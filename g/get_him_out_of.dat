During the journey the wizard disappears on side errands dimly hinted at, only to appear again at key moments in the story. Thorin Oakenshield, the proud, pompous head of the company of dwarves and heir to the destroyed dwarvish kingdom under the Lonely Mountain, makes many mistakes in his leadership, relying on Gandalf and Bilbo to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> trouble, but he proves himself a mighty warrior.

5|$|In September 1929, Wessel met Erna Jänicke, a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in {{a tavern}} {{not far from}} Alexanderplatz. Some sources claim Wessel earned money as Jänicke's procurer. On 1 November she moved into his room {{on the third floor}} of 62 Große Frankfurter Straße (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sub-let from 29-year old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Freedom Fighter, {{although}} she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent; Salm wanted Jänicke to leave, but she refused to, and Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help on the evening of 14 January 1930. At first the Communists were not interested in helping her, as she was not well-liked by them because of her refusal to allow the KPD to give her husband the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Freedom Fighters League, but when they realised that Horst Wessel was involved, they agreed to give Wessel a beating and <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Salm's flat by force.|$|E

5|$|Victor and Nikki finally remarry in March 2013 {{just before}} she is {{diagnosed}} with multiple sclerosis. At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming {{to take back the}} company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up overdosing on. Jack reported Victor to the FDA and he and his company were put under investigation. Dylan's supposed father and Nikki's former lover Ian Ward (Ray Wise) then arrives in town and causes pandemonium, to which Victor tries to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> town.

Victor and Nikki later learn that Ian is incapable of fathering children, leading to confusion. It is later revealed that Paul Williams (Doug Davidson), Nikki's ex-lover and longtime friend, is in fact Dylan's father, causing tension in Victor and Nikki's marriage, which continues when Victor goes to extensive lengths to awaken Phyllis (Gina Tognoni) from a coma in order to find out more information on Sharon's supposed secret. Nikki falls off the wagon and begins drinking again; she leaves Victor and refuses to take him back. Victor also sells Chancellor Industries back to Jill (Jess Walton), leaving the rest of the Newman family confused as to why he gave Chancellor up so easily.|$|E

25|$|Tony Randall portrayed Poirot in The Alphabet Murders, a 1965 film {{also known}} as The ABC Murders. This was more a satire of Poirot than a {{straightforward}} adaptation, and was greatly changed from the original. Much of the story, set in modernistic times, was played for comedy, with Poirot investigating the murders while evading the attempts by Hastings (Robert Morley) and the police to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> England and back to Belgium.|$|E

He was eventually able to convince the caliph to go along with the plan, and al-Muntasir ordered Wasif to head to the Byzantine frontier.|$|E
25|$|Dill was {{promoted}} field marshal on 18 November 1941, but {{by this time}} it was clear how poorly he and Churchill got on. Dill gained a reputation as unimaginative and obstructionist. Keen to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way, Churchill at the end of 1941 had Dill advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) and posted him to Washington as his personal representative where he became Chief of the British Joint Staff Mission, then Senior British Representative on the Combined Chiefs of Staff. Dill showed a great flair as a diplomatic military presence. In 1943 alone he attended the Quebec Conference, the Casablanca Conference, the Tehran Conference and meetings in India, China and Brazil. He also served on the Combined Policy Committee set up by the British and United States governments under the Quebec Agreement to oversee the construction of the atomic bomb.|$|E

25|$|At {{this time}} he also faced his first moral dilemma. After Owen was censured again after being fired, {{students}} were threatened with punishment for associating with him. However, Penn stood by the dean, thereby gaining a fine and reprimand from the university. The Admiral, despairing of the charges, pulled young Penn away from Oxford, hoping to distract him from the heretical influences of the university. The attempt had no effect and father and son struggled to understand each other. Back at school, the administration imposed stricter religious requirements including daily chapel attendance and required dress. Penn rebelled against enforced worship and was expelled. His father, in a rage, attacked young Penn with a cane and forced him from their home. Penn's mother made peace in the family, which allowed her son to return home but she quickly concluded that both her social standing and her husband's career were being threatened by their son's behaviour. So at age 18, young Penn was sent to Paris to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> view, improve his manners, and expose him to another culture.|$|E

25|$|In {{place of}} these, Gowen {{proposed}} his own reorganization plan based, one more time, upon optimistic earnings estimates {{and his ability}} to attract new money into the company. Also, one more time, his oration carried the audience into great enthusiasm. Such was the momentum generated by Gowen's overall campaign that Keim conceded the January 1886 presidential election in advance; Gowen and his Board of Managers slate were elected unanimously and adopted a resolution calling for a change in the receivership. Notwithstanding the optimistic reorganization plan Gowen rode back into the presidency, shareholder enthusiasm and a board resolution were insufficient to remove the Reading from its deeply troubled circumstance. Before Gowen was able to mobilize any of the money required to take action, Morgan reentered the arena, this time heading a syndicate that offered to return peace and prosperity to the company through a different means. An anonymous member of Morgan's syndicate described a central element of the proposed peace:In order to do this it has been found necessary to get rid of Mr. Gowen. We have all combined to <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> railroad management, just as all the powers of Europe combined to crush Napoleon, {{and there will be no}} peace until Mr. Gowen is in St. Helena. He is an able and brilliant man and in some respects a veritable Napoleon, but he is no railroad manager.... The trouble with Mr. Gowen is that he wants to be fighting all the time. When he was after the Molly Maguires he was in his element, but as a railroad manager he is a failure.|$|E
