500|$|Lewis {{has said}} that he {{discovered}} [...] "I wasn't a real [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amateur leagues of high school mathematics", but was [...] "tremendously excited" [...] by the computer-science research [...] at Harvard.|$|E
500|$|Afework Hagos, a {{computer}} programmer, {{was on his}} way to work and stuck in a traffic jam near the Pentagon when the airplane flew over. [...] "There was a huge screaming noise and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car as the plane came over. Everybody was running away in different directions. It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance. It hit some lampposts on the way in." [...] Daryl Donley witnessed the crash and took some of the first photographs of the site.|$|E
500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I think {{there was a lot of}} cocaine going around, and that's when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
60|$|Just as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, <b>I</b> heard {{footsteps}} and voices under my window.|$|R
60|$|L. What! Sindbad's, which {{nobody could}} get <b>out</b> <b>of?</b> ISABEL. Yes; but Florrie and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it.|$|R
60|$|Now, do you {{see what}} I did for that man? He was on a {{downward}} path, and I rescued him. But all <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it was a watermelon.|$|R
2500|$|Roach {{was part}} of the West Indies squad which toured Sri Lanka in November and December 2010. Senior bowlers Jerome Taylor and Fidel Edwards were absent, leaving Roach {{as the head of the}} attack. In the lead up, he {{attempted}} to develop his use of swing to cope with Sri Lankan pitches traditionally unhelpful to fast bowlers. Roach remarked [...] "I still have a little bit of work to do on my lengths, but I'm satisfied with what <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> camp". Roach's performance in the Tests, finishing as the West Indies lead wicket-taker with 10wickets at an average of 24.50 for which he was named Man of the Series, was highlighted by Sammy, the team's captain, as one of the best performances of the drawn series.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{needless to}} add that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> way, and took Kitty with me, at the {{earliest}} opportunity--and left them by themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you do I shall {{get out of}} it just as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> half-crowns, and Miss Wilson {{will begin}} to think that you are mad." ...|$|E
6000|$|I thought so. I {{anticipated}} him, anyhow. I {{stayed there}} and was bombarded with old gentlemen for an hour, perhaps; and all <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{any of them}} was [...] "Oh, my!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{smiled in}} his droll fashion and replied, [...] "Because, {{interesting}} as this household is in sundry ways, I {{think it is}} about time that we, or at any rate that <b>I,</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Did you?" [...] said Tabitha, {{grasping}} her arm, {{a horrible}} {{look on her}} face. [...] "So did I. I thought they went to Ursulaâ€™s room, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed and went on the stairs to listen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] Bathurst said. [...] "I felt a sort {{of shock}} as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> water, but I don't know that I am hurt at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I DID write, after <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital, several times," [...] he said, [...] "and never {{a word in}} answer, Aunt Rachel. What was I {{to think}} when Phillippa wouldn't answer my letters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room I felt limply flat, like a {{squeezed}} lemon, and the doorkeeper in {{his glass}} cage, where I stopped {{to get my}} hat and tip him a shilling, said: ...|$|E
500|$|After divorcing Ike in 1978, Tina abstained {{from serious}} {{relationships}} {{for a long}} time, as she set on bringing her career back on track. In 1986 she said, [...] "People {{have to realize that}} <b>I</b> just <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a very difficult marriage. I'm not the type of woman who needs to jump back into another. I liked my freedom when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that one. I've had a few love affairs, but nothing important." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No,' assented the Admiral, 'not much. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it in time; {{and here}} - well, here {{everything}} pleases me. I am plain in my tastes. 'A PROPOS, {{you have never}} asked me how I liked my daughter?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] assented the Admiral, [...] "not much. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it in time; and here--well, here {{everything}} pleases me. I am plain in my tastes. A propos, {{you have}} never asked me how I liked my daughter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There was a {{gleam of}} {{sunshine}} when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> van yesterday. I never knew before what sunshine was. I {{hope it will}} be a sunny day when I go out for the last time!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, man, for G----d's sake! If the {{servants}} hear you talking that way, I'm dished. If it once got abroad about my taking her off, I'd have the devil to pay before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country." ...|$|E
60|$|Very {{pleased to}} find that the object of our search still lived there, Polly and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fly and went in; while Harry, who said he hated this sort of thing, stopped outside to look after the boxes.|$|E
6000|$|Daylight stared his amazement at this cryptic utterance. [...] "That sure beats me. I {{always said}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my depth with women, and you've <b>got</b> me <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my depth now. Why {{you want me}} to lose everything, seeing as you like me--" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{expected}} a hamper from Peggotty, and brightened at the order. Some {{of the boys}} about me put in their claim not to be forgotten {{in the distribution of}} the good things, as <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my seat with great alacrity.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, and <b>I</b> {{ought to}} have lit a candle, but I didn't think of it {{until it was too}} late. It was the darkest place that ever was. There has never been {{darkness}} any thicker than that. It just lay in cakes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{once for}} all, I'll {{tell you the}} facts. As <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> train a man I'd seen once {{before in my life}} made an attack upon me, and before the police came up, I got a blow in the face. Now you know all about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By my honour, then, I didn't see {{anything}} from the time <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brook. I'd enough to do to sit where I was, and keep the mare's head straight. When she made the great leap, I hardly felt her feet come to the ground, she came down so lightly." ...|$|E
6000|$|At last, when I {{began to}} fancy that I was spirally {{climbing}} the Tower of Babel in a dream, I {{was brought to}} fact by alarming noises, stoppage, and the driver saying that [...] "it couldn't be done." [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car and suddenly forgot that I had ever been in it.|$|E
60|$|After a short rest I started forward, {{slow and}} {{stealthy}} as a creeping cat. When within fifty {{feet of the}} fire I went down on all-fours and began to crawl. Twice <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> line. But at last Dick's burly shoulders loomed up {{between me and the}} light.|$|R
60|$|I {{protest that}} if some great Power {{would agree to}} make me always think what is true and do what is right, on {{condition}} of being turned {{into a sort of}} clock and wound up every morning before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bed, <b>I</b> should instantly close with the offer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, we are, devilish good friends," [...] he {{answered}} with assurance; [...] "known {{each other from}} boyhood, and all that. And I say, old chap," [...] he added, [...] "you needn't be jealous of me, you know. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that long ago. And I'm after something else now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} impatiently, [...] "of course! I wasn't alone. Don't you understand? <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coach to walk uphill {{on the bank}} under the trees. It was so hot and stuffy. My foot must have slipped up there--and--I--slid--down. Have you heard any one calling me? Have you called out yourself?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't do it, ma'm," [...] the boy repeated. [...] "Directly <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate, I {{started off}} to run home. I hadn't gone not twenty yards when I heard a smash; but I wasn't going for to stop {{to see what}} it was. It weren't no {{business}} of mine, and that's all I know about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was late}} {{yesterday}} evening before I arrived at Bingen. A servant {{was waiting to}} take my portmanteau, when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coach. After first asking my name, he communicated to me the melancholy tidings of dear Mr. Engelman's death. He had sunk under a fit of apoplexy, at an early hour that morning.|$|E
60|$|I led {{him without}} any delay into Mrs. Bunter's private sitting-room. After she had dropped a tear over the late cannibal, given a hug to her Winston, {{and told him}} that he must grow his {{moustache}} again, the dear lady tucked her feet upon the sofa, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Bunter's way.|$|R
2500|$|For {{a week in}} January 2005 {{he worked}} with Nolan Ryan at Ryan's {{off-season}} pitching camp in Houston. [...] Hirsh said: [...] "The biggest thing <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it was the confidence ... Phil Garner and Nolan Ryan sit there {{and tell you that}} you've got the stuff to be in the big leagues." ...|$|R
5000|$|The A.V. Club {{gave it a}} {{grade of}} [...] "D+", saying: [...] "I didnâ€™t get it, and neither did any other American I spoke to, but the French were applauding madly throughout, {{apparently}} in response to policy statements. Director and star have an easy rapport, but thatâ€™s all <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, Iâ€™m afraid." ...|$|R
