500|$|A. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the {{following}} about this. The term [...] "special treatment" [...] (Sonderbehandlung) has various meanings.

On these forms it says, [...] "Re: Special Treatment" [...] - first of all for Poles suitable for Germanization (eindeutschungsfaehig), and the same word, special treatment, is also for Poles not suitable for Germanization, that is those to be sent from the Eastern Occupied Territories to the Generalgouvernement. So that is one meaning of special treatment (Sonderbehandlung). Special Treatment also means - I {{want to say this}} here in this context as well, although I know that it is known - also means all transports of Jews, the deportation transports.|$|E

500|$|Fan {{reaction}} was largely positive, though certain fans {{complained that the}} game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato {{were aware of the}} changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, wondering what the Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever [...] "really got through to them". He continued, [...] "Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths.

500|$|Mardas {{was given}} his own {{laboratory}} called Apple Electronics, at 34 Boston Place, Westminster, London, and was helped {{to obtain a}} British work visa. His pay eventually rose to £6,000 per year, and an American patent attorney, Alfred Crotti, moved to England to assist Mardas. In a historical TV promo for Apple Corps included on the Beatles Anthology DVD, Mardas is shown wearing a white laboratory assistant's coat in Apple Electronics (with loud oscillating noises in the background) saying, [...] "Hello, I'm Alexis, from Apple Electronics. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Hello' to all my brothers around the world, and to all the girls around the world, and to all the electronic people around the world. That is Apple Electronics." [...] Mardas then turns and points back to a collection of two portable 2-track recorders in wooden boxes, a 2-track studio recording machine, voltage meters, a hi-fi amplifier, an oscilloscope, and a TV screen showing pulsating psychedelic balloon shapes. A mysterious fire at the laboratory prevented Mardas from presenting his inventions, but he later said: [...] "I'm a rock gardener, and now I'm doing electronics. Maybe next year, I make films or poems. I have no formal training in any of these, but this is irrelevant".|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the other}} units of the Mid-Ulster Brigade soon affirmed their loyalty to the leadership. Wright ignored an order to leave Northern Ireland by 1 September 1996, and hours before the {{deadline}} attended a Royal Black Preceptory march and a celebration at a club in Portadown's Corcrain estate, receiving a hero's welcome at both events. On 4 September, at least 5,000 loyalists attended a rally in Portadown in support of Wright. The rally was addressed by Reverend William McCrea (a DUP Member of Parliament) and Harold Gracey (head of the Portadown Orange Lodge). McCrea made a speech critical of David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson for what he felt was their involvement in the death threats. McCrea's sharing of the stage with a militant such as Wright caused uproar, although he argued that he was merely supporting Wright's entitlement to freedom of speech. Ignoring the threat, Wright, in a public show of defiance, formed the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), taking members mainly from the officially-disbanded Portadown unit of the UVF Mid-Ulster Brigade. According to writers John Robert Gold and George Revill, Wright's [...] "mythical stature" [...] amongst loyalists [...] "provided him with the status necessary to form the LVF" [...] in the traditional UVF stronghold of Portadown. Appearing at a Drumcree protest rally, Wright made the following statement: [...] "I will not be leaving Ulster, I will not change my mind about what I believe is happening in Ulster. But all <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{is that it has}} broken my heart to think that fellow loyalists would turn their guns on me, and I have to ask them, 'For whom are you doing it?'". Wright's hardline stance won the support of a number of leading loyalists, including UVF colleague Jackie Mahood, Frankie Curry of the Red Hand Commandos and Alex Kerr of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Kerr, another key figure at the Drumcree standoff, had also been ordered by the Combined Loyalist Military Command to leave Northern Ireland on pain of execution.|$|E

But in my eyes it's a crazy album…I'm really proud of myself for this record." [...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work. I {{know a lot of}} rappers say that when they dropping they albums, but I'm one of those dudes it ain't like I drop mixtapes. It ain't like I do that type of stuff. Drop songs every month to let you know I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
