5000|$|Sawan (सावन, ਸਾਵਣ) is a fifth {{month in}} the Hindu calendar. It is derived from Sanskrit: श्रावण. Many Indian {{calendars}} started in different eras such as Shaka Calendar ( [...] national calendar of India) traditional Vikrama {{as well as a}} new Nanakshahi calendar created few years ago by SGPC which governs the activities within Sikhism. This month coincides with July and August in the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> and is 31 days long, like the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars.</b>|$|R
5|$|Constantine {{enforced}} {{the prohibition}} of the First Council of Nicaea against celebrating the Lord's Supper {{on the day before}} the Jewish Passover (14 Nisan) (see Quartodecimanism and Easter controversy). This marked a definite break of Christianity from the Judaic tradition. From then on the Roman <b>Julian</b> <b>Calendar,</b> a solar calendar, was given precedence over the lunisolar Hebrew Calendar among the Christian churches of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{observations}} and recording of a transit of Venus {{were made in}} 1639 by the English astronomers Jeremiah Horrocks and his friend and correspondent William Crabtree. The pair made their observations independently on 4December that year (24November under the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> then used in England); Horrocks from Carr House, then {{in the village of}} Much Hoole, Lancashire, and Crabtree from his home in Broughton, near Manchester.|$|E
5|$|George Washington was {{the first}} child of Augustine Washington (1694–1743) and his second wife Mary Ball Washington (1708–1789), born on their Pope's Creek Estate near present-day Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, {{according}} to the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> and Annunciation Style of enumerating years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a birth date of February 22, 1732.|$|E
50|$|Katak (ਕੱਤਕ) is {{the eighth}} {{month of the}} Nanakshahi calendar. This month coincides with October and November in the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> and is 30 days long.|$|R

5|$|The {{observations}} {{made with}} the sundial provided essential confirmation {{of the need to}} reform the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar.</b> The anemoscope, in contrast, was a complex mechanism attached to the ceiling which was used to measure the strength and direction of the wind but soon stopped functioning. The instrument may have led to the other name of the tower, Tower of the Winds; however, an ancient observatory at Athens was also called the Tower of the Winds and might have been the source for inspiration.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese used astronomical studies {{mainly to}} {{construct}} and revise their calendar. In contrast to the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> (46 BCE) and Gregorian calendar (1582 CE) of the West (but like the Hellenic calendars of Classical Greece), the Chinese calendar is a lunisolar calendar, meaning that it uses the precise movements of the Sun and Moon as time-markers throughout the year. In the 5th century BCE during the Spring and Autumn period, the Chinese established the Sifen calendar (古四分历), which measured the tropical year at 3651⁄4 days (like the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> of Rome). Emperor Wu replaced this with the new Taichu calendar (太初历) in 104 BCE which measured the tropical year at 365385⁄1539 days and the lunar month at 2943⁄81 days. Since the Taichu calendar had become inaccurate over two centuries, Emperor Zhang of Han (r. 75–88 CE) halted its use and revived use of the Sifen calendar. Later, astronomer Guo Shoujing (1233–1316 CE) would set the tropical year at 365.2425 days for his Shoushi calendar (授時曆), the same value used in the Gregorian calendar. Besides {{the use of the}} calendar for regulating agricultural practices throughout the seasons, it was also used to mark important dates in the Sexagenary cycle—constructed by celestial stems (gan 干) and Earthly Branches (zhi 支), each of the latter associated with an animal of the Chinese zodiac.|$|E
5|$|Alexander {{was born}} at Tatoi Palace on 1 August 1893 (20 July in the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar),</b> the second son of Crown Prince Constantine of Greece of the House of Glücksburg and his wife Princess Sophia of Prussia. He was related to royalty {{throughout}} Europe. His father was the eldest son and heir apparent of King George I of Greece by his wife Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia; his mother {{was the daughter of}} Emperor Frederick III of Germany and his wife Victoria, Princess Royal of the United Kingdom. Constantine was a grandson of King Christian IX of Denmark and a cousin of both King George V of the United Kingdom and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia. Sophia was the sister of Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany, and was also a cousin of King George V through her grandmother, Queen Victoria.|$|E

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Declaration of the Rights of the Peoples of Russia, which stated that non-Russian ethnic groups living inside the Republic {{had the right}} to cede from Russian {{authority}} and establish their own independent nation-states. Many nations declared independence: Finland and Lithuania in December 1917, Latvia and Ukraine in January 1918, Estonia in February 1918, Transcaucasia in April 1918, and Poland in November 1918. Soon, the Bolsheviks actively promoted communist parties in these independent nation-states, while in July 1918, at the Fifth All-Russian Congress of the Soviets, a constitution was approved that reformed the Russian Republic into the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Seeking to modernise the country, the government officially converted Russia from the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> to the Gregorian calendar used in Europe.|$|E
5|$|John Adams {{was born}} on October 30, 1735 (October 19, 1735 Old Style, <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar)</b> to John Adams Sr. (1691–1761) and Susanna Boylston (1708–1797). He had two younger brothers, Peter and Elihu. Adams' birthplace was then in Braintree, Massachusetts (now Quincy, Massachusetts), and is {{preserved}} at Adams National Historical Park. Adams' mother was from a leading medical family of present-day Brookline, Massachusetts. His father was a deacon in the Congregational Church, a farmer, a cordwainer, and a lieutenant in the militia. His great-grandfather, Henry Adams, emigrated to Massachusetts from Braintree, Essex, England around 1638. John Sr. {{also served as a}} selectman (town councilman) and supervised the building of schools and roads. Adams often praised his father and recalled their close relationship.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of George's life, two {{calendars}} were used: the Old Style <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> and the New Style Gregorian calendar. Before 1700, the two calendars were 10 days apart. Hanover switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 19 February (O.S.) / 1 March (N.S.) 1700. Great Britain switched on 3/14 September 1752. George was born on 30 October Old Style, which was 9 November New Style, but because the calendar shifted forward a further day in 1700, the date is occasionally miscalculated as 10 November. In this article, individual dates before September 1752 are indicated as either O.S. or N.S. or both. All dates after September 1752 are N.S. only. All years are assumed to start from 1 January and not 25 March, which was the English New Year.|$|E
50|$|The Feast of Melania the Younger is held on December 31 (the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar's</b> December 31 {{falls on}} January 13 on the Gregorian calendar). In Ukraine, Malanka ("Melania's Day") is celebrated on January 13.|$|R
50|$|Jeth (ਜੇਠ) {{is a third}} {{month of}} the Nanakshahi calendar, which govern the {{activities}} within Sikhism. This month coincides with May and June in the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> and is 31 days long.|$|R

5|$|The {{month of}} August (Latin: Augustus) {{is named after}} Augustus; until his time it was called Sextilis (named so {{because it had been}} the sixth month of the {{original}} Roman calendar and the Latin word for six is sex). Commonly repeated lore has it that August has 31 days because Augustus wanted his month to match the length of Julius Caesar's July, but this is an invention of the 13th century scholar Johannes de Sacrobosco. Sextilis in fact had 31 days before it was renamed, and it was not chosen for its length (see <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar).</b> According to a senatus consultum quoted by Macrobius, Sextilis was renamed to honor Augustus because several of the most significant events in his rise to power, culminating in the fall of Alexandria, fell in that month.|$|E
5|$|Vasil Levski's hanging is {{observed}} annually across Bulgaria on 19 February instead of 18 February, {{due to the}} erroneous calculation of 19th-century <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> dates after Bulgaria adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1916. Although the location of Levski's grave has not been determined, some of his hair is on exhibit at the National Museum of Military History. After Levski gave up monkhood in 1863, he shaved his hair, which his mother and later his sister Yana preserved. Levski's personal items—such as his silver Christian cross, his copper water vessel, his Gasser revolver, made in Austria–Hungary in 1869, and the shackles from his imprisonment in Sofia—are also exhibited in the military history museum, while Levski's sabre {{can be seen in}} the Lovech regional museum.|$|E
5|$|Year 1346 (MCCCXLVI) was {{a common}} year {{starting}} on Sunday (link will display the full calendar) of the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar.</b> It was {{a year in the}} 14th century, {{in the midst of a}} period known in European history as the Late Middle Ages. In Asia that year, the Black Plague came to the troops of the Golden Horde Khanate; the disease also affected the Genoese Europeans they were attacking, before spreading to the rest of Europe. In Central and East Asia, there was a series of revolts after Kazan Khan was killed in an uprising, and the Chagatai Khanate began to splinter and fall; several revolts in China began what would eventually lead to the overthrow of the Yuan dynasty. The Indian kingdom of Vijayanagara won several victories over Muslim conquerors in the north in this year as well.|$|E
50|$|Maghar (ਮੱਘਰ) is {{the ninth}} {{month of the}} Nanakshahi calendar, which governs the {{activities}} within Sikhism. This month coincides with November and December in the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> and is 30 days long.|$|R
50|$|Phagun (ਫੱਗਣ) is {{the twelfth}} {{and last month}} of the Nanakshahi calendar, which governs {{activities}} within Sikhism. This month coincides with February and March of the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> and is 30 or 31 days long.|$|R
5000|$|The Islamic {{calendar}} is lunar, {{but not a}} lunisolar calendar {{because its}} date {{is not related to}} the sun. The civil versions of the <b>Julian</b> and Gregorian <b>calendars</b> are solar, because their dates do not indicate the moon phase [...] - [...] however, both the Gregorian and <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> include undated lunar calendars that allow them to calculate the Christian celebration of Easter, so both are lunisolar calendars in that respect.|$|R
5|$|Around the planisphere {{moves the}} rete, a {{web-like}} metal cutout representing the zodiac, which {{also features a}} <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar</b> dial. Above the rete, a display indicates {{the day of the}} week. Because leap days are not supported by the clockwork, the calendar hand has to be reset manually each leap year on 29 February. A moon dial circles the inner ring of the zodiac, displaying the moon phase. The principal hand of the clock indicates the time of day on the outer ring of 24 golden Roman numerals, which run twice from I to XII. It features two suns, the smaller one indicating the date on the retes calendar dial. The larger one circles the zodiac at one revolution per year and also rotates across the planisphere once per day. Its crossing of the horizon and dawn lines twice per day allows the timing of sunrise, dawn, dusk and sunset.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, Easter Monday, Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar,</b> Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reported}} observation of Io {{was made by}} Galileo Galilei on 7 January 1610 using a 20x-power, refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low power of his telescope, so the two were recorded as a single point of light. Io and Europa were seen {{for the first time}} as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jovian system the following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Io by the IAU). The discovery of Io and the other Galilean satellites of Jupiter was published in Galileo's Sidereus Nuncius in March 1610. In his Mundus Jovialis, published in 1614, Simon Marius claimed to have discovered Io and the other moons of Jupiter in 1609, one week before Galileo's discovery. Galileo doubted this claim and dismissed the work of Marius as plagiarism. Regardless, Marius' first recorded observation came from 29 December 1609 in the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar,</b> which equates to 8 January 1610 in the Gregorian calendar, which Galileo used. Given that Galileo published his work before Marius, Galileo is credited with the discovery.|$|E
40|$|Aim of {{this paper}} is to show how the Orthodox Church calculates date of Easter. On the basis of {{historical}} evidence it indicates the assumptions of the Paschalia system from the second century to the modern days. Paper explains differences between Julian, Gregorian and revised <b>Julian</b> <b>calendars</b> and shows how to calculate the date of Easter in present days. The text also discusses the problems of imperfection and errors, and calendars on their basis shows suggestions for their correction.

50|$|The Gregorian reform {{modified}} the <b>Julian</b> <b>calendar's</b> scheme of leap years as follows: Every year {{that is exactly}} divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 are not leap years, but the year 2000 is.|$|R
