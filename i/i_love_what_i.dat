I then {{spent a year}} at the University of Miami, Diabetes Research Institute {{studying}} islet cell transplantation. In 2005, I began medical school at NSU, College of Osteopathic Medicine where I earned both my D. O. and M. P. H. I then completed my general surgery residency at Michigan State’s Botsford Hospital in Farmington Hills, Michigan. While in residency I decided I wanted to advance my general surgery skills and pursue a career in Bariatric surgery. I am currently completing my fellowship in Bariatric and Advanced Minimally Invasive Surgery at Banner Gateway in Gilbert, Arizona. This has been a very long road, but <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> do. NSU was such an integral part of my education and training. I appreciate the many lessons I learned and the connections I have made along the way. Becoming a physician, especially a surgeon is not an easy path, and is definitely time consuming. Here is some advice {{to make the most of}} your education and life. I have found that education and work is all about finding the right fit. You have to find what graduate/medical school and especially residency is right for you. You must be selfmotivated to study and perform you best. When it comes to residency, finding the correct “fit” is most important. You will spend more time with your co-residents and attendings than your family members through this time in your life. You must like the education you will receive in your residency, but more importantly, you must like or learn to like the people you work with. This is a life skill that is invaluable. Work should not become a chore. You should wake up every day and enjoy what you do. Find a career in medicine that fits your personality, lifestyle and long-term goals. The rest will fall into place...|$|E
