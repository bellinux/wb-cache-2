25|$|Masturbation {{is little}} {{noted in the}} sources for ancient Roman sexuality. The poet Martial {{considers}} it an inferior form of sexual release resorted to by slaves. Though infrequently mentioned, masturbation was a longstanding theme in Latin satire, appearing <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> surviving fragments of Lucilius, Rome's earliest practitioner of the genre. The Romans preferred the left hand for masturbation.|$|E

25|$|The British Mandate of Palestine {{that came}} into effect in 1923 aimed at restricting land {{purchases}} of previously Arab-owned land by Jewish immigrants. For this reason the Jewish population was initially more urban and had a higher share in industrial occupations than did the Arab majority.

25|$|Cambridge Springs was {{the most}} {{important}} chess tournament {{that took place in the}} year 1904.

In 1998 the U.S. Chess Championship returned to Cambridge Springs and the tournament was held <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> hotels remaining from the railroad resort era, the Riverside Inn.|$|E

25|$|In the fresco, Perugino's {{influence}} on Pinturicchio is manifest: the Umbrian-Perugian perspective rationality, {{the variety of}} types and attitudes of the characters, inspired by Florentine painters such as Benozzo Gozzoli or Domenico Ghirlandaio, the striking appearance of the poor pilgrims and beggars, derived from Flemish painting. The candelabra grotesque decoration is inspired by contemporary examples discovered at Rome in the Domus Aurea. These elements are contained <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> drawings certainly attributable to Pinturicchio, housed in the Kupferstichkabinett of Berlin (n. 5192).

25|$|Van Gogh {{lived in}} Amsterdam {{for a short}} while and there is a museum {{dedicated}} to his work. The museum is housed <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> modern buildings in this area of Amsterdam. The building was designed by Gerrit Rietveld. This building is where the permanent collection is displayed. A new building was added to the museum in 1999. This building, known as the performance wing, was designed by Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa. Its purpose is to house temporary exhibitions of the museum. Some of Van Gogh's most famous paintings, like The Potato Eaters and Sunflowers, are in the collection.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of a 1996 Ethics Committee probe of then Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, which cited the Speaker for {{providing}} false information under oath to a House committee, Leach broke ranks with tradition and voted against his party's nominee for Speaker in the subsequent Congress. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> occasions in the 20th century when any party division was recorded on the initial leadership organizing votes on the House floor, he voted for the former Republican leader, Bob Michel, and received two votes himself, causing Leach to take a distant third in the contest for Speaker of the 105th Congress behind Gingrich and the Democratic nominee, Dick Gephardt.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> {{suspected}} acts of entomological bioterrorism an eco-terror {{group known}} as The Breeders claimed to have released Mediterranean fruit flies (medflies) amidst an ongoing California infestation.

The pest attacks a variety of crops and the state of California responded with a large-scale pesticide spraying program. At least one source asserted that there is no doubt that an outside hand played a role in the dense 1989 infestation. The group stated in a letter to then Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that their goals were twofold. They sought to cause the medfly infestation to grow out of control which, in turn, would render the ongoing Malathion spraying program financially infeasible.|$|E
25|$|The team's fall {{performances}} were perhaps subdued {{by the news}} of their impending collapse being confirmed in early August. It was not until October, at Paris–Bourges that the team came relatively close to another victory.

The team had a bittersweet joy later that same week at Paris–Tours, as it was there that Cavendish debuted his newly won world championship rainbow jersey, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> occasions he would wear it as a member of this team. With a late attack by 's Greg Van Avermaet keeping the expected bunch finish from happening, the team's best-placed man on the day was Degenkolb in 11th; Cavendish was 42nd, coming in towards the back of the first large group on the road. Cavendish also rode in the rainbow jersey at the Giro del Piemonte, but did not complete the race. The team's best-placed rider that day was trainee rider Zakkari Dempster, well down in 65th position.|$|E
