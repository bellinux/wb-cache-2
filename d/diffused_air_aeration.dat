5000|$|Fine bubble {{aeration}} is an {{efficient way to}} transfer oxygen to a water body. A compressor on shore pumps air through a hose, which is connected to an underwater aeration unit. Attached to the unit are a number of diffusers. These diffusers come in the shape of discs, plates, tubes or hoses constructed from glass-bonded silica, porous ceramic plastic, PVC or perforated membranes made from EPDM (ethylene propylene diene Monomer) rubber. [...] Air pumped through the diffuser membranes is released into the water. These bubbles are known as fine bubbles. The EPA defines a fine bubble as anything smaller than 2mm in diameter. This type of aeration has a very high oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE), sometimes as high as 15 pounds of oxygen / (horsepower * hour) (9.1 kilograms of oxygen / (kilowatt * hour)). On average, <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> <b>aeration</b> diffuses approximately 2-4 cfm (cubic feet of air per minute) (56.6-113.3 liters of air per minute), but some operate at levels as low as 1 cfm (28.3 L/min) or as high as 10 cfm (283 L/min).|$|E
40|$|Intermittent sand {{filtration}} was evaluated {{as a means}} of upgrading the quality of aerated lagoon effluents to satisfy the requirements of PL 92 - 500. The aerated lagoon in question treats the wastes from a milk and cheese factory located in northern Utah. The treatment system consists of two <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> <b>aeration</b> ponds followed by a facultative settling pond, were applied to pilot scale intermittent sand filters with 0. 17 mm and 0. 40 mm effective size sands. The filters were loaded hydraulically from 0. 25 million gallons per acre per day to 1. 0 million gallons per acre per day. It was found that sand size has a profound effect on the quality of effluent produced by filtration. Also, sand size was related to the time of operation before plugging occurred. At the levels of application studied, hydraulic loading rate was found to affect BOD removal regardless of influent concentration. However, effluent suspended and volatile suspended solids concentrations reflected changes in influent concentrations regardless of hydraulic loading rate. It was found that filtration of facultative settling pond effluent provided better removals than direct filtration of aerated lagoon effluent using equivalent sand sixes and hydraulic loading rates. It was concluded that intermittent {{sand filtration}} was capable of upgrading the effluent from aerated lagoons to meet present and future discharge requirements when effluent from the facultative settling pond was applied to 0. 17 mm effective size sand...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} {{aimed to}} explore new method of aeration using oxygen enriched air performance on BOD reduction of palm oil wastewater was conducted. The oxygen enriched air was obtained from an Oxygen Enriched System (OES) developed using asymmetric polysulfone hollow fiber membrane with composition consisting of PSF: 22 %, DMAc: 31. 8 %, THF: 31. 8 %, EtOH: 14. 4 %. Palm oil wastewater samples were taken from facultative pond effluent. These samples were tested for its initial biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), pH, conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen (DO), suspended solids (SS), and total dissolved solids (TDS) before being subjected to two modes of aeration system, that is <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> and oxygen enriched air. These water quality concentrations were tested for every 20 minutes for two-hour period during the aeration process. Results of BOD, TSS, pH, conductivity, DO, SS and TDS concentrations against time of samples from the two modes of aeration were then compared. It was found that DO concentration achieved in oxygen enriched <b>air</b> <b>aeration</b> was better than <b>aeration</b> using <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> system. <b>Aeration</b> using OES improve the DO concentration in the wastewater and thus improve the BOD reduction and also influence other physical characteristics of wastewater. This phenomenon indicates the advantage of using air with higher oxygen concentration for wastewater <b>aeration</b> instead of <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> system...|$|R

There are many of aeration instruments in the market {{that can be used in}} activated sludge reactor, which can be classified to either surface aerator of <b>diffused</b> <b>air.</b> The wastewater <b>aeration</b> in the attached growth reactor (rotating biological contactor “RBC ” or trickling filter) is aerated through diffusion of air to water bubbles from the atmosphere. A laboratory model simulating both suspended growth biological reactor and attached growth biological reactor was build in order to investigate the performance of the combined reactor. The RBC with fill and draw cups simulated the attached growth reactor, while the <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> simulated the suspended growth reactor. The present paper investigates the rate of oxygen transfer for four different configurations, three of them were tested using tab water and the forth set of experiment was made using primary treated wastewater. First configuration investigated the oxygen transfer rate while the rotating disks operate alone. The second configuration investigated the oxygen transfer rate while the <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> are in operation alone, and the third configuration investigated the oxygen transfer rate while both of the rotating disks and the <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> are in operation together. The forth configuration investigated the oxygen transfer rate while both of the rotating disks and the <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> are in operation together, but using primary treated wastewater sample in stead of the tab water that had been used for the first three sets of experiments.

40|$|The goal of {{aquaculture}} ponds is {{to maximize}} production and profits while holding labor and management efforts to the minimum. Poor water quality in most ponds causes risk of fish kills, disease outbreaks {{which lead to}} minimization of pond production. Dissolved Oxygen (DO) {{is considered to be}} among the most important water quality parameters in fish culture. Fish ponds in aquaculture farms are usually located in remote areas where grid lines are at far distance. Aeration of ponds is required to prevent mortality and to intensify production, especially when feeding is practical, and in warm regions. To increase pond production it is necessary to control dissolved oxygen. Aeration offers the most immediate and practical solution to water quality problems encountered at higher stocking and feeding rates. Many units of aeration system are electrical units so using a continuous, high reliability, affordable, and environmentally friendly power sources is necessary. Fuel cells have become one of the major areas of research in the academia and the industry. Aeration of water by using PEM fuel cell power is not only a new application of the renewable energy, but also, it provides an affordable method to promote biodiversity in stagnant ponds and lakes. This paper presents a new design and control of PEM fuel cell powered a <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> <b>aeration</b> system for a shrimp farm in Mersa Matruh in Egypt. Also Artificial intelligence (AI) control techniques are used to control the fuel cell output power by controlling its input gases flow rate. Moreover the mathematical modeling and simulation of PEM fuel cell is introduced.

30|$|A {{stationary}} phase was observed around day 8 {{in the three}} mixotrophic groups. Of course, a possible reason for this restricted microalgal growth is that the microalgae was suffering from a nitrogen deficiency.

There are two main types of submerged diffused aeration systems for lagoon applications: floating lateral and submerged lateral.

However, other types of airflow may require the spoiler to operate differently and take on vastly different physical characteristics.|$|R
40|$|A new {{simplified}} mass-transfer {{model was}} developed to describe the volatile organic compounds (VOC) emission rates from diffused aeration systems. The model takes into consideration that the VOC mass transfer occurs in two separate mass-transfer zones instead of lumping the overall VOC transfer in the whole aeration tank as {{is done in the}} conventional ASCE-based model. A series of batch VOC emission tests were performed in a 1000 l tank equipped with a fine pore diffuser at 0, 50 to 1, 33 - 10 - 3 normal m 3 /s <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> flow rate and a water temperature of 293 K. The unsteady-state dissolved concentrations of p-xylene, benzene, toluene, trichloroethylene and tetrachlorethylene were measured during the tests and these data were used to find the proportional coefficient Î¨ and with it, the volumetric mass-transfer coefficients of the VOCs. It was found that the Î¨ coefficients were not dependent upon the <b>diffused</b> <b>air</b> flow rate, but do depend {{on the nature of the}} volatile compound used. A semiempirical set of equations that predict successfully the Î¨ coefficients based on the critical volume and the normal boiling temperature of the compound was found.

Tree-ring series show that the Cd and Zn accumulation rates were higher between 1960 and 1986 and that the long-term acidification of the soil (Ca/Al series) was likely induced by NOx and SOx deposition (&#x 03 B 4; 15 N and &#x 03 B 4; 13 C trends as proxy). The Pb concentrations and 206 Pb/ 207 Pb ratios indicate that the dominant source of lead from 1880 to the 1920 s was the combustion of north-eastern American coal, which was succeeded by the combustion of leaded gasoline from the 1920 s to the end of the 1980 s.

Heterotrophic growth {{is the dominant}} step in Phase I (to increase microalgal biomass) and photoautotrophic growth occurs in Phase II (to improve biomass concentration and lipid production). The {{results show that the}} addition of the low-cost antioxidant sodium erythorbate (8  g L− 1) significantly accelerates the growth of microalgae in the first stage with <b>air</b> <b>aeration.</b> Furthermore, a higher CO 2 fixation rate was obtained in the second stage (at least 344.32  mg CO 2  L− 1 day− 1) with 10 % CO 2 aeration. This approximately corresponds to an increase of 177 % over simple photoautotrophic cultivation with 10 % CO 2 aeration during the whole period. The two-stage cultivation strategy achieved a maximum C. vulgaris biomass concentration of 3.45  g L− 1 and lipid productivity of 43.70  mg L− 1 day− 1, which are 1.85 and 1.64 times those arising due to simple photoautotrophy, respectively. Moreover, an analysis of the product’s fatty acid profile indicates that C. vulgaris might be an ideal candidate for two-stage mixotrophic cultivation of a renewable biomass for use in biodiesel applications. Another interesting point to note from the study is that it is an insufficiency of N and CO 2 that probably limits the further growth of C. vulgaris.|$|R
