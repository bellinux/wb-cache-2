Since increased cohesion may have {{positive effects on}} student mental health, {{it is argued that}} researchers should routinely assess changes in classroom cohesion by these or other metliods during classroom interventions.

40|$|This study delineates the {{relationships}} between social background, classroom experience, and academic abilities. Classroom experience is mainly judged in terms of students ' affective dispositions. The objective is to clarify how these dispositions are shaped by the personal?nd situational factors in a child's social background, and then how they, in turn, shape academic achievement. Two types of affective dispositions areconsidered: first, a student's <b>incli</b> ation or ability to appry himself/herself to the classroom task second, a student's ability {{to get along with}} the teacher and classmates. In the first stage of the analysis, these characteristics are specifically related to a student's gender, ethnic membership, his/her neighborhood socioeconomic status, and the type of school (public or private) he/she attends. In the second stage of the inquiry, these socio-persohal attributes, along with the affective dispositions and previous academic performance, are used to predict achievement in vocabulary, readirg comprehension, computation, and problem-solving. An effort is made to integrate all these variables into a canonical model of adjustment to school.

40|$|Relationship between chin {{deviation}} and {{the position}} and morphology of the mandible in individuals with a unilateral cleft lip and palate Objective: In this study, we aimed {{to examine the relationship}} between chin deviation {{and the position}}al and morphological features of the mandible and to determine the factors that contributed to chin deviation in individuals with a unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP). Methods: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of 28 adults with UCLP were analyzed in this study. Segmented three-dimensional temporomandibular fossa and mandible images were reconstructed, and angular, linear, and volumetric parameters were measured. Results: For all 28 individuals, the chin was found to deviate to the cleft side by 1. 59 mm. Moreover, among these 28 individuals, only 7 showed distinct (more than 4 mm) chin deviation, which was toward the cleft side. Compared to the non-cleft side, the mandibular body length, frontal ramal <b>incli</b> nation, and vertical position of the condyle were lower and inclination of the temporomandibular fossa was steeper on the cleft side. Furthermore, the dif ferences in inclination of the temporomandibular fossa, mandibular body length, ramus length, and condylar volume ratio (non-deviated/deviated) were po sitively correlated with chin deviation. Conclusions: UCLP individuals show mild chin deviation to the cleft side. Statistical differences were noted in the parameters that represented positional and morphological asymmetries of the mandible and temporomandibular fossa; however, these differences were too small to indicate clinical significance.
