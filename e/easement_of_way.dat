2500|$|The {{definition}} of a road depends on the {{definition of}} a highway; there is no formal definition for a highway in the relevant Act. A 1984 ruling said [...] "the land over which a public right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> exists is known as a highway; and although most highways have been made up into roads, and most <b>easements</b> <b>of</b> <b>way</b> exist over footpaths, {{the presence or absence of}} a made road has nothing to do with the distinction. Another legal view is that while a highway historically included footpaths, bridleways, driftways, etc., it can now be used to mean those ways that allow the movement of motor-vehicles, and the term rights <b>of</b> <b>way</b> can be used to cover the wider usage.|$|R

50|$|The first {{requirement}} - {{that there}} must be two distinct plots of land affected - is central to the definition <b>of</b> an <b>easement.</b> A right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> granted to an individual is granted in their capacity as a land owner; if a right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> is granted to an individual who is not a land owner, it is merely a license.|$|R

50|$|The route {{would have}} {{extended}} the toll road {{to connect to}} Interstate 5 at the San Diego County line near San Onofre, where the TCA projects traffic to increase 60 percent by 2025. The final four miles (6 km) of the roadway would have been located on Camp Pendleton Marine Base. The road would have gone through {{a section of the}} San Onofre State Park, which is leased from the United States Marine Corps. The Marine Corps reserved the right to grant <b>easements</b> for rights <b>of</b> <b>way</b> when the lease with the California Department of Parks and Recreation was signed in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Ironically, {{the road}} {{improvement}} project which {{contributed to this}} incident did not {{require the use of}} the entire area subject to the easement. Because the project would change a nearby intersecting road, much <b>of</b> the <b>easement</b> could have been abandoned by the SCDOT and would then have reverted to the full ownership of the Bixby family. This was explained to the family by an individual working as a right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> agent under contract to SCDOT. These right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> agents normally explain the project and, if property or a property interest is being obtained from a landowner, offer some amount of just compensation. Since the Bixbys were not losing any property, and might even have regained a portion <b>of</b> the <b>easement,</b> the right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> agent did not offer them any compensation.|$|R
5000|$|The range <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> is {{primarily}} restricted by a fourfold test {{laid out in}} Re Ellenborough Park. The homeowners around Ellenborough Park wished to show they had an easement over the communal gardens to claim compensation for its requisition in World War II. Lord Evershed MR agreed because (1) they owned the dominant tenements, (2) their rights to the [...] "servient" [...] tenement (i.e. the park) benefited their land (3) they did not own the servient tenement, and, despite some prior authority suggesting easements could not be for pure pleasure, (4) it was within a recognised class <b>of</b> <b>easements.</b> Most often, <b>easements</b> are rights <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> Many recent cases have also involved car parking, including Moncrieff v Jamieson where the owner of land between the shoreline and a steep escarpment only had access through his neighbour's, and he had, from 1973 become used to parking there. The servient tenement owner claimed the car parking took away {{his use of the}} land, and so could not be an easement. But the House of Lords held that in the nature of parking (which was not permanent) to which the dominant owner had become accustomed, the right could count as an easement.|$|R

50|$|The State Question 777 is an {{amendment}} that was proposed to the Oklahoma Constitution that voters {{had the chance to}} reject or approve during the general election last November. There was lots of controversy surrounding this amendment, supporters referred to State Question 777 as the ‘right to farm’, while opposition groups referred to it as the ‘right to harm’. The amendment states, “To protect agriculture as a vital sector of Oklahoma’s economy, which provides food, energy, health benefits, and security and is the foundation and stabilizing force of Oklahoma’s economy, the rights of citizens and lawful residents of Oklahoma to engage in farming and ranching practices shall be forever guaranteed in this state. The Legislature shall pass no law which abridges the right of citizens and lawful residents of Oklahoma to employ agricultural technology and livestock production and ranching practices without a compelling state interest. Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify any provision of common law or statutes relating to trespass, eminent domain, dominance <b>of</b> mineral interests, <b>easements,</b> rights <b>of</b> <b>way</b> or any other property rights. Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or enact any statute or ordinance enacted by the Legislature or any political subdivision prior to December 31, 2014”. This poorly written amendment leaves room for much of it to be interpreted in different ways, which will cause numerous lawsuits, and does not benefit the people and local farmers of Oklahoma, however it hurts them in many ways.|$|R
50|$|Easements in English law are rights within English {{land law}} that one {{individual}} has over another's land. Rights recognised as easements most frequently include rights <b>of</b> <b>way</b> or light, and extend {{as far as}} the right to use a neighbour's lavatory, or to park a car on their land. The necessity <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> can be recognised by the Law Commission's recent findings that there are easements over at least 65% of registered freehold titles. In some circumstances for example, it may be impossible for one land owner to access a public highway without an <b>easement</b> <b>of</b> a right <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> The creation <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> is usually done expressly by deed, but easements may be implied where they are necessary, or would be reasonably expected to be held by a land owner, an approach which is not altogether uncontroversial, and {{has been the subject of}} recent reform proposals.|$|R

5000|$|Wilhelmus Beekman's name is perpetuated in {{the names}} of William Street and Beekman Street, New York City, which latter became legally a street in 1734. [...] The Beekman {{homestead}} in New Amsterdam was built by Wilhelmus Beekman in 1670 near the present corner of Pearl and Beekman Streets. A street was laid out through the property and was designated Beekman Street by the public in his honor. As New York City grew new streets were opened where formerly the farmers had only the <b>easement</b> or right <b>of</b> <b>way.</b> This was the origin of Beekman Street, which was laid out and graded in 1752, although since 1656 the farmers had the right to drive their cattle to the commons through it. A second thoroughfare, running at a right angle to the first was called William Street, after Beekman's first, or Christian, name. [...] Beekman Tower, the 76-story skyscraper designed by architect Frank Gehry and later renamed 8 Spruce Street, first utilized the Beekman name due to its proximity to Beekman Street.|$|R

The second chapter {{deals with the}} definition and function <b>of</b> <b>easements.</b> The third chapter examines their sorting. The fourth chapter deals with the content <b>of</b> <b>easements.</b> The most common easements - the right <b>of</b> <b>way</b> and the right to use a flat or a room - are described in two sub-chapters. The fifth chapter deals with an issue <b>of</b> recording <b>easements</b> in the land register.

In three sub-chapters of the seventh chapter modification <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> (in their subjects, content and object) is analysed. The eighth chapter examines individual <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> termination <b>of</b> <b>easements</b> in six sub-chapters.
