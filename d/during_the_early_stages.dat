5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages</b> of development, in-game {{dialogue}} {{was recorded}} in Los Angeles by local Asian actors, {{but much of the}} audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company.

There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the sound design team eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E

Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese.|$|E
30|$|The above results {{suggested}} that lactate accumulation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> late stage of fermentation {{do not have}} an obvious influence on 1, 3 -PD formation in cells. So, 3 -HPA accumulation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of fermentation decreased the 1, 3 -PD concentration directly rather than through lactate accumulation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> late stage of fermentation. Maybe this was because of the 3 -HPA accumulation <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> of fermentation inhibited the central carbon pathway at the post translation level of the cell growth, which could result in irreversible damage to cells in the fermentation broth and would cause an irreversible cessation of the fermentation process until the end of fermentation [[11],[14]].|$|R

5|$|An {{affluent}} 19th-century {{agricultural community}} {{of the same name}} established near the lakeside in the mid-19th century, but dwindled in status, becoming virtually abandoned {{in the aftermath of the}} American Civil War. It was strategically important <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages</b> of the war, due to its proximity to fresh water and the Gulf of Mexico. After reaching its low point during the Great Depression, the lakeside community modestly rebounded in 1947 following the nearby discovery of oil. A fictional lake of the same name and with a similar history is featured in the 1998 novel Holes.|$|E

5|$|<b>During</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>stages,</b> the Anuradhapura Kingdom did {{not have}} a strong regular army except for a small body of soldiers.

In times of war, a larger army was formed using this method. An army consisted of four main divisions; an elephant corps, cavalry, chariots and infantry. This combination was called Chaturangani Sena (fourfold army). However, the majority of the army was infantry composed of swordsmen, spearmen and archers.|$|E
