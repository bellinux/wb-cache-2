40|$|A {{new concept}} <b>of</b> an <b>evolution</b> system <b>of</b> {{measures}} for stochastic flows is considered. It {{corresponds to the}} notion of an invariant measure for random dynamical systems (or cocycles). The existence <b>of</b> <b>evolution</b> systems <b>of</b> measures for asymptotically compact stochastic flows is obtained. For a white noise stochastic flow, there exists a one to one correspondence between <b>evolution</b> systems <b>of</b> measures for a stochastic flow and <b>evolution</b> systems <b>of</b> measures for the associated Markov transition semigroup. As an application, an alternative approach for <b>evolution</b> systems <b>of</b> measures of 2 D stochastic Navier-Stokes equations with a time-periodic forcing term is presented.

40|$|We derive the {{complete}} set <b>of</b> <b>evolutions</b> <b>of</b> chirality-odd twist- 3 fragmentation functions at one-loop level. There are totally nine real twist- 3 fragmentation functions, among which seven are independent. The renormalization-scale {{dependence of the}} nine functions has an important implication for studies of single transverse-spin asymmetries. We find that the <b>evolutions</b> <b>of</b> the three complex fragmentation functions defined by quark-gluon-quark operator are mixed with themselves. There is no mixing with the fragmentation functions defined only with bilinear quark field operators. In the large-$N_c$ limit the <b>evolutions</b> <b>of</b> the three complex fragmentation functions are simplified and reduced to six homogenous equations.

5|$|Another {{model of}} the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this genus, also {{proposed}} by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this lineage {{is characterized by the}} increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E

5|$|Historically, insects {{have been}} the most {{significant}} herbivores, and the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> land plants is closely associated with the <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> insects. While most plant defenses are directed against insects, other defenses have evolved that are aimed at vertebrate herbivores, such as birds and mammals. The study of plant defenses against herbivory is important, not only from an evolutionary view point, but also in the direct impact that these defenses have on agriculture, including human and livestock food sources; as beneficial 'biological control agents' in biological pest control programs; {{as well as in the}} search for plants of medical importance.|$|E
