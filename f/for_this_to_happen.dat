The President {{has the ability to}} resign from office at any time under Article 87. The letter of resignation is sent to the House of Representatives and is accepted by them. The President has the ability to be removed from office if his physical or mental health is impaired under Article 88.

If the President has committed a grave crime, such as treason, one-third of the House must bring charges against the President formally. The investigation of the charges will be conducted by the Council of the Republic. In order to evict the President from office, a two-thirds majority is needed to vote in favor of conviction. The criminal case is further sent to the Supreme Court for review. The actions of either option must occur one month after the resolution is passed or the action will be considered void by the Constitution.|$|E

The waves eventually meet and cancel each other out, but, if an area of transient block occurred with a refractory period that blocked one wavefront and subsequently allowed the other to proceed retrogradely over the other path, then a self-sustaining circus movement phenomenon would result. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> however, {{it is necessary that}} there be some form of non-uniformity.

25|$|For Fitzpatrick, {{the key to}} {{establishing}} financially viable models for university presses and modes of scholarly publishing more generally is the reconceptualization of the university’s mission. Universities must recognize that their mission is, {{in addition to the}} production of knowledge, the communication of knowledge. Fitzpatrick conceptualizes scholarship as an ongoing conversation between scholars that can only continue if participants have the means to contribute to it. Publishing and disseminating information via the university press is one possible mode of communication. This reconceptualization of the university’s mission is part and parcel to the restructuring of its press’s functioning. If the university is reimagined as a center of communication, rather than principally as a credential-bestowing organization, its central mission becomes the production and dissemination of scholarly work. In this rethinking, the press has a future as the knowledge-disseminating organ of the university. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> the press must be integrated within the university and be provided sufficient funding so that its mission is not financially based but, rather, aligns with that of the university.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} in forming a supermassive black hole {{resides in the}} need for enough matter {{to be in a}} small enough volume. This matter needs to have very little angular momentum in order <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Normally, the process of accretion involves transporting a large initial endowment of angular momentum outwards, and this appears to be the limiting factor in black hole growth. This is a major component of the theory of accretion disks. Gas accretion is the most efficient and also the most conspicuous way in which black holes grow. The majority of the mass growth of supermassive black holes is thought to occur through episodes of rapid gas accretion, which are observable as active galactic nuclei or quasars. Observations reveal that quasars were much more frequent when the Universe was younger, indicating that supermassive black holes formed and grew early. A major constraining factor for theories of supermassive black hole formation is the observation of distant luminous quasars, which indicate that supermassive black holes of billions of solar masses had already formed when the Universe was less than one billion years old. This suggests that supermassive black holes arose very early in the Universe, inside the first massive galaxies.|$|E

30|$|The {{existence}} of an RNA world is considered a crucial step in {{the origin of life}} [23, 24]. However, the transition from prebiotic chemistry <b>to</b> <b>this</b> stage of life is still poorly understood. An autocatalytic set of cooperative molecules is likely to have been required <b>for</b> <b>this</b> transition <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> In recent experiments [1], it was shown that particular mixtures of RNA fragments that self-assemble into self-replicating ribozymes spontaneously form cooperative catalytic networks. Furthermore, when such cooperative networks compete directly with selfish cycles, the former grow faster, indicating an intrinsic ability of collections of RNA molecules to evolve greater complexity through cooperation. These RNA replictor experiments thus highlight the advantages of cooperative behavior (as autocatalytic sets), even at the early molecular stages of life [1].|$|R
