5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot or <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E
5|$|A pimp rapes Number 18 in a bar, then enslaves her sexually. Number 18's {{father died}} when she was young and her family {{struggled}} to support her thereafter. Strangers took her from her home in Cambodia as a child, replaced her name with a number, and prostituted her in various countries. Number 18 ends up in the Thai child prostitution industry. Most of her clients are rich men, many of them foreign tourists. In a brothel and bar called The Pearl, Number 18 is kept in a dark room containing only a table and a dilapidated bed. Whenever she fails to follow the orders of Mama, the brothel-keeper, Mama shouts at her and beats her. Number 18 prays <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> come and save her from these ordeals. At the same time she becomes the most elegant and highly sought-after prostitute at The Pearl and her pimp's favourite. She becomes very proficient in pleasing men sexually but also remains childlike—she dries her face with her skirt and plays with its hem.|$|E
5|$|Artillery {{powered by}} {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced to}} Europe in the 1320s and spread quickly. Handguns, which were initially unpredictable and inaccurate weapons, were not recorded until the 1380s. Castles were adapted to allow small artillery pieces– averaging between – to fire from towers. These guns were too heavy <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> carry and fire, but if he supported the butt end and rested the muzzle {{on the edge of}} the gun port he could fire the weapon. The gun ports developed in this period show a unique feature, that of a horizontal timber across the opening. A hook on the end of the gun could be latched over the timber so the gunner did not have to take the full recoil of the weapon. This adaptation is found across Europe, and although the timber rarely survives, there is an intact example at Castle Doornenburg in the Netherlands. Gunports were keyhole shaped, with a circular hole at the bottom for the weapon and a narrow slit on top to allow the gunner to aim.|$|E

25|$|The husband, too, is {{indirectly}} implied to {{have some}} responsibilities to his wife. The Torah obligates a man to not deprive his wife of food, clothing, or of sexual activity; if the husband does not provide the first wife with these things, she is to be divorced, without cost to her. The Talmud interprets this as a requirement <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> provide food and clothing to, and have sex with, each of his wives, even if he only has one.|$|E
25|$|The FLDS Church {{teaches the}} {{doctrine}} of plural marriage, which states that a man having multiple wives is ordained of and a commandment by God; the doctrine requires it in order <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> receive the highest form of salvation. It is generally believed in the church that a man should have {{a minimum of three}} wives to fulfill this requirement. Connected with this doctrine is patriarchal doctrine, the belief that wives are required to be subordinate to their husbands.|$|E
25|$|Most men, however, {{have only}} one wife, and it is rare <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> have more than two wives.

After having children, divorce is a rare and serious matter, and it requires the participation of the whole village. An enlarged family can count up to a hundred persons and is called guinna.|$|E

25|$|One {{cause of}} the change in young women's {{behavior}} was World War I which ended in November 1918. The death of large numbers of young men in the war, and the Spanish flu epidemic which struck in 1918 killing between 20–40 million people, inspired in young people a feeling that life is short and could end at any moment. Therefore, young women wanted to spend their youth enjoying their life and freedom rather than just staying at home and waiting <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> <b>to</b> marry them.|$|E
25|$|Terohaute's {{explanation}} was that Hood had been cleaning {{his gun and}} that it had gone off, shooting him through the head.

But with Terohaute stronger than them and armed, there was nothing John Hepburn and Richardson could do for the next three days, as Terohaute refused to let them out of his sight and became more and more aggressive, repeatedly asking to know if they thought he had murdered Hood. Finally, on 23 October, Terohaute left them for a short time to gather lichen. Richardson took the opportunity to load his pistol, and on Terohaute's return, shot him dead.|$|E
