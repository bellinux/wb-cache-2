"When I got it, I {{was pretty}} shocked – I must say it's not {{something}} I'd ever expected – {{and so you}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and wonder what the hell you're going to do. But as I've been getting into it {{in the last few}} months, then you realise that it's just not the case that you spend lots of money – about one in four of the government dollars – but the issues are just so wide ranging. Yesterday, I was in Alice Springs, talking to people about the difficulties that they're having with Aboriginal alcoholism and violence – the kind of problems that it's bringing – and then you're back into discussions on – race back to Cabinet for discussions on migration and what kind of social security benefits people might get, and then you're talking about age pensions, this morning, on another program about some people's concerns. It's just so big. I'll get interested, don't worry." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to the House of Commons (17 December), he slipped into the Chamber largely {{unacknowledged}} by his own party. One Conservative MP rose to wave his Order Paper, only to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in embarrassment whilst Labour MPs laughed. On 18 December he addressed the 1922 committee (Conservative backbenchers), declaring “as long as I live, I shall never apologise for what we did”, but was unable to answer a question about the validity of the Tripartite Declaration of 1950 (which he had in fact reaffirmed in April 1955, two days before becoming Prime Minister). In his final statement to the House of Commons as Prime Minister (20 December 1956) he performed well in a difficult debate, but told MPs that [...] "there was not foreknowledge that Israel would attack Egypt". Victor Rothwell writes that the knowledge of his having misled the House of Commons on this way must have hung over him thereafter, as was the concern that the US Administration might demand that Britain pay reparations to Egypt. Papers released in January 1987 showed the entire Cabinet had been informed of the plan on 23 October 1956.|$|E

6000|$|... "But I {{think you}} {{understand}} {{better than most}} people," [...] she answered, {{and sat down on}} a little chair placed beside a big leather chair so that Hewet <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> beside her.|$|R
60|$|A few strokes {{took the}} boat {{back to the}} dock, and Dave and Roger {{assisted}} the dripping youth to land. Gus Plum was so weak he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on a bench to recover.|$|R
60|$|Not heeding them, {{and only}} half {{sure of the}} {{completeness}} of the disguise, Edgar issued boldly from his cabin, and walked with heavy tread towards {{the place where he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the helmet screwed on.|$|R

6000|$|... ------ is one {{of those}} men who go far to shake my faith in a future state of existence; I mean, on account of the {{difficulty}} of knowing where to place him. I could not bear to roast him; he is not so bad as all that comes to: but then, on the other hand, to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with such a fellow in the very lowest pothouse of heaven is utterly inconsistent with the belief of that place being a place of happiness for me.|$|E

60|$|After that Dick <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> {{and tell}} his father {{the details of}} all that had occurred. Then he got a late supper, and some time after {{that he and his}} parent retired. The youth was {{thoroughly}} tired out, but happy.|$|R
60|$|Sterne {{slipped away}} into his berth, {{and at once}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> His head swam with exultation. He got into his bunk {{as if in a}} dream. A feeling of {{profound}} peace, of pacific joy, came over him. On deck all was quiet.|$|R
60|$|Of all {{experiences}} {{in connection with}} towing, the most exciting is being towed by girls. It is a sensation that nobody ought to miss. It takes three girls to tow always; two hold the rope, {{and the other one}} runs round and round, and giggles. They generally begin by getting themselves tied up. They get the line round their legs, and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> on the path and undo each other, and then they twist it round their necks, and are nearly strangled. They fix it straight, however, at last, and start off at a run, pulling the boat along at quite a dangerous pace. At the end of a hundred yards they are naturally breathless, and suddenly stop, and all sit down on the grass and laugh, and your boat drifts out to mid-stream and turns round, before you know what has happened, or can get hold of a scull. Then they stand up, and are surprised.|$|E
6000|$|Ethelbertha {{was very}} young--ridiculously young, as I think I have {{mentioned}} before--in those days of which I am writing, {{and the love}} of dolls, and of the gorgeous dresses that dolls wear, and of the many-windowed but inconveniently arranged houses that dolls inhabit--or are supposed to inhabit, for as a rule they seem to prefer sitting on the roof with their legs dangling down over the front door, which has always appeared to me to be unladylike: but then, of course, I am no authority on doll etiquette--had not yet, I think, quite departed from her. Nay, am I not sure that it had not? Do I not remember, years later, peeping into a certain room, the walls of which are covered with works of art of a character calculated to send any aesthetic person mad, and seeing her, sitting on the floor, before a red brick mansion, containing two rooms and a kitchen; and are not her hands trembling with delight as she arranges the three real tin plates upon the dresser? And does she not knock at the real brass knocker upon the real front door until it comes off, and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> beside her on the floor and screw it on again? ...|$|E
60|$|As soon, even, as I was in {{the hotel}} I was {{impatient}} to press through {{to the place where}} the dancing was, and where I already heard the band playing. I knew very well that when we got there I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> somewhere {{on the edge of the}} platform with the other frumps and fogies, and begin taking cold in my dress-coat, and want to doze off without being able to, while my young people were waltzing together, or else promenading up and down ignoring me, or recognising me by the offer of a fan, and the question whether I was not simply melting; I have seen how the poor chaperon fares at such times. But they, secure of their fun, were by no means desirous to have it over, or even to have it begin. They dawdled through the thronged hotel office, where other irresponsible pairs were coming and going under the admiring eyes of the hotel loungers, and they wandered up and down the waste parlours, and sat on tete-a- tetes just to try them, apparently; and Miss Gage verified in the mirrors the beauty which was reflected in all eyes. They amused themselves with the extent of the richly-carpeted and upholstered desolation around them, where only a few lonely and aging women lurked about on sofas and ottomans; and they fell to playing with their compassion for the plebeian spectators at the long verandah windows trying to penetrate with their forbidden eyes to the hop going on in the court far beyond the intermediary desert of the parlours.|$|E
6000|$|And, oh, the {{pleasant}} chats {{with the old}} ladies when the dog wound the chain into a knot around their legs, and upset them, and my uncle <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in the road beside them, and untie them before they could get up again! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My troops enfiladed, left-faced, {{and left}} the spot. After {{enticing}} the enemy for three miles or so we struck a brier-patch and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down.</b> When we were ordered to throw up our toes and surrender we obeyed. Five of my best staff-officers fell, suffering extremely with stone-bruised heels.|$|R
50|$|The mental {{radio was}} needed {{primarily}} as a receiver. Wonder Woman and her allies were shown {{to be able to}} broadcast their distress calls even when they were nowhere near a mental radio, but they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in front of a mental radio device in order to receive telepathic transmissions.|$|R
60|$|I can {{conceive}} no such Peace Congress {{as those}} that have settled up after other wars, settling up after this war. Not only has the war been enormously bigger than any other war, but it has struck deeper at the foundations {{of social and economic}} life. I doubt if we begin to realize how much of the old system is dead to-day, how much has to be remade. Since the beginnings of history there has been a credible promise of gold payments underneath our financial arrangements. It is now an incredible promise. The value of a pound note waves about while you look at it. What will happen to it when peace comes no man can tell. Nor {{what will happen to the}} mark. The rouble has gone into the Abyss. Our giddy money specialists clutch their handfuls of paper and watch it flying down the steep. Much as we may hate the Germans, some of us will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> with some of the enemy to arrange a common scheme for the preservation of credit in money. And I presume that it is not proposed to end this war in a wild scramble of buyers for such food as remains in the world. There is a shortage now, a greater shortage ahead of the world, and there will be shortages of supply at the source and transport in food and all raw materials for some years to come. The Peace Congress will have to sit and organize a share-out and distribution and reorganization of these shattered supplies. It will have to Rhondda the nations. Probably, too, we shall have to deal collectively with a pestilence before we are out of the mess. Then there are such little jobs as the reconstruction of Belgium and Serbia. There are considerable rectifications of boundaries to be made. There are fresh states to be created, in Poland and Armenia for example. About all these smaller states, new and old, that the peace must call into being, there must be a system of guarantees of the most difficult and complicated sort.|$|E
60|$|Not that it {{was just}} on Sir Miles's part to turn upon George, and be angry with his nephew for refusing the offer of {{promotion}} made by his Royal Highness, for Sir Miles himself had agreed in George's view of pursuing quite other than a military career, and it was in respect to this plan of her son's that Madam Esmond had written from Virginia to Sir Miles Warrington. George had announced to her his intention of entering at the Temple, and qualifying himself for the magisterial and civil duties which, in the course of nature, he would be called to fulfil; nor could any one applaud his resolution more cordially than his uncle Sir Miles, who introduced George to a lawyer of reputation, under whose guidance we may fancy the young gentleman reading leisurely. Madam Esmond from home signified her approval of her son's course, fully agreeing with Sir Miles (to whom and his lady she begged to send her grateful remembrances) that the British Constitution was the envy of the world, and the proper object of every English gentleman's admiring study. The chief point to which George's mother objected was the notion that Mr. Warrington should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> in the Temple dinner-ball, and cut at a shoulder of mutton, and drink small-beer out of tin pannikins, by the side of rough students who wore gowns like the parish-clerk. George's loyal younger brother shared too this repugnance. Anything was good enough for him, Harry said; he was a younger son, and prepared to rough it; but George, in a gown, and dining in a mess with three nobody's sons off dirty pewter platters! Harry never could relish this condescension on his brother's part, or fancy George in his proper place at any except the high table; and was sorry that a plan Madam Esmond hinted at in her letters was not feasible--viz., that an application should be made to the Master of the Temple, who should be informed that Mr. George Warrington was a gentleman of most noble birth, and of great property in America, and ought only to sit with the very best company in the Hall. Rather to Harry's discomfiture, when he communicated his own and his mother's ideas to the gentlemen's new coffee-house friend, Mr. Spencer, Mr. Spencer received the proposal with roars of laughter; and I cannot learn, from the Warrington papers, that any application was made to the Master of the Temple on this subject. Besides his literary and historical pursuits, which were those he most especially loved, Mr. Warrington studied the laws of his country, attended the courts at Westminster, where he heard a Henley, a Pratt, a Murray, and those other great famous schools of eloquence and patriotism, the two houses of parliament.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} {{is not expected}} to affect the Commissioner’s Cup coverage since the tournament would be over by the time the AKTV-IBC deal expires, but the board will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> again soon to discuss on which free television channel the PBA games will be aired next.|$|E
60|$|And Erös Béla {{had done}} the feast in style. Nothing was stinted. You just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and eat your fill of roast veal or roast pork, of fattened capons from his {{farmyard}} or of fogas[4] from the river, or of the scores of dishes {{of all kinds of}} good things which stood temptingly about.|$|R
60|$|By {{the time}} they had reached a point about a hundred feet above the shelf of rocks they were so {{exhausted}} they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and rest. They were now on another shelf, and from this location could look out over the entire surface of Lake Narsac. Not a boat or a person was to be seen.|$|R
60|$|Child-bearing, hard work, and {{constant}} anxiety {{were beginning to}} tell on Mrs. Athelny; and sometimes her back ached in the evening so that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and rest herself. Her ideal of happiness was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a girl <b>to</b> do the rough work so that she need not herself get up before seven. Athelny waved his beautiful white hand.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, Humphrey {{was forced}} into early {{retirement}} due to a heart condition. After retiring, his weight ballooned to over 900 lb. At this weight he would tire after about 10 steps, and <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> (in two chairs). Humphrey attempted to control his eating habits (which sometimes included eating up to 15 whole chickens in one sitting), but after consulting with doctors, he decided to volunteer for obesity research and checked himself into the Medical College of Georgia's Clinical Investigation Unit in Augusta. Upon entering the clinic, he weighed 802 lb.|$|E
5000|$|... "All Join Hands" [...] is a similarly-styled anthem to the band's 1983 hit [...] "My Oh My". In a 1984 {{interview}} with Record Mirror, Lea said: [...] "It's another anthem.

50|$|The Monster is heart-broken nobody's {{afraid of}} him. He <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> all day, {{because when he}} stands up, his feet touch the floor.

50|$|The sit ups {{punishment}} {{is a form}} of punishment given in schools of Indian subcontinent, specially in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. In this punishment, one <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> and stand up continuously and count the number of sit ups. It is a common punishment in schools. Generally students are asked to perform this with holding their ears with hands. For humiliation, it is done in front of other students.|$|R
