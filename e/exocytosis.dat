5|$|<b>Exocytosis</b> in prokaryotes: Membrane {{vesicular}} <b>exocytosis,</b> {{popularly known}} as membrane vesicle trafficking, a Nobel prize-winning (year, 2013) process, is traditionally regarded as a prerogative of eukaryotic cells. This myth was however broken with the revelation that nanovesicles, {{popularly known as}} bacterial outer membrane vesicles, released by gram-negative microbes, translocate bacterial signal molecules to host or target cells to carry out multiple processes in favour of the secreting microbe e.g., in host cell invasion and microbe-environment interactions, in general.|$|E
5|$|In animals, vacuoles {{serve in}} <b>exocytosis</b> and {{endocytosis}} processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances {{are taken into}} the cell, whereas for <b>exocytosis</b> substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There {{are two types of}} endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.|$|E
5|$|Some {{molecules}} or {{particles are}} too large or too hydrophilic {{to pass through}} a lipid bilayer. Other molecules could pass through the bilayer but must be transported rapidly in such large numbers that channel-type transport is impractical. In both cases, these types of cargo can be moved across the cell membrane through fusion or budding of vesicles. When a vesicle is produced inside the cell and fuses with the plasma membrane to release its contents into the extracellular space, this process is known as <b>exocytosis.</b> In the reverse process, a region of the cell membrane will dimple inwards and eventually pinch off, enclosing {{a portion of the}} extracellular fluid to transport it into the cell. Endocytosis and <b>exocytosis</b> rely on very different molecular machinery to function, but the two processes are intimately linked and could not work without each other. The primary mechanism of this interdependence is the sheer volume of lipid material involved. In a typical cell, an area of bilayer equivalent to the entire plasma membrane will travel through the endocytosis/exocytosis cycle in about half an hour. If these two processes were not balancing each other, the cell would either balloon outward to an unmanageable size or completely deplete its plasma membrane within a matter of minutes.|$|E
5|$|Fusion is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this fusion proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the fusion process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. Fusion is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. <b>Exocytosis,</b> fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Inside the brain, {{dopamine}} {{functions as}} a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator, and is controlled {{by a set of}} mechanisms common to all monoamine neurotransmitters. After synthesis, dopamine is transported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by a solute carrier—a vesicular monoamine transporter, VMAT2. Dopamine is stored in these vesicles until it is ejected into the synaptic cleft. In most cases, the release of dopamine occurs through a process called <b>exocytosis</b> which is caused by action potentials, {{but it can also be}} caused by the activity of an intracellular trace amine-associated receptor, TAAR1. TAAR1 is a high-affinity receptor for dopamine, trace amines, and certain substituted amphetamines that is located along membranes in the intracellular milieu of the presynaptic cell; activation of the receptor can regulate dopamine signaling by inducing dopamine reuptake inhibition and efflux as well as by inhibiting neuronal firing through a diverse set of mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by <b>exocytosis.</b> They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
25|$|Ales et al. {{showed that}} raised {{concentrations}} of extracellular calcium ions shift the preferred mode of recycling and synaptic vesicle release to the kiss-and-run mechanism in a calcium-concentration-dependent manner. It {{has been proposed}} that during secretion of neurotransmitters at synapses, the mode of <b>exocytosis</b> is modulated by calcium to attain optimal conditions for coupled <b>exocytosis</b> and endocytosis according to synaptic activity.|$|E
25|$|In {{correspondence}} to its activity, ribbon synapses can have synaptic ribbons that vary in size. In mouse photoreceptor synapses when the neurotransmitter release rate {{is high and}} <b>exocytosis</b> is high, the synaptic ribbons are long. When neurotransmitter release rate is low and <b>exocytosis</b> is low, the synaptic ribbons are short. A current hypothesis is that synaptic ribbons can enlarge {{by the addition of}} more RIBEYE subunit.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{abnormal}} expression of otoferlin, a ribbon synapse associated protein, impairs <b>exocytosis</b> of ribbon-bound vesicles in auditory inner hair cells. Otoferlin displays similar functional characteristics to synaptotagmin, a synapse associated protein important for mediating <b>exocytosis</b> in many other synapses (such {{as those in the}} central nervous system). Impaired hearing in mice {{has been shown to be}} associated with disrupted expression of otoferlin.|$|E
25|$|The ribbon synapse {{is a type}} of {{neuronal}} synapse {{characterized by}} the presence of an electron-dense structure, the synaptic ribbon, that holds vesicles close to the active zone. It is characterized by a tight vesicle-calcium channel coupling that promotes rapid neurotransmitter release and sustained signal transmission. Ribbon synapses undergo a cycle of <b>exocytosis</b> and endocytosis in response to graded changes of membrane potential. It has been proposed that most ribbon synapses undergo a special type of <b>exocytosis</b> based on coordinated multivesicular release. This interpretation has recently been questioned at the inner hair cell ribbon synapse, where it has been instead proposed that <b>exocytosis</b> is described by uniquantal (i.e., univesicular) release shaped by a flickering vesicle fusion pore.|$|E
25|$|During the 1950s, Bernard Katz and Paul Fatt {{observed}} spontaneous miniature synaptic currents at {{the frog}} neuromuscular junction. Based on these observations, they developed the 'quantal hypothesis' {{that is the}} basis for our current understanding of neurotransmitter release as <b>exocytosis</b> and for which they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1970. In the late 1960s, Ricardo Miledi and Katz advanced the hypothesis that depolarization-induced influx of calcium ions triggers <b>exocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{molecular}} composition between conventional neuronal synapse and ribbon synapse {{is surprisingly}} dissimilar. At {{the core of}} synaptic vesicle <b>exocytosis</b> machinery in vertebrate neuronal synapses is the SNARE complex. The minimally functional SNARE complex includes syntaxin 1, VAMP 1 and 2, and SNAP-25. In contrast, genetic ablation or application of botulinum, targeting SNAP-25, syntaxin 1-3, and VAMP 1-3, did not affect inner hair cell ribbon synapse <b>exocytosis</b> in mice. Additionally, no neuronal SNAREs were observed in hair cells using immunostaining, pointing {{to the possibility of}} a different <b>exocytosis</b> mechanism. However, several studies found SNARE mRNA and protein expressed in hair cell, perhaps indicating presence of a neuronal SNARE complex in ribbon synapse that is present in low levels and with very redundant components.|$|E
25|$|Abercrombie {{thought that}} the carbon {{particle}} is a marker on the cell surface and its behaviour reflects what the surface is doing. This led him to propose that, as a cell moves, membrane from internal stores is added {{at the front of}} the cell—enabling the cell to extend forward—and retrieved toward the rear of the cell. This process of <b>exocytosis</b> {{at the front of the}} cell and endocytosis elsewhere has been modified by Bretscher. He and Hopkins showed that the specific membrane endocytosed by coated pits on motile cells is returned by <b>exocytosis</b> to the cell surface at the leading edge. The spatial difference between the sites of <b>exocytosis</b> (at the front) and endocytosis (everywhere on the surface) leads to a flow of the matrix of the plasma membrane—lipids—from the front toward the rear. Large objects, such as patches, would be swept along with this flow, whereas non-crosslinked small molecules would be able to diffuse by Brownian motion against the flow and so evade being swept backward. Hence, in this theory, the need for crosslinking. Bretscher proposed that on stationary cells <b>exocytosis</b> is random—and therefore a major difference between motile and nonmotile cells.|$|E
25|$|In {{pancreatic}} β-cells, cAMP signaling, {{which can}} be activated by various extracellular stimuli including hormonal and neural inputs primarily through Gs-coupled receptors, is of importance for normal regulation of insulin secretion to maintain glucose homeostasis. Activation of cAMP signaling amplifies insulin secretion by Epac2-dependent as well as PKA-dependent pathways. Epac2-Rap1 signaling is critical to promote <b>exocytosis</b> of insulin-containing vesicles from the readily releasable pool. In Epac2-mediated <b>exocytosis</b> of insulin granules, Epac2 interacts with Rim2, which is a scaffold protein localized in both plasma membrane and insulin granules, and determines the docking and priming states of <b>exocytosis.</b> In addition, piccolo, a possible Ca2+ sensor protein, interacts with the Epac2-Rim2 complex to regulate cAMP-induced insulin secretion. It is suggested that phospholipase C-ε (PLC-ε), one of the effector proteins of Rap, regulates intracellular Ca2+ dynamics by altering the activities of ion channels such as ATP-sensitive potassium channel, ryanodine receptor, and IP3 receptor.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{specificity}} {{element of}} biochemical interactions to create synaptic plasticity, namely the importance of location. Processes occur at microdomains – such as <b>exocytosis</b> of AMPA receptors is spatially regulated by the t-SNARE STX4.|$|E
25|$|A {{high rate}} of {{endocytosis}} is necessary to counter the {{high rate of}} <b>exocytosis</b> during sustained neurotransmitter release at ribbon synapses. Synaptic vesicles need to be recycled for further transmission to occur. These vesicles are directly recycled and because of their mobility, quickly replenish the neurotransmitters required for continued release.|$|E
25|$|Microscopy of {{the skin}} sample {{obtained}} from the biopsy is used to detect the presence of cleavage within the dermis, epidermal acantholysis (breaking apart {{of the skin}}), dyskeratotic keratinocytes and vacuolar changes in the layers of the skin, interfacial dermatitis, and epidermal <b>exocytosis.</b> Presentation of these characteristics suggests PNP.|$|E
25|$|Secretion of {{oxytocin}} {{from the}} neurosecretory nerve endings is {{regulated by the}} electrical activity of the oxytocin cells in the hypothalamus. These cells generate action potentials that propagate down axons to the nerve endings in the pituitary; the endings contain large numbers of oxytocin-containing vesicles, which are released by <b>exocytosis</b> when the nerve terminals are depolarised.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{can also}} signal through a nonreceptor {{mechanism}} called serotonylation, in which serotonin modifies proteins. This process underlies serotonin's effects upon platelet-forming cells (thrombocytes) {{in which it}} links to the modification of signaling enzymes called GTPases that then trigger the release of vesicle contents by <b>exocytosis.</b> A similar process underlies the pancreatic release of insulin.|$|E
25|$|Catecholamines are {{synthesized}} inside {{cells and}} sequestered in intracellular vesicles. This was first shown by Blaschko and Arnold Welch (1908–2003) in Oxford and by Hillarp {{and his group}} in Lund for the adrenal medulla and later for sympathetic nerves and the brain. In addition the vesicles contained adenosine triphosphate (ATP), with a molar noradrenaline:ATP ratio in sympathetic nerve vesicles of 5.2:1 as determined by Hans-Joachim Schümann (1919–1998) and Horst Grobecker (born 1934) in Peter Holtz′ group at the Goethe University Frankfurt. Blaschko and Welch wondered how the catecholamines got out when nervous impulses reached the cells. <b>Exocytosis</b> was not among the possibilities they considered. It required the analogy of the ″quantal″ release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction shown by Bernard Katz, third winner of the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine; the demonstration of the co-release with catecholamines of other vesicle constituents such as ATP and dopamine β-hydroxylase; and the unquestionable electron microscopic images of vesicles fusing with the cell membrane – to establish <b>exocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|During <b>exocytosis</b> at the bipolar ribbon synapse, vesicles {{are seen}} to pause at the {{membrane}} and then upon opening of the calcium channels to promptly release their contents within milliseconds. Like most <b>exocytosis,</b> Ca2+ regulates the release of vesicles from the presynaptic membrane. Different types of ribbon synapses have different dependence on Ca2+ releases. The hair cell ribbon synapses exhibit a steep dependence on Ca2+ concentration, while the photoreceptor synapses is less steeply dependent on Ca2+ and is stimulated by much lower levels of free Ca2+. The hair cell ribbon synapse experiences spontaneous activity {{in the absence of}} stimuli, under conditions of a constant hair cell membrane potential. Voltage clamp at the postsynaptic bouton showed that the bouton experiences a wide range of excitatory postsynaptic current amplitudes. The current amplitude distribution is a positive-skew, with a range of larger amplitudes for both spontaneous and stimulus evoked release. It was thought that this current distribution was not explainable with single vesicle release, and other scenarios of release have been proposed: coordinated multivesicular release, kiss-and-run, or compound fusion of vesicles prior to <b>exocytosis.</b> However it has been recently proposed that uniquantal release with fusion pore flickering is the most plausible interpretation of the found current distribution. In fact, the charge distribution of currents is actually normally distributed, supporting the uniquantal release scenario. It has been shown that the skewness of the current amplitude distribution is well explained by different time courses of neurotransmitter release of a single vesicles with a flickering fusion pore.|$|E
25|$|Endocytosis and <b>exocytosis</b> {{are both}} forms of bulk {{transport}} that move materials {{into and out}} of cells, respectively, via vesicles. In the case of Endocytosis, the cellular membrane folds around the desired materials outside the cell. The ingested particle becomes trapped within a pouch, known as a vesicle, inside the cytoplasm. Often enzymes from lysosomes are then used to digest the molecules absorbed by this process.|$|E
25|$|The G1 (aka Gn) and G2 (Gc) glycoproteins form hetero-oligomers and {{are then}} transported from the {{endoplasmic}} reticulum to the Golgi complex, where glycosylation is completed. The L protein produces nascent genomes by replication via a positive-sense RNA intermediate. Hantavirus virions {{are believed to}} assemble by association of nucleocapsids with glycoproteins embedded in the membranes of the Golgi, followed by budding into the Golgi cisternae. Nascent virions are then transported in secretory vesicles to the plasma membrane and released by <b>exocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|At a {{chemical}} synapse, one neuron releases neurotransmitter molecules {{into a small}} space (the synaptic cleft) that is adjacent to another neuron. The neurotransmitters are kept within small sacs called vesicles, and are released into the synaptic cleft by <b>exocytosis.</b> These molecules then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell's side of the synaptic cleft. Finally, the neurotransmitters must be cleared from the synapse through one of several potential mechanisms including enzymatic degradation or re-uptake by specific transporters either on the presynaptic cell or possibly by neuroglia to terminate {{the action of the}} transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Fusion is {{involved}} in many cellular processes, particularly in eukaryotes since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. <b>Exocytosis,</b> fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of}} the many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of fusion. Fusion is also an important mechanism for transport of lipids from their site of synthesis to the membrane where they are needed. Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by fusion, as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated fusion proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that periods of intense {{stimulation}} at neural synapses deplete vesicle count as well as increase cellular capacitance and surface area. This indicates that after synaptic vesicles release their neurotransmitter payload, they merge with and become part of, the cellular membrane. After tagging synaptic vesicles with HRP (horseradish peroxidase), Heuser and Reese found that portions of the cellular membrane at the frog neuromuscular junction were taken up by the cell and converted back into synaptic vesicles. Studies suggest that the entire cycle of <b>exocytosis,</b> retrieval, and reformation of the synaptic vesicles requires less than 1 minute.|$|E
25|$|Primed vesicles fuse {{very quickly}} in {{response}} to calcium elevations in the cytoplasm. This fusion event {{is thought to be}} mediated directly by the SNAREs and driven by the energy provided from SNARE assembly. The calcium-sensing trigger for this event is the calcium-binding synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin. The ability of SNAREs to mediate fusion in a calcium-dependent manner recently has been reconstituted in vitro. Consistent with SNAREs being essential for the fusion process, v-SNARE and t-SNARE mutants of C. elegans are lethal. Similarly, mutants in Drosophila and knockouts in mice indicate that these SNARES {{play a critical role in}} synaptic <b>exocytosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} of calcium-dependent <b>exocytosis</b> at retinal ribbon synapses {{suggests that the}} ribbon accommodates a reservoir of primed releasable vesicles. The vesicles that are in closest contact with the presynaptic plasma membrane {{at the base of}} the ribbon constitute the small, rapidly releasable pool of vesicles, whereas the remaining vesicles tethered to the ribbon constitute the large, readily (slower) releasable pool. These regularly aligned rows of synaptic vesicles tethered to either side of the ribbon along with the expression of the kinesin motor protein KIF3A at retinal ribbon synapses can move vesicles like a conveyor belt to the docking/release site at the ribbon base.|$|E
25|$|In the {{diagnosis}} of type I diabetes, elevated anti-sulfatide antibodies in serum arise. Such anti-sulfatide antibodies prevent insulin secretion and <b>exocytosis.</b> However, {{research has shown that}} when non-obese diabetic mice are treated with sulfatide, it reduces the possible occurrence of diabetes from 85% in control animals to 35% in experimental animals. Sulfatide is also commonly known to possess anti-inflammatory properties. As a result of these anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the blockage of L-selectin, sulfatide has been shown to prevent type I diabetes and inhibit insulitis in non-obese diabetic mice. Sulfatide also prevents apoptosis in insulin secreting cells by preventing the effects of interleukin-1 beta (lL-1β), interferon beta 1b (lFN-1β), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) that promote apoptosis.|$|E
25|$|Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and the {{sympathetic}} nervous system stimulate the synthesis of adrenaline precursors by enhancing the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine β-hydroxylase, two key enzymes involved in catecholamine synthesis. ACTH also stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol, which increases the expression of PNMT in chromaffin cells, enhancing adrenaline synthesis. This is most often done in response to stress. The {{sympathetic nervous system}}, acting via splanchnic nerves to the adrenal medulla, stimulates the release of adrenaline. Acetylcholine released by preganglionic sympathetic fibers of these nerves acts on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, causing cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage-gated calcium channels. Calcium triggers the <b>exocytosis</b> of chromaffin granules and, thus, the release of adrenaline (and noradrenaline) into the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} ion {{channels}} on the post-synaptic membrane affects {{the strength of}} the synapse. Research suggests that the density of receptors on post-synaptic membranes changes, affecting the neuron’s excitability in response to stimuli. In a dynamic process that is maintained in equilibrium, N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor) and AMPA receptors are added to the membrane by <b>exocytosis</b> and removed by endocytosis. These processes, and by extension the number of receptors on the membrane, can be altered by synaptic activity. Experiments have shown that AMPA receptors are delivered to the synapse through vesicular membrane fusion with the postsynaptic membrane via the protein kinase CaMKII, which is activated by the influx of calcium through NMDA receptors. CaMKII also improves AMPA ionic conductance through phosphorylation.|$|E
25|$|Once {{inside the}} human host, promastigotes invade macrophages. Inside the cells they {{transform}} {{back into the}} smaller amastigote form. The amastigotes replicate in the most hostile part of the macrophage cell, inside the phagolysosome, whose normal defensive response {{they are able to}} prevent. After repeated multiplication, they break down their host cell by sheer pressure of mass, but there is some recent speculation that they are able to leave the cell by triggering the <b>exocytosis</b> response of the macrophage. The daughter cells protozoans then migrate to fresh cells or through the bloodstream to find new hosts. In this way the infection is progressive, spreading to the host's mononuclear phagocyte system, particularly the spleen and liver. The free amastigotes in peripheral tissues are then ingested by sandfly to enter another cycle.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has several}} isoforms, {{including}} C16:0, which is found {{primarily in the}} secretory granules and toward {{the surface of the}} membrane of β cells. Secretory granules and β cells are found in the islet of Langerhans and in rat β TC3 cells. Research has shown that in the pancreases of type II diabetic mouse models, there is a deficiency of C16:0. Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the pancreas secrete insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent <b>exocytosis</b> and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive potassium ion channels. Sulfatide can also stimulate proinsulin folding as well, as it can serve as a molecular chaperone for insulin.|$|E
25|$|Neonatal {{jaundice}} is {{the other}} chief complication {{that leads to the}} basal ganglia damage associated with this condition. Jaundice is caused by hyperbilirubinemia, or abnormally high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is usually bound to albumin immediately and sent to the liver. However, in neonatal jaundice, the concentration of bilirubin overwhelms that of albumin and some of the bilirubin remains unconjugated and can enter the brain through the blood–brain barrier. Normally bilirubin {{would not be able to}} diffuse across the blood–brain barrier, but in infants, the barrier is immature and has higher permeability. Bilirubin is toxic as it prevents the phosphorylation of many proteins, including synapsin I which binds vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Therefore, it directly inhibits the <b>exocytosis</b> of neurotransmitters and severely hinders the synapses it affects. In autopsies of children who suffered from neonatal jaundice, chronic changes of neuronal loss, gliosis and demyelination were observed in the basal ganglia and more specifically within the globus pallidus.|$|E
25|$|Several {{proteins}} of the synaptic ribbon {{have also}} {{been found to be}} associated with conventional synapses. RIM (Rab3-interacting proteins) is a GTPase expressed on synaptic vesicles that is important in priming synaptic vesicles. Immunostaining has revealed the presence of KIF3A, a component of the kinesin II motor complex whose function is still unknown. The presynaptic cytomatrix proteins Bassoon and Piccolo are both expressed at photoreceptor ribbons, but Piccolo is only expressed at retinal bipolar synaptic ribbons. Bassoon is responsible for attaching itself {{to the base of the}} synaptic ribbons and subsequently anchoring the synaptic ribbons. The function of Piccolo is unknown. Also important is the filaments that tether the vesicles to the ribbon synapse. These are shed during high rates of <b>exocytosis.</b> The only unique protein associated with the synaptic ribbon is RIBEYE, first identified in purified synaptic ribbon from bovine retina. It is found to be a part of all vertebrate synaptic ribbons in ribbon synapses and is the central portion of ribbon synapses. RIBEYE interactions are required to form a scaffold formation protein of the synaptic ribbon.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (<b>exocytosis).</b> Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (tail current). Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E
