5|$|At WrestleMania XXIV, Edge {{lost the}} World Heavyweight {{championship}} to the Undertaker when <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> {{out to the}} Hell's Gate. In a WrestleMania rematch, The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash to retain the World Heavyweight championship. Following Backlash, The Undertaker was stripped of the World title by Vickie Guerrero and faced Edge for the title at Judgment Day in May and then again at One Night Stand in a TLC match in June. The first match ended with a countout victory for The Undertaker but no champion was crowned due to the circumstances. The second match at One Night Stand saw Edge walk away champion, which also meant Undertaker {{was forced to leave}} the company.|$|E
5|$|Rocky Balboa gives nods to {{previous}} installments via the casting. The most obvious is {{the return of}} Stallone, Young, and Burtonthe only actors to portray the same characters in all six installments. Tarver's appearance in the film marks the sixth time an active professional boxer {{has appeared in the}} series. Previously, Joe Frazier (Rocky), Pedro Lovell (Rocky), Roberto Durán (Rocky II), Tommy Morrison (Rocky V), and Michael Williams (Rocky V) have appeared in the series. Stallone initially wanted Roy Jones, Jr. to portray Dixon, but after Jones did not return Stallone's phone calls, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> Antonio Tarver to fill the role. Tarver accidentally knocked out Stallone during the filming of one of the segments of the fight.|$|E
5|$|The {{sound effects}} were {{designed}} by Star Wars veteran Ben Burtt. Whereas the phaser blast noises from the television series were derived from The War of the Worlds (1953), Burtt made his phaser sounds more like his blasters from Star Wars, because Abrams' depiction of phasers were closer to the blasters' bullet-like fire, rather than the steady beams of energy in previous Star Trek films. Burtt reproduced the classic photon torpedo and warp drive sounds: <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> a long spring against a contact microphone, and combined that with cannon fire. Burtt used a 1960s oscillator to create a musical and emotional hum to the warping and transporting sounds.|$|E

2500|$|However, Norman {{decides to}} cast his [...] spell to give +3/+3 to his Grizzly Bears before combat damage is dealt. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> a Forest {{to pay for}} the spell, and puts Giant Growth on the stack. Tom, who does not want to give the Grizzly Bears a chance to grow to 5/5 and kill his Hill Giant, {{responds}} by casting [...] targeting the Grizzly Bears. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> one Mountain {{to pay for the}} spell, and puts Shock on the stack on top of Giant Growth. If Norman had no other spells, then Tom's Shock would resolve first and deal 2 damage to the Grizzly Bears, killing them. His Giant Growth would then go to the graveyard with no effect because the Bears would no longer be on the battlefield and would thus be an illegal target. Fortunately for Norman, he has another spell to cast. <b>He</b> <b>taps</b> a Plains and casts [...] targeting his Grizzly Bears. Now Mending Hands is on top of the stack, with Shock and then Giant Growth beneath it.|$|R
5|$|Merson came {{in place}} of John Jensen in Arsenal's {{starting}} XI, while for Milan Zvonimir Boban replaced the suspended Simone, and Christian Panucci was chosen to stand in for Paolo Maldini. Graham deployed a 4–1–4–1 formation, with Schwarz acting as the lone defensive midfielder and Hartson positioned the furthest forward. Watched by a crowd of 23,953, Milan eased to a 2–0 win {{and in the process}} ended Arsenal's 15-match unbeaten run in Europe. The home side's first goal came minutes before half-time, when Daniele Massaro's defensive-splitting pass found Boban, who scored, despite Schwarz's attempts to hold him back by tugging his shirt. The Croatian forward nearly scored a second, but for Seaman's quick intervention. Up until then, Arsenal had briefly threatened; from a long ball in the 19th minute, Hartson managed to turn Franco Baresi, but scuffed his shot wide. Milan found it easy to contain the opposition, given Desailly and Savićević influenced the tempo of the match. The latter came close to doubling Milan's lead when he broke forward and hit a shot goalwards, only for Seaman to divert the ball round the post. In the second half, Wright thought he had equalised for Arsenal when <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> the ball in, but the referee disallowed the goal as there was infringement in the build-up. Milan continued to attack and extended their lead soon after; from Savićević's corner, Massaro jumped higher than his marker Lee Dixon and headed the ball into the Arsenal goal. Dixon, who required treatment early in the second half, was substituted for Martin Keown right away as he struggled to play on.|$|E
25|$|Angle, {{who became}} a fan {{favorite}} {{as a result of}} Austin's treachery, immediately began challenging Austin for the WWF Championship. His first chance came at SummerSlam, which Angle won by disqualification allowing Austin to retain the title. At Unforgiven in September, Angle forced Austin to submit to his ankle lock and won the WWF Championship in front of his hometown fans in Pittsburgh. Austin demanded a rematch, claiming his hand was under the ropes when <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> out, and received it on the October 8, 2001 edition of Raw. Austin regained the title when William Regal, the WWF Commissioner and special enforcer, attacked Angle and joined The Alliance.|$|E
25|$|He faced Shawn Jordan on June 15, 2013 at UFC 161, losing by TKO {{in round}} one. However, later reports came that the {{stoppage}} {{might have been}} caused by an eye poke from Jordan. The report showed that the uppercut Jordan landed (which seemed to daze Barry) wasn't an uppercut but an open hand blow. The report also showed that Jordan's fingers found their way into Barry's eyes. Following the uppercut, Barry was trying to protect the eye from the next of Jordan's punches. Barry did not mention that he had been poked in the eye, but pictures from the day after the fight show that <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> to strikes three times.|$|E

25|$|Davis' appointees in {{the second}} term {{included}} outgoing State Representative Claude Kirkpatrick of Jennings, the seat of Jefferson Davis Parish, who was named to succeed Lorris M. Wimberly as the Director of Public Works. In that capacity, Kirkpatrick took the steps for a joint agreement with Texas to establish the popular Toledo Bend Reservoir, a haven for boating and fishing. Mrs. Kirkpatrick, the former Edith Killgore, a native of Claiborne Parish, headed Davis' women's campaign division for southwestern Louisiana. He appointed Alexandria businessman Morgan W. Walker, Sr., to the State Mineral Board. Walker founded a company which later became part of Continental Trailways Bus lines. Davis named as state highway director Ray Burgess of Baton Rouge, who considered running for governor in the 1963 primary. <b>He</b> <b>tapped</b> the attorney Frank Voelker, Jr., of Lake Providence, to chair the states' rights panel, the Louisiana Sovereignty Commission; Voelker left the commission {{to run for governor}} in 1963 but polled few votes.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004 at the Royal Rumble, Flair and Batista {{successfully}} {{defended the}} World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a Tables match, and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a Last Man Standing match, thus retaining the championship. Flair and Batista exchanged the World Tag Team Championships with Booker T and Rob Van Dam. At WrestleMania XX, Evolution defeated the Rock 'n' Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. Later that night, Triple H lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Benoit (in a triple threat match that also involved Shawn Michaels) when <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> {{out to the}} Crippler Crossface. At Backlash, Flair lost to Shelton Benjamin in one-on-one action. Later that night, Orton defended the Intercontinental Championship successfully against Cactus Jack (Mick Foley) in a Hardcore match, while Chris Benoit retained the World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match against Triple H and Shawn Michaels, this time forcing Michaels to submit with the Sharpshooter.|$|E
25|$|Alonso {{started the}} season by {{qualifying}} fifth in Australia; {{by the end}} of the first lap he had moved up to third. He eventually managed to use the pit stops to his advantage by pitting early and jumping Vettel. Alonso held onto second until the end of the race. In Malaysia, Alonso qualified on the second row of the grid in third. Going into the second corner <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> the back of Vettel and damaged his front wing, the team told him to stay out instead of pitting, hoping that the wing would not break, so that Alonso would be able to pit for slick tyres at the right time. However while going down the main straight at the start of the second lap, his front wing broke off and went underneath his car sending it into the gravel trap and into retirement. Alonso then won his home race, the , by fighting through from fifth; however, seventh place in Monaco after that again lost him points and left him 29 points behind Vettel.|$|E

25|$|After a {{break for}} the FA Cup fourth round matches, during which time the squad {{travelled}} to Barcelona for training, Southampton travelled to Old Trafford to face league leaders Manchester United on 30 January 2013. The game started positively for the visitors, as Jay Rodriguez scored after just two minutes following a poor pass back by Michael Carrick to goalkeeper David de Gea. Just six minutes later, however, Wayne Rooney equalised, and Shinji Kagawa almost made it two in the tenth minute when he hit the post. In the 27th minute, Rooney scored the second for the home side as <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> in a header by Patrice Evra from a Robin van Persie free kick awarded for a foul on Phil Jones by Rodriguez. In the second half, Van Persie came close to a headed goal but for an impressive Artur Boruc save, and {{he also had a}} goal disallowed for offside. Despite the majority of the possession in the second half, the Saints were unable to make any of their chances count, and suffered their first league defeat since 22 December 2012 to remain 16th in the table.|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} held under a one-night tournament format. In the first round, Shamrock was pitted against taekwondo stylist Patrick Smith, who he made short work of by {{throwing}} Smith {{to the mat}} and submitting him with a heel hook. His next opponent would be Brazilian jiu-jitsu exponent and eventual tournament winner Royce Gracie. Shamrock sprawled a takedown attempt and maneuvered on top of Gracie, and then grabbed his ankle and sat back to attempt another heel hook. According to Shamrock, however, his arm had gotten tangled in Gracie's gi, and when Shamrock sat back, it pulled Gracie on top of him, which allowed Gracie to secure a choke and submit Shamrock. While the move is often listed as a rear naked choke, Shamrock later stated it to be actually a gi choke, in which Royce would have wrapped the cloth of his gi around Ken's neck. The ending of the fight was also source of controversy because the referee {{did not see the}} tap and ordered the two fighters to continue fighting after Gracie had let go of the hold. Shamrock paused for a few seconds but declined, admitting to the ref that <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> out and {{that it would not be}} fair for him to continue fighting.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Frieze of Life" [...] themes recur {{throughout}} Munch's {{work but}} he especially focused {{on them in}} the mid-1890s. In sketches, paintings, pastels and prints, <b>he</b> <b>tapped</b> {{the depths of his}} feelings to examine his major motifs: the stages of life, the femme fatale, the hopelessness of love, anxiety, infidelity, jealousy, sexual humiliation, and separation in life and death. These themes are expressed in paintings such as The Sick Child (1885), Love and Pain (retitled Vampire; 1893–94), Ashes (1894), and The Bridge. The latter shows limp figures with featureless or hidden faces, over which loom the threatening shapes of heavy trees and brooding houses. Munch portrayed women either as frail, innocent sufferers (see Puberty and Love and Pain) or as the cause of great longing, jealousy and despair (see Separation, Jealousy, and Ashes).|$|E

[...] Many in the KMT’s right-wing claimed the speech betrayed the party’s historic commitment to destroy the communists; Chiang countered by instructing Lee to publish the entire speech in the party’s official journal. The role Lee played in the lifting of martial law in Taiwan and subsequent reforms to the National Assembly led to assembly members characterizing Lee as one of the Red Guards.|$|E
