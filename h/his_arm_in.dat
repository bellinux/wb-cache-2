5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist to hers. Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|Chard {{claims to}} be the birthplace of powered flight, as it was here in 1848 that the Victorian {{aeronautical}} pioneer John Stringfellow (1799–1883) first demonstrated that engine-powered flight was possible through his work on the Aerial Steam Carriage. James Gillingham (1839–1924) from Chard pioneered the development of articulated artificial limbs when he produced a prosthesis for a man who lost <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> a cannon accident in 1863. Chard Museum has a display of Gillingham's work.|$|E
5|$|Kishimoto {{has noted}} that he likes Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> order to not obscure his hair.|$|E

5|$|Sadie, {{traveling}} {{as either}} Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left for Los Angeles on March 25, 1882, {{and then returned}} to her family in San Francisco. In July 1882, Wyatt left Colorado and went to San Francisco, where he sought out Sadie and his brother Virgil, who was seeking treatment for <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> <b>In</b> February or March 1883, Sadie and Earp left San Francisco for Gunnison, where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City. Sadie was his common-law wife for the next 46 years.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe {{grew up in}} South Australia, {{and studied}} at St Peter's College, Adelaide in his youth. There he earned the {{attention}} of cricket watchers for his skill and his suspect action. Halcombe was suspected of throwing, meaning an illegal bowling action in which a player straightens <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> the process of delivering the ball, thereby throwing it, whereas the laws of cricket required that a bowler did not change the angle of his elbow in delivering the ball. In 1923, while still a schoolboy, he was observed by former England captain Archie MacLaren (who was currently visiting Australia {{as part of the}} Marylebone Cricket Club team) and former Australia captain and all rounder George Giffen. To test the legitimacy of Halcombe's action, his wrist, forearm and elbow were encased in splints, so that he could not move his elbow position. He delivered balls at varying speeds, and the experts failed to detect an illegal action.|$|E
5|$|McCall played {{football}} for Upper Wortley Primary School and Thornhill Middle School, even scoring a winning {{goal for the}} latter in a cup final when he came on as a substitute with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> a sling. While McCall also played table tennis as a schoolboy, football was a focus, and he captained the Leeds under-11 boys team and played for other Leeds representative sides. McCall's parents split and he made up for his size {{when he moved to}} one of Leeds' toughest estates and played for pub sides by the age of 14. He moved schools to Harrington High and also played for local young sides Pudsey Juniors, Holbeck and later Farsley Celtic. McCall thought he had missed his chance of playing professionally after a string of other players were signed by professional clubs, until Farsley played Bradford City's junior side in a friendly and he impressed coach Bryan Edwards enough to be asked for a trial.|$|E

5|$|Nova began a {{throwing}} {{program to}} rehabilitate <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> September, {{and spent the}} winter at the Yankees' spring training facility in Tampa, Florida, rather than returning to the Dominican Republic. The Yankees signed Nova to a $3.3million contract for the 2015 season, avoiding arbitration. On April 11, 2015, the Yankees placed Nova on the 60-day disabled list to begin the season recovering from his Tommy John surgery. He made his first rehabilitation start on June 8, {{and returned to the}} Yankees on June 24. Nova pitched to a 5.11 ERA in 14 starts before the Yankees took him out of the starting rotation on September 16; however, Nova returned to the rotation due to an injury to Masahiro Tanaka. He finished the 2015 season with a 6–11 record and a 5.07 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Carlton {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to the other six residents, pouring gasoline underneath the door of the far end of the residence and setting it on fire. Draftsman Herbert Fritz managed to break open a window and escape, though he broke <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> the process. Carlton then entered the other dining room and killed Brodelle. He then hid, waiting for the other residents to try to escape. As foreman William Weston and his 13-year-old son Ernest ran through the door, Carlton attacked with the hatchet. The Westons escaped, but Ernest died from his wounds hours later. Carlton sought out the final two residents, laborer Thomas Brunker and gardener David Lindblom. Brunker and Lindblom managed to fight off Carlton and escape, but died days later from their burns and injuries. With the house empty, Carlton ran to the basement and into a fireproof furnace chamber. He brought a small vial of hydrochloric acid with him as a fallback plan in case the heat became too much for him to handle. Carlton did attempt suicide by swallowing the acid, but it failed to kill him.|$|E
5|$|The earguards are in {{the shape}} of silver ears, and the neckguard is {{decorated}} with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> the air as he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large cornucopia, and a Roman helmet and shield below.|$|E

5|$|The second divisional game of {{the year}} for the 3–0 Bears, looking for their first 4–0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2–1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the {{meetings}} between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had {{to keep up with the}} Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> a car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011.|$|E
25|$|At {{the local}} Goondiwindi {{hospital}} a nurse attended Boland, {{but the doctor}} on duty refused to see him, despite the gravity of his injuries, according to Boland's family. At one stage Boland {{and one of the}} Tomkins, who had broken <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> the fracas, were sitting together in the same treatment room. Boland was then taken by the police to a holding cell in Tenterfield.|$|E
25|$|In May 2001, Malik's bowling {{action was}} inspected. The PCB group of bowling {{advisers}} concluded that his stock off-spinner was legal, although his delivery going {{the other way}} was not. He was encouraged to concentrate on his off-spin and to practice bowling his other delivery without bending <b>his</b> <b>arm.</b> <b>In</b> an One Day International (ODI) match against England in June 2001, Malik suffered a fractured right shoulder after falling awkwardly while attempting to take a catch.|$|E

25|$|The Yankees re-signed Cone in {{the offseason}} to a three-year {{contract}} worth $19.5 million. Cone was 4–1 with a 2.02 ERA when {{he was diagnosed with}} an aneurysm in <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> 1996 and went on the disabled list {{for the majority of the}} year. In his comeback start that September against the Oakland Athletics, Cone pitched a no-hitter through seven innings before he had to leave due to pitch count restrictions. Mariano Rivera allowed a single, ending the no-hit bid.|$|E
25|$|This match {{had a very}} {{exciting}} climax. When time ran out, England were six runs short of the 234 {{that they needed to}} win. The ninth wicket fell when Derek Shackleton was run out from the fourth ball of the final over. Colin Cowdrey had had his left arm broken earlier in the innings, and had retired hurt. Now he reappeared, with <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> plaster. Luckily for him, and for England, he was not required to face a ball, David Allen playing out the remaining two deliveries.|$|E

He releases his monkey in the zoo, but it is killed by the other monkeys. Because of his arm, he is unable to find employment. As a crowd approaches him at a street crossing, he runs away in fear.|$|E

The captain of Azov, Mikhail Lazarev, was promoted to Rear Admiral; Lazarev and lieutenants Pavel Nakhimov (the future admiral) and Ivan Butenev (who lost <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> the battle) were awarded the Order of St. George. In March 1828 the crew of Azov was awarded a special Flag of St. George. Nicholas decreed that after Azovs retirement the Russian Navy must perpetually have a ship named Pamyat Azova (Память Азова, The Memory of Azov), thus the name Azov was effectively retired.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, he {{was badly}} injured by a bear while driving a freight team from Independence, Missouri to Santa Fe, New Mexico. According to Hickok's account, {{he found the}} road blocked by a {{cinnamon}} bear and its two cubs. Dismounting, he approached the bear and fired a shot into its head, but the bullet ricocheted off its skull, infuriating it. The bear attacked, crushing Hickok with its body. Hickok managed to fire another shot, wounding the bear's paw. The bear then grabbed <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> its mouth, but Hickok was able to grab his knife and slash its throat, killing it.|$|E

After the season was completed, he returned to California to play for the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, which played a longer schedule than other baseball leagues. In 1947, Sandel was promoted to the major leagues and spent the next two seasons as relief pitcher for the New York Giants. Because relief pitchers were not used regularly in games back in the 1940s, Sandel was often rotated back to the Jersey City team during the season to keep <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>in</b> shape.|$|E
