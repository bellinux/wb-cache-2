25|$|Architecturally Grade II*-listed the Dower House is {{the largest}} {{building}} on a long residential lane off Cranleigh Road, Barnett Lane at the end east of the street. In 1710 most all of its exterior was built – the date of foundations and chimneys is uncertain – in red brick with plain hipped tiles and five 12-pane <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sash windows to its first floor. Its architectural features represent typical authentic Queen Anne style architecture.|$|E
50|$|Original timber {{doors are}} either {{single-leaf}} or French with rectangular fanlights. The former are low-waisted with four solid panels, {{while the latter}} are low-waisted with single solid panels {{at the bottom and}} two rectangular panes divided by a narrow <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> at the top. Some doors appear to have been relocated within the building.|$|E
50|$|This {{administration}} block {{served the}} former iron works and Burrell's Colours {{business in the}} latter 20th century. Inlaid with various depth brickwork, this three-storeyed stock brick block is arranged parallel to the above units, separated by Burrells Wharf Square where a construction dock once stood. Upper floors have <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sash windows with flat-gauged arches and stucco sills.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{windows are}} usually glazed with one large sheet of glass per sash, while {{windows in the}} past were glazed with {{multiple}} panes separated by <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> or muntins, due to the unavailability of large sheets of glass. Today, <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> tend to be decorative, separating windows into small panes of glass even though larger panes of glass are available, generally in a pattern dictated by the architectural style at use. <b>Glazing</b> <b>bars</b> are typically wooden, but occasionally lead <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> soldered in place are used for more intricate glazing patterns.|$|R
50|$|A {{picture window}} {{is a large}} fixed window in a wall, {{typically}} without <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> or <b>glazed</b> with only perfunctory <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> {{near the edge of}} the window. Picture windows provide an unimpeded view, as if framing a picture.|$|R
50|$|The front {{elevation}} features windows with arched <b>glazing</b> <b>bars,</b> whilst the fanlight {{above the door}} features scalloped <b>glazing</b> <b>bars.</b> The remainder of the windows were originally nine paned in rows of three which pivoted inwards or outwards, however most were replaced with sheet glass or glass louvres in 1983.|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} the use of a rabbet is in a <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> where it makes {{provision}} for the insertion of the pane of glass and putty. It may also accommodate the edge of the back panel of a cabinet. It is also used in door and casement window jambs, and for shiplap planking. A rabbet can be used to form a joint with another piece of wood (often containing a dado).|$|E
50|$|The terrace is of 3 main floors, {{together}} with an attic and basement. The frontage is stucco, and the roof is slate. There is a string under the first floor windows, and a moulded cornice with parapet, which has balustraded panels over the windows. The terrace is symmetrical, with the two end houses projecting slightly. Each house has three semi-circular headed dormers, some with radiating glazing and 3 ranges of <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sash windows, whilst the end houses have architrave and cornice to the centre first floor windows.|$|E

2500|$|Bow or bay {{windows were}} the [...] "chief {{architectural}} feature" [...] of Brighton's early houses. Vertical sliding timber-framed sash windows with <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> were usually inserted into these, although casements were sometimes used—typically on the oldest or most modest buildings. [...] Casements would sometimes be given <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> as well. [...] Such bars were usually slim and had mouldings in various patterns. [...] The combination of partly recessed sashes and bow windows {{is characteristic of}} Brighton's Regency-era residential developments. The Queen Anne Revival-style housing popular in Hove in the late 19th century had its own window pattern: two-part sashes with many panes on the upper section, separated by wider <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> than those used in earlier years. Casement windows were popular on interwar Tudor Revival houses, as at Woodland Drive (a conservation area) in West Blatchington; and steel-framed Crittall windows are found in interwar Modernist buildings such as Embassy Court and the Moderne-style mansion flats at 4 Grand Avenue, Hove.|$|R
50|$|It is {{now called}} Dunston Church of England Voluntary Primary Controlled School, Junior Mixed and Infants. The {{building}} is of red brick, the original block, dating from 1866, has lancet windows with diagonal <b>glazing</b> <b>bars.</b>|$|R
50|$|Goodnestone House is a Grade II* listed red {{and blue}} brick palladian house, enlisted on 13 October 1952. The {{original}} house, as built in 1704, was a two-storey building. However, significant alterations were made around 1790 when a 3rd floor was added with plinth, plat band and cornice to the hipped roof with stacks to left and to right. Between 1838 and 1844 further changes {{were made by the}} partnership of Thomas Rickman and R.C. Hussey and by Sir Brook Bridges, 5th Baronet. The house has nine bays, the central 5th bay projecting with pediment. On the top floor are nine half-sized <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sashes on top floor, and 6 full sized on the first and ground floors. The grand porch features Greek Doric columns, with solid side walls, adding during the development phase in the early 1840s. The original entrance to the house was on its eastern side. The eastern side also features 9 bays with <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sashes and heavy stone surrounds with the protruding central 5th bay emblazoned with arms of Sir Brook Bridges in 1842. To the northern side there are 2 storeys with an attic with plinth, plat band and parapet to hipped roof, with 3 pedimented dormers and rear stack. On both the northern and southern side of the house is a large pilaster strip buttress and shallow canted bay.|$|E
50|$|The {{inscription}} on the rainwater {{head of the}} hall indicates the hall was built in 1792. According to records the hall was raised and altered in about 1845 and in 1889-90 additions were made by Robert Evans. The square plan building is built in three storeys and features stucco, with ashlar dressings and hipped slate roofs with various coped stacks. The windows mainly have <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sashes and include a Venetian window and 4 reglazed French windows. At the rear, {{north end of the}} property, is a square service building with pyramidal roof, linked by a curved corridor.|$|E
5000|$|Hinchley Wood {{is within}} easy walking {{distance}} of Littleworth Common, just to the east southwards, where it meets Esher Eagles Rugby League club then followed by, in the south west, a historic but now small wood which shares its name with the community. Telegraph Hill is also southwest of Hinchley Wood and is the largest nearby walking spot and has some visitor attraction for its Grade II (architecture) listed 'Semaphore House' semaphore tower described as [...] "c1822. Rendered brick on projecting plinth with hipped slate roof. 3-storey square tower to centre...C20 <b>glazing</b> <b>bar</b> sash windows throughout".|$|E
50|$|The manse {{is located}} {{at the corner of the}} black facing Ipswich Street. It is a {{weatherboard}} building on low stumps with a hipped corrugated iron roof. The windows are casements with horizontal <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> and there is a small porch.|$|R
50|$|The north window, as noted, was {{put into}} the {{elevation}} in 1801. The window is of tripartite type comprising a six-over-six sash with narrow margin lights. The <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> are narrow and elegant, consistent with the Regency era within which it was built.|$|R
50|$|The {{windows are}} ornamented by dropped keystones and aprons. In order to {{maintain}} the scale and perspective of the building, the windows are by necessity long and narrow this creates an illusion of greater height — illusion being a typical Baroque feature. The illusion has been somewhat modified, however, by the late 19th century replacement <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> on the first and second floors. The <b>glazing</b> <b>bars</b> on the ground floor, which are likely to be original, give smaller panes which are more in the English Baroque style as seen at other contemporary baroque buildings, such as Easton Neston. The crowded features of the Baroque façade are not dissimilar to those at Heythrop Park, also in Oxfordshire, where Francis Smith, the architect, worked as building contractor.|$|R
