40|$|A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in Hamer and Bena-Tsemay pastoral and agro-pastoral districts of South Omo zone, south western Ethiopia in between January to May 2011 with the objective to describe availability of feed resource for goats. Data were collected from the two districts by informal and formal survey methods using focused group discussion and semi-structured questionnaire administered to 250 households. Natural pastures from rangelands are major feed sources for goats. Higher feed availability is reported in March to April (during the main rainy season). However, availability of feed extends up to October in Bena-Tsemay district due to the higher rainfall in the district. In both districts, the hot dry season (November to February) is the period of feed scarcity and during which high mortality of goats have been reported. Crop residues and some food left over are also available for supplementing animals especially in the agro-pastoral areas.

The experimentation has foreseen dynamic tests, during the real milking of the cows, in an apulian plant in which different measurers of the quantity of milk have been installed: weigh jar, electronic weighing “bascule” milk-meter, electronic proportional milk-meter. In a mechanical point of view, the vacuum level and the vacuum fluctuations in three different milk pipe sections have been valued: at short milk tube, downstream from the claw, prior to the milk meter. Comparing the results, authors deduced that the electronic milk-meters, like the electronic proportional milk meter, allows inferior vacuum degree variations and less mechanical solicitations in cow udder; such situation is particularly evident with higher milk flow. The study also underlines that the vacuum drops during milking can be very critical if not immediately compensate with a suitable planning and periodic revision of the plants...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to know of potential of natural resources of Mt. Halimun used by surrounding communities and the development of bufferzone. The potential of natural resources are composed of wildlife, plant biodiversity,land and hydrology. Then, The utilization of natural resources will be correlated with the condition of socio economic and culture of communities. According to the study, it is known that the major occupation of the village communities are as farmers, who have private land or as laborers (> 50 %). As laborers, they worked for landlord with salary Rp. 5, 000 to Rp 10, 000 per day for six days per week. This condition made village communities to depend their livelihood to potential of natural resources of Mt. Halimun NP. Based on dynamic hypothesis,the bufferzone could be developed through data and information of the natural resources that utilized or disturbed by communities. The plant biodiversity are used as energy, traditional medicines, food, handicrafts and forages. Illegal hunting done by surrounding communities was hunting wild pigs, birds and monkeys. To limit the exploitation, illegal cutting, illegal hunting and deforestation The Mt Halimun NP have program social forestry and agroforestry to decrease dependency of communities to the forest.

There were 1. 08 kids born per litter in goats and 1. 06 lambs in sheep: litter size in sheep differed significantly between seasons and between years of parturition. Kids weighed 12. 8 kg at 150 days, there being differences due to season and parity: lambs weighed 14. 9 kg, this weight being affected by season, parity and litter size. Seasonal variations in weights of adult female goats and sheep were marked, being about 12 % below the overall annual average weight for each age class in June (end of dry season) and 12 % above the mean in November (post rains).

To date, very few studies have investigated farmers’ local knowledge on plants used in managing {{animal health and welfare}} in Angolan Mopane woodland. This is a very dry ecosystem where animal husbandry (mostly cattle and <b>goats</b> <b>breeding)</b> is highly widespread and is often the main form of subsidence, greatly contributing to local communities food security, especially in periods of resources shortage. An ethnobotanical research project was carried out in Bibala (Namibe province – Angola) in 2010 – 2012, in order to collect information on different traditional uses of plants, involving an interviewed sample of 66 informants. Fifty-eight of them (87. 9 %) listed a total of 39 species used as ethno-veterinary and/or fodder plants. Ten ethno-veterinary species (28 citations) were reported by 20 informants as used to treat diseases commonly affecting animals in the studied area, namely respiratory tract problems (Laphangium luteoalbum, Gyrocarpus americanus, Craibia brevicaudata subsp. baptistarum, Lepisanthes senegalensis, Ptaeroxylon obliquum, Ximenia americana) and skin diseases and wounds (Aloe littoralis, Blepharis sp., Ficus thonningii), or acting as a general tonic (Faidherbia albida). Thirty-four plants (235 citations) were cited by 58 informants as fodder. In this category of use, the most cited species were Terminalia prunioides (30 citations), Faidherbia albida (28 citations) and Spirostachys africana (21 citations).
