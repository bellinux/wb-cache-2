5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. Boletus xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as Boletus purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano Alessio to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species <b>description</b> meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of Boletus rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (both now placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed <b>description</b> by Quélet, and that this was the only <b>description</b> faithful to the original <b>description</b> with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original <b>description</b> must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{aimed to}} discuss how {{specific}} Turkish migraineurs’ the most severe headache attack <b>descriptions</b> are to socio-cultural background and how universal these <b>descriptions</b> are. Consecutive 99 patients who met International Headache Society’s “migraine without aura” criteria were required to give a short comment on their most severe headache attacks. The <b>descriptions</b> that were given by the patients were grouped in six categories. These categories were: 1. <b>Descriptions</b> related to eyes (n= 23) 2. <b>Descriptions</b> about penetration of the head (n= 11) 3. <b>Descriptions</b> about the intracranial pressure/congestion (n= 13) 4. <b>Descriptions</b> about the change of intracranial contents (n= 9) 5. Various <b>descriptions</b> (n= 6) 6. <b>Descriptions</b> related to patients’ affect rather than the headache quality (n= 24). First five groups’ <b>descriptions</b> {{were thought to be}} related with central sensitization process of migraine (n= 62), while the last group’s <b>descriptions</b> were thought to be related to patients’ anxiety due to pain (n= 24). Cranial sensitization is related to migraine pathophysiology which is universal, so <b>descriptions</b> about that should be universal as well. However, we believe that the ethnic and cultural background on patients’ affects about acute and extreme migraine headache is open to discussion...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{automatically}} generating human-like <b>descriptions</b> for unseen images, given a collection of images and their corresponding human-generated <b>descriptions.</b> Previous attempts for this task mostly rely on visual clues and corpus statis-tics, but do not take much advantage of the semantic in-formation inherent in the available image <b>descriptions.</b> Here, we present a generic method which benefits from all these three sources (i. e. visual clues, corpus statis-tics and available <b>descriptions)</b> simultaneously, and is capable of constructing novel <b>descriptions.</b> Our ap-proach works on syntactically and linguistically moti-vated phrases extracted from the human <b>descriptions.</b> Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our formu-lation mostly generates lucid and semantically correct <b>descriptions,</b> and significantly outperforms the previous methods on automatic evaluation metrics. One of the significant advantages of our approach is that we can generate multiple interesting <b>descriptions</b> for an image. Unlike any previous work, we also test the applicabil-ity of our method on a large dataset containing complex images with rich <b>descriptions...</b>|$|R
40|$|Scientific, {{and more}} {{specifically}} empirical observations, are incapable of deriving a cohesive moral theory based solely on those distinctions. What we find in the ethical world is far more complex than any one series of observations and scientific theories which could establish or break down existing moral theory.

The thesis of this paper is, then, no scientific <b>descriptions</b> are <b>descriptions</b> {{that are able to}} tell us how things ought to be. A valid standard form categorical syllogism can be formulated to demonstrate how this conclusion is arrived at by logical necessity.

40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been an {{increased}} interest in generating Referring Expressions (GRE) that are tailored {{to the needs of the}} addressee (e. g. van der Sluis & Krahmer, 2005; Paraboni et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2006 [KRvD 06]).

5|$|The {{demand for}} {{consistency}} between a quantum <b>description</b> {{of matter and}} a geometric <b>description</b> of spacetime, {{as well as the}} appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate <b>description</b> of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics.

5|$|The first {{appearance}} {{of this species}} in the literature was in 1890, under the name Colus fusiformis, when Eduard Fischer wrote a <b>description</b> based on a painting he found in the Paris Museum of Natural History. In his 1944 monograph on the Gasteromycetes of Australia and New Zealand, Gordon Herriot Cunningham considered this naming to be a nomen nudum—not published with an adequate <b>description.</b> However, it was valid under {{the rules of the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. In 1899 Penzig described the species Colus javanicus based on a single specimen found on Java, and a year later Fischer amended the name of his original Colus fusiformis to Colus javanicus, as he was not satisfied with the quality of his original <b>description.</b> Despite his doubts on the validity of his <b>description,</b> his original naming is both legitimate and has priority over C.javanicus.|$|E
40|$|Theories of <b>descriptions</b> tend {{to involve}} {{commitments}} about {{the ambiguity of}} <b>descriptions.</b> For example, sentences containing <b>descriptions</b> are widely taken to be ambiguous between de re, de dicto, and intermediate interpretations and are sometimes thought to be ambiguous between the former and directly referential interpretations.

On the other hand, I argue that <b>descriptions</b> are ambiguous between the above family of interpretations and what may be called 'institutional' as well as generic interpretations. My arguments suggest that an adequate theory of <b>descriptions</b> may require considerable rethinking. Most contemporary theories of <b>descriptions</b> appear to be committed to one or more claims about the ambiguity of <b>descriptions</b> that I reject in this paper.
