(2009). {{and more}} recently Environmental Tracking 3.0 (2011). The original book proposed the concept of Environmental Tracking, which envisaged using {{the power of the}} stock market, primarily through index funds, as a means to incentivise companies to reduce their emissions. In the book Gill proposed the creation of an Environmental Scoring Panel (ESP), which would evaluate companies based on a range of environmental criteria. This environmental scoring would then be used to weight companies within an index. With the emergence of climate change as the overriding concern of the 21st century, however, the concept was refined to focus specifically on corporate greenhouse gas emissions. This was also facilitated by improved rates of corporate <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> as witnessed by response rates to the Carbon Disclosure Project's annual questionnaires to the world's largest companies, which asks them to provide data on their emissions.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to seek to shed light on the {{practice}} of incomplete corporate disclosure of quantitative Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and investigates whether external stakeholder pressure influences the existence, and separately, the completeness of voluntary GHG emissions disclosures by 431 European companies. Design/methodology/approach – A classification of reporting completeness is developed with respect to the scope, type and reporting boundary of GHG emissions based on the guidelines of the GHG Protocol, Global Reporting Initiative and the Carbon Disclosure Project. Logistic regression analysis is applied to examine whether proxies for exposure to climate change concerns from different stakeholder groups influence the existence and/or completeness of quantitative GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Findings – From 2005 to 2009, on average only 15 percent of companies that disclose GHG emissions report them in a manner that the authors consider complete. Results of regression analyses suggest that external stakeholder pressure is a determinant of the existence but not the completeness of <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Findings are consistent with stakeholder theory arguments that companies respond to external stakeholder pressure to report GHG emissions, but also with legitimacy theory claims that firms can use carbon disclosure, in this case the incomplete reporting of emissions, as a symbolic act to address legitimacy exposures. Practical implications – Bringing corporate GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> in line with recommended guidelines will require either more direct stakeholder pressure or, perhaps, a mandated disclosure regime. In the meantime, users of the data will need to carefully consider the relevance of the reported data and develop the necessary competencies to detect and control for its incompleteness. A more troubling concern is that stakeholders may instead grow to accept less than complete disclosure. Originality/value – The paper represents the first large-scale empirical study into the completeness of companies’ disclosure of quantitative GHG emissions and is the first to analyze these disclosures in the context of stakeholder pressure and its relation to legitimation...|$|E

Central to the Government 2 ̆ 7 s strategy is the proposed emissions trading scheme (AETS) now mooted to begin in 2011. Credible, transparent and efficient information is necessary to inform such a market, hence the National Greenhouse and Energy Act 2007 requires annual mandatory corporate reporting of GHG emissions from 1 July 2008. This study examines GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices of Australian companies {{as well as their}} motivations to voluntarily report emissions before mandatory reporting, from a legitimacy perspective. A logit regression is used to analyse the link between voluntary GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> (VEmD) and: the existence of an environmental management system (EMS); presence of an environment committee; CEO membership of the environment committee; firm size and industry category of 271 ASX 300 firms. The findings reveal that firms with an EMS in place are more likely to disclose discretionary GHG emissions data. Firms that have certified their EMS (ISO 14001) are more inclined to voluntarily disclose GHG emissions information than firms without a certified EMS. Energy and mining firms demonstrate a higher propensity to disclose GHG emissions information than other industries. Firm size was also positively related to VEmD.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the capital market impact of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures.</b> The effect of assurance of these disclosures, {{the type of}} assurance provider and GHG management performance is also examined. The sample consists of 2, 734 firm-year observations covering the period 2006 - 2010 across 33 countries. A modified Ohlson (1995) model is applied to capture the effect on market value while the cost of equity capital analysis uses an average of measures used in prior literature (Hail and Leuz, 2006). After controlling for selection bias, this thesis finds {{a negative effect on}} market value for GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> and that this effect is moderated if the emissions are assured, particularly when this assurance is provided by the accounting profession. Moreover, the negative effect is also moderated for firms that manage their GHG emissions, although no effect is found for firms that attain higher GHG management performance. A positive relationship is observed for the cost of equity capital, with this adverse effect reduced for firms that attain higher GHG management performance. This suggests that although investors view GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> to be value reducing, firms are able to minimise such effects through obtaining assurance, and specifically from the accounting profession, as well as through GHG emissions management. This thesis contributes to the scant literature on the market value and cost of equity capital impact of GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures.</b> It also contributes to the literature addressing the capital market impact of voluntary assurance and voluntary management of environmental risks. The findings of this thesis have implications for a number of stakeholders. Given that GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> are informative to investors, analysts should consider such non-financial information when making stock recommendations. Further, firms have an opportunity to reduce the negative impact on market value that results from disclosing GHG emissions through managing and assuring these emissions, and also by hiring higher quality assurers. In addition, regulators or policy makers across the world may find these findings useful as they deliberately embrace the recent trend of regulatory requirements to disclose GHG emissions in countries such as Australia, U.

40|$|While carbon {{emissions}} have received mounting attention from regulators, academics and practitioners {{for the past}} two decades, {{little is known about the}} current reporting and assurance practices in this area. More recently, there has been a growth in studies related to carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures.</b> Although disclosures are the first step towards carbon <b>emissions</b> reduction, these <b>disclosures</b> would be less meaningful if they lacked a certain degree of credibility. This is where the assurance on carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> plays an indispensible role. However, few studies have examined the assurance practice specifically on {{carbon emissions}}. This thesis fills in the gap by providing an international comparison of the determinants underlying the decision to purchase assurance on carbon emissions as well as the factors associated with the choice between accounting firm providers and other providers of such assurance. Building on legitimacy theory, stakeholder theory and institutional theory, it is expected that certain country, industry and company specific characteristics will have an impact on companies&# 145; decisions to adopt the assurance services on their carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures.</b> It is also expected that those characteristics will have a similar effect on companies&# 145; choice of assurance providers, which in this thesis have been classified into two types, i. e. accounting firm providers and other providers. To identify those characteristics, this thesis examines the carbon assurance practices for 3008 companies across 47 countries between 2006 and 2008 as included in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) databases 2007 to 2009. CDP is an independent not-for-profit organization that collects carbon emissions data by sending out questionnaires to the world&# 145;s largest companies. To promote the consistency and comparability among the responses of responding companies, a detailed examination of the responses to CDP by participating companies was performed to retrieve information about the nature of the assurance services including: Whether the assurance was purchased in response to regulatory requirements or was it voluntary? And whether the assurance services were at the corporate level or facility level? Further information was also hand collected from the assurance statements of responding companies including: the type of assurance providers, i. e. accounting firm providers and other providers; the subject matters included in the assurance services, i. e. sustainability as a whole or carbon emissions specifically; the report containing the assurance statements, i. e. sustainability reports or annual reports or carbon emissions reports; the level of the assurance provided, i. e. limited or reasonable, and also the assurance standards used to carry out the assurance services, i. e. ISAE 3000 or AA 1000 or others. Results indicate that the assurance decisions exhibit a strong country and industry pattern, with companies from stakeholder oriented countries and environmentally sensitive industries such as &# 8213;Energy&# 8214; and &# 8213;Materials&# 8214; more inclined to purchase the assurance services on their carbon emissions. At the same time, company level characteristics such as internal control and corporate governance were found to be important in the assurance decisions, with companies having certain forms of internal control on their carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> and those having a board responsible for the climate change issues more likely to have their carbon <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> assured. In relation to the choice of assurance provider decisions, country and industry characteristics were found to have an impact on the decision, with companies domiciled in stakeholder oriented countries and companies from environmentally sensitive industries more likely to select accounting firm providers than other providers. However, company level characteristics were not found to be highly correlated with the choice of assurance providers. These results indicate that the choice of assurance provider is mostly determined by country and industry factors rather than company specific factors. Future research could explore whether additional company level factors not examined in this thesis are associated with companies&# 145; choice over different assurance providers...|$|R

Various targets are set by governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the South African Government is, among others, investigating a carbon tax policy to facilitate their transition to a greener economy. As the global manufacturing industry emits up to 43 percent of the global CO 2 emissions, it is evident that the companies in this industry are expected to {{play a significant role in}} reducing greenhouse gas emissions going forward. What gets measured, gets managed, and formal institutions and regulatory establishments, such as, but not limited to, the Global Reporting Initiative, Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Carbon Disclosure Project provide recommendations and guidelines for companies regarding <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> in their sustainability reports as well as how to account for emissions inventories. During this research, the integrated and sustainability reports of the top ten manufacturing companies listed on the JSE were reviewed and the disclosures of emissions were evaluated against a checklist that was developed through a literature review comprising various sources. From the results of the research, it is evident that all the companies reviewed are aware of the importance of <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> and the impact that emissions have on climate change. All the companies reviewed did participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project in 2013, and all the companies make use of some formal document as guideline for their emissions reporting. Companies, in general, adhere more to the qualitative, narrative type of requirements than to the more computable, performance-related reporting of emissions. It is recommended for the top manufacturing companies to improve on the emissions performance reporting. As a very limited sample was selected for this research, and no comparison periods were reviewed to measure the level of improvement of the emissions reporting, it is recommended for future research to focus on emissions performance reporting measured over a period of time to identify an improvement in emissions reporting of the top manufacturing companies.

This result implies that even if attention is focused entirely on those sectors with the greatest influence on the supply chain in terms of monetary value, this is unlikely to result in effective emissions reduction. After all, to properly manage supply chains, the GHG-inducing structure should be thoroughly tackled as well as monetary aspects. Opportunities to decarbonize the supply chain should be sought from both perspectives.

Findings indicate that corporate disclosures of quantitative GHG emissions and, to a lesser extent, carbon performance are value relevant.

We regress portfolios on Carhart (1997) four factor models extended for industry effects over the years 2005 to 2009. Results show that investors achieved abnormal risk-adjusted returns of up to 13. 05 % annually by exploiting inefficiently priced positive effects of (complete) GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> and good corporate climate change performance in terms of GHG efficiency. Results imply that, firstly, information costs involved in carbon disclosure and management do not present a burden on corporate financial resources. Secondly, investors should not neglect carbon disclosure and performance when making investment decisions. Thirdly, during the period analysed financial markets were inefficient in pricing publicly available information on carbon disclosure and performance.

At its December 2007 meeting, the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board (hereafter, IAASB) approved a project to consider the development of such a standard aimed at promoting trust and confidence in <b>disclosures</b> of GHG <b>emissions,</b> including <b>disclosures</b> required under <b>emissions</b> trading schemes. The authors assess the types of disclosures that can be assured, and outline the issues involved in developing an international assurance standard on GHG <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures.</b> The discussion synthesizes the insights gained from four international roundtables on the proposed IAASB assurance standard held in Asia-Pacific, North America, and Europe during 2008, and an IAASB meeting addressing this topic in December 2008...|$|R

40|$|A new Norwegian {{electricity}} directive {{that will}} take effect in 2007 will mandate the compliance of Norwegian electricity utilities with the European Unions EL Directive (2003 / 54 /EC, par 6). The EU Directive states that all electricity suppliers {{will be required to}} provide their customers with ‘power disclosure’ information on the fuel mix and emissions resulting from energy generation. The USA has a decade of experience with the implementation of power disclosure information. The experiences in the USA form a valuable source of insights and information on {{the pros and cons of}} various forms for power disclosure. These insights serve as a source for further testing in Norway and as a resource on which Norwegian authorities and energy suppliers can draw in their further development of guidelines and compliance schemes. In this report, the US experiences with power and <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> are reviewed and their relevance for Norway discussed. Emphasis is given to the ways that information has been provided to customers, such as whether information should be provided on the energy bill or as a billing insert; whether a graphical or tabular presentation of the information should be used; whether and how to provide a basis of comparison of a given suppliers power mix with that of others. Recommendations are made as to how Norwegian suppliers can best achieve an effective and consumer friendly format for power disclosure information...|$|E
40|$|Parties {{frequently}} seek {{exemption from}} regulation {{on the ground}} that they contribute only a very small share to a problem. These one percent arguments are not inherently questionable; it can be efficient to exclude relatively small contributors. These arguments for exemption garner broad acceptance in part because they appeal to behavioral biases that induce individuals to discount or ignore small values. But when a regulatory problem can be solved only by regulating small contributors, accepting one percent arguments creates what we call the one percent problem. This Article shows that this general problem for regulation has particularly damaging effects on climate change policy: The global character of the climate change problem renders many sources of carbon emissions candidates for one percent arguments, but the climate problem cannot be solved without attention to these sources. This Article then isolates a gap in U. S. climate policy that is critical to addressing the one percent problem for climate. Unlike many other bodies, Congress currently legislates and appropriates without calculating the emissions consequences of its actions or adhering to an emissions budget. Both are necessary. Congress has long responded to one percent problems in managing the federal budget with disclosure and offsetting requirements. Requiring Congress to disclose the carbon emissions of legislation treats carbon costs on par with financial costs, and brings Congress’s <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> duties in line with those that already apply to federal agencies and many industrial sources. Adopting a budgeting pre-commitment strategy of last resort - a carbon pay-as-you-go rule - directly confronts the analytic slippage exploited by one percent arguments...|$|E
40|$|Corporate carbon {{footprint}} data has become ubiquitous. This data is also highly promissory. But as this paper argues, such data fails both consumers and citizens. The governance {{of climate change}} seemingly requires a strong foundation of data on emission sources. Economists approach climate change as a market failure, where the optimisation of the atmosphere is to be evidence based and data driven. Citizens or consumers, state or private agents of control, all require deep access to information to judge emission realities. Whether {{we are interested in}} state-led or in neoliberal ‘solutions’ for either democratic participatory decision-making or for preventing market failure, companies’ emissions need to be known. This paper draws on 20 months of ethnographic fieldwork in a Fortune 50 company’s environmental accounting unit to show how carbon reporting interferes with information symmetry requirements, which further troubles possibilities for contesting data. A material-semiotic analysis of the data practices and infrastructures employed in the context of corporate <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosure</b> details the situated political economies of data labour along the data processing chain. The explicit consideration of how information asymmetries are socially and computationally shaped, how contexts are shifted and how data is systematically straightened out informs a reflexive engagement with Big Data. The paper argues that attempts to automatise environmental accounting’s veracity management by means of computing metadata or to ensure that data quality meets requirements through third-party control are not satisfactory. The crossover of Big Data with corporate environmental governance does not promise to trouble the political economy that hitherto sustained unsustainability...|$|E

We examine the research problem in Australia in a period when no requirements existed for listed companies to appoint female directors or to report GHG emissions. This environment allows us to examine the association between women on boards and GHG <b>emissions</b> related <b>disclosure</b> in annual and sustainability reports in a voluntary setting. We find that companies with multiple female directors make GHG <b>emissions</b> related <b>disclosures</b> that are of higher quality...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} issue of {{corporate}} (voluntary) <b>emissions</b> <b>disclosures</b> in Australia during the period 2003 / 04 through 2009 / 10. This seven year period covered {{significant changes in the}} emissions-related social and political environment, including a change in Australian government, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by Australia, the introduction of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007, and a proposed Australian Emissions Trading Scheme (including carbon pricing). A multi-theoretical accounting model is used to explain the disclosures as a transitioning of two political economy theories: Legitimacy and Stakeholder theories. Both theories have been widely used in accounting research for examining the communication between an entity and society in general (Legitimacy Theory) or with certain stakeholders (Managerial Stakeholder Theory). ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This study aims {{to report}} the extent of {{voluntary}} carbon <b>emission</b> <b>disclosures</b> by major Australian companies during the years 2006 to 2008. This paper provides contemporary data and explanations about carbon emissions reporting in Australia. Additionally, the paper aims to determine the variables that explain the extent of carbon disclosures. Design/methodology/approach: The carbon disclosure score is measured directly from individual companies' annual reports and sustainability reports. A checklist is established to determine the {{breadth and depth of}} the information related to climate change and carbon emissions incorporated in these publicly available reports. Findings: The overall carbon disclosure score has increased significantly over the authors' research period. Furthermore, regression results show that larger firms with higher visibility tend to make more comprehensive carbon disclosures. Overall, the authors' results indicate that the legislation of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (the NGER Act) in 2007 may have enhanced the voluntary carbon <b>emission</b> <b>disclosures</b> in 2008, even though the NGER Act was not operative until the 2009 financial year. From a theoretical perspective, the findings of the paper are consistent with legitimacy theory. Originality/value: Previous studies examining environmental disclosures in Australia are based on a time period prior to widespread public discussion and interest in climate change and carbon emissions. By investigating voluntary disclosures made by large Australian companies around the time that the mandatory emission reporting scheme was introduced, this paper investigates whether the prominence of discussion and impending operation of the mandatory environmental disclosures have led to a greater extent of voluntary carbon disclosures. The findings can help regulators draft appropriate legislation that targets industries and specific practices where disclosure is of greatest importance to relevant stakeholders. In addition, an understanding of who and why entities disclose carbon gas emission information can arm green groups and other stakeholders with an appropriate level of understanding about the motivation for such disclosures...|$|R
