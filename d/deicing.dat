5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain stormwater discharge permits and ensure that wastes from <b>deicing</b> operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft <b>deicing</b> fluid after <b>deicing.</b> Airports that discharge the collected aircraft <b>deicing</b> fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft <b>deicing</b> in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E
5|$|After the <b>deicing</b> {{truck was}} repaired, the pilot {{requested}} a second <b>deicing,</b> though {{the flight crew}} did not perform a walkaround of their airplane, and USAir procedures did not require them to do so. Following the second <b>deicing,</b> LaGuardia ground control granted Flight 405 permission to taxi to Runway 13. The flight crew completed the pre-flight checklist during the taxi.|$|E
5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to <b>deicing.</b> It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II <b>deicing</b> fluid rather than Type I, <b>deicing</b> trucks near the runway {{rather than at the}} gate, and that the crew should inspect their wings not only from the cockpit, but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry’s sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations.|$|E
40|$|The Iowa Department of Transportation Materials Laboratory {{personnel}} {{developed a}} process to produce a road <b>deicer</b> consisting of sand grains coated with calcium magnesium acetate (CMA). Research project HR- 253 was established to explore commercial production of the CMA/sand <b>deicer</b> by an independent contractor. About 60 tons of the <b>deicer</b> was produced at a ready-mix concrete facility and evaluated in the field during the 1983 - 1984 winter season. The initial contracted production of CMA/sand <b>deicer</b> under research project HR- 253 identified two major problems: (1) excessive unreacted lime in the final product, and (2) formation of spherical lumps within the product requiring subsequent size reduction. It was recommended in the HR- 253 report that additional <b>deicer</b> be produced as {{a continuation of the}} project in order to address these problems and further develop the production process.

5|$|In {{the years}} that {{followed}} the accident, airlines started using Type IV <b>deicing</b> fluid, which is more effective than both Type I and Type II fluids. Type IV fluids stick to aircraft for up to two hours. Chicago O'Hare International Airport was the first to introduce <b>deicing</b> facilities at the runway, something which has now become commonplace.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{also found}} that the <b>deicing</b> {{procedures}} at LaGuardia were substandard. While the jet encountered a delay of up to 35 minutes, they found that the <b>deicing</b> fluid that was being used at the airport, and by the majority of commercial airlines across the United States, was effective for only fifteen minutes. The accident led to a number of studies into the effect that ice has on aircraft, and several recommendations into prevention techniques.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that discussions over different types of <b>deicing</b> fluid were discussed, along with different <b>deicing</b> equipment and techniques. They {{also found that the}} pilot in command was the ultimate authority for take off decisions, but that all operators had to provide proper training and criteria for the pilot in command to base a proper decision on.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Influence of glycol, {{which is}} the main {{composition}} {{of the most frequently}} used aircraft dicer, on the freeze-thaw durability of Portland cement concrete were investigated. Freeze-thaw durability of Portland cement concrete was tested by accelerated freeze-thaw test. Four kinds of solutions, namely tap water, 3. 5 % NaCl solution, glycol solutions and a LBR-A type commercial aircraft <b>deicer</b> were employed to be the freezing-thawing mediums. Results show that freeze-thaw durability of concrete exposed to glycol solutions is closely related to the solution concentrations. Failure of concretes exposed to 3. 5 % glycol solution {{is similar to that of}} those exposed 3. 5 % NaCl solution, which are attributed to serious surface scaling. While damage of concrete exposed to 12. 5 % and 25 % glycol solutions are postponed, and the durability of concrete are increased. Compared with glycol solution, the commercial aircraft <b>deicer</b> demonstrated much more negative effect to concrete freeze-thaw durability, and the degree even exceeds 3. 5 % NaCl solution. Consequently, the commercial aircraft <b>deicer</b> is not a kind of environmental friendly <b>deicer</b> as usually considered...|$|R

5|$|The conference {{concluded}} with {{an amendment to}} FAA regulations which air carriers operated under. The new regulations stated that airlines should put in place FAA-approved ground <b>deicing</b> or anti-icing procedures anytime weather conditions of ice, snow or frost prevailed.

5|$|The Port of Portland began {{efforts in}} 1997 {{to reduce the}} flow of {{aircraft}} <b>deicing</b> chemicals from the airport into the waterway, though it still diverted concentrated chemicals (mostly glycol) directly into the slough during rare times of reservoir overflow.

5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport {{was used as a}} pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 19467–48. While there were initially many customers, the lack of sufficient <b>deicing</b> caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season. The route was not reopened the following year.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft {{themselves}} {{now have}} more sophisticated <b>deicing</b> systems {{that can be}} used on the ground and in the air. Many modern civil fixed wing transport aircraft, for example the Boeing 737, use anti-ice systems on the leading edge of wings, engine inlets and air data probes using warm air. This is bled from engines and is ducted into a cavity beneath the surface to be anti-iced. The warm air heats the surface up to a few degrees above freezing, preventing ice from forming. The system may operate autonomously, switching on and off as the aircraft enters and leaves icing conditions.|$|E
5|$|In November, Color Air {{changed the}} {{conditions}} tied to purchase of tickets. Reduced price tickets were only available seven days or more before departure, and only full-price tickets could be refunded. At the same time, the maximum price increased to NOK870, though all ticket prices were changed {{to include all}} taxes, after requirements from the authorities. A new, cheapest ticket was introduced at NOK345, including taxes. After the winter settled, the front between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens' denying Color Air to use their <b>deicing</b> equipment at Ålesund, resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} question is: What role does newly-formed expansive mineral growth {{play in the}} premature {{deterioration of}} concrete? These minerals (ettringite and brucite) are formed in cement paste {{as a result of}} chemical reactions involving cement and coarse/fine aggregate. Petrographic observations and SEM/EDAX analysis were conducted in order to determine chemical and mineralogical changes in the aggregate and cement paste of samples taken from Iowa concrete highways that showed premature deterioration. Mechanisms involved in deterioration were investigated. A second objective was to investigate whether <b>deicer</b> solutions exacerbate the formation of expansive minerals and concrete deterioration. Magnesium in <b>deicer</b> solutions causes the most severe paste deterioration by forming non-cementitious magnesium silicate hydrate and brucite. Chloride in <b>deicer</b> solutions promotes decalcification of paste and alters ettringite to chloroaluminate. Calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) and magnesium acetate (Mg-acetate) produce the most deleterious effects on concrete, with calcium acetate (Ca-acetate) being much less severe...|$|R

5|$|Properly {{equipped}} {{aircraft are}} able to fly through snowstorms under Instrument Flight Rules. Prior to takeoff, during snowstorms they require <b>deicing</b> fluid to prevent accumulation and freezing of snow and other precipitation on wings and fuselages, which may compromise {{the safety of the}} aircraft and its occupants. In flight, aircraft rely on a variety of mechanisms to avoid rime and other types of icing in clouds, these include pulsing pneumatic boots, electro-thermal areas that generate heat, and fluid deicers that bleed onto the surface.|$|E
5|$|Aircraft <b>deicing</b> {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|In November 1998, Color Air {{introduced}} a new cheapest ticket for NOK345. After the winter settled, the ice front between Color Air and Braathens grew colder following Braathens' denying Color Air to use their <b>deicing</b> equipment at Ålesund, resulting in the plane being stuck at the airport. By the end of 1998, {{it became clear that}} Braathens had increased capacity with 20%, but only achieved a 5.2% ridership increase after the opening of Gardermoen. Similar numbers were applicable for SAS. The business market, in particular the large corporations with divisions in several cities, were demanding high frequencies on the routes. Color Air could get by with fewer departures, because they mainly targeted the leisure segment. In particular, the routes from Oslo to Ålesund and Kristiansand had a very low seat utilization; to Ålesund there were 1.2 million flown seats annually, but only 345,000 passengers, giving a 29% cabin load.|$|E
40|$|The {{deleterious}} effects of deicers on concrete pavements and bridges have concerned concrete researchers for several decades. The present study experimentally investigates {{the effects of}} different deicers on concrete deterioration. Laboratory simulations of environmental conditions (wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycling) were conducted on highway concrete samples with various <b>deicer</b> chemicals (NaCl, CaCl 2, MgCl 2, calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) of 5 different Ca/Mg ratios, Ca-acetate, and Mg-acetate). Each <b>deicer</b> produced characteristic effects on the concrete samples by physically and chemically altering the dolomite coarse aggregate, the dolomite coarse aggregate-paste interface, and cement paste. Chloride solutions commonly promoted decalcification of paste and altered ettringite to chloroaluminate. Magnesium-bearing <b>deicer</b> solutions (e. g., CMA, Mg-acetate and MgCl 2) caused severe paste deterioration by forming brucite and non-cementitious magnesium silicate hydrate. For acetate solutions, the effects caused by Ca-acetate on concrete deterioration was much less severe than those caused by Mg-bearing acetates. For the experimental conditions utilized herein, NaCl solution was the least deleterious to the cement paste and aggregate.

5|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} lifting off at sunrise in Japan, the men {{began to see}} the sun rise again over the Yukon—it was a very short day for them, and none had been able to sleep for the {{excitement}} of the trip, the stimulant benzedrine, and the penetrating cold. Crossing into Canada, the headwinds grew stronger still, and a load of hard rime ice and clear ice was visible on the wings. Though the B-29s had been delivered to the war front complete with <b>deicing</b> equipment, such gear had been removed months before to reduce weight and therefore increase combat range and speed. The ice load picked up in the night would have to be endured until it melted off at lower altitudes.|$|E
5|$|The {{subsequent}} investigation {{revealed that}} due to pilot error, inadequate <b>deicing</b> procedures at LaGuardia, and several lengthy delays, {{a large amount of}} ice had accumulated on the wings and airframe. This ice disrupted airflow over the jet, increasing drag and reducing lift, which prevented the jet from lifting off the runway.The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) concluded that the flight crew were unaware of the amount of ice that had built up after the jet was delayed by heavy ground traffic taxiing to the runway. The report also listed the fact that the aircraft had begun its takeoff rotation too early at a lower speed than was standard as a contributing factor to the accident.|$|E
