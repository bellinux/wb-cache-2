This set of symptoms {{was not given}} a name until 30 years later, when the nephrologist Oliver Wrong more fully described the disease.Wrong had studied with Dent and chose to name the disease after his mentor. Dent's disease is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the gene CLCN5, which encodes a kidney-specific voltage-gated chloride channel, a 746-amino-acid protein (CLC-5) with 12 to 13 transmembrane domains. It manifests itself through low-molecular-weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, aminoaciduria and <b>hypophosphataemia.</b> Because of its rather rare occurrence, Dent's disease is often diagnosed as idiopathic hypercalciuria, i.e., excess calcium in urine with undetermined causes.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate or 2,3-BPG (formerly named 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or 2,3-DPG, {{which is}} now {{considered}} obsolete and incorrect) is an organophosphate formed in erythrocytes during glycolysis and is the conjugate base of 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid. The production of 2,3-BPG is likely an important adaptive mechanism, because the production increases for several conditions {{in the presence of}} diminished peripheral tissue O2 availability, such as hypoxaemia, chronic lung disease, anaemia, and congestive heart failure, among others. High levels of 2,3-BPG shift the curve to the right (as in childhood), while low levels of 2,3-BPG cause a leftward shift, seen in states such as septic shock, and <b>hypophosphataemia.</b> In the absence of 2,3-BPG, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases. 2,3-BPG acts as a heteroallosteric effector of hemoglobin, lowering hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by binding preferentially to deoxyhemoglobin. An increased concentration of BPG in red blood cells favours formation of the T, low-affinity state of hemoglobin and so the oxygen-binding curve will shift to the right.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{identify}} {{risk factors}} for development of <b>hypophosphataemia</b> in patients treated with two different intensities of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) and to assess the independent association of <b>hypophosphataemia</b> with major clinical outcomes. Materials and methods: We performed secondary analysis of data collected from 1441 patients during a large, multicentre randomised controlled trial of CRRT intensity. We allocated patients to two different intensities of CRRT (25 mL/kg/hour vs 40 mL/kg/hour of effluent generation) and obtained daily measurement of serum phosphate levels. Results: We obtained 14 115 phosphate measurements and identified 462 patients (32. 1 %) with <b>hypophosphataemia,</b> with peak incidence on Day 2 and Day 3. With lower intensity CRRT, there were 58 episodes of hypophosphataemia/ 1000 patient days, compared with 112 episodes/ 1000 patient days with higher intensity CRRT (P < 0. 001). On multivariable logistic regression analysis, higher intensity CRRT, female sex, higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score and hypokalaemia were independently {{associated with an increased}} odds ratio (OR) for <b>hypophosphataemia.</b> On multivariable models, <b>hypophosphataemia</b> was associated with better clinical outcomes, but when analysis was confined to patients alive at 96 hours, <b>hypophosphataemia</b> was not independently associated with clinical outcomes. Conclusions: <b>Hypophosphataemia</b> is common during CRRT and its incidence increases with greater CRRT intensity. <b>Hypophosphataemia</b> is not a robust independent predictor of mortality.

40|$|OBJECTIVE - To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} parenteral nutrition on plasma phosphate levels and to evaluate the incidence of refeeding <b>hypophosphataemia.</b> SUBJECTS AND SETTING - 250 adult patients started consecutively on parenteral nutrition (PN) were monitored at The Royal Surrey County Hospital, a 530 -bed, non-teaching, secondary care trust incorporating medical and surgical care, paediatrics, intensive care, maternity services and a regional cancer centre. DESIGN - Data on plasma levels of magnesium and phosphate, relevant interventions performed and nutrition outcomes was collated by the Trust Nutrition Support Team. RESULTS - 36 patients (15 per cent) were found to be hypophosphataemic before commencing PN. 86 patients (34. 4 per cent) developed refeeding <b>hypophosphataemia</b> within seven days after commencing PN. It was considered severe (less than 0. 5 mmol/L phosphate) in 10. 8 per cent.

40|$|Introduction Refeeding {{syndrome}} {{has been}} recognised for {{over half a}} century as a phenomenon that afflicts severely malnourished patients. It has been the cause of significant morbidity and mortality largely through cardiac and neurological manifestations of <b>hypophosphataemia.</b> Though it is well documented in certain populations, refeeding <b>hypophosphataemia</b> may be overlooked and under-diagnosed in hospital inpatients on parenteral nutrition. This could be {{because of a lack}} of appropriate biochemical monitoring and an assumption that 'modem' parenteral nutrition regimens contain optimal proportions of minerals and other nutrients to prevent <b>hypophosphataemia</b> It was important to find out who was at risk and what rates of feeding and phosphate infusion are required in parenterally fed patients. Guidelines for staff involved with monitoring and caring for those at risk receiving parenteral nutrition were needed. Method. A cohort of all patients started on total parenteral nutrition was prospectively recruitedÃ‚Â· between November 2002 and May 2005. Serial serum phosphate levels, and details on otherÃ‚Â· biochemistry, dietary and medicines intake were collated. Patients in the cohort who developed moderate or severe refeeding <b>hypophosphataemia</b> (a fall in serum phosphate to 0. 65 mmol/litre or less) were recruited as cases and matched for age with controls who did not Paired cases and controls were examined to see whether any attributes or risk factors for <b>hypophosphataemia</b> could be identified. Logistic regression to arialyse the effect ofmultiple potential risk factor variables was perfonned.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: <b>Hypophosphataemia</b> {{is common}} in HIV-positive patients, in {{particular}} in those using tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF). Its pathogenesis is not well understood. The importance of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF- 23), the most potent phosphaturic hormone known today, has not been studied in these patients. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate whether FGF- 23 might be involved in the aetiology of <b>hypophosphataemia</b> in HIV-positive patients on tenofovir. METHODS: Calcium and phosphate metabolism was studied in 36 HIV-positive patients on TDF. <b>Hypophosphataemia</b> was defined as a serum phosphate level< 0. 75 mmol/L. RESULTS: Fifteen patients (42 %) had <b>hypophosphataemia</b> (group 1), and 21 had a normal serum phosphate level (group 2). The renal phosphate reabsorption threshold [tubular maximum phosphate reabsorption per glomerular filtration rate (TmP/gfr) ] was significantly lower in group 1 than in group 2 (0. 58 +/- 0. 04 vs. 0. 91 +/- 0. 03 mmol/L, respectively; P< 0. 0001). The serum phosphate concentration was strongly correlated with TmP/gfr (R= 0. 71; P< 0. 0001). Both groups had normal serum FGF- 23 levels, and serum phosphate and TmP/gfr were not related to serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) or FGF- 23 levels. CONCLUSION: FGF- 23 is not involved in the pathogenesis of <b>hypophosphataemia</b> in HIV-positive patients on TDF. The data suggest that a PTH-like factor may be involved...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the most common causes of <b>hypophosphataemia</b> (≤ 0. 5 mmol/l) in a hospital population in order to identify patient groups at risk of developing the condition. Methods: The study was conducted at Tygerberg Hospital, a tertiary care centre in the Western Cape, South Africa. All patients identified with a phosphate level ≤ 0. 5 mmol/l during an 18 -month period were included in the study. Medical records of these patients were reviewed. Results: Of all the requests received for serum phosphate determination by the laboratory, 2 % (861 out of 45 394 requests) were ≤ 0. 5 mmol/l. Thirty per cent (30 %; n = 189) of the patients in the study population died during their hospital stay. Most (45 %; n = 278) of the patients with low phosphate levels occurred in an intensive care setting, whereas 10 % (n = 63) were most likely due to refeeding, and 6 % (n = 35) had neoplastic disease.

She had a novel mutation in her phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome and had an unusual degree of dependence on phosphate supplementation. Prior to operative intervention she had a trial of cinacalcet that improved bone turnover markers when used in isolation but which led to a paradoxical rise in parathyroid hormone levels when given with phosphate supplementation. After correction of hungry bone syndrome, the renal phosphorus threshold normalised as a manifestation of hypoparathyroid state despite marked elevation in level of fibroblast growth factor 23.

40|$|Background. Matrix {{extracellular}} phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE), first {{isolated from}} tumour-derived tissue {{from a patient}} with oncogenic <b>hypophosphataemia,</b> is a putative phosphatonin that has received much less attention than fibroblast growth factor- 23. To date, its effect on renal tubular phosphate reabsorption remains undefined. Methods. A renal clearance study was performed in anaesthetized rats infused intravenously {{with a range of}} doses of MEPE. Results. MEPE had no effect on glomerular filtration rate (inulin clearance) but caused rapid, dose-dependent increases in absolute and fractional phosphate excretion, wholly attributable to reduced phosphate reabsorption. At a maximal dose, MEPE increased fractional phosphate excretion more than 2 -fold, whereas no change was observed in time controls. Conclusion. The results lend support to the hypothesis that MEPE contributes to the phosphaturia of oncogenic <b>hypophosphataemia</b> and of hypophospha-taemic rickets...|$|E
