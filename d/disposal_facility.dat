5|$|Recommendation #6: The roles, responsibilities, and {{authorities}} of local, state, and tribal governments (with respect to facility siting {{and other aspects}} of nuclear waste disposal) must be an element of the negotiation between {{the federal government and the}} other affected units of government in establishing a <b>disposal</b> <b>facility.</b> In addition to legally-binding agreements, as discussed in Recommendation #4, all affected levels of government (local, state, tribal, etc.) must have, at a minimum, a meaningful consultative role in all other important decisions. Additionally, states and tribes should retain—or where appropriate, be delegated—direct authority over aspects of regulation, permitting, and operations where oversight below the federal level can be exercised effectively and in a way that is helpful in protecting the interests and gaining the confidence of affected communities and citizens.|$|E

5|$|Spent {{nuclear fuel}} is the {{radioactive}} by-product of electricity generation at commercial nuclear power plants, and {{high-level radioactive waste}} is the by-product from reprocessing spent fuel to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. In 1982, the United States Congress established a national policy {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste disposal. This policy is a federal law called the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, which made the DOE responsible for finding a site, building, and operating an underground <b>disposal</b> <b>facility</b> called a geologic repository. The recommendation to use a geologic repository dates back to 1957 when the National Academy of Sciences recommended that the best means of protecting the environment and public health and safety would be to dispose of the waste in rock deep underground.|$|E

Every year, the facility collects and processed only about 60% {{of the entire}} city's waste with landfilling and recycling services. The dumpsite uses rice hull ash as daily cover and odor control material for the waste collected in the area. Lingunan Controlled Dumpsite also conducted some limited waste segregation and resource recovery operations prior to burial of residual waste. In 2006, the controlled dumpsite was closed per MMDA order in 2003 and was subsequently converted into a sanitary landfill as directed by RA 9003.|$|E
25|$|Disposal methods vary {{by country}} and locale, but common methods of {{disposal}} are either by truck service or, in the United States, by disposal of sharps through the mail. Truck service involves trained personnel collecting sharps waste, and often medical waste, {{at the point}} of generation and hauling it away by truck to a destruction facility. Similarly, the mail-back sharps disposal method allows generators to ship sharps waste to the <b>disposal</b> <b>facility</b> directly through the U.S. mail in specially designed and approved shipping containers. Mail-back sharps disposal allows waste generators to dispose of smaller amounts of sharps more economically than if they were to hire out a truck service.|$|E

In 1981 the U.S. Department of Defense sought to relocate the {{weapons to the}} Tooele Chemical Agent <b>Disposal</b> <b>Facility</b> at the Deseret Chemical Depot. This move was opposed by many residents of Utah and the state's governor at the time Scott M. Matheson. The transfer was controversial and Matheson continued to fight it until the U.S. Senate passed a bill which included an amendment sponsored by then-U.S. Senator Gary Hart (D-CO) requiring the weapons be moved out of Colorado. Matheson's concern stemmed {{from the fact that}} some of the thin-shelled Weteyes stored in Colorado were leaking nerve agent.|$|E

An incinerator was built to destroy the stockpile of Sarin, VX nerve agent, and mustard blister agent stored at the depot. Destruction of the weapons was completed in 2011. The incinerator and related operations were officially closed in May 2013, and the incinerator was disassembled and removed from the depot at the end of 2013.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Lithium-ion battery (LIB) is {{significantly}} changing {{the landscape of}} human life.

The yearly processing capacity of recycling and <b>disposal</b> <b>facilities</b> of spent LIBs on a nationwide scale were estimated to be at least 50 kilotons. The recycling and <b>disposal</b> <b>facilities</b> should be established in the southeastern coast areas of China, which generated high-density spent LIBs.

[...] At that time, Orr declared that she was not pleased with the choice, but had to acquiesce in the other states' decision. [...] U.S. Ecology, the company chosen to construct and operate the facility, considered a variety of sites in the state. [...] In January 1989, they announced that they had narrowed their choices to sites in Boyd, Nemaha, and Nuckolls counties; in January 1990, they declared that they had chosen the Boyd County location.|$|E
