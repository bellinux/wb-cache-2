5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the term neo-Lamarckism {{came to be}} {{associated}} with the position of naturalists who viewed the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> acquired characteristics as the most important evolutionary mechanism. Advocates of this position included the British writer and Darwin critic Samuel Butler, the German biologist Ernst Haeckel, and the American paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope. They considered Lamarckism to be philosophically superior to Darwin's idea of selection acting on random variation. Cope looked for, and thought he found, patterns of linear progression in the fossil record. <b>Inheritance</b> <b>of</b> acquired characteristics was part of Haeckel's recapitulation theory of evolution, which held that the embryological development of an organism repeats its evolutionary history. Critics of neo-Lamarckism, such as the German biologist August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace, pointed out that no one had ever produced solid evidence for the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> acquired characteristics. Despite these criticisms, neo-Lamarckism remained the most popular alternative to natural selection at the end of the 19th century, and would remain the position of some naturalists well into the 20th century.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a semantic model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> and investigates its {{applications for the}} analysis and design <b>of</b> programming languages. <b>Inheritance</b> is a mechanism for incremental programming {{in the presence of}} self-reference. This interpretation <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> is formalized using traditional techniques of fixed-point theory, resulting in a compositional model <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> that is directly applicable to object-oriented languages. Novel applications <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> revealed by the model are illustrated to show that inheritance has wider significance beyond object-oriented class inheritance. Constraints induced by self-reference and inheritance are investigated using type theory and yield a formal characterization of abstract classes and a demonstration that the subtype relation is a direct consequence of the basic mechanism <b>of</b> <b>inheritance.</b> The model is proven equivalent to the operational semantics <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> embodied by the interpreters of object-oriented languages like Smalltalk. Concise descriptions <b>of</b> <b>inheritance</b> behavior in several object-oriented languages, including Smalltalk, Beta, Simula, and Flavors, are presented in a common framework that facilitates direct comparison of their features...|$|R

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the <b>inheritance</b> <b>of</b> phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
