5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to the sights and sounds of war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with <b>equine</b> <b>influenza,</b> ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

The difference could be clearly demonstrated in haemagglutination inhibition tests performed with postinfection horse or ferret sera but not with hyperimmune rooster sera. Antibody responses of diseased horses were higher and more frequent against current isolates than against strain equine/Miami/ 1 / 63. Some animals also showed antibody responses to the Hong Kong variant of human influenzavirus A...|$|R
40|$|Antigenic {{variation}} {{among three}} recent isolations of equine- 2 H 3 N 8 influenza viruses from Ibadan, Nigeria is reported. Antigenic analysis with panels of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and polyclonal antisera {{indicated that the}} three viruses were antigenically divergent, although they were all H 3 N 8 subtype related to other equine 2 -viruses isolated between 1963 and 1987. Results of virus protein synthesis investigated by pulse-chase experiments showed heterogeneity among the proteins of the ribonucleoprotein complex and the haemagglutinin glycoproteins, which were not cleaved in tissue culture. The {{results of this study}} indicate that equine H 3 HAs have evolved by a process of evolutionary divergence and mutational changes, as confirmed by genetic analysis in another study. The results also showed that antigenic variation occurs among <b>equine</b> H 3 <b>influenza</b> viruses and that H 3 viruses with antigenically different HA molecules could co-circulate in equine populations.

25|$|In September 1873, the U.S. economy {{entered a}} crisis. This {{followed}} {{a period of}} post-Civil War economic over-expansion that arose from the Northern railroad boom. It came {{at the end of}} a series of economic setbacks: the Black Friday panic of 1869, the Chicago fire of 1871, the outbreak of <b>equine</b> <b>influenza</b> in 1872, and demonetization of silver in 1873.|$|E

It has been a disaster, with many not being able to bring their highly trained animals home. Many of these horses have had to be left on properties within New South Wales.|$|E
40|$|PB 1 -F 2 is an {{accessory}} protein of most human, avian, swine, <b>equine,</b> and canine <b>influenza</b> A viruses (IAVs). Although it is dispensable for virus replication and growth, it plays significant roles in pathogenesis by {{interfering with the}} host innate immune response, inducing death in immune and epithelial cells, altering inflammatory responses, and promoting secondary bacterial pneumonia. The effects of PB 1 -F 2 differ between virus strains and host species. This can at least partially {{be explained by the}} presence of multiple PB 1 -F 2 sequence variants, including premature stop codons that lead to the expression of truncated PB 1 -F 2 proteins of different lengths and specific virulence-associated residues that enhance susceptibility to bacterial superinfection. Although there has been a tendency for human seasonal IAV to gradually reduce the number of virulence-associated residues, zoonotic IAVs contain a reservoir of PB 1 -F 2 proteins with full length, virulence-associated sequences. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms by which PB 1 -F 2 may affect influenza virulence, and factors associated with the evolution and selection of this protein...|$|R
40|$|Evolution drives {{changes in}} a protein’s {{sequence}} over time. The {{extent to which these}} changes in sequence lead to shifts in the underlying preference for each amino acid at each site is an important question with implications for comparative sequence-analysis methods, such as molecular phylogenetics. To quantify the extent that site-specific amino acid pref-erences shift during evolution, we performed deep mutational scanning on two homologs of human influenza nucleo-protein with 94 % amino acid identity. We found that only a modest fraction of sites exhibited shifts in amino acid preferences that exceeded the noise in our experiments. Furthermore, even among sites that did exhibit detectable shifts, the magnitude tended to be small relative to differences between nonhomologous proteins. Given the limited change in amino acid preferences between these close homologs, we tested whether our measurements could inform site-specific substitution models that describe the evolution of nucleoproteins from more diverse influenza viruses. We found that site-specific evolutionary models informed by our experiments greatly outperformed nonsite-specific alternatives in fitting phylogenies of nucleoproteins from human, swine, <b>equine,</b> and avian <b>influenza.</b> Combining the experimental data from both homologs improved phylogenetic fit, partly because measurements in multiple genetic contexts better captured the evolutionary average of the amino acid preferences for sites with shifting preferences. Our results show that site-specific amino acid preferences are sufficiently conserved that measuring mutational effects in one protein provide...|$|R
40|$|Influenza viruses of gallinaceous {{poultry and}} wild aquatic birds usually have {{distinguishable}} receptor-binding properties. Here {{we used a}} panel of synthetic sialylglycopolymers and solid-phase receptor-binding assays to characterize receptor-binding profiles of about 70 H 7 influenza viruses isolated from aquatic birds, land-based poultry, and horses in Eurasia and America. Unlike typical duck influenza viruses with non-H 7 hemagglutinin (HA), all avian H 7 influenza viruses, irrespective of the host species, displayed a poultry-virus-like binding specificity, i. e., preferential binding to sulfated oligosaccharides Neu 5 Acα 2 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 (6 -O-HSO 3) GlcNAc and Neu 5 Acα 2 - 3 Galβ 1 - 4 (Fucα 1 - 3) (6 -O-HSO 3) GlcNAc. This phenotype correlated with the unique amino acid sequence of the amino acid 185 to 189 loop of H 7 HA {{and seemed to be}} dependent on ionic interactions between the sulfate group of the receptor and Lys 193 and on the lack of sterical clashes between the fucose residue and Gln 222. Many North American and Eurasian H 7 influenza viruses displayed weak but detectable binding to the human-type receptor moiety Neu 5 Acα 2 - 6 Galβ 1 - 4 GlcNAc, highlighting the potential of H 7 influenza viruses for avian-to-human transmission. <b>Equine</b> H 7 <b>influenza</b> viruses differed from other viruses by preferential binding to the N-glycolyl form of sialic acid. Our data suggest that the receptor-binding site of contemporary H 7 influenza viruses in aquatic and terrestrial birds was formed after the introduction of their common precursor from ducks to a new host, presumably, gallinaceous poultry. The uniformity of the receptor-binding profile of H 7 influenza viruses in various wild and domestic birds indicates that there is no strong receptor-mediated host range restriction in birds on viruses with this HA subtype. This notion agrees with repeated interspecies transmission of H 7 influenza viruses from aquatic birds to poultry...|$|R

This filly, later named La Dolce Diva, sold at auction for $1.2 million to trainer Mark Kavanagh of Melbourne. Makybe Diva had a colt on 28 August 2009 by Encosta De Lago and was covered by More Than Ready for the 2010 season, but she did not produce a foal in 2010.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 20th century women {{trainers}} were not unknown– Norah Wilmot was training horses for The Queen. But women trained in an unofficial capacity, and were forced to employ men to hold the training licence on their behalf, or to have licences in their husbands' names. Thus, beginning in 1932, the divorced Nagle employed Alfred Stickley, a licensed trainer, to work at her stables in the capacity of head lad. Mahwa, by Match III out of Media, was owned by Newton Deakin and was the first winning horse to be officially listed as trained by Nagle. [...] As late as 1975, she trained twelve horses and recommended feeding them some seaweed to provide iodine. She was also a great believer in the beneficial effects of fresh air, insisting that her horses' top stable doors were permanently left open. She was vehemently opposed to the vaccination of horses against <b>equine</b> <b>influenza,</b> and challenged a Jockey Club decision to make vaccination compulsory.
