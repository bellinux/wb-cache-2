50|$|The {{qualifying}} round {{consists of}} over 300 competitors, running {{an obstacle course}} strongly influenced by Sasuke's first stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, {{a modified version of}} the pipe slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the <b>Jumping</b> <b>Bars,</b> and a Net Climb.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe flash-lag effect {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} in which a flash adjacent to a continuously moving object is perceived to lag behind it. To test three previously proposed hypotheses (motion extrapolation, positional averaging, and differential latency), a new stimulus configuration, to which the three hypotheses give different predictions, was introduced. Instead of continuous motion, a randomly <b>jumping</b> <b>bar</b> {{was used as the}} moving stimulus, relative to which the position of the flash was judged. The results were visualized as a spatiotemporal correlogram, in which the response to a flash was plotted at the space–time relative to the position and onset of the <b>jumping</b> <b>bar.</b> The actual human performance was not consistent with any of the original hypotheses. However, all the results were explained well if the differential latency was assumed to fluctuate considerably, its probability density function being approximated by Gaussian. Also, the model fit well with previously published data on the flash-lag effect...|$|R

He {{or she must}} clear a high <b>jump</b> <b>bar</b> and two [...] "hurdles" [...] by jumping off the ground with help of elastic cord. Finally, {{he or she must}} then take a sticky marker, jump off a platform, and attempt to paste it on a vertical wall. Each bar, hurdle, and vertical foot on the leap cleared is worth 10 points.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first was}} in high jump equipment. Until the 1930s, the high <b>jump</b> <b>bar</b> rested on two pegs that {{projected}} {{from the back of}} the uprights. Consequently, the jumper could hit the bar quite hard without dislodging it, by pressing it back against the uprights. This was scarcely possible for scissors jumpers, but easily possible with the Western roll. This loophole was exploited by Harold Osborn, amongothers. As a result, high jump equipment was changed to ensure that the bar could be dislodged both backwards and forwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{designated}} chief ring steward or ring {{manager is}} responsible for finding and assigning workers, almost always volunteers, to perform the myriad tasks involved in putting on a trial. For example, if electronic timing is not being used, each class needs a timer, who ensures that the dog's running time is recorded, a scribe, who records the judge's calls as a dog runs the class, and pole setters (or ring stewards), who ensure that <b>jump</b> <b>bars</b> are reset when they are knocked off and change jump heights for dogs of different sizes.|$|R

5000|$|... 6th Exercise is Directed Jumping. It {{is often}} {{referred}} to as [...] "go outs". The dog and handler are centered at one end of the ring. The dog is sent out and required to turn and sit approximately 20 feet beyond the high <b>jump</b> and <b>bar</b> <b>jump.</b> The dog is given a signal and verbal command to jump a high jump and in the second half of the exercise the dog is sent out again and must execute the other jump. It is scored as one exercise.|$|R
50|$|Fosbury, who {{was born}} in Portland, Oregon, first started experimenting with a new high jumping {{technique}} at age 16, while attending Medford High School. Fosbury had difficulty competing using the dominant high jumping techniques of the period. In his sophomore year, he failed to complete jumps of 5 ft, the qualifying height for many high school track meets. This dominant technique, the straddle method, was a complex motion where an athlete went over the high <b>jump</b> <b>bar</b> facing down, and lifted his legs individually over the bar. Fosbury found it difficult to coordinate all the motions involved in the straddle method, and began to experiment with other ways of doing the high jump.|$|R
50|$|Plyometrics, {{including}} {{running up}} and down stairs and hurdle bounding, can be incorporated into workouts, generally twice a week. This allows an athlete to work on agility and explosiveness. Other plyometric workouts that are common for long jumpers are box jumps. Boxes of various heights are set up spaced evenly apart and jumpers can proceed jumping onto them and off moving in a forward direction. They can vary the jumps from both legs to single jumps. Alternatively, they can set up the boxes in front of a high jump mat if allowed, and jump over a high <b>jump</b> <b>bar</b> onto the mat mimicking a landing phase of the jump. These plyometric workouts are typically performed {{at the end of a}} workout.|$|R

50|$|Artistic roller skaters most {{commonly}} skate on traditional quad skates. Skates designed for artistic skating typically have leather boots, a strong sole plate, and a <b>jump</b> <b>bar</b> for reinforcement. The plate {{has to be}} made from a strong material as it {{has to be able to}} withstand the shock of jumping and landing. Artistic roller skates usually have stainless steel or aluminum plates for that reason, even though these are heavier than ones made from other materials such as plastic. Free skaters usually use a toe stop, which can be used in the take-off in certain jumps such as the Mapes or the flip. Dance skaters substitute toe plugs, as the large toe stops are cumbersome when performing dance footwork. Figure skaters generally have specially made plates for figure skating which have no receptacle for the toe stop.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the first}} day of competition, Mohawk dominates North Star, {{cheating}} in many cases to win. Crockett fails to clear the high <b>jump</b> <b>bar,</b> Hardware gets pummeled in boxing, and Jackie suffers a broken leg in field hockey, thanks to the dirty work of two Mohawk girls. The score at the end of Day One is: Mohawk 170, North Star 63. That evening at the North Star Lodge, Tripper gives a rousing speech, telling the demoralized campers that it doesn't matter whether they win or lose. In unison, Camp North Star begins to chant, [...] "It just doesn't matter!" [...] Day Two of the Olympiad belongs to newly inspired North Star as they win every event. Wheels outwrestles his opponent, Spaz defeats Rhino in a stacking contest with inspiration from Jackie and a thwarted Mohawk cheating attempt, and, after 12 years of North Star defeats, Fink finally beats [...] "The Stomach" [...] in the hot dog eating contest. North Star now trails by only 10 points with one event left, a four-mile cross country run for 20 points. Tripper steps forward and selects a surprised Rudy to compete against Horse, Mohawk's star runner. The many mornings Rudy spent jogging and training with Tripper pay off as he wins the race, giving North Star its first Olympiad victory by a score of 230-220.|$|R

50|$|In the 1984 final Garry Cook {{was pushed}} very close by {{professional}} stunt performer and motorcycle racer, Eddie Kidd, {{but he held}} on against a weaker field than usual to become champion. Cook also competed in the now more popular Superteams series, {{as part of the}} never-defeated 'Athletes' team, who were only finally beaten during the last season of the show in 1985. By now the BBC had decided that the programme was in need of 'freshening up' and had altered the format several times, changing the format of the gym tests to include <b>bar</b> <b>jumps</b> and adding computerised scoring to stop the trend of sliding squat thrusts. The programme was also moved to Portsmouth and took on a naval theme, adding a field gun competition in a bid to boost flagging ratings. The final series of Superteams was duly won by 'Watersports' (a team representing swimming, water-skiing and diving) which was led by Olympic swimmer Robin Brew who excelled at running events and also in the gym tests, where the <b>bar</b> <b>jump</b> became his speciality.|$|R
