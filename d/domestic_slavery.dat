Some general practices in the Tunisian court contributed to entrench this tradition: the princes from the Hafsid period down to the Husainid beys solely employed slaves as palace guards and servants in their harem. By integrating slaves into the daily life of the court, the princes provided a model of slave use for the thousands of aristocrats living at court and for the civic nobility.|$|R
50|$|Slavery {{was a part}} of Ottoman society, {{with most}} slaves {{employed}} as <b>domestic</b> servants. Agricultural <b>slavery,</b> such as that which was widespread in the Americas, was relatively rare. Unlike systems of chattel slavery, slaves under Islamic law were not regarded as movable property, but maintained basic, though limited, rights. This gave them a degree of protection against abuse. Female slaves were still sold in the Empire as late as 1908. During the 19th century the Empire came under pressure from Western European countries to outlaw the practice. Policies developed by various Sultans throughout the 19th century attempted to curtail the slave trade but, since slavery did have centuries of religious backing and sanction, they never directly abolished the institution outright.|$|R

He explored the gap between military-administrative elite <b>slavery,</b> <b>domestic</b> slaves in households, and agricultural enserfment-enslavement. His later work attempted to recover voices of enslaved persons, look at the enslaver-enslaved relationship as a coerced attachment, and examine what happened when trust was violated by the enslavers; it also looked at agency and resistance by the enslaved. [...] More recently he has explored the reasons for the fact that Muslim-majority societies generated limited antislavery argumentation and had weak abolitionist movements, if at all.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} theorizes Harriet Jacobs's {{politics of}} abolitionist emancipation as a loophole in modern theories of freedom. Jacobs's narrative, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, is an immeasurably valuable {{critique of the}} sexual politics of the peculiar institution. Our return to Jacobs wonders what additional value might be gleamed from reading her contributions to the abolitionist tradition as a social critique of slavery animated by an immanent critique of the virtues of modern political emancipation. Though most studies of Jacobs's work focus on her narrative this project places Incidents in the broader context of her Civil War writings and subsequent contributions to national reconstruction. I argue that Jacobs's slave girl protocols of emancipation shift the sexual politics of <b>slavery's</b> <b>domestic</b> order from {{the margins of the}} abolitionist tradition to its epistemic center. The question of freedom at the core of Jacobs's abolitionism directed itself to both proslavery supporters and antislavery activists alike. It was a question that asked when and for whom is self-defense a crime, and when and for whom a virtue? Her philosophy of freedom challenged conventional figurations of freedom foundational to American political theory, and anticipated analytic innovations of the twentieth century wrought to repurpose them, in particular feminist of color interventions to conventional notions of national belonging, political justice and a radical ethics of freedom...|$|R

The variables being most closely examined are the types of services required by non-PR CALD women (hereafter known as the client), the types of service provided, the broader accommodation needs and how they were best met. All statistics in this report are an amalgam of all state-wide crisis services across Australia and all identifying client information has been removed.

40|$|Following World War II {{the novel}} faced {{a crisis in}} its mode of address. How could the human and humane {{function}} of language and artistic representation be lent to the depiction of historical terror or trauma? Who {{has the right to}} speak on behalf of – or to assume the voice of – victims of such real atrocity? And to what extent can a writer attend to another's pain without aestheticising extreme vulnerability, or losing the reader to indifference or repulsion? The difficulties confronted by the writer of fictional works when addressing such issues as war, rape, <b>domestic</b> abuse, colonisation, <b>slavery,</b> even genocide are not rooted in an inadequacy of syntax; rather they are borne out of the disjunction between the idealistic assumptions that linked language to a sense of humanity, intelligence and the pursuit of goals beneficial to society as a whole, and the extremity of recent acts of human atrocity as conducted not by the savage Other but by modern societies with which the reader would otherwise identify. Since the mid-twentieth century a number of writers have responded to these challenges by forgoing the traditional dialogic form of the novel and electing characters that cannot or will not speak in order to convey, through their speechlessness and – at times – their damaged physicality, the extent of the violence and oppression to which they have been subjected, and the difficulty of assimilating such violence into the stories by which communities, indeed whole nations, define themselves. The unexpectedly large cast of mute characters suggests that silence has a vital role in the literary portrayal of historical trauma. The prevalence of silence in contemporary fiction related to the Holocaust, for example, shows how this group of writers recognises the extent to which this event tested and continues to test literary exploration. Writers the world over continue to refuse to ignore these subjects – indeed, the broken images and fragmented forms common to many of the novels studied in the following pages can be seen as an apt response to the chaos of war and human aggression – but, as is evident from the number of contemporary works of fiction incorporating a mute character, silence has become an accepted and effective tool for the portrayal of historical events of terror or trauma that continue to challenge the ethical boundaries of the imagination...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2016 - 06 This {{dissertation}} {{reviews the}} historical interpretations of “guestworkers” that emerged {{with the creation}} of the labor importation agreements between the United States, Mexico, and the Caribbean during and after World War II, to expose “guestworker” programs as a pivotal axis in the U. S. imperial framework of the twentieth century. Cast as facilitating individual salvation and international reciprocity, U. S. migrant labor importation policies with Mexico, Jamaica, Bahamas, Honduras, Barbados, and Puerto Rico emphasized the labor contract, bilateral agreements between nation-states, and equal rights, all of which appeared as advances from older labor arrangements forged under colonialism and slavery. Through various debates between and among U. S. government officials, leftist labor leaders, civil rights activists, and agribusiness employers, this dissertation examines how they all, in contradictory ways, celebrated and projected these labor programs as marking a new global age of freedom. This emergent rhetoric of freedom surrounding labor migrations to the United States facilitated, obscured, legitimated, and extended global racial and colonial dynamics in the post-World War II era. To expose how empire and race drove the programs, each chapter places the labor programs within the context of their formative moments: U. S imperial interventions in Latin America in the nineteenth century, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II, slavery and indentured servitude in the British Caribbean colonies, the U. S. labor and civil rights movements, and the movements for independence in the British West Indies. In viewing the co-constitutive logic of “guestworker” labor programs within these formative contexts, it reveals that the “break” from empire that the labor programs seemed to signify in the 1940 s was hardly a break at all. It then addresses how “guestworkers” and their advocates struggled to compel the state to fulfill the “freedom” of the labor programs during the long civil rights movement. Within the daily struggles of migrant workers and anticolonial activists, we can begin to find glimpses of wider visions of social justice that challenged the mandates of the U. S. liberal state, beyond universal “freedom” as it is framed by “rights” under nation. “Contracting Freedom” demonstrates that the racial formation of the U. S. “guestworker” was much more than a minor footnote to U. S. race relations, usually assumed to matter only along the West Coast {{with the advent of the}} Bracero Program. Instead, the “guestworker” proved central to the reconstruction of race, class, and nation during the mid-twentieth century, by upsetting and then recreating social and cultural dualisms that lay at the heart of American identities and imperial subjectivities: foreign and <b>domestic,</b> freedom and <b>slavery,</b> citizen and noncitizen, guest and alien...|$|R
