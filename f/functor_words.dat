40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the CIRCUS language instruments for determining language comprehension and performance in the 4 - and 5 -year-old child is discussed. In these instruments, the use of content words is primarily studied {{through the use of}} single-word measures, such as a picture vocabulary test and an auditory discrimination test, whereas the use of <b>functor</b> <b>words</b> is studied by three different measures: a listening comprehension test, a test which measures the receptive understanding of certain grammatical constructions, and a test which measures the ability of the child to produce the same or similar constructions. These last two measures are designed to provide information which can be used to compare the child's receptive vs. productive use of grammatical structures. The intent of the CIRCUS measures is to provide the teacher with a reasonable sampling of the child's language. The CIRCUS instruments measure the growth of the child's spoken language by observing three types of language use: descriptive, functional, and narrative. (DB) n...|$|E
40|$|The {{practice}} of using alphabet supplementation to increase speech intelligibility {{for people with}} dysarthric speech has been documented for that past 25 years. Alphabet supplementation involves pointing to the first letter of each word as it is spoken. Alphabet supplementation can increase sentence-level intelligibility {{by an average of}} 26 %. Traditional alphabet supplementation research assumes complete and accurate alphabet cues for all spoken words. No documentation exists about the effect of omitted alphabet cues on speech intelligibility. ^ This study investigated the effect of omitting alphabet cues from alphabet-supplemented speech by systematically omitting the cues for words within different word classes. Specifically, no alphabet cues were omitted in a 100 % alphabet supplementation condition, cues for all nouns were omitted in an alphabet-minus-noun condition, cues for <b>functor</b> <b>words</b> were omitted in an alphabet-minus-functors condition, and cues for verbs were omitted in an alphabet-minus verbs condition. The study used sentence stimuli from two different speakers. Each experiment compared sentence intelligibility scores between habitual speech (natural dysarthric speech with no intervention) and the four alphabet-supplemented conditions, and between the 100 % supplementation condition and the three omitted conditions. ^ Results showed statistically significant differences between the habitual speech condition and {{all but one of the}} alphabet supplementation conditions. No statistically significant differences occurred between the 100 % alphabet supplementation condition and any of the manipulated conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|Reports of five {{patients}} whose deep alexic reading all evolved into phonological alexia {{in a similar}} fashion point to the hypothesis that deep alexia and phonological alexia represent different points on the same continuum. This hypothesis is explored further through an examination of previously published case reports of eleven pa-tients with phonological alexia. Data from these patients suggest that there is a predictable succession of symptoms which form a continuum of severity of phono-logical alexia, with deep alexia as its endpoint. An account of the recovery from deep to phonological alexia, based upon a lexical (no-rules) model of reading, is provided (Glosser & Friedman, 1990), and the implications for therapy are consid-ered. The significance of the notion of a continuum of phonological/deep alexia is discussed. 1996 Academic Press, Inc. Phonological alexia is the term applied to a reading disorder in which pseudoword reading is poor relative to the reading of real words. This symp-tom may be accompanied by other alexic symptoms, such as a relative deficit in the reading of <b>functor</b> <b>words.</b> When an accompanying symptom of phono-logical alexia is the production of semantic paralexias, then the reading disor-der is no longer labeled phonological alexia; it is now termed deep alexia. Patients with deep alexia reliably display a number of alexic symptoms when reading words aloud, in addition to the production of semantic paralex-ias. These include the production of morphologic paralexias, a part of speech effect (nouns better than verbs and functors), and a concreteness effect (con-crete words better than abstract words), in addition to marked difficulty read...|$|E

40|$|Three {{experiments}} examined whether infants recognise functors in phrases, {{and whether}} their representations of functors are phonetically well specified. Eight- and 13 - month-old English infants heard monosyllabic lexical words preceded by real functors (e. g., the, his) versus nonsense functors (e. g., kuh); {{the latter were}} minimally modified segmentally (but not prosodically) from real <b>functors.</b> Lexical <b>words</b> were constant across conditions; thus recognition of functors would appear as longer listening time to sequences with real functors. Eightmonth- olds' listening times to sequences with real versus nonsense functors did not significantly differ, suggesting {{that they did not}} recognise real functors, or functor representations lacked phonetic specification. However, 13 -month-olds listened significantly longer to sequences with real functors. Thus, somewhere between 8 and 13 months of age infants learn familiar functors and represent them with segmental detail.

40|$|One {{universal}} {{feature of}} human languages is {{the division between}} grammatical <b>functors</b> and content <b>words.</b> From a learnability point of view, functors might provide entry points or anchors into the syntactic structure of utterances due to their high frequency.

Here we report a corpus study and an artificial grammar learning experiment testing the anchoring hypothesis in Basque, Japanese, French and Italian adults. We show that adults are sensitive to the distribution of functors in their native language and use them when learning new linguistic material.

5000|$|Pure alexia {{exhibits}} {{some unexpected}} residual abilities despite {{the inability to}} read words. For instance, one patient had preserved calculation capabilities such as deciding which number was greater, and whether a number was odd or even with greater than chance probability. The study showed that the patient was also able to calculate simple arithmetic tasks such as addition, subtraction, and division, but not multiplication, even though the patient could not read the numbers. For example, the patient would be presented with [...] "8 - 6", {{and he or she}} would read it as [...] "five minus four", but still come up with the correct answer [...] "two" [...] with greater than chance accuracy. Pure alexia patients also seem to retain some residual semantic processing. They are able to perform better than chance when forced to make a lexical decision or make a semantic-categorisation decision. These subjects also performed better with nouns than <b>functors,</b> better with <b>words</b> that had high rather than low imageability, and performed poorly with suffixes. However, {{this may be due to}} right hemisphere input or residual left hemisphere input.|$|R
40|$|Aim: The {{proposed}} graphemic area in {{the dominant}} hemisphere contains letter representations {{that are responsible for}} guiding the skilled movements required for writing and for recognition of the physical features of letters. Dysfunction in this system may cause apraxic agraphia. In this study, writing performance of a right-handed, left hemisphere damaged, 12 -year old apraxic agraphic patient with a native language of shallow ortography is analysed. Methods: Writing performance was evaluated with several different word lists, each holding same amount of letters, novel <b>words</b> (non-word), <b>words,</b> <b>functors,</b> and high-imagery and low-imagery words. Non-words were derived from words by changing a single letter. Results: A selective writing impairment limited to the left hand was observed. Her deficit was graphemic in nature; she made no phonological errors during spontaneous speech and oral naming. Writing was not affected by lexical factors (grammatical class, word length, or abstract quality) or lexicality (<b>word,</b> non-word, <b>functor).</b> In the entire corpus of responses, she wrote 2 of 154 vowel letters (1. 3 %) and 51 of 232 consonant letters (22. 0 %) incorrectly. Conclusions: It is proposed that the corpus callosum carries the interhemispheric control of praxis and writing at different levels, praxis for writing carried separately from praxis in general and within praxis for writin...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{construct}} a 2 -functor from the unobstructed immersed Weinstein category to {{the category of}} all filtered A infinity categories. We consider arbitrary (compact) symplectic manifolds and its arbitrary (relatively spin) immersed Lagrangian submanifolds. The filtered A infinity category associated to a symplectic manifold is defined by using Lagrangian Floer theory in such generality by Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono and Akaho-Joyce. The morphism of unobstructed immersed Weinstein category is by definition a pair of immersed Lagrangian submanifold of the direct product and its bounding cochain (in the sense of Fukaya-Oh-Ohta-Ono and Akaho-Joyce). Such a morphism transforms an (immersed) Lagrangian submanifold of one factor {{to one of the}} other factor. The key new result proved in this paper shows that this geometric transformation preserves unobstructed-ness of the Lagrangian Floer theory. Thus, this paper generalizes earlier results by Wehrheim-Woodward and Mau's-Wehrheim-Woodward so that it works in complete generality in the compact case. The main idea of the proofs are based on Lekili-Lipiyansky's Y diagram and a lemma from homological algebra, together with systematic use of Yoneda <b>functor.</b> In other <b>words</b> the proofs are based on a different idea from those which are studied by Bottmann-Mau's-Wehrheim-Woodward, where strip shrinking and figure 8 bubble plays the central role.
