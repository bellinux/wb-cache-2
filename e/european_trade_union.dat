30|$|The dilemma {{nowadays}} {{is whether}} <b>trade</b> <b>unions,</b> as {{social and political}} actors, should try to influence regulations on immigration and migrant workers’ access to labour markets by opposing or supporting government policies on immigration and integration. In fact, most <b>European</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> have formally abandoned their restrictive stances of the past. They have ‘renewed’ their emphasis on notions such as international solidarity and equality and tend to favour more liberal immigration regimes. Some Southern <b>European</b> <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> have lobbied against national immigration laws that they perceived as unfair and discriminatory and have supported regularizations of undocumented immigrants. In countries such as Spain and Italy, however, these stances have been {{explained in terms of}} protecting the national workforce and advocating for better labour conditions (Watts, 2002). A similar interpretation was recently proposed to explain unions’ attitudes in some North-Western European countries (Menz, 2009).|$|R
