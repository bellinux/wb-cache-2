500|$|Engineering of {{the song}} was done by Emily Wright and Sam Holland at Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. While Kesha was {{in the studio with}} Dr. Luke and Blanco, she took three takes to get the song correct as she jokingly [...] "white-girl rapped" [...] over the beat. At one point in the song's production, she had wanted to re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked." [...] She elaborated, [...] "I thought it was just another song, I thought it was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> the other ones I'd written. I didn't even know if it was very good. I wanted to rewrite the verses, I didn't think it was funny or clever. I thought it kind of sucked. But {{everyone}} else liked it."

500|$|From 1986 the {{championship}} has been {{classified as a}} [...] "National" [...] title, which means that officially non-Mexican citizens are prohibited from challenging or holding {{the championship}}, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> other Mexican National Championships. There have been instances where those rules have not been strictly enforced, including Puerto Rican Zeuxis winning the championship. Later CMLL announced that she actually had joint citizenship in Puerto Rico and Mexico after she won the championship in 2015. It is unclear if Zeuxis' Puerto Rican heritage is a storyline or not.< All title matches take place under best two-out-of-three falls rules. On occasion single fall title matches have taken place, for example when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan, conforming to {{the traditions of the}} local promotion, for instance when Princesa Blanca defended the championship against Lady Apache in Korakuen Hall in Tokyo, Japan. As it is a professional wrestling championship, it is not won legitimately; it is instead won via a scripted ending to a match or awarded to a wrestler because of a storyline.|$|E
500|$|Former {{teammate}} Andy Russell called Greene [...] "unquestionably the NFL's {{best player}} in the seventies," [...] saying [...] "No player had a greater impact or did more for his team." [...] Greene and coach Noll are widely credited with turning the Steelers franchise around. The Steelers finished 1970 with a 5–9 record and went 6–8 in 1971. Greene was invited to the Pro Bowl in both seasons. In 1972, Pittsburgh finished 11–3 and won its first division title and its first playoff game—the [...] "Immaculate Reception" [...] game against the Oakland Raiders. [...] During the season, Greene tallied eleven quarterback sacks and 42 solo tackles, and he was recognized as the AP NFL Defensive Player of the Year. Miami Dolphins head coach Don Shula lauded Greene, saying, [...] "He's just a super super star. It's hard to believe he isn't offside on every play. He makes the other team adjust to him." [...] By this time, Noll had built a formidable defense. [...] "We have maybe 10 guys now capable of making All-Pro," [...] said Greene in 1972. [...] "I'm <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> the other guys, doing my best in a team effort." ...|$|E

2500|$|An {{exception}} to the law on misrepresentation – that contracts are voidable at the instance of the misrepresentee, but the right to rescission can be barred inter alia by the intervention of third party rights – arises when someone is induced by the fraudulent misrepresentation to enter an agreement through a written document at a distance (and not when a transaction is face to face). In Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson a crook obtained Mr Patel's credit details and bought a Mitsubishi Shogun on hire purchase contract at a car dealer. Shogun Finance was faxed through Mr Patel's details, and agreed to finance {{the purchase of the}} car, letting the crook drive away. Subsequently, Mrs Hudson bought the car from the crook. The crook disappeared. Then Shogun Finance, who had predictably never been paid, found Mrs Hudson and sued to retrieve the car. A bare majority in the House of Lords held that to protect the certainty of commercial dealings through a signed document, the contract between the finance company and the crook was void (the same consequence as if there had never been any offer mirrored by an acceptance). They had only ever intended to contract with Mr Patel. And because nobody can convey property they do not have (nemo dat quod non habet) Mrs Hudson never acquired legitimate title to the car from the crook and had to give back the car. The minority held that this situation should follow ordinary law of misrepresentation, and should mean that the right of the finance company to rescind the contract would be barred by the intervention of Mrs Hudson's rights as a bona fide third party purchaser, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>all</b> of Europe, the United States, and previous decisions of the Court of Appeal suggest. However, because of the majority's decision this special category of [...] "mistake about identity" [...] cases remains a general {{exception to}} the English law on misrepresentation.|$|E
