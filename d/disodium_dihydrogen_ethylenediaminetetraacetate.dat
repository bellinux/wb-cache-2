40|$|A flow {{injection}} {{method was}} developed, {{aimed at the}} determination of urea in human serum. The system makes use of the naturally immobilized urease present in Canavalia ensiformis DC (jack bean). A column is filled with small pieces of this bean, and the sample (50 microliters) containing urea passes through it carried by a 1 % NaCl solution. On leaving the column the stream is merged with an alkaline reagent (0. 5 mol dm- 3 NaOH; 0. 5 % <b>disodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate).</b> The ammonium ions, arising from the enzymatic reaction that occurs inside the column, are changed into the molecular form, which permeates a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane and is received in a de-ionized water acceptor stream. The ammonia ionizes causing {{an increase in the}} conductance, which is proportional to the urea content of the sample. About 40 samples can be processed in 1 h with negligible carry-over and with a relative standard deviation of 1 % or less. The results are in agreement with those obtained by a standard spectrophotometric method...|$|E

The {{major component of}} singly modified [cytcIII{CoIII(dtpa) }] contains a [CoIII(dtpa) ] ion at Lys 13, of which the ε-amino group is linked with a carboxylate ion of dtpa. A one-electron reduced protein, [cytcII{CoIII(dtpa) }], was prepared by reduction with a methylviologen-radical cation, which was produced in situ by a photoreduction using a tris(2, 2 ′-bipyridine) ruthenium(II) ion {{in the presence of}} <b>disodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> <b>ethylenediaminetetraacetate</b> at 25 °C, pH 7. 5 (0. 010 mol dm− 3 tris(hydroxymethyl) aminomethane–HCl buffer), and an ionic strength of 0. 50 mol dm− 3 (NaCl). The reaction of [cytcII{CoIII(dtpa) }] to form [cytcIII{CoII(dtpa) }] was very slow, and was followed by conventional spectrophotometry. The reaction was of first order in the protein and the first-order rate constant ((3. 1 ± 0. 5) × 10 − 4 s− 1) was independent of the concentration of the protein, indicating that the intramolecular electron-transfer (ET) process is predominant. The reaction mechanism is discussed on a through-bond or through-space pathway. The slow intramolecular ET rate might arise not only from the long distance, but also from the large reorganization energy for the Co(III) /Co(II) couple...|$|E

The experiment was performed on board ship. Increasing concentrations of 4 -HR delayed the occurrence of melanosis during storage.

Specific phenol compounds including rhododendrol (RD), a skin-brightening ingredient in cosmetics, are reported to induce leukoderma, inducing a social problem, and the elucidation of mechanism of leukoderma is strongly demanded. This study investigated the relationship among the cytotoxicities of six phenol compounds on B 16 F 10 melanoma cells andHaCaT keratinocytes and generated reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, the cytotoxicity of RD on B 16 F 10 cells was higher than that on HaCaT cells, and RD significantly increased intracellular ROS and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) levels in B 16 F 10 cells.

In vivo and postmortem application of treatment was evaluated. Prawns with no additives or treated with 4 % of a commercial formula based on sulfites were used to compare with 4 -hexylresorcinol. The formulations based on 4 -hexylresorcinol or sulfites inhibited the polyphenoloxidase (PPO) activity under 0. 2 (Δoptical density [OD]/min/mL), instead of 1 (ΔOD/min/mL) achieved by prawns without additives, with the consequent delay in the appearance of melanosis during the 1 st wk of storage. Prawns treated with sulfites showed initially better protection; however 4 -hexylresorcinol proved to be more effective at the end of storage. The formulation based on 4 -hexylresorcinol at 0. 1 % concentration, provided in vivo, inhibited the microbial growth (total bacteria count, H 2 S-producer microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, enterobacteria, and pseudomonads), whereas the commercial sulfites inhibited the luminescent bacteria growth. © 2005 Institute of Food Technologists.

40|$|Resorbable calcium {{phosphate}} based bone void fillers should work as temporary templates for new bone formation. The incorporation of macropores with sizes of 100 - 300 µm {{has been shown}} to increase the resorption rate of the implant and speed up bone ingrowth. In this work, macroporous brushite cements were fabricated through foaming of the cement paste, using two different synthetic surfactants, Tween® 80 and Pluronic® F- 127. The macropores formed in the Pluronic samples were both smaller and less homogeneously distributed compared with the pores formed in the Tween samples. The porosity and compressive strength (CS) were comparable to previously developed hydroxyapatite foams. The cement foam containing Tween, 0. 5 M citric acid in the liquid, 1 mass% of <b>disodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> pyrophosphate mixed in the powder and a liquid to powder ratio of 0. 43 mL/g, showed the highest porosity values (76 % total and 56 % macroporosity), while the CS was > 1 MPa, that is, the hardened cement could be handled without rupture of the foamed structure.

40|$|AbstractDue to a {{fast setting}} reaction, good {{biological}} properties, and easily available starting materials, {{there has been}} extensive research {{within the field of}} brushite cements as bone replacing material. However, the fast setting of brushite cement gives them intrinsically low mechanical properties due to the poor crystal compaction during setting. To improve this, many additives such as citric acid, pyrophosphates, and glycolic acid {{have been added to the}} cement paste to retard the crystal growth. Furthermore, the incorporation of a filler material could improve the mechanical properties when used in the correct amounts. In this study, the effect of the addition of the two retardants, <b>disodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> pyrophosphate and citric acid, together with the addition of β-TCP filler particles, on the mechanical properties of a brushite cement was investigated. The results showed that the addition of low amounts of a filler (up to 10 %) can have large effects on the mechanical properties. Furthermore, the addition of citric acid to the liquid phase makes it possible to use lower liquid-to-powder ratios (L/P), which strongly affects the strength of the cements. The maximal compressive strength (41. 8 MPa) was found for a composition with a molar ratio of 45 : 55 between monocalcium phosphate monohydrate and beta-tricalcium phosphate, an L/P of 0. 25 ml/g and a citric acid concentration of 0. 5 M in the liquid phase...|$|R
40|$|Summary A new bisphosphonate, <b>disodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> (cycloheptylamino) {{methylene}} bisphosphonate monohydrate (YM 175), {{was compared}} with 3 -amino- 1 -hydroxypropylidene- 1, 1 -bisphosphonate (AHPrBP) and l-hydroxyethylidene- 1, 1 -bisphosphonate (HEBP) {{in terms of}} its effect on tumour induced osteolysis using a bladder tumour in mice (MBT- 2). The method consisted of inoculating tumour cells subcutaneously (SC) over the calvaria in mice, resulting in a local tumour causing fragmentation of the bone. The compounds were active not only when administered preventively before establishment of bone resorption, but also in an inhibitory fashion once the variables were already {{under the influence of the}} tumour. This osteolysis was evaluated by measuring the increased area of bone resorption in reduced opacity to radiograph and histology. The results showed the following sequence of potency: YM 175 > AHPrBP = HEBP. This inhibition was obtained with no apparent effect on the growth of the MBT- 2 tumour. YM 175 appears to be an interesting new bisphosphonate with possible clinical application. There are at least two mechanisms for osteolysis that occurs in both human metastases and experimental skeletal metastasis; osteoclast mediated bone destruction and direct destruction of bone independent of osteoclasts (Galasko & Bennett, 1976). Thus, agents that inhibit bone resorption might be used to decrease the extent of bone destruction by the tumour. Based on their action on calcium phosphate crystal formation and on bone resorption, bisphosphonates represent a new class of drugs with considerable therapeutic potential for metastatic bone disease (Fleisch et al., 1969...|$|R
40|$|The gold {{standard}} for bone replacement today, autologous bone, suffers from several disadvantages, such as the increased risk of infection due {{to the need for}} two surgeries. Degradable synthetic materials with properties similar to bone, such as calcium phosphate cements, are a promising alternative. Calcium phosphate cements are suited for a limited amount of applications and improving their physical properties could extend their use into areas previously not considered possible. For example, cement with increased strength could be used as load bearing support in selected applications. The focus of this thesis is, therefore, on how the physical properties of acidic calcium phosphate cements (brushite cements) are affected by compositional variations, with the ultimate aim of making it possible to formulate brushite cements with desired properties. In this thesis a method to measure the porosity of a cement was developed. This method is advantageous over existing methods as it is easy to use, requiring no advanced equipment. A model estimating the porosity of the hardened cement from the initial chemical composition was further formulated and the accuracy affirmed. Utilization of this model allows the porosity to be optimized by calculations rather than extensive laboratory work. The effect on strength and porosity of several compositional variations were also assessed and {{it was found that the}} optimal composition to achieve a high strength was: monocalcium phosphate particles in sizes < 75 µm, 10 mol% excess of beta-tricalcium phosphate, 1 wt% <b>disodium</b> <b>dihydrogen</b> pyrophosphate, and 0. 5 M citric acid in a liquid-to-powder ratio of 0. 22 ml/g. This composition gave the highest compressive strength historically measured for this type of cement, i. e., 74. 4 (± 10. 7)  MPa. Although such a high strength may not be necessary for all applications, it allows for the use of brushite cements in new applications. Furthermore, a high strength of the bulk allows for alterations to the cement that cause a decrease in strength. One application is fast degrading materials, allowing rapid bone ingrowth. A fast degradation is obtained with a high macroporosity, which would reduce strength. The high strength composition was therefore utilized to achieve brushite cement with a high macroporosity...|$|R
