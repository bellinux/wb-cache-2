5000|$|There {{are many}} {{products}} in the marketplace which are sold as jerky which consist of highly processed, chopped and <b>formed</b> <b>meat,</b> rather than traditional sliced, whole-muscle meat. These products may contain more fat, but moisture content, like the whole-muscle product, must meet a 0.75 to 1 moisture to protein ratio in the US. [...] Chemical preservatives {{can be used to}} prevent oxidative spoilage, but the moisture to protein ratio prevents microbial spoilage by low water activity. Many jerky products are very high in sugar and are therefore very sweet, unlike biltong, which rarely contains added sugars.|$|E
40|$|The Federal Safety and Inspection Services in {{accordance}} with United States Department of Agriculture require that <b>formed</b> <b>meat</b> products be cooked to a specified minimum internal temperature in order to eliminate the possible presence of harmful bacteria. The current system of verifying the internal temperatures of <b>formed</b> <b>meat</b> products consists of manually inserting a temperature probe into the selected sample as it exits the oven. Creating an automated system that measures and records the internal temperatures of <b>formed</b> <b>meat</b> samples as they exit the oven along a meat processing line has been the topic of an ongoing research. The most recent research conducted utilized the knowledge and results presented from previous work to create a 3 -D simulation of a proposed automated system. The objective of this thesis was to analyze the previously created simulation and implement the necessary modifications {{to increase the efficiency}} of the system. At the conclusion of the research, a new automated system process was designed along with an additional implementation for further optimization...|$|E

This is also often the case for fillings in steamed dishes. This process is what lends a smooth texture to the meatballs. Pounding, unlike mincing, uncoils and stretches previously wound and tangled protein strands in meat and allows them to cure to a gel with heat in a similar manner as surimi.|$|R
