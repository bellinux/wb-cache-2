40|$|The intense fear {{response}} to vaginal penetration {{in women with}} lifelong vaginismus, {{who have never been}} able to experience coitus, may reflect negative automatic and deliberate appraisals of vaginal penetration stimuli which might be modified by exposure treatment. The aim of this study is to examine whether (i) sexual stimuli elicit relatively strong automatic and <b>deliberate</b> <b>threat</b> associations in women with vaginismus, as well as relatively negative automatic and deliberate global affective associations, compared with symptom-free women; and (ii) these automatic and more deliberate attitudes can be modified by therapist-aided exposure treatment. A single target Implicit Association Test (st-IAT) was used to index automatic threat associations, and an Affective Simon Task (AST) to index global automatic affective associations. Participants were women with lifelong vaginismus (N = 68) and women without sexual problems (N = 70). The vaginismus group was randomly allocated to treatment (n = 34) and a waiting list control condition (n = 34). Indices of automatic threat were obtained by the st-IAT and automatic global affective associations by the AST, visual analogue scales (VAS) were used to assess deliberate appraisals of the sexual pictures (fear and global positive affect). More deliberate fear and less global positive affective associations with sexual stimuli were found in women with vaginismus. Following therapist-aided exposure treatment, the strength of fear was strongly reduced, whereas global positive affective associations were strengthened. Automatic associations did not differ between women with and without vaginismus and did not change following treatment. Relatively stronger negative (threat or global affect) associations with sexual stimuli in vaginismus appeared restricted to the deliberate level. Therapist-aided exposure treatment was effective in reducing subjective fear of sexual penetration stimuli and led to more global positive affective associations with sexual stimuli. The impact of exposure might be further improved by strengthening the association between vaginal penetration and positive affect (e. g., by using counter-conditioning techniques...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{organizations}} {{around the}} world are becoming aware of the need to run risk management programs in order to enhance their information security. However, the majority of the existing qualitative/empirical methods fail to adhere to the terminology defined by ISO 27000 -series and treat <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats</b> in a misleading way. In this paper, a quantitative risk analysis approach for <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats</b> is introduced. The proposed approach follows the steps suggested by the ISO 27005 standard for risk management, extending them in order to focus on <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats</b> and the different information security incidents that realize them. It is based on three-levels: the conceptual foundation level, the modeling tools level and the mathematical foundation level. The conceptual foundation level defines and analyzes the terminology involved, using unified modeling language (UML) class diagrams. The modeling tools level introduces certain tools that assist in modeling the relations among different concepts. Finally, the mathematical foundation level includes all the different mathematical formulas and techniques used to estimate risk values for each threat...|$|R

40|$|Democracy as a {{political}} form of social organization offers humanity its best prospect for freedom and peace. Today, it faces <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats</b> from totalitarian movements that rely on terrorist tactics. Democracy also faces threats from its own leaders because of the consequential nature of their judgment and decision making. This article examines how threats to democracy are perceived and managed. It is proposed that perception and management of threats to democracy represent a case of judgment and decision making under uncertainty. Relevant factors that influence policy decision making {{as it pertains to}} safeguarding democracies from threat are highlighted. There is a lot of talk these days about democracy, including the need to protect it from terrorists, to protect it from government policies that erode its fundamental commitments to civil liberties, humanitarian principles, and the rule of law, and to promote (or “spread”) it—even by use of force—to areas of the world where it currently does not exist. Indeed, foreign policy thinkers across the political spectrum share in common a penchant for promoting and protecting democracy...|$|R
40|$|A database-management system (DBMS) is a {{collection}} of correlated data and a set of programs to access correlated data. The collection of data, usually referred to as the database, contains information able to an enterprise. And hence the concept of security lies with-in. As the database contains all information relevant to particular enterprise, so it's very important to be in safe side to prevent all threats related to data. Various Security Mechanisms have been developed to prevent ill-legal and un-authorized access of data (enterprise related, web or network related etc.) by un-authorized users and hackers. Database security is a growing concern of the market these days as there has been found an un-expected growth in ill-legal access of data. This paper is the brief analysis of all the threats and attacks against database security and integrity. Database security is the mechanisms that secure the database from data tampering, <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats,</b> unauthorized users and hackers. Security refers to protecting data from unauthorized users and Integrity refers to protecting the data against authorized users. Both concepts must be taken into consideration for making a complete check on overall security of database...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{security}} concept has become increasingly expanded in its referent object, core values and type of threats. Among scholars, Richard Ullman {{was the first to}} advocate an extension of security concept to include {{a wide range of issues}} from natural disasters and diseases to environmental degradation. 2 Such advocacy was prominent with the end of Cold War that led to the decline of military threats, while other threats to human being (poverty, diseases, natural disaster, environmental degradation, and so on) have seemed to increase in {{the past few}} decades. This extension has nevertheless turned security into a sharply contested concept in the study of International Relations. On the one hand, defending the “traditionalist ” view of security, scholars such as Stephen Walt and Patrick Morgan argue that the state should remain the only referent of security because they believe that security should only deal with <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats</b> (primarily of a military nature) to the physical security of the nation-state. Moreover, with regard to the scope of security concept, they believe that security should be limited to the international level, that is, rivalries between states. On the other hand, moving beyond this traditionalist approach, Ken Booth, Simon Dalby and Barry Buzan argue that the referen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract In the SQoS network as {{introduced}} in [1] and [2], the border router in every autonomous system (AS) provides customized security mechanisms to the incoming packets. Some serious {{problems have been}} recently raised particularly when there are one or more compromised routers that attempt to modify, delete, or fabricate any part or the whole packet into the SQoS network. The compromised router can either passively or actively perform the malicious activities against the forwarding packets. The SQoS network does not explicitly specify the method to detect whether the data contained in the packets have been abused by the compromised routers or by the end host itself. We <b>deliberate</b> the <b>threats</b> and later propose several methods to detect both the malicious routers and end hosts such that SQoS information and payload is authentic and integrity-protected.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of impact events (e. g. blackouts with vast geographic coverage) into electrical critic infrastructure systems usually require {{the analysis of}} cascade failure root causes through the conduction of structural vulnerability studies, with well-defined methodologies that may guide decision-making for implementation of preventing actions and for operation recovering into the power system (e. g. N- 1 and N-t contingency studies). This technical contribution provides some alternative techniques based upon complex networks and graph theory, which {{in the last few}} years have been proposed as useful methodologies for analysis of physical behavior of electric power systems. Vulnerability assessment is achieved by testing their performance into random risks and <b>deliberate</b> attacks <b>threats</b> scenarios. Results shown in this proposal lead to conclusions on the use of complex networks for contingency analysis by means of studies of those events that result in cascade failures and consumer disconnections...|$|R

As a result Meshulam's followers were sentenced to prison terms of between 15 months to five years. Meshulam himself was convicted of providing instruction to throw Molotov cocktails at police forces and obstruction of justice. He was sentenced to 8 years but was eventually cleared of one of the offenses and as a result his sentence was reduced to six and a half years, from which he did five years in practice after the president Ezer Weizman deducted seven months of his sentence.|$|R

The cities of Speyer, Strassburg, Worms and Mainz aligned {{to put up a}} force of 100 armed horsemen (30 from Mainz and Strassburg, 20 from Speyer and Worms). Possibly because of this danger, the church and city moved closer together. The bishop also contributed to the defense of the city and hired a gunsmith who could also make gunpowder and train soldiers. On April 25, 1440, even a friendship treaty was signed. In 1441, the council of imperial cities met in Speyer to <b>deliberate</b> the <b>threat,</b> in 1443 the city walls and the perimeter defensive dike were strengthened and another protection treaty was signed with the new Elector Palatine Louis IV.

40|$|Civil wars {{involving}} non-state armed {{groups in}} Burma {{have been driven}} by a complex mix of historical socio-political grievances and economic factors. The central government and its armed forces have conducted counterinsurgency campaigns against myriad rebel groups in ethnic areas virtually since independence in 1948. Civilian populations caught in these conflicts have suffered immensely as a consequence. The government and army have never completely controlled all the territory and people of the internationally recognised state as it exists on the map. Instead, in some areas it has been armed groups and welfare actors associated with them that {{have been responsible for}} limited administration and service provision to conflict-affected populations. Despite tolerance or support for this non-state governance in some areas, armed groups still present threats to the security of the constituencies they also claim to represent. This thesis assesses the factors that have facilitated or obstructed armed groups’ actions and the extent of their compliance (or not) in response to the norms against landmine use and the recruitment of children. While studies in other regions on armed groups and humanitarian norms have tended to consider policies of violence deliberately directed against civilians, the present study considers these less <b>deliberate</b> <b>threats</b> that armed groups in Burma present to the security of their own constituencies. It explores a set of theoretical propositions drawn from literature that has addressed armed groups from the perspectives of humanitarian engagement, sociology and political economy analysis of armed conflict. These contrasting approaches offer a more inclusive framework for analysis, considering the social, economic and coercive military and political structures influencing armed groups, affected populations and humanitarian actors engaging with them in relation to these issues. This thesis contends that perceived legitimacy and the role of armed group associated welfare and civil society actors have been significant influences on attempts to ameliorate the impact of these issues. The perspectives and influences of legitimacy diverge, however, between international support for the prohibition of landmine use and underage recruitment, and local perceptions, from armed group constituencies and the government, of the groups as credible armed actors. Localised economic agendas combined with geographical dispersion and weak organisational cohesion have also been factors leading to less compliance with these protection norms. The findings indicate that there is also considerable divergence in the extent of compliance between the two norms. Whereas landmine use remains perceived as militarily necessary to most armed groups in Burma and related to their maintenance of local legitimacy, children involved with armed groups are seen as less vital militarily, and external engagement with armed groups to address this issue has met with more acceptance over time. In the light of bilateral ceasefires and ongoing negotiations since 2012, the willingness and capacity of the armed groups and their welfare wings to address these concerns for conflict-affected populations will be important for their future support and for lasting political settlements...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a distributed Data Acquisition System (DAQ) {{developed for the}} TAWARA-RTM project (TAp WAter RAdioactivity Real Time Monitor). The aim is detecting the presence of radioactive contaminants in drinking water; {{in order to prevent}} <b>deliberate</b> or accidental <b>threats.</b> Employing a set of detectors, it is possible to detect alpha, beta and gamma radiations, from emitters dissolved in water. The Sensor Network (SN) consists of several heterogeneous nodes controlled by a centralized server. The SN cyber-security is guaranteed in order to protect it from external intrusions and malicious acts. The nodes were installed in different locations, along the water treatment processes, in the waterworks plant supplying the aqueduct of Warsaw, Poland. Embedded computers control the simpler nodes, and are directly connected to the SN. Local-PCs (LPCs) control the more complex nodes that consist signal digitizers acquiring data from several detectors. The DAQ in the LPC is split in several processes communicating with sockets in a local sub-network. Each process is dedicated to a very simple task (e. g. data acquisition, data analysis, hydraulics management) {{in order to have a}} flexible and fault-tolerant system.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{cross-sectional}} study of gender specific relationships between self-reported {{child sexual abuse}} and suicidality in a community sample of adolescents. METHOD: Students aged 14 years on average (N = 2, 485) from 27 schools in South Australia completed a questionnaire including items on sexual abuse and suicidality, and measures of depression (Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale), hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale), and family functioning (McMaster Family Assessment Device General Functioning Subscale). Data analysis included logistic regression. RESULTS: In boys, self-report sexual abuse is strongly and independently associated with suicidal thoughts, plans, <b>threats,</b> <b>deliberate</b> self-injury, and suicide attempts, after controlling for current levels of depression, hopelessness, and family dysfunction. In girls, the relationship between sexual abuse and suicidality is mediated fully by depression, hopelessness, and family dysfunction. Girls who report current high distress about sexual abuse, however, have a threefold increased risk of suicidal thoughts and plans, compared to non-abused girls. Boys who report current high distress about sexual abuse have 10 -fold increased risk for suicidal plans and threats, and 15 -fold increased risk for suicide attempts, compared to non-abused boys. Fifty-five percent (n = 15) of sexually abused boys attempted suicide versus 29 % (n = 17) girls. CONCLUSIONS: A history of sexual abuse should alert clinicians, professionals and carers in contact with adolescents, to greatly increased risks of suicidal behavior and attempts in boys, {{even in the absence}} of depression and hopelessness. Distress following sexual abuse, along with depression and hopelessness indicate increased risk of suicidal behavior in girls, as well as boys...|$|R
40|$|Background: Actions at European Union {{level for}} International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 {{implementation}} and maritime transport {{were focused on}} two European projects implemented between 2006 and 2011. Method: Situation analysis and needs assessment were conducted, a Manual including European standards and best practice and training material was developed and training courses were delivered. Ship-to-port and port-to-port communication web-based network and database for recording IHR Ship Sanitation Certificates (SSC) were established. Results: Fifty pilot inspections based on the Manual were conducted on passenger ships. A total of 393 corrective actions were implemented according to recommendations given to Captains during pilot inspections. The web-based communication network of competent authorities at ports in EU Member States was used to manage 13 events/outbreaks (dengue fever, Legionnaires' disease, gastroenteritis, meningitis, varicella and measles). The European information database system was used for producing and recording 1018 IHR SSC by 156 inspectors in 6 countries {{in accordance with the}} WHO Handbook for inspection of ships and issuance of SSC. Conclusions: Implementation of corrective actions after pilot inspections increased the level of compliance with the hygiene standards in passenger ships sailing within the EU waters and improved hygiene conditions. The communication tool contributed to improvement of outbreak identification and better management through rapid sharing of public health information, allowing a more timely and coordinated response. After the implementation of actions on passenger ships, the European Commission co-funded a Joint action that will expand the activities to all types of ships and chemical, biological and radio-nuclear <b>threats</b> (<b>deliberate</b> acts/accidental). © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

On the basis of the analysis of theoretical works of national and foreign authors, normative documents of state and international level the genesis of approaches {{to the understanding of the}} essence of modern terrorism, its contents, the subject-object relations and manifestation forms is received. As the result, according to the authors’ definition “terrorism” is understood as an ideology connected with <b>deliberate</b> violence or <b>threats</b> against the civilian population or property to influence on the government or the interstate organizations. In the work, the factors of development and spreading of terrorism in the Russian Federation’s regions are allocated and quantitatively proved.
