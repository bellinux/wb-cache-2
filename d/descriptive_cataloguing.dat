50|$|Ziedan sees {{cataloguing}} as an ars maior, {{that has}} not received the attention it deserves. According to him, cataloguing {{is the key to}} have a panoramic view of a particular manuscript heritage. With this in mind, Ziedan produced some 20 manuscript catalogues using detailed <b>descriptive</b> <b>cataloguing</b> techniques rather than skimpy uninformative bibliographic records. His catalogues are mostly thematic, i.e. they are not general catalogues, they handle each theme of knowledge separately.|$|E
5000|$|Cataloging is an {{important}} aspect of collections management as it provides the individual records associated with each object within a collection. Should an object be lost or destroyed, the catalog entry can be utilized as a permanent record of the object and its data. For some collections, such as natural history collections, the catalog entry for an object or specimen also contains the scientific values and research information about the physical object, making maintenance of a catalog entry imperative for future research and education. Most modern collectors and institutions utilize CMS to streamline the catalog process. For this to be effective, data entry standards must be utilized for data structure, data values, and data content, which then [...] "form the basis for a set of tools that can lead to good <b>descriptive</b> <b>cataloguing,</b> consistent documentation, shared records, and increased end-user access." ...|$|E

40|$|The article {{describes}} {{one of the}} main traditional processes librarianship of Scientific Library of the Odessa National I. I. Mechnikov University – descriptive cataloging. Great attention is paid to history of development of descriptive cataloging in the world and particularly in the Library of the Odessa University. In indissoluble communication with history, questions of the theory and a technique are considered. The analysis of <b>descriptive</b> <b>cataloguing</b> carried out on materials of the General alphabetical catalog of University Library. General scientific methods have been used: terminological analysis, operationalization of concepts, and analysis of documents. The formalized method of the analysis of documents – the content analysis was applied to studying of the card array of the General alphabetical catalog. Special methods of library science – bibliographic and analytical were applied to studying of the General alphabetical catalog. Defined the prospects of development of <b>descriptive</b> <b>cataloguing</b> in Scientific Library at the present stage. Shown the stages of introduction of machine-readable cataloguing. All history of development of cataloguing and <b>descriptive</b> <b>cataloguing</b> in particular confirms aspiration to unification, standardization and, as a result to corporate cataloguing. Corporate cataloguing – the most widespread type of interaction of libraries also assumes existence of network of participating libraries of corporation. Studying long-term world history of development of the theory of cataloguing, we see that this branch of library activity as any another is urged to promote consolidation of resources of libraries in uniform corporate network, which can provide with information the greatest number of users. It is possible to tell that machine-readable cataloguing – the conductor to corporate cataloguing...|$|E

40|$|Students have {{provided}} cheap successful labour for routine retrospective cataloguing projects. The current article examines a library project which went further, using university students with minimum training to catalogue its undergraduate stock {{from the book}} in hand to AACR 2, level 2, allegedly to professional standard. The article discusses the faults made in MARC coding, <b>descriptive</b> <b>cataloguing</b> and subject cataloguing, noting {{the nature of the}} errors and their results. The investigation concludes that intelligence alone does not guarantee library ability, and that cataloguing beyond the creation of minimum records is not an intuitive task to be picked up without training. Hidden expenses are attached. A derisory attitude towards library skills is unjustified, and a place remains for qualified librarians to do qualified library work.

40|$|Nowadays {{in digital}} {{information}} environments, {{various types of}} resources coexist with heterogeneous metadata formats and standards and efforts {{have been made to}} achieve interoperability in order to use multiple metadata standards and reuse metadata records by developing strategies, which range from simple mappings among metadata elements to complex structural modeling. Dealing with information resources requires a description of form and machine readable content with results that are understandable to humans and can meet the interoperability requirements between information environments. Considering this, this research proposes a reflection and suggests the development of an architecture for semantic bibliographic descriptions that ensures interoperability in digital information environments. By using exploratory and descriptive analysis, we found that <b>Descriptive</b> <b>Cataloguing</b> methodologies and a bibliographic ontology description, explained in the rules and codes of cataloguing and in metadata standards, redesign the development of better structured new digital information environments to retrieve information and effectively establish interoperability...|$|E
