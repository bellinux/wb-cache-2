The samples were tested at 1 hertz, at a displacement of 10 μm, and at room temperature. The fiber volume content of the kenaf was varied from 20 %- 40 % in 5 % increments.

5000|$|... ==Background== According to {{beam theory}} and the 3-point test of a {{rectangular}} beam of an istoroptic linear material, a perpendicular specific force applied to a rectangular beam would cause it to deflect {{as a function of}} its dimension parameters and material properties (i.e. <b>flexural</b> <b>modulus).</b> All parameters fixed, the dependence of the deflection on thickness is inversely proportional, i.e. the thinner the beam the more it deflects when the same force is applied. In a simplistic manner, the applied force per unit area is the stress experienced by the beam. For two beams made of similar materials but one is thinner than the other, a lower force (stress) is required to achieve the same deflection in the thinner beam. This opens up a possibility of reducing a beam's thickness to adjust the amount of stress it can handle before physically breaking, if deflection requirement is the same. Applying this concept on the commonly used brittle Monocrystalline silicon (100) substrates, it can achieve some flexibility (note that silicon is an anisotropic material and requires dealing with elasticity matrix, a tensor, not a simple value for <b>flexural</b> <b>modulus).</b> This is done by using various micro-fabrication techniques and novel approaches to reduce the silicon substrate thickness to few to tens of micrometers, enabling bending up to 0.5 cm radius without breaking.|$|E

Wollastonite also competes with several nonfibrous minerals or rocks, such as kaolin, mica, and talc, which are added to plastics to increase flexural strength, and such minerals as barite, calcium carbonate, gypsum, and talc, which impart dimensional stability to plastics.
