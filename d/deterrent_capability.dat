500|$|As CAS, Hancock {{worked to}} enhance the RAAF's <b>deterrent</b> <b>capability</b> in the Pacific region, {{particularly}} in light of heightened tensions with Indonesia during its period of Konfrontasi with Malaysia. In June 1963, Hancock undertook a mission to Britain, France and the United States to consider potential replacements for the English Electric Canberra bomber as Australia's prime aerial strike platform. After investigating the US [...] "TFX", North American A-5 Vigilante and McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II, the British BAC TSR-2, and the French Dassault Mirage IV, Hancock decided that the swing-wing TFX, forerunner of the General Dynamics F-111, would be the aircraft best suited for this role. However, as the TFX had not yet flown, he recommended purchase of the already operational Vigilante to counteract a perceived imminent threat from Indonesia. In the event, the Federal Government did not go ahead with an immediate replacement for the Canberra, and Hancock's original choice of the TFX was taken up as a long-term solution, leading to Australia's agreement in October to purchase the F-111C. The same month, as Konfrontasi continued to simmer, Hancock approved simplification to the rules of engagement for Australian CAC Sabre fighters based at RAAF Butterworth to engage and destroy Indonesian aircraft violating Malay air space. The following month he urged using RAAF Canberras from Butterworth to make pre-emptive strikes against Indonesian air bases, in retaliation for incursions into West Malaysia, but Britain, which had initially requested Australia's involvement, held back on action.|$|E
2500|$|A crucial {{reason for}} Skybolt's {{survival}} was the support it garnered from Britain. Blue Streak was cancelled on 24 February 1960, {{subject to a}} adequate replacement being procured from the US. An initial solution appeared to be Skybolt, which combined the range of Blue Streak with the mobile basing of the Blue Steel, and was small enough that two could be carried on the Vulcan bomber. This would improve the <b>deterrent</b> <b>capability</b> of the UK's V bomber force, and extend its useful life into the late 1960s and early 1970s. Like the USAF, the RAF was concerned that ballistic missiles could eventually replace manned bombers. An institutional challenge came from the [...] United States Navy, which was developing a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), the UGM-27 Polaris. The US Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, kept the First Sea Lord, Lord Mountbatten, appraised of its development. By moving the deterrent out to sea, Polaris offered {{the prospect of a}} deterrent that was invulnerable to a first strike, and reduced the risk of a nuclear strike on the British Isles. The British Nuclear Deterrent Study Group (BNDSG) produced a study that argued that SLBM technology was as yet unproven, that Polaris would be expensive, and that given the time it would take to build the boats, it could not be deployed before the early 1970s. The Cabinet Defence Committee approved the acquisition of Skybolt in February 1960.|$|E

In secret negotiations that began in 1969 Washington sought unrestricted use of its bases for possible conventional combat operations in Korea, Taiwan, and South Vietnam, as well as the emergency re-entry and transit rights of nuclear weapons. However anti-nuclear sentiment was strong in Japan and the government wanted the U.S. to remove all nuclear weapons from Okinawa. In the end, the United States and Japan agreed to maintain bases that would allow the continuation of American <b>deterrent</b> <b>capabilities</b> in East Asia.

50|$|Nuclear {{strike is}} the ability of nuclear forces to rapidly and {{accurately}} strike targets which the enemy holds dear in a devastating manner. If a crisis occurs, rapid generation and, if necessary, deployment of nuclear strike capabilities will demonstrate US resolve and may prompt an adversary to alter the course of action deemed threatening to our national interest. Should deterrence fail, the President may authorize a precise, tailored response to terminate the conflict at the lowest possible level and lead to a rapid cessation of hostilities. Post-conflict, regeneration of a credible nuclear <b>deterrent</b> <b>capability</b> will deter further aggression. The Air Force may present a credible force posture in either the Continental United States, within a theater of operations, or both to effectively deter the range of potential adversaries envisioned in the 21st century. This requires the ability to engage targets globally using a variety of methods; therefore, the Air Force should possess the ability to induct, train, assign, educate and exercise individuals and units to rapidly and effectively execute missions that support US NDO objectives. Finally, the Air Force regularly exercises and evaluates all aspects of nuclear operations to ensure high levels of performance.|$|E
5000|$|Project Nobska was a 1956 summer {{study on}} anti-submarine warfare (ASW) for the United States Navy ordered by Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Arleigh Burke. It is also {{referred}} to as the Nobska Study, named for its location on Nobska Point near the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The focus was on the ASW implications of nuclear submarines, particularly on new technologies to defend against them. The study was coordinated by the Committee on Undersea Warfare (CUW) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). It was notable for including 73 representatives from numerous organizations involved in submarine design, submarine-related fields, and weapons design, including senior scientists from the Atomic Energy Commission's nuclear weapons laboratories. Among the participants were Nobel laureate Isidor Rabi, Paul Nitze, and Edward Teller. The study's recommendations influenced all subsequent US Navy submarine designs, as well as submarine-launched ASW tactical nuclear weapons until this weapon type was phased out in the late 1980s.

40|$|South Asia's {{strategic}} {{stability is}} embroiled with deep rooted trust deficit, technological arms race, sub-conventional war trends and evolving doctrines. In {{the absence of}} sustainable dialogue process, the strategic anxieties of both India and Pakistan have consolidated into aggressive force postures leaving little room for shared learning. Instead of forging grounds to seek resolution to the bilateral disputes (complex learning), both states have adapted new means to pursue their existing state policies (simple learning). The drivers of nuclear learning in South Asia are primarily assessed at three levels of analyses i. e. individual, organizational level which directly affects the third tier i. e. the state level. Over the years, the state institutions in two countries have evolved following parochial interests eventually giving birth to rigid organizational cultures. Moreover, the idiosyncratic role of key decision makers remained vital in determining the military crises in both pre and post- 1998 eras. Each military crisis is different in its backdrop, occurrence and termination from its preceding event. The reason being, each military crisis taught different lessons to either state, subject to different interpretations drawn by the decision makers on both sides. Hence, unlearning {{at the individual level}} is responsible for shaping a peculiar strategic culture of South Asia promoting crisis instability. It is important to explore the factors determining crisis behavior in the region while the two states have operationalized their <b>deterrent</b> <b>capabilities</b> and pursuing assured second strike pathways. Ideally, the acquisition of nuclear weapons should have inculcated enough confidence in both states to transform their 'enduring rivalry'into a new relationship having greater credence on nuclear deterrence. In reality, both states have used nuclear shield to pursue their existing state practices thus, complicating deterrence stability in the region (stability-instability paradox). The study analyses the lag in nuclear learning as a determinant of crisis instability. One of the key levels of analysis is the individual level reiterating the role of strong personalities operating at different tiers of decision making remained involved in crises eruption. Interestingly, the 'culture of secrecy'that shrouded in the development of nuclear programs of both the countries is eventually found a key factor for confining the nuclear decision making circle. This explains the inconsistent policies and risk prone behavior as a direct outcome of nuclear unlearning by the state due to incompetent judgment of the individuals facing security paranoia and organizational pathologies in the concerned bureaucracies. The recurrence of military crises is explained through the prism of nuclear learning, constructivism and cognitive dissonance in shaping a strategic culture conducive for crisis instability...|$|R
