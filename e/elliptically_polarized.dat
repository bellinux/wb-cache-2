5|$|The chiral pitch, p, {{refers to}} the {{distance}} over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360° twist (but note that {{the structure of the}} chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0° and ±180° are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the wavelength of visible light. This causes these systems to exhibit unique optical properties, such as Bragg reflection and low-threshold laser emission, and these properties are exploited in a number of optical applications. For the case of Bragg reflection only the lowest-order reflection is allowed if the light is incident along the helical axis, whereas for oblique incidence higher-order reflections become permitted. Cholesteric liquid crystals also exhibit the unique property that they reflect circularly polarized light when it is incident along the helical axis and <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarized</b> if it comes in obliquely.|$|E

25|$|Note {{that this}} {{principle}} only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the Brewster angle) will still emerge as right handed, but <b>elliptically,</b> <b>polarized.</b> Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may {{be solved by}} decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the plane of incidence, commonly denoted p and s respectively. The reflected components in the p and s linear polarizations are found by applying the Fresnel coefficients of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, {{where there is no}} distinction between p and s, are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{important}} special case of reflection {{at normal incidence}} (not involving anisotropic materials) there is no particular s or p polarization. Both the x and y polarization components are reflected identically, and therefore the polarization of the reflected wave is identical {{to that of the}} incident wave. However, in the case of circular (or elliptical) polarization, the handedness of the polarization state is thereby reversed, since by convention this is specified relative to the direction of propagation. The circular rotation of the electric field around the x-y axes called [...] "right-handed" [...] for a wave in the +z direction is [...] "left-handed" [...] for a wave in the -z direction. But in the general case of reflection at a nonzero angle of incidence, no such generalization can be made. For instance, right-circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at a grazing angle, will still be right-handed (but <b>elliptically)</b> <b>polarized.</b> Linear polarized light reflected from a metal at non-normal incidence will generally become <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarized.</b> These cases are handled using Jones vectors acted upon by the different Fresnel coefficients for the s and p polarization components.|$|E

It was designed to provide four polarization modes: circular, elliptical, horizontal and vertical. In addition first tests were carried out to provide linear polarization with arbitrary orientation (between ver-tical and horizontal). The following sections will focus on measurements of the influence the EPU has on the elec-tron beam (e. g. betatron tunes, chromaticity, coupling, or-bit) and which correction methods {{have been developed to}} minimize them. ...|$|R
2500|$|If [...] {{denotes the}} {{polarization}} vector {{of the wave}} exiting the waveplate, then this expression shows that the angle between [...] and [...] is −θ.

2500|$|A full-wave plate {{introduces}} a phase difference of exactly one wavelength {{between the two}} polarization directions, for one wavelength of light. In optical mineralogy, {{it is common to}} use a full-wave plate designed for green light (wavelength = 540nbsp&nm). Linearly polarized white light which passes through the plate becomes <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarized,</b> except for 540nbsp&nm light which will remain linear. If a linear polarizer oriented perpendicular to the original polarization is added, this green wavelength is fully extinguished but elements of the other colors remain. This means that under these conditions the plate will appear an intense shade of red-violet, sometimes known as [...] "sensitive tint". This gives rise to this plate's alternative names, the sensitive-tint plate or (less commonly) red-tint plate. These plates are widely used in mineralogy to aid in identification of minerals in thin sections of rocks.|$|E

[...] This set up requires the rotation of the analyzer and polarizer in order to achieve null conditions. [...] The ellipsometric null condition is obtained when A is perpendicular with respect to the polarization axis of the reflected light achieving complete destructive interference, i.e., the state at which the absolute minimum of light flux is detected at the CCD camera. The angles of P, C, and A obtained are used to determine the Ψ and Δ values of the material.|$|E
40|$|Since about 5 years, Apple-II type <b>Elliptically</b> <b>Polarizing</b> Undulators (EPU) {{have been}} used very {{successfully}} at the ALS to generate high brightness photon beams with arbitrary polarization.

2500|$|Ellipsometry {{can also}} be done as imaging {{ellipsometry}} by using a CCD camera as a detector. This provides a real time contrast image of the sample, which provides information about film thickness and refractive index. Advanced imaging ellipsometer technology operates {{on the principle of}} classical null ellipsometry and real-time ellipsometric contrast imaging. [...] Imaging ellipsometry is based on the concept of nulling. [...] In ellipsometry, the film under investigation is placed onto a reflective substrate. [...] The film and the substrate have different refractive indexes. [...] In order to obtain data about film thickness, the light reflecting off of the substrate must be nulled. [...] Nulling is achieved by adjusting the analyzer and polarizer so that all reflected light off of the substrate is extinguished. [...] Due to the difference in refractive indexes, this will allow the sample to become very bright and clearly visible. The light source consists of a monochromatic laser of the desired wavelength. A common wavelength that is used is 532nm green laser light. [...] Since only intensity of light measurements are needed, almost any type of camera can be implemented as the CCD, which is useful if building an ellipsometer from parts. [...] Typically, imaging ellipsometers are configured in such a way so that the laser (L) fires a beam of light which immediately passes through a linear polarizer (P). [...] The linearly polarized light then passes through a quarter wavelength compensator (C) which transforms the light into <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarized</b> light. [...] This <b>elliptically</b> <b>polarized</b> light then reflects off the sample (S), passes through the analyzer (A) and is imaged onto a CCD camera by a long working distance objective. The analyzer here is another polarizer identical to the P, however, this polarizer serves to help quantify the change in polarization and is thus given the name analyzer. [...] This design is commonly referred to as a LPCSA configuration.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of antennas are linearly polarized. In fact it can be shown from considerations of symmetry that an antenna that lies entirely in a plane which also includes the observer, can only have its polarization {{in the direction of}} that plane. This applies to many cases, allowing one to easily infer such an antenna's polarization at an intended direction of propagation. So a typical rooftop Yagi or log-periodic antenna with horizontal conductors, as viewed from a second station toward the horizon, is necessarily horizontally polarized. But a vertical [...] "whip antenna" [...] or AM broadcast tower used as an antenna element (again, for observers horizontally displaced from it) will transmit in the vertical polarization. A turnstile antenna with its four arms in the horizontal plane, likewise transmits horizontally polarized radiation toward the horizon. However, when that same turnstile antenna is used in the [...] "axial mode" [...] (upwards, for the same horizontally-oriented structure) its radiation is circularly polarized.
