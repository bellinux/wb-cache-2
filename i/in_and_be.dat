5|$|This loss led Tiku to {{reinforce}} his men. The Torajan troops were armed with rifles, spears, boulders, swords, and chili pepper extract, sprayed into enemy {{eyes with a}} device called a tirik lada, or blowgun, to blind them. Tiku himself was armed with a Portuguese rifle, spear, and labo. He wore protective armour, a sepu (crotch guard), and a songkok with protrusions {{in the shape of}} buffalo horns, and carried a decorated shield. With his soldiers, Tiku dug pits filled with bamboo stakes along Dutch supply routes; those who wandered over the pits would fall <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> impaled. However, these were not enough to stop the advancing Dutch. On 17 October 1906, two more fortresses, Bamba Puang and Kotu, fell, after several unsuccessful Dutch attacks since June. As the campaign against Tiku, which had already lasted longer than most other campaigns in the occupation, was thought to undermine Dutch authority in Sulawesi, Governor-General J. B. van Heutsz dispatched Governor of Sulawesi Swart to personally lead the attack.|$|E

Even as a grown woman, returning to her Dominican roots, Yolanda finds she can never truly escape the fear that has hovered over her {{for as long as}} she can remember. This is evident in the very first chapter, [...] "Antojos", as Alvarez reveals the panic evoked in the adult Yolanda at the sudden realization that she is stranded in a guava field in the Dominican Republic, where women do not go about unchaperoned at night. Alvarez evokes Yolanda's fear as she reports that [...] "the rustling leaves of the guava trees echo the warnings of her old aunts: you will get lost, you will get kidnapped, you will get raped, you will get killed".|$|E
500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. I think she would be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E

[...] At his first meeting with the band, Shirley described the songs played for him as having [...] "the same old jammy, shuffle feel of the last two records. [...] I stopped them then and I said to them... 'You've got to feel like you're teenagers again. You need a song like that.'" [...] Shirley's prompting led the band to write [...] "Kickin' My Heart Around" [...] on the spot, before he had signed on to produce. [...] Rich agreed that Shirley shifted the focus to making [...] "a rock record" [...] that was [...] "focused and concise".|$|E

500|$|... "The Other Woman" [...] {{contains}} Jack and Juliet's second kiss. [...] Juliet {{was conceived}} by the writers {{as the next}} possible love interest for Jack {{after the death of}} the second season character Ana Lucia Cortez (Michelle Rodriguez). [...] Fans hated Ana Lucia so the writers did not pursue the romantic story arc. [...] Mitchell guesses that her character was created because [...] "they needed a bridge between Ben and everyone else, and they needed someone to come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> a little salt in the oyster of Jack and Kate." [...] She believes that Juliet did genuinely fall in love with Jack, but not knowing whether [...] "her attraction to Jack or her willingness to do anything to get off the island" [...] is more important to her. [...] Juliet forms something of a [...] "love rectangle" [...] with Jack, Kate and Sawyer. [...] Mitchell [...] "feel like [...] a very grown-up relationship. [...] They seem to really respect and like each other", whereas Sawyer and Kate are like [...] "rambunctious teenagers".

500|$|The scene wherein Peppermint Butler teaches Finn and Jake {{to enter}} {{the land of the}} dead by {{crossing}} their eyes and staring at a corner was inspired by a story that Moynihan's father told him when he was younger. According to the artist, his father told him that if you [...] "concentrate really hard enough", you would [...] "walk into another dimension". Moynihan recalled the story when he was storyboarding, and worked it into the episode. The climax featuring Death and Finn engaging in a musical competition was specifically written so as to not be [...] "corny". According to Ward, scenes featuring contests were often avoided because they were [...] "the easiest traps to fall into when you're writing an outline". For [...] "Death in Bloom", the writing staff realized that a contest would work towards the story's strengths. In original drafts of the episode, Finn and Jake were guided through the Land of the Dead by a mysterious rabbit. Sanchez continually felt that the rabbit was misplaced in the episode. When it came time to revise the story, the rabbit was inevitably cut because it was agreed by the writers and series staff that the character did not fit within the story. The rabbit's role was later partially replaced by an ominous talking skull that tries to get Jake to drink from the [...] "River of Forgetfulness". According to storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar, a rough draft for the original ending featured Princess Bubblegum becoming a man without the Princess Plant. Moynihan later noted that the writers were being a [...] "little reckless" [...] when it was pitched, and Ward joked that he had to step <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> [...] "quality control" [...] to prevent the idea from making it into the final episode.|$|E

2500|$|Due to {{his time}} {{working on the}} Trump {{campaign}} {{and the fact that}} he previously worked for politicians in Russia, Caputo was contacted by the United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence on May 9, 2017, as part of their investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election. The House Intelligence Committee requested Caputo come <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>be</b> interviewed voluntarily and submit to the Committee relevant documents associated with their investigation. During a March 20, 2017 hearing, Representative Jackie Speier questioned FBI Director James Comey about Caputo, and cited employment with Gazprom and history in Ukraine. Caputo worked with the House Intelligence Committee in order to acquiesce to their queries. Posting to social media, Caputo denied ties to Russia while on the Trump campaign. Caputo told the House Intelligence Committee: [...] "The only time the President and I talked about Russia was in 2013, when he simply asked me in passing what it was like to live there in the context of a dinner conversation." [...] Caputo hired attorney Dennis Vacco to represent him during the investigation, and subsequently stated that he had liquidated his children's college funds to pay Vacco.|$|E
