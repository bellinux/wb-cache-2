The counterbalance passed under the main cradle, which carried trucks on three transverse tracks, at the midway point.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out on the cooling and {{crystallization}} along an inclined plane of aqueous solutions of Na,CO, in order to investigate convective effects and the development of compositional zonation. The formation of crystals of NaaCO,. lOH,O causes adjacent fluid to become relatively light because it is depleted in Na,COs. When crystallization occurs at an inclined roof the behaviour is similar to previous results for crystallization and the release of light fluid at a vertical boundary. A compositional boundary layer of light residual fluid flows along the sloping roof and forms an upper region of strong chemical stratification. This gradient region increases in depth with time and is separated by a sharp interface from a region of homogeneous solution below. Eventually the whole depth of fluid becomes chemically stratified. When crystallization occurs along an <b>inclined</b> <b>floor</b> thin plumes of light residual fluid rise vertically from the slope with strong compositional boundary layer flows up the slope. The combination of this boundary flow and the horizontal variation in the length of the plumes leads to development of compositional stratification throughout the solution. A steep gradient develops at the top which grades down into a weaker gradient in the central and lower region. The shape and magnitude of the chemical gradients depend on the geometry of the tank adjacent to the slope. Stronger compositional gradients are developed in tanks with larger ratios of width to depth. The experiments suggest that compositional zoning can develop in magma chambers by crystallization along an <b>inclined</b> <b>floor</b> even if the angle is quite small.

Retrogressive thaw slumps – {{also referred to as}} thermo-cirques – represent a highly dynamic geomorphologic feature in ice-rich permafrost regions. These rapidly forming landforms consist of a steep headwall surrounding a gently <b>inclined</b> slump <b>floor</b> where sediment erosion and accumulation takes place simulatenously and develop as a result of rapid permafrost thaw over several decades. Thaw slumps are commonly found in permafrost areas with near-surface, thick ground-ice layers that are susceptible to thermo-denudation and subsequent mass displacement through cryogenic landslides (Leibman et al., 2008). Thaw slumps are particularly frequent along riverbanks and coastlines in the Northwest American and West Siberian Arctic, where they are typically initiated by lateral erosion of the bluff toe. In these regions, buried glacier ice (massive ground ice) bodies or ice-rich glacial till have been mapped. Given their exceptional size of up to 40 ha in area and 25 m high headwalls, so-called mega slumps in northwestern Canada represent primary terrain destabilization features with different environmental settings than surrounding areas (Lantuit et al., 2012), but are a significant source for sediment and solute delivery to adjacent lakes and streams (Kokelj et al., 2013).

40|$|At {{preliminary}} design stage, the global mechanical behavior of large marine vessels such as container ships {{has previously been}} analyzed idealizing them as a classical beam. These structures are complex and a classical beam idealization significantly compromises important structural behavior associated with cross section warping or in-plane displacements. On the other hand, 3 D Finite Element (FE) models have been utilized which are accurate in capturing these details but pose high computational cost. In present work, structural analyses of marine vessels with realistic boundary conditions have been presented using well-known Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF). Using CUF, higher order theories can be implemented without the need of ad-hoc formulations. The finite element arrays are written in terms of fundamental nuclei for 1 D beam elements that are independent of problem characteristics and the approximation order. Thus, refined models can be developed in an automatic manner. In the present work, the beam cross sections are discretized using elements with Lagrange polynomials and the FE model is regarded as Component-Wise (CW), allowing one to model complex 3 D features, such as <b>inclined</b> hull walls, <b>floors</b> and girders {{in the form of}} components. The work is mainly divided in two parts: Hull in vacuo (in absence of water) and Hull with Hydrostatic Stiffness (in presence of water). The former involves static and dynamic structural analyses of hulls with realistic geometries without the effect of water. The later involves static and dynamic analyses of realistic hull geometries that are supported by buoyancy springs. The stiffness of buoyancy springs is made part of the fundamental nuclei and the corresponding FEM matrices for hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads are obtained. The hydrodynamic loads have been considered in the form of Radiation Wave loads which include damping and added mass effects. Utilization of Component-Wise (CW) model under hydrodynamic loads has afforded an ease in modelling the complex geometrical configurations such as realistic boat shapes and the dynamic response analyses of aircraft carrier due to moving aircraft. All the analyses have been validated with published literature and their computational efficacy is established through their comparison with the results from commercial code...|$|R

This thesis {{is part of the}} research work initiated by CSIRO Australia. Experimental and numerical model studies are carried out at UQ to understand the tsunami effects on the seabed especially continental slope and continental shelf. Solitary waves are considered to represent the leading waves of a tsunami. Breaking and non-breaking solitary waves over smooth and rough beds (d 50 = 0. 2 mm) were generated in the laboratory and the corresponding shear stresses were measured using a Shear Plate apparatus. A physical model was set up in the laboratory that represented the deep horizontal ocean <b>floor,</b> <b>inclined</b> continental slope and the shallow horizontal continental shelf. Measurements of bed shear stress, surface elevation and flow velocities were carried out. Periodic waves were also generated and the bed shear stresses measured over a horizontal bed were found to be comparable with the earlier studies and theoretical estimates. The total force (sum of bed shear stress and pressure gradient force) measured using the shear plate is important in determining the stability of submarine sediment and in sheet flow regimes. The bed shear stresses generated by breaking and non-breaking solitary waves were in laminar and transitional flow regimes (~ 10 ^ 4 < Re < ~ 10 ^ 5), and showed reversal of sign during the deceleration phase of the solitary wave, although the flow did not change its direction. The non-breaking solitary wave height to still water depth ratio over the horizontal smooth bed varied between 0. 12 and 0. 68. The maximum near bed velocity varied between 0. 16 m/s and 0. 51 m/s and the peak positive total shear stress varied between 0. 386 N/m^ 2 and 2. 06 N/m^ 2. The maximum positive total shear stress magnitudes over smooth bed were observed to increase up the slope and further on the shelf for a given h/d ratio. For rough bed cases, the peak positive total shear stress was an order of magnitude larger than that of smooth bed cases, with increasing peak positive total shear stress as the wave propagated up slope. Wave friction factors are found to vary depending on the choice of normalizing velocity used in the drag law, i. e., either using the maximum velocity, as is conventional, or the instantaneous velocity corresponding to the shear stress. To understand the impact of the phase difference of the velocity and shear stress on friction factors, friction factors were estimated from bed shear stress at different instances over the wave, viz., time of maximum positive total shear stress, maximum bed shear stress and at the time of maximum velocity, using both the maximum velocity and the instantaneous velocity at that phase of the wave cycle. Friction factors are consistent with previous data for monochromatic waves, and are found to vary inversely with the square-root of the Reynolds number. The phase difference between the maximum bed shear stress and the maximum velocity was about 30 ° for the smooth horizontal bed and it was about 38 ° for the rough horizontal bed. The median phase difference for the sloping bed was between 24 ° to 28 ° and for the horizontal bed beyond the slope was about 34 °. A convolution model forced with the measured free stream acceleration is used to predict total and bed shear stresses. The peak positive value of the total and bed shear stresses are considered for comparison between measurements and model results. Modelled and measured peak positive bed shear stresses correlated well with the measurements for the horizontal bed data. However, for the sloping bed region, the model generally resulted in under estimation of the bed shear stress, few reasons could be attributed to changing eddy viscosity during upslope flow propagation or could be due to excessive estimation of the pressure gradient forces. For the rough bed cases, the model behaved similarly to that over the smooth bed, with appropriate roughness incorporated in the model. However, the model did not predict well for breaking wave conditions. Due to the inherent formulation of the convolution model, it is found that the model fails for steady flow cases. Further work related to a comprehensive model including steady flow and unsteady flow would be required. The convolution model and conventional drag law model to estimate the shear stress are applied to tsunami induced flow over the slope and shelf region of the northwest Australian (NWA) coast and the south east Indian coast. MIKE 3 - a 3 D hydrodynamic numerical model was used to obtain the tsunami induced flow field. The results suggest that tsunami is highly likely to induce significant sediment mobility at shallower depths. However, to identify the hotspots of high sediment mobility which could trigger submarine slides, careful study is required since the tsunami induced flow field is site specific...|$|R

I am not a sailor, and don't know anything about ships. I went as passenger, {{and there was another}} one named William Anderson, and his son Sam, a boy about fifteen years old. We were all going to Valparaiso on business. I don't remember just how many days we were out, nor do I know just where we were, but it was somewhere off the coast of South America, when, one dark night--with a fog besides, for aught I know, for I was asleep--we ran into a steamer coming north. How we managed to do this, with room enough on both sides for all the ships in the world to pass, I don't know; but so it was. When I got on deck the other vessel had gone on, and we never saw anything more of her. Whether she sunk or got home is something I can't tell. But we pretty soon found that the 'Thomas Hyke' had some of the plates in her bow badly smashed, and she took in water like a thirsty dog. The captain had the forward water-tight bulkhead shut tight, and the pumps set to work, but it was no use. That forward compartment just filled up with water, and the 'Thomas Hyke' settled down with her bow clean under. Her deck was slanting forward like the side of a hill, and the propeller was lifted up so that it wouldn't have worked even if the engine had been kept going. The captain had the masts cut away, thinking this might bring her up some, but it didn't help much. There was a pretty heavy sea on, and the waves came rolling up the slant of the deck like the surf on the sea-shore. The captain gave orders to have all the hatches battened down so that water couldn't get in, and the only way by which anybody could go below was by the cabin door, which was far aft. This work of stopping up all openings in the deck was a dangerous business, for the decks sloped right down into the water, and if anybody had slipped, away he'd have gone into the ocean, with nothing to stop him; but the men made a line fast to themselves, and worked away with a good will, and soon got the deck and the house over the engine as tight as a bottle. The smoke-stack, which was well forward, had been broken down by a spar when the masts had been cut, and as the waves washed into the hole that it left, the captain had this plugged up with old sails, well fastened down. It was a dreadful thing to see the ship a-lying with her bows clean under water and her stern sticking up. If it hadn't been for her water-tight compartments that were left uninjured, she would have gone down to the bottom as slick as a whistle. On the afternoon of the day after the collision the wind fell, and the sea soon became pretty smooth. The captain was quite sure {{that there would be no}} trouble about keeping afloat until some ship came along and took us off. Our flag was flying, upside down, from a pole in the stern; and if anybody saw a ship making such a guy of herself as the 'Thomas Hyke' was then doing, they'd be sure to come to see what was the matter with her, even if she had no flag of distress flying. We tried to make ourselves as comfortable as we could, but this wasn't easy with everything on such a dreadful slant. But that night we heard a rumbling and grinding noise down in the hold, and the slant seemed to get worse. Pretty soon the captain roused all hands and told us that the cargo of pig-iron was shifting and sliding down to the bow, and that it wouldn't be long before it would break through all the bulkheads, and then we'd fill and go to the bottom like a shot. He said we must all take to the boats and get away as quick as we could. It was an easy matter launching the boats. They didn't lower them outside from the davits, but they just let 'em down on deck and slid 'em along forward into the water, and then held 'em there with a rope till everything was ready to start. They launched three boats, put plenty of provisions and water in 'em, and then everybody began to get aboard. But William Anderson and me and his son Sam couldn't make up our minds to get into those boats and row out on the dark, wide ocean. They were the biggest boats we had, but still they were little things enough. The ship seemed to us to be a good deal safer, and more likely to be seen when day broke, than those three boats, which might be blown off, if the wind rose, nobody knew where. It seemed to us that the cargo had done all the shifting it intended to, for the noise below had stopped; and, altogether, we agreed that we'd rather stick to the ship than go off in those boats. The captain he tried to make us go, but we wouldn't do it; and he told us if we chose to stay behind and be drowned it was our affair and he couldn't help it; and then he said there was a small boat aft, and we'd better launch her, and have her ready in case things should get worse and we should make up our minds to leave the vessel. He and the rest then rowed off so as not to be caught in the vortex if the steamer went down, and we three stayed aboard. We launched the small boat in the way we'd seen the others launched, being careful to have ropes tied to us while we were doing it; and we put things aboard that we thought we should want. Then we went into the cabin and waited for morning. It was a queer kind of a cabin, with a <b>floor</b> <b>inclined</b> like the roof of a house; but we sat down in the corners, and were glad to be there. The swinging lamp was burning, and it was a good deal more cheerful in there than it was outside. But, about daybreak, the grinding and rumbling down below began again, and the bow of the 'Thomas Hyke' kept going down more and more; and it wasn't long before the forward bulkhead of the cabin, which was what you might call its front wall when everything was all right, was under our feet, as level as a floor, and the lamp was lying close against the ceiling that it was hanging from. You may be sure that we thought it was time to get out of that. There were benches with arms to them fastened to the floor, and by these we climbed up to the foot of the cabin stairs, which, being turned bottom upward, we went down in order to get out. When we reached the cabin door we saw part of the deck below us, standing up like the side of a house that is built in the water, as they say the houses in Venice are. We had made our boat fast to the cabin door by a long line, and now we saw her floating quietly on the water, which was very smooth and about twenty feet below us. We drew her up as close under us as we could, and then we let the boy Sam down by a rope, and after some kicking and swinging he got into her; and then he took the oars and kept her right under us while we scrambled down by the ropes which we had used in getting her ready. As soon as we were in the boat we cut her rope and pulled away as hard as we could; and when we got to what we thought was a safe distance we stopped to look at the 'Thomas Hyke.' You never saw such a ship in all your born days. Two thirds of the hull was sunk in the water, and she was standing straight up and down with the stern in the air, her rudder up as high as the topsail ought to be, and the screw propeller looking like the wheel on the top of one of these windmills that they have in the country for pumping up water. Her cargo had shifted so far forward that it had turned her right upon end, but she couldn't sink, owing to the air in the compartments that the water hadn't got into; and on the top of the whole thing was the distress flag flying from the pole which stuck out over the stern. It was broad daylight, but not a thing did we see of the other boats. We'd supposed that they wouldn't row very far, but would lay off at a safe distance until daylight; but they must have been scared and rowed farther than they intended. Well, sir, we stayed in that boat all day and watched the 'Thomas Hyke'; but she just kept as she was and didn't seem to sink an inch. There was no use of rowing away, for we had no place to row to; and besides, we thought that passing ships would be much more likely to see that stern sticking high in the air than our little boat. We had enough to eat, and at night two of us slept while the other watched, dividing off the time and taking turns to this. In the morning there was the 'Thomas Hyke' standing stern up just as before. There was a long swell on the ocean now, and she'd rise and lean over a little on each wave, but she'd come up again just as straight as before. That night passed as the last one had, and in the morning we found we'd drifted a good deal farther from the 'Thomas Hyke'; but she was floating just as she had been, like a big buoy that's moored over a sandbar. We couldn't see a sign of the boats, and we about gave them up. We had our breakfast, which was a pretty poor meal, being nothing but hardtack and what was left of a piece of boiled beef. After we'd sat for a while doing nothing, but feeling mighty uncomfortable, William Anderson said, 'Look here, do you know that I think we would be three fools to keep on shivering all night, and living on hardtack in the daytime, when there's plenty on that vessel for us to eat and to keep us warm. If she's floated that way for two days and two nights, there's no knowing how much longer she'll float, and we might as well go on board and get the things we want as not.' 'All right,' said I, for I was tired doing nothing; and Sam was as willing as anybody. So we rowed up to the steamer, and stopped close to the deck, which, as I said before, was standing straight up out of the water like the wall of a house. The cabin door, which was the only opening into her, was about twenty feet above us, and the ropes which we had tied to the rails of the stairs inside were still hanging down. Sam was an active youngster, and he managed to climb up one of these ropes; but when he got to the door he drew it up and tied knots in it about a foot apart, and then he let|$|R
