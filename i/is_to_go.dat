5|$|According to flashbacks {{during the}} game, Squall {{grew up in}} an orphanage with the other playable {{characters}} (except Rinoa). The orphans were cared for by Edea; although Squall remembers little about his past, he becomes an emotionally detached, cynical and introverted boy whose original goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through life without any emotional ties or dependence. He gradually warms, and it is later revealed that his detachment from his companions is a defensive mechanism to protect himself from the emotional pain he suffered when he and his older sister were separated.|$|E
5|$|Four middle-aged {{friends who}} {{have known each other}} since sixth form, Baxter (John Simm), Quinn (Philip Glenister), Rick (Marc Warren) and Woody (Max Beesley), get {{together}} for a holiday in Majorca at the villa of Alvo (Ben Chaplin), a mutual friend who became wealthy in the property business. Over time Alvo's behaviour becomes increasingly erratic, and he is later killed by a man in a Tony Blair mask for taking a drug boat the group used earlier. The four clean the boat to remove evidence of their presence, when they are mistaken for drug dealers and paid three million euros. Afterwards, the four learn from María (María Botto), a local detective, that they are caught up in a Serbian mafia drug smuggling operation. Using video camera footage of their holiday, Baxter learns the real perpetrators are corrupt police officers, including María and her superior Dominic (Tim Woodward). Alvo is revealed {{to be a part of}} the operation, and was murdered when he no longer wanted to take part in it. María later attempts to kill the four when employing scare tactics to make them part with the cash fails to work, but is shot to death by Quinn. The other three run over Dominic to save Quinn. They leave with the money and accidentally board a ferry to Ibiza (their intention <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Barcelona).|$|E

5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if they die as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning player or team will have to face a new opponent. If the player or team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E

A law passed in 2010 provides an appropriate mechanism, the Innovation and Prosperity Fund. According to the fund’s president, Behzad Soltani, 4600 billion Iranian rials (circa US$171.4 million) had been allocated to 100 knowledge-based companies by late 2014. Public and private universities wishing to set up private firms may also apply to the fund.|$|E
25|$|When Daniels's unit is re-formed to {{investigate}} stevedore union boss Frank Sobotka, Rawls refuses to allow McNulty {{to rejoin the}} team. McNulty seems to accept this with good grace, but tries to help the detail unofficially. Daniels persuades Rawls to let McNulty return by taking on the murders of the fourteen women. McNulty's first assignment <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> undercover as a client visiting a local brothel, much to the amusement of his colleagues. He also flirts with Russell, who has been assigned to Daniels' detail, though he seems {{to shy away from}} a relationship.|$|E

It turns out that Camões had returned from his expedition to save the settlement. Pilar gives Camões his poem back, but again he is exiled. Before the Irishman sets sail to Hong Kong, he trails the half-Chinese daughter of a Portuguese governor. He is despondent since {{he was unable to}} help or harbor the spirit of the other who sought refuge in him. His final plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> straight into China, from Shanghai.|$|E
60|$|Well, {{the whole}} thing was arranged, and they {{proceeded}} to carry the picnic into effect. It was settled that some <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> by land, though the descent from the cliffs <b>to</b> the cove <b>was</b> not an easy or safe one. Others <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> by water, and the water-party was sub-divided into two bands. One band, which included Susannah and the amazing baby, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> in canoes; the other <b>was</b> <b>to</b> swim. The distance by water might be about eight miles, but that was a mere trifle to the Pitcairners, some of whom could swim right round their island.|$|R

25|$|Then the swimmer shrugs their {{shoulders}} and throws their arms and shoulders forward, lunging cat-like {{back into the water}} (though the emphasis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> forward, not down). As the swimmer sinks, they arch their back, and kicks. Timing is very important in order for the kick to transfer all of its force via the arched back, but the optimum time is when the arms are 3/4 extended. Then the swimmer kicks and presses on their chest, undulating a little underwater, and squeezing the gluteus maximus to prevent the legs and feet from rising out of the water. The swimmer has now returned to the streamlined position, and the cycle starts again.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{a council}} {{has been called}} between the Free Peoples of Middle-earth to {{determine}} {{the fate of the}} One Ring.

The fellowship set out, attempting to cross the Misty Mountains vis the Pass of Caradhras. However, a storm called forth by Gandalf's former friend, the wizard Saruman, now an ally of Sauron, closes the pass.

One day, Dorothy and Toto are caught up in a cyclone that {{deposits}} her farmhouse into Munchkin Country in the magical Land of Oz. The falling house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East, the evil ruler of the Munchkins. The Good Witch of the North arrives with three other grateful Munchkins and gives Dorothy the magical Silver Shoes that once belonged to the Wicked witch. The Good Witch tells Dorothy that the only way she can return home <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to the Emerald City and ask the great and powerful Wizard of Oz to help her. As Dorothy embarks on her journey, the Good Witch of the North kisses her on the forehead, giving her magical protection from harm.|$|E

They reluctantly decide the only way past the Misty Mountains <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> under them, via the dwarven mines of Moria. In Moria, they fight off orcs as they pass through the chambers. Near the exit, they are attacked by a Balrog. Gandalf stands against it, defeating it by destroying the bridge on which it is standing. However, as it falls, it catches Gandalf with its whip, pulling him down after it. The distraught party leave Moria, entering Lothlórien, and meeting Galadriel (Jennifer Hale). She takes Frodo to see the Mirror of Galadriel, where he sees images of the coming War of the Ring. Frodo offers her the One Ring and although she is tempted, she turns it down, explaining that his resistance to its evil is because he has never tried {{to use it to}} control others.|$|E

Inside, Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) is horrified to learn that his cousin Balin is dead. In the Chamber of Mazarbul, the Fellowship finds Balin's tomb and a record of how the dwarves lost the mine to the goblins. The fellowship is then attacked by a hoard of goblins and a cave troll. The party manage to fight off their attackers {{and get to the}} exit, but on their way across the Bridge of Khazad-dûm they are confronted by a Balrog, and Gandalf (Ian McKellen) sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape.|$|E
