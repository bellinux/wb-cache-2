For instance, more than one in five households in Umutara <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> hour away from its water source. This has implications for the quality of women's and girls' lives, their economic productivity and their access to education. Even where people statistically do have access to an improved water source such as a communal borehole that in some cases is shared by up to 175 families, they sometimes have to wait for more than four hours before they can get water.|$|E

2500|$|Aside from Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, {{laws that}} Hawkins was {{instrumental}} in passing include: the 1974 Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act, a law which provides certain protections to young criminal offenders; the 1978 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act; and the 1978 Pregnancy Disability Act, which aimed to prevent discrimination against women {{on the basis of}} pregnancy and of which Hawkins said, “we have the opportunity to ensure that genuine equality in the American labor force <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> illusion and that pregnancy will no longer be the basis of unfavorable treatment of working women." [...] Hawkins is known best of all for the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, which Hawkins sponsored in 1977 alongside the legendary Senator Hubert Humphrey of Minnesota. The Bill gave the U.S. government the goal to provide full employment; it also ordered that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board must provide Congress with testimony {{on the state of the}} economy. However, by the time it made to President Jimmy Carter's desk, [...] "the legislation was clearly symbolic." [...] Hawkins later authored landmark legislation such as the Job Training Partnership Act and the 1988 School Improvement Act. He became chair of the House Education and Labor Committee in 1984.|$|E
2500|$|Tractate Pesachim in the Mishnah, Tosefta, Jerusalem Talmud, and Babylonian Talmud {{interpreted}} {{the laws of}} the Passover in [...] and [...] And elsewhere, the Mishnah in tractate Zevahim taught that intent to eat the Passover offering raw (violating the commandment of [...] ) or to break the bones of the offering (violating the commandment of [...] ) did not invalidate the offering itself.

Similarly, the Mishnah in tractate Beitzah reported that the House of Shammai held that an olive's bulk of leavening or a date's bulk (which <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> olive's bulk) of leavened bread in one's house made one liable, but the House of Hillel held that an olive's bulk of either made one liable. The Gemara noted that the command in [...] to eat unleavened bread ( [...] , matzah) on the first night of Passover applies to women (as did the command in [...] for all Israelites to assemble), even though the general rule is that women are exempt from time-bound positive commandments. The Gemara cited these exceptions to support Rabbi Johanan's assertion that one may not draw inferences from general rules, for they often have exceptions.|$|E

The teleological and the mechanical views of nature are not, necessarily, mutually exclusive. On the contrary, the more purely a mechanist the speculator is, the more firmly does he assume a primordial molecular arrangement, of which all the phenomena of the universe are the consequences; and the more completely is he thereby {{at the mercy of the}} teleologist, who can always defy him to disprove that this primordial molecular arrangement was not intended to evolve the phenomena of the universe. On the other hand, if the teleologist assert that this, that, or the other result of the working of any part of the mechanism of the universe is its purpose and final cause, the mechanist can always inquire how he knows that it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> unessential incident--the mere ticking of the clock, which he mistakes for its function.

But those who believe in the new ideas very steadfastly deny that. God is, they say, not an aggregate but a synthesis.

60|$|The {{progress}} of knowledge may, one day, {{enable us to}} deduce from such facts as these the maximum {{rate at which the}} chalk can have accumulated, and thus to arrive at the minimum duration of the chalk period. Suppose that the valve of the Crania upon which a coralline has fixed itself in the way just described, is so attached to the sea-urchin that no part of it <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> inch above the face upon which the sea-urchin rests. Then, as the coralline could not have fixed itself, if the Crania had been covered up with chalk mud, and could not have lived had itself been so covered it follows, that an inch of chalk mud could not have accumulated within the time between the death and decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin and the growth of the coralline to the full size which it has attained. If the decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin; the attachment, growth to maturity, and decay of the Crania; and the subsequent attachment and growth of the coralline, took a year (which is a low estimate enough), the accumulation of the inch of chalk must have taken more than a year: and the deposit of a thousand feet of chalk must, consequently, have taken more than twelve thousand years.|$|E
6000|$|... 209 Other {{examples}} of inappropriate conceptions are given by Dr. Whewell [...] (Phil. Ind. Sc. ii., 185) as follows: “Aristotle {{and his followers}} [...] endeavored in vain {{to account for the}} mechanical relation of forces [...] in the lever, by applying the inappropriate geometrical [...] conceptions of the properties of the circle: they failed in [...] explaining the form of the luminous spot made by the sun shining [...] through a hole, because they applied the inappropriate conception [...] of a circular quality in the sun’s light: they speculated to no [...] purpose about the elementary composition of bodies, because they [...] assumed the inappropriate conception of likeness between the [...] elements and the compound, instead of the genuine notion of elements [...] merely determining the qualities of the compound.” But in these [...] cases there <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> inappropriate conception; there is a [...] false conception; one which has no prototype in nature, nothing [...] corresponding to it in facts. This is evident in the last two [...] examples, and is equally true in the first; the “properties of the [...] circle” which were referred to, being purely fantastical. There is, [...] therefore, an error beyond the wrong choice of a principle of [...] generalization; there is a false assumption of matters of fact.

6000|$|Why {{now here}} is, as to this, {{and to what}} else can it be objected, the {{faithfulness}} of God engaged. First, in a general promise; I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee (Heb 13:5,6). Secondly, we have an invitation {{to come to this}} faithful God for wisdom to assist and help. For after he had said, [...] "My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations--and let patience have her perfect work"; he adds, [...] "If any man lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it shall be given him" [...] (James 1:2-5). Here <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>an</b> invitation, here is a promise--it shall be given him; and all to show us what a faithful Creator we have committed our souls unto. Doth any lack wisdom to know how to carry it in a time of trial: let them ask it of God--of the God that is wisdom itself; let him ask it of God, the liberal giver, who giveth to all men all that they have, and upbraideth not for their unworthiness. Nor doth the Holy Ghost stop here, but enlarges himself in a more particular way to those that suffer according to the text, saying, [...] "But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall speak" [...] (Matt 10:19). I have often been amazed in my mind at this text, for how could Jesus Christ have said such a word if he {{had not been able to}} perform it? This text, therefore, declares him to be God. It is also a proof of faithfulness to those that suffer for him.|$|E
