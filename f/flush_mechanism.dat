50|$|The modern {{water closet}} or toilet utilises a cistern to reserve {{and hold the}} correct amount of water {{required}} to flush the toilet bowl. In earlier toilets, the cistern was located high above the toilet bowl and connected to it by a long pipe. It was necessary to pull a hanging chain connected to a release valve located inside the cistern in order to flush the toilet. Modern toilets may be close coupled, with the cistern mounted directly on the toilet bowl and no intermediate pipe. In this arrangement, the <b>flush</b> <b>mechanism</b> (lever or push button) is usually mounted on the cistern. Concealed cistern toilets, where the cistern {{is built into the}} wall behind the toilet, are also available. A flushing trough is a type of cistern used to serve more than one WC pan at one time.

When more water is used, a second float at a higher level trips and causes the appearance of a second servant figure — with a towel!"

40|$|Nowadays, {{there is}} a clear trend in {{industry}} towards employing the growing amount of transistors on chip in replicating execution cores (CMP), where each core is Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT). State-of-the-art high-performance processors like the IBM POWER 5 and POWER 6 corroborate this CMP+SMT trend. Within each SMT core any of the well-known SMT mechanisms may be applied to face SMT related challenges. Among them, probably the most important issue in an SMT execution pipeline concerns the In-struction Fetch (IFetch) Policy. The FLUSH IFetch Policy represents a choice for throughput-oriented scenarios.

40|$|Abstract — OpenMP can be {{supported}} in cluster environments by using distributed shared memory (DSM) systems. A portable approach for building DSM systems is to layer it on MPI. With these goals in mind, this paper makes two contributions. The {{first is a}} discussion about two software DSM systems that we have implemented using MPI. One uses background polling threads while the other uses processes that are driven only by incoming MPI messages. Comparisons of the two approaches show the latter {{to be a more}} scalable architecture that is better suited for the multi-core processors that are becoming commonplace. The second contribution recognizes that a common workaround for sub-team synchronizations in OpenMP is to use the flush directive on shared variables within busy-wait loops. In such a situation, only the flush in the last iteration of the busy-wait loop will result in the conditions necessary for exiting the loop. Thus transfer of the shared value need only be done if there were changes. We implement in our DSM a <b>flush</b> <b>mechanism</b> that eliminates the unnecessary data transfers entirely without any additional support or hints from the programmer. I...|$|E
30|$|Incubation {{chambers}} {{were constructed}} of mason jars that were pre-drilled {{through the glass}} bottom and plugged with a stopper that had a small section of glass tubing fitted with half-hole septa. When incubation chambers were assembled, crust cores {{were placed on the}} jar lid and the jar was turned upside down, allowing cores to be fully exposed to the incubation lights. Biocrusts were wetted with deionized water at the levels described above and placed in incubators in open mason jars for a period of 4 h at the desired temperature. Following the pre-incubation period, jars were plugged with rubber stoppers to form an airtight chamber and a 10 % acetylene atmosphere was created in each chamber by first removing a volume of headspace and replacing that same volume with acetylene gas. Acetylene gas was made in the lab by reacting calcium carbide with water and trapping the gas generated from the reaction in an airtight gas sampling bag. After the 4 h pre-incubation, biocrust cores were immediately incubated {{in the presence of the}} acetylene atmosphere for an additional 2 h. Following the 2 h incubation, a gas sample was drawn from the chambers using an airtight syringe fitted with a needle and injected into pre-evacuated Exetainers (Labco Limited, UK). Ethylene and N 2 O gas were simultaneously analyzed by gas chromatography (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD) equipped with both an FID and an ECD, such that there was a front <b>flush</b> <b>mechanism</b> in order to prevent acetylene exposure to the ECD, and fitted with a 1 cm sample loop.|$|E

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Agricultural economics. "December 2011 "Fresh water is a renewable, but finite, and increasingly scarce resource. Strategies to reduce water consumption are becoming ever more important in order to minimize future water shortages. One such approach is to focus upon the publicly supplied sector of water use, which includes households and also large-scale commercial and industrial enterprises such as schools, hospitals, airports, and private firms. If such enterprises were to implement water-saving appliances and fixtures on a large scale, substantial water savings could be realized. One such water-saving appliance is the dual-flush toilet, which uses a high-volume flush for solid waste and a lower-volume flush for liquid waste. This thesis uses the principles of behavioral economics, which studies human behavior and decision-making, in order to determine whether the design of the dual <b>flush</b> <b>mechanism</b> can lead the user to make the incorrect 'choice' and thus waste water. A field experiment performed in the public restrooms of a municipal building in Columbia, Missouri definitively showed {{that in the case of}} one particular model of dual flush toilet, the Sloan Uppercut®, water usage was considerably higher than the manufacturer's projections. This was due to the fact that the default option, pushing the flush handle down, resulted in a large flush. While Sloan predicted a 2 : 1 urination-to-defecation (U/D) flush ratio, the observed ratio during the control period was roughly 1 : 4. The treatment period consisted of adding multiple signs to each stall that instructed users on how to use the toilets correctly; however, even with signs added, the U/D ratio only increased to 2 : 5. The implications of this research are that if water savings are to be fully maximized, the 'real-world' actions of users must be taken into account. These results are of particular relevance in areas where water is especially scarce and/or costly...|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of nitrogen (N) and suspended solids (SS) were investigated in stream water during four storm events in 2003 at the Shibetsu watershed, eastern Hokkaido, Japan. Analysis showed that total nitrogen (TN), nitrate-N (NO^[-]_[3] -N), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), particulate nitrogen (PN), and SS concentrations all peaked sharply during the rising limb of the discharge hydrograph, but peaks in PN and SS were {{more significant than}} that of dissolved N. PN and SS consistently displayed clockwise hysteresis with higher concentrations during rising flows, whereas NO^[-]_[3]-N and DON showed different patterns among storms depending on the antecedent soil moisture. An M (V) curve, defined as the nutrient mass distribution vs. the volume of discharge, showed that a "first flush" of PN, NO^[-]_[3]-N, DON and SS was observed, however, the distribution of nutrient loads in the discharge was different. PN and SS had a shorter flushing characteristic time constant (t_[1 /e], defined as the time interval required for a decline in nutrient concentrations in discharge water to e^[- 1] (37 %) of their initial concentrations) but contributed 80 % of fluxes during the first 50 % of the discharge, while longer flush time (t_[1 /e]) of NO^[-]_[3]-N and DON with slowly decreased concentrations led to half loads during the recession of the discharge. These data indicate that the <b>flush</b> <b>mechanisms</b> might be distinguished between particulate nutrients and dissolved N. Analysis showed that the concentrations of PN and SS derived from soil erosion were related to surface runoff. In contrast, NO^[-]_[3]-N originated from the near-surface soil layer associated with the rising shallow ground water table and mainly flushed with subsurface runoff. Different <b>flushing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> implied that different watershed best management practices should be undertaken for effectively mitigating water quality degradation...|$|R

Flushing of underground sediment begins with small particles, and large particles will be taken away later. The pore ratio of the soil increases gradually. The flow ultimately becomes direct water seepage, and the sediment concentration at the same position in the water decreases over time. The concentration of maximal flushing potential sediment decreases along the path. The underground sediment flushing model reflects the <b>flushing</b> <b>mechanism</b> of underground sediment...|$|R
40|$|Timing {{channels}} are information flows, encoded {{in the relative}} timing of events, that bypass the system's protection mechanisms. Any microarchitectural state that depends on execution history and affects the rate of progress of later executions potentially establishes a timing channel, unless explicit steps are taken to close it. Such state includes CPU caches, TLBs, branch predictors and prefetchers; removing the channels requires that the OS can partition such state or flush it on a switch of security domains. We measure the capacities of channels based on these microarchitectural features on several generations of processors across the two mainstream ISAs, x 86 and ARM, and investigate {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>flushing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> provided by the respective ISA. We find that in all processors we studied, at least one significant channel remains. This implies that closing all timing channels seems impossible on contemporary mainstream processors...|$|R

Moreover, it was suggested that the <b>flushing</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of sediment from the dam differ in an early rising stage and falling stage.

40|$|This {{study used}} a mass balance {{approach}} by characterizing the input, output, and sink rates of N {{in order to}} assess a declared "stage III N-saturated forest" response to decreased atmospheric N deposition in western Maryland. Relying on the conceptual model of kinetic N-saturation to holistically link stream, vegetative, soil, and atmospheric compartments and the use of a novel stable isotopic technique, the study demonstrated dynamic soil NO 3 -N pools, unprocessed atmospheric NO 3 -N in base flow, and significant reductions in NO 3 -N yield in response to decreased atmospheric N deposition. A lumped conceptual model, incorporating a dormant season NO 3 -N flush, was proposed that explains forest response to decreased deposition and sheds light on the hydrologic processes that govern the storage/release of NO 3 -N among years. It is proposed that this <b>flushing</b> <b>mechanism</b> prevents forests from attaining higher stages of N-saturation and predicts forests will be responsive to further reductions in N deposition...|$|R
2500|$|The {{siphoning}} toilet {{is perhaps}} the most popular design in North America for residential and light commercial toilet installations. Some other terms for these types of toilets are [...] "siphon jet", [...] "siphon wash", and in North America, [...] "wash down". All siphoning toilets incorporate an [...] "S" [...] shaped waterway. The waterways in these toilets are designed with slightly smaller diameters than a non-siphoning toilet, so that the waterway will naturally fill up with water, each time it is flushed, thus creating the siphon action. To flush the toilet the user activates a <b>flushing</b> <b>mechanism</b> (see above), which pours a large quantity of water quickly into the bowl. This creates a flow large enough to purge the bowl's waterway of all air, thus causing the bowl to empty rapidly due to the siphon action that has been created. This flow stops as soon as the water level in the bowl drops below the first bend of the siphon, allowing air to enter the S-pipe to break the column of liquid and to halt the siphonic action.|$|R
