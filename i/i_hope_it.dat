This book is not a call for financial reparations. Instead, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> is a formidable plea for a resurrection and fundamental reinterpretation of a tortured chapter in the collective American past.|$|E

500|$|... "Work" [...] {{served as}} Azalea's debut single as a lead artist, {{and the lead}} single from The New Classic. Following its premiere on BBC Radio 1Xtra on 11 February 2013, Azalea tweeted, [...] "Thanks for {{supporting}} me and I'm {{happy to have a}} first single about my story and not something meaningless <b>i</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> inspires and motivates". Her label later announced that an extended play (EP) for the single would be released on 8 April 2013. Azalea posted a timed preview of [...] "Work" [...] on SoundCloud on 24 February 2013. The following day, Azalea announced on Twitter that the song would be digitally released within the first week of March 2013.|$|E
500|$|Writing in the Saturday Review of Literature, Oswald Garrison Villard criticized America's 60 Families, {{describing}} it as [...] "bitter muckracking", lamenting that it merely revisited old themes, and ultimately dismissing {{it with the}} caution that as [...] "a guidebook to American folly and scandal it has a place. How <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will not find its way to Hitler and Mussolini! It would be held by them to be proof positive that our democracy is beyond hope". Several years later, Nazi politician Robert Ley, head of the German Labor Front, published a pamphlet in Germany titled Roosevelt Betrays America! in which he cited Lundberg's book as proof that [...] "nowhere are as many scoundrels running around loose as in the United States".|$|E
500|$|Fuller {{agreed with}} the {{transcendental}} concern for the psychological well-being of the individual, though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist. Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means [...] "that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> is so". She criticized people like Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like {{other members of the}} so-called Transcendental Club, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended Unitarian congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer Charles Capper has noted, she [...] "was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins." ...|$|E

500|$|The result {{marked the}} first time that Manchester United had lost in the {{calendar}} year, ending a 33-match unbeaten run. Wenger believed the result showed that Arsenal were [...] "ready for the season", albeit admitting that the defence had trouble coping with Yorke. He thought it was [...] "...psychologically important to beat United, especially after the great run they have had". Wenger confirmed afterwards that Anelka would sign for Real Madrid: [...] "I hope everything will be finalised {{in the next couple of}} days. In any case, he is not coming back here, and although the contract is not signed yet, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will be after his medical and that is the end of it." [...] Kanu, who scored Arsenal's equaliser and set up the match winner, was pleased with his performance and relished the opportunity of establishing himself in the first team, after Anelka's departure.|$|E
500|$|Sibelius was {{not easily}} stirred from his exile; {{friend and fellow}} {{composer}} Wilhelm Stenhammar, then Artistic Director and chief conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra, wrote to Sibelius repeatedly {{to persuade him to}} conduct a concert of his works in Gothenburg. Believing himself duty-bound to premiere a [...] "major work" [...] in Sweden, such as a symphony, Sibelius—to Stenhammar's chagrin—delayed each scheduled trip. He withdrew from planned concerts for March 1914, writing to Stenhammar, [...] "My conscience forces me to this. But when I have some new works ready next year, as <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>it</b> would give me great joy to perform them in Gothenburg". New arrangements were made for February 1915, but these, too, Sibelius canceled in December 1914. In the end, the indefatigable Stenhammar prevailed and new concerts were set for March 1915 ("I see yet again your great sympathy for my music. I shall come".).|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2010, Hayes {{apologized for}} the pain and {{suffering}} he had caused the Petit family and added that: [...] "Death for me will be a welcome relief and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will bring some peace and comfort to those who I have hurt so much." [...] Judge Jon Blue formally imposed six death sentences, one for each of the capital charges; Blue then added a sentence of 106 years for other crimes Hayes committed during the home invasion, including kidnapping, burglary, and assault, before finishing with, [...] "This is a terrible sentence, but is, in truth, a sentence you wrote for yourself in flames. May God have mercy on your soul." [...] The judge also gave Hayes an official execution date of May 27, 2011; Blue said that this date was a formality, because if Hayes appealed his case, his execution could be delayed for decades. His death sentence became a life sentence in August 2015 when the state abolished the death penalty.|$|E

So it's the happiness and the sorrow and we're almost singing to each other, trying to figure out how both of us can work." [...] She added that the video was not [...] "so-in-your-face" [...] in order to be made more literal, but expressed her opinion that it's [...] "all about touching somebody and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> does that". For the video, fake snow and trees were used along with various other objects which according to the video's scenic coordinator, were supposed to create a [...] "frozen, gothic, cemetery feel". For the scenes filmed in water, a hydraulic lift was used with which Lee could easily sink and the lake water was colored black.|$|E
500|$|The British used {{smallpox}} as {{a biological}} warfare agent at the Siege of Fort Pitt during the French and Indian Wars (1754–1763) against France and its Native American allies. The actual use of smallpox had official sanction. British officers, including the top British commanding generals, ordered, sanctioned, paid for and conducted {{the use of}} smallpox against the Native Americans. As described by historians, [...] "there {{is no doubt that}} British military authorities approved of attempts to spread smallpox among the enemy", and [...] "it was deliberate British policy to infect the indians with smallpox". [...] On June 24, 1763, William Trent, a local trader and commander of the Fort Pitt militia, wrote, [...] "Out of our regard for them, we gave them two Blankets and an Handkerchief out of the Small Pox Hospital. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> will have the desired effect." [...] The effectiveness of this effort to broadcast the disease is unknown. There are also accounts that smallpox was used as a weapon during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783).|$|E
500|$|The musical {{performances}} and {{sound of the}} album were frequently hailed by critics. [...] Lorraine Ali of Rolling Stone identified Rich Robinson's guitar playing as [...] "brilliant in spots, letting it rip with Southern-rock abandon or lazy, drawling slide guitar". Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band's retention of the sonic detail from Amorica, and Jane Stevenson of the Toronto Sun appreciated the [...] "soulful" [...] backing vocals throughout. [...] Echoing those sentiments was CMJ, which noted the [...] "lazy slide-guitar textures, harmonica moans and choirs of soulful singers", but also stated [...] "Chris Robinson's gritty, cocksure vocals blaze the trail." [...] Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club called Robinson's vocal performance on [...] "HorseHead" [...] "an inflection-for-inflection imitation of... Billy Squier"; elsewhere on the album Robinson's voice was {{compared to that of}} Rod Stewart. [...] Stewart himself called the album [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it [...] "absolutely knocked [...] out". [...] Robinson's lyrics were alternately praised and panned. [...] The Guardians Caroline Sullivan called [...] "Go Faster" [...] an amalgam of the band's interests, [...] "including drugs... nubile wenchhood... scrapes... and touring". [...] The Washington Posts Harrington, however, called Robinson [...] "convincing when he sings , 'I feel so alive today and that's all I want to say/ <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> stays this way,' adding, 'If not, I'll be okay'".|$|E

"Mongrels friends, {{it is my}} unbearably sad duty to {{announce}} {{that we will not}} be returning for a third series on BBC Three, a decision that has been made {{based on the fact that}} apparently you need more than two people watching a programme to make it successful. Crazy talk. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone at BBC Comedy, BBC Three and BBC Worldwide who have supported us so strongly over the years, and helped us put our silly puppet show on the digital screens of the nation. I'd also like to thank, from the bottom of my heart, all the writers, cast, crew and support team who have made a horribly challenging show such an utter joy to make. This news could not be less of a reflection on your brilliant work. Most of all I'd like to thank those of you that loved watching Mongrels as much as we loved making it. It's wonderfully reassuring to think that we weren't mad after all, and that what we find funny, other people do too. I'd like to believe that there's room on television for a little show like ours; one that's not just another sitcom, one that tries to do things a bit differently and that tries to push a few boundaries here and there. Who knows, maybe we'll find a that room in the future. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> has a minibar. Thank you for watching. Both of you." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interviews, {{conducted}} by former team owner Eddie Jordan, Sebastian Vettel described the race {{as one of}} his best ever, calling it [...] "a great day; we had a really great weekend". He also revealed that his drink bottle had failed halfway into the race, causing him to become thirsty as drivers lose two to three litres in sweat during the Singapore race. Second placed Daniel Ricciardo said he felt that an undercut, overtaking Vettel by pitting earlier might have been possible {{had it not been for}} the safety car periods. Kimi Räikkönen expressed surprise at his performance, considering that he had struggled with the handling of the car both in qualifying and the race. Speaking about the track intruder, Sebastian Vettel stated at the post-race press conference that he [...] "saw him taking a picture" [...] and continued: [...] "I hope it was a good one at least. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> was in focus! Yeah, pretty crazy, we approach that corner at around 280–290 klicks so, I don't know, I wouldn't cross the track if I was him.

500|$|Initially, {{the song}} [...] "Everyone's at It" [...] was {{announced}} {{to be released}} as the lead single from the album, but it was ultimately decided on [...] "The Fear".

[...] I think I've grown up a bit {{as a person and}} <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>it</b> reflects that." [...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that where I come from, and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy. But at the same time, I'm very aware that I am a part of that culture – but it's not something that I feel particularly comfortable with.|$|E
