25|$|In December 2013, the FDA issued two warning letters, {{one to the}} Burzynski <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> Board and one to Burzynski, the {{subjects}} of the investigations in February.

25|$|Psychiatric {{research}} is, by {{its very}} nature, interdisciplinary; combining social, biological and psychological perspectives in attempt {{to understand the nature}} and treatment of mental disorders. Clinical and research psychiatrists study basic and clinical psychiatric topics at research institutions and publish articles in journals. Under the supervision of <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> boards, psychiatric clinical researchers look at topics such as neuroimaging, genetics, and psychopharmacology in order to enhance diagnostic validity and reliability, to discover new treatment methods, and to classify new mental disorders.|$|E
25|$|To {{protect the}} rights and {{well-being}} of research participants, {{and at the same}} time discover meaningful results and insights into human behavior, virtually all social psychology research must pass an ethical review process. At most colleges and universities, this is conducted by an ethics committee or <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> Board. This group examines the proposed research to make sure that no harm is likely to be done to the participants, and that the study's benefits outweigh any possible risks or discomforts to people taking part in the study.|$|E
25|$|In {{medical and}} {{scientific}} research, asking subjects {{for information about}} their behaviors is normally strictly scrutinized by <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> boards, for example, to ensure that adolescents and their parents have informed consent.

25|$|Tuskegee {{highlighted}} {{issues in}} race and science. The aftershocks of this study, {{and other human}} experiments in the United States, led {{to the establishment of}} the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research and the National Research Act. The latter requires the establishment of <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> boards (IRBs) at institutions receiving federal support (such as grants, cooperative agreements, or contracts). Foreign consent procedures can be substituted which offer similar protections and must be submitted to the Federal Register unless a statute or Executive Order requires otherwise.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} contemporary standards are informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the Nuremberg Code was established because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the Declaration of Helsinki. In the U.S., the National Institutes of Health established the <b>Institutional</b> <b>Review</b> Board in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the National Research Act (HR 7724). All {{of these measures}} encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led {{to the establishment of}} this rule; such studies included the MIT and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the Thalidomide tragedy, the Willowbrook hepatitis study, and Stanley Milgram's studies of obedience to authority.|$|E

25|$|After the {{publication}} of the paper, other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakefield's findings or confirm his hypothesis of an association between the MMR vaccine and autism, or autism and gastrointestinal disease. A 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part, and most of his co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations. The British General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues. The investigation centred on Deer's numerous findings, including that children with autism were subjected to unnecessary invasive medical procedures such as colonoscopies and lumbar punctures, and that Wakefield acted without the required ethical approval from an <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> board.|$|E

40|$|Investigators and <b>institutional</b> <b>reviews</b> boards who/which {{have participated}} in recent {{controlled}} gastroenterology clinical research studies assessing new therapies for pep-tic ulcer disease have questioned the continued use of a placebo-control when effica-cious therapies for peptic ulcer disease are currently available. As the sponsor of such studies, Glaxo is {{of the opinion that}} the use of placebo-controlled clinical research studies is appropriate in certain situations. In choosing between the use of an active comparator or placebo-controlled trial Glaxo recommends an assessment of the se-verity of the disease and the morbidity associated with use of placebo treatment. It further recommends the need to assess the efficacy of placebo therapy to establish the baseline remission rate for the disease. Glaxo suggests an assessment of the safety data for the new chemical entity under investigation, and if such data are lacking, minimize patient risk employing suggerted study designs that maximize patient utili-zation. The statistical implications of sample size and the risks associated with Type I and IIerrors by comparing the number ofpatients required for a typicalstudy using a placebo and active control are discussed. Finally, for all placebo-controlled studies performed with patients with peptic ulcer disease, the elimination of high risk pa-tients, the use of supplemental antacids, and proper obtainment of informed patient consent is recommended.

[...] In 2009, Burger was able to receive approval from the <b>institutional</b> <b>review</b> board by modifying several of the experimental protocols. Burger found obedience rates virtually identical to those reported by Milgram found in 1961–62, even while meeting current ethical regulations of informing participants. In addition, half the replication participants were female, and their rate of obedience was virtually identical to that of the male participants. Burger also included a condition in which participants first saw another participant refuse to continue. However, participants in this condition obeyed at the same rate as participants in the base condition.|$|E
