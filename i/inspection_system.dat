5|$|Automation {{means that}} the smaller size of parts permits a mobile <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> to examine {{multiple}} parts more quickly.

5|$|Almost a {{year after}} the initial release, Microsoft quietly {{released}} the second version. It entered the technical preview stage on 19 July 2010, and the final build was released on 16 December 2010. It includes Network <b>Inspection</b> <b>System</b> (NIS), a network intrusion detection system that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs heuristics in malware detection. Version 2.0 integrates with Internet Explorer to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.|$|E
5|$|Specific {{instances}} include removing {{of parts}} from the mould {{immediately after the}} parts are created, as well as applying machine vision systems. A robot grips the part after the ejector pins have been extended to free the part from the mould. It then moves them into either a holding location or directly onto an <b>inspection</b> <b>system.</b> The choice depends upon the type of product, {{as well as the}} general layout of the manufacturing equipment. Vision systems mounted on robots have greatly enhanced quality control for insert moulded parts. A mobile robot can more precisely determine the placement accuracy of the metal component, and inspect faster than a human can.|$|E

5|$|The {{jurisdiction}} of the party discipline <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> mirrors that of the MOS, with the CCDI responsible for cases involving breaches of party discipline and state law by party members. Like the MOS, the CCDI lacks judicial authority and is limited to investigating allegations of corruption and breaches of party discipline. Since the CCDI {{does not have the}} power to prosecute, it is supposed to transfer cases (after investigation) to the Supreme People's Procuratorate or the Supreme People's Court. Despite this, its formal jurisdiction is loosely defined. The CDI's ability to begin investigations and administer party sanctions has often led to the slow transfer (or sometimes no transfer) of cases to the Supreme People's Procuratorate.|$|E

40|$|Recently, 100 % <b>inspection</b> using {{automated}} <b>systems</b> {{has seen}} more frequent application than traditional sampling inspection using human inspectors. Nevertheless, humans still outperform machines in most attribute inspection tasks. Studies {{have shown that}} hybrid <b>inspection</b> <b>systems</b> where humans work corporately with machines might achieve superior system performance than either humans or machines alone. In response to this situation, {{there is a need}} to study function allocations in hybrid <b>inspection</b> <b>systems,</b> specifically, the communication between humans and machines. This paper introduces three types of communication alternatives in the design of hybrid <b>inspection</b> <b>systems</b> and discusses their impact on dynamically allocating search and decision-making functions to the humans and the machines...|$|R

25|$|A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo {{turboshaft}} engines {{power the}} Puma's four-blade main rotor. The helicopter's rotors are driven {{at a speed}} of roughly 265 rpm via a five reduction stage transmission. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the rotor shaft and the anti-vibration measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade <b>inspection</b> <b>system,</b> which guarded against and alerted crews to fatigue cracking in the rotor blades. There are two hydraulic systems on board, these operate entirely independent of one another, one system powers only the aircraft's flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, rotor brake, and the flight controls.|$|E
25|$|In October 2009, the European Court of Justice {{ruled against}} Ireland {{regarding}} septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems. It deemed Ireland non-compliant with Articles 4 and 8 of the Waste Directive {{in relation to}} domestic wastewaters disposed of in the countryside. Ireland was fined €2million and the court imposed daily fines of €12,000 for each day of delay in achieving compliance. Central to ending the case against Ireland was establishing a national inspection plan for domestic wastewater treatment systems. In 2012, the government passed the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, which provided for a new <b>inspection</b> <b>system</b> and which would require owners of septic tanks and other on-site treatment systems to register their systems. A new registration and inspection regime was introduced in June 2012. By July 2013, almost 90% of owners of premises connected with such systems had registered their systems. The government also announced details of a grant scheme for remedial work on a septic system.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the prime}} {{examples}} of the deficiencies in its former franchise structure can be illustrated by the relationship between Burger King and a Louisiana-based franchisee. Chart House, owned by brothers Billy and Jimmy Trotter, opened its first BK franchise in that state in 1963. By 1970 the Trotters' company had grown to over 350 stores across the country, with its own purchasing system, training program and <b>inspection</b> <b>system.</b> In 1973 Chart House attempted to purchase the chain from Pillsbury for , but Pillsbury declined. The Trotters then put forth a second plan that would have Pillsbury and Chart House spin off their respective holdings and merge the two entities into a separate jointly controlled company, which Pillsbury also declined. After the failed bids, the relationship between Pilsbury and the Trotters soured. When Chart House purchased several restaurants in Boston and Houston in 1979, Burger King sued the selling franchisees for not respecting their contractual {{right of first refusal}} and won, preventing the sale. The two parties eventually reach a settlement where Chart House kept the Houston locations in their portfolio. In the early 1980s Chart House spun off its Burger King restaurants to focus on its higher end chains; its Burger King holding company, DiversiFoods, was eventually acquired by Pillsbury [...] in 1984 and folded into Burger King's operations.|$|E

Animal cruelty was previously regulated by the Protection of Animals Act 1911 (now largely repealed) and more recently by the Animal Welfare Act 2006, both of which outlaw the causing of [...] "unnecessary suffering".
