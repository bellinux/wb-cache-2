The scaffolds {{differ in the}} configuration at the two stereocenters and the substitution at the diketopiperazinic nitrogen atoms.

Nanomolar IC 50 values were obtained for the RGD peptidomimetics derived from trans DKP scaffolds (DKP- 2 -DKP- 8). Conformational studies of the cyclic RGD peptidomimetics by 1 H NMR spectroscopy experiments (VT-NMR and NOESY spectroscopy) in aqueous solution and Monte Carlo/Stochastic Dynamics (MC/SD) simulations revealed that the highest affinity ligands display well-defined preferred conformations featuring intramolecular hydrogen-bonded turn motifs and an <b>extended</b> <b>arrangement</b> of the RGD sequence [Cβ(Arg) -Cβ(Asp) average distance ≥ 8. 8 Å].
