500|$|Up to {{that point}} a {{manufacturer}} of solid-state pre-/power- amplifier separates, Naim Audio wanted an entry-level <b>integrated</b> <b>amplifier</b> to complement their range and widen their appeal. They worked to create a low-powered model that shared the family characteristics and sound. The approach, seemingly against the received wisdom {{of the time that}} power and sound quality go hand in hand, remained nevertheless controversial, despite the fact that NAD Electronics had trail-blazed five years earlier with the top-selling low-cost audiophile amplifier, the [...] The Naim Audio <b>Integrated</b> <b>amplifier</b> (or NAIT) was created by Julian Vereker as a minimalist black shoe-box design that includes a phono and two line-level inputs – one for tuner and one for tape recorder. The phono input, for moving magnet cartridges, is derived from the [...] pre-amplifier. The NAIT was launched in 1983, ten years after the firm was founded.|$|E

40|$|A CMOS <b>integrating</b> <b>amplifier</b> {{has been}} {{developed}} {{for use in the}} PHENIX Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) detector. The amplifier, consisting of a charge-integrating amplifier followed by a variable gain amplifier (VGA), is an element of a photon measurement system comprising a photomultiplier tube, a wideband, gain of 10 <b>amplifier,</b> the <b>integrating</b> <b>amplifier,</b> and an analog memory followed by an ADC and double correlated sampling implemented in software. The <b>integrating</b> <b>amplifier</b> is designed for a nominal full scale input of 160 pC with a gain of 20 mV/pC and a dynamic range of 1000 : 1. The VGA is used for equalizing gains prior to forming analog sums for trigger purposes. The gain of the VGA is variable over a 3 : 1 range using a 5 bits digital control, and the risetime is held to approximately 20 ns using switched compensation in the VGA. Details of the design and results from several prototype devices fabricated in 1. 2 {micro}m Orbit CMOS are presented.

500|$|Launched circa 1978–79 in an {{era where}} the {{principal}} preoccupation of hi-fi manufacturers was power output, the sub-£80 (US$135) low-powered solid state amplifier, created and marketed by a then little-known manufacturer, very rapidly acquired a reputation for excellent sound quality and exceptional value. Stereophile magazine called the [...] "ridiculously inexpensive".

500|$|The Naim NAIT is an {{amplifier}} concept {{from the}} British hi-fi manufacturer, Naim Audio.

Hi-fi critic Lucio Cadeddu recognised its legendary status, referring to it as [...] "one of the most controversial and famous integrated amps in the history of HiFi".|$|E
2500|$|Using monitor {{speakers}} {{instead of}} in ear monitors typically results in an increase of stage volume, {{which can lead to}} more feedback issues and progressive hearing damage for the performers in front of them. [...] The clarity of the mix for the performer on stage is also typically not as clear as they hear more extraneous noise from around them. [...] The use of monitor loudspeakers, active (with an <b>integrated</b> <b>amplifier)</b> or passive, requires more cabling and gear on stage, resulting in an even more cluttered stage. [...] These factors, amongst others, have led to the increasing popularity of in-ear monitors.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the death}} of Howard Anthony in 1954, Heath was bought by Daystrom Company, a {{management}} holding company that also owned several other electronics companies. Daystrom was absorbed by oilfield service company Schlumberger Limited in 1962, and the Daystrom/Schlumberger days were Heathkit's most successful. Those years saw some [...] "firsts" [...] in the general consumer market. The early 60s saw {{the introduction of the}} AA-100 <b>integrated</b> <b>amplifier.</b> This was a unit of reliable quality (and affordable) that was produced several years before any other major hi-fi company produced anything comparable. The early 70s saw Heath introduce the AJ-1510, an FM tuner using digital synthesis, and the GC-1005 digital clock. Again, these components were quality products and were produced well ahead of anyone else in the industry. In 1974, Heathkit started [...] "Heathkit Educational Systems", which expanded their manuals' clear writing style into general electronics and computer training materials. Heathkit also expanded their expertise into digital and, eventually, computerized equipment, producing among other things digital clocks and weather stations with the new technology.|$|E
2500|$|Monitor loudspeakers, {{also called}} [...] "foldback" [...] loudspeakers, are speaker {{cabinets}} {{which are used}} onstage to help performers to hear their singing or playing. As such, monitor speakers are pointed towards a performer or {{a section of the}} stage. [...] They are generally sent a different mix of vocals or instruments than the mix that is sent to the main loudspeaker system. [...] Monitor loudspeaker cabinets are often a wedge shape, directing their output upwards towards the performer when set {{on the floor of the}} stage. [...] Two-way, dual driver designs with a speaker cone and a horn are common, as monitor loudspeakers need to be smaller to save space on the stage. [...] These loudspeakers typically require less power and volume than the main loudspeaker system, as they only need to provide sound for a few people who are in relatively close proximity to the loudspeaker. [...] Some manufacturers have designed loudspeakers for use either as a component of a small PA system or as a monitor loudspeaker. In the 2000s, a number of manufacturers produced powered monitor speakers, which contain an <b>integrated</b> <b>amplifier.</b>|$|E

40|$|Basic {{improvements}} in the technology of low noise read-out systems for low background detectors were demonstrated. Using discrete JFET <b>integrating</b> <b>amplifiers</b> at their optimum temperature of 55 K, read noise less than 7. 5 electrons in 128 seconds of integration was obtained. Two models of single channel integrators are now available, the JF- 77 for use between 50 and 80 K and the JF- 4 for lower temperatures. A 1 x 15 linear array of complete integrators on a single integrated circuit was developed and will be made available in the near future. The successful operation of a superconducting stepper motor was demonstrated. The motor shows a three fold increase in torque over conventional motors operating at room temperature. The success of the motor stems {{from the use of}} superconducting coils in conjunction with developments in bearings for cryogenic use, rare-earth rotors, and motor cooling techniques. The current state of development will allow the rapid development of motors optimized for specific applications. An electronic switch capable of resetting cooled JFET <b>integrating</b> <b>amplifiers</b> was developed. The JFET <b>integrating</b> <b>amplifiers</b> that use this switch have demonstrated read noise of less than 10 electrons. The JFET reset device exhibits an extremely high open impedance and low leakage current. Capacitance is sufficiently low so as not to impair amplifier sensitivity.
