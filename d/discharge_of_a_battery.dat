The energetics and local structural motifs of these metastable Li-Si phases closely resemble those of the amorphous phases, making these small unit cell crystal phases good approximants of the amorphous phase for use in further studies. The charge capacity is estimated, and the electrical potential profiles and the energy density of Li-Si anodes are predicted.

40|$|Wireless mesh {{networks}} recently {{emerge as}} a flexible, low-cost and multipurpose networking platform with wired infrastructure connected to the Internet. A critical issue in mesh networks is to maintain network activities for a long lifetime with high energy efficiency. As more and more outdoor applications require long-lasting, high energy efficient and continuously-working mesh networks with batterypowered mesh routers, {{it is important to}} optimize the performance of mesh networks from <b>a</b> battery-aware point <b>of</b> view. Recent study in battery technology reveals that <b>discharging</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> is nonlinear. Batteries tend to discharge more power than needed, and reimburse the overdischarged power later if they have sufficiently long recovery time. Intuitively, to optimize network performance, a mesh router should recover its battery periodically to prolong the lifetime. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model on battery discharging duration and lifetime for wireless mesh networks. We also present <b>a</b> <b>battery</b> lifetime optimization scheduling algorithm (BLOS) to maximize the lifetime of battery-powered mesh routers. Based on the B-LOS algorithm, we further consider the problem of using battery powered routers to monitor or cover a few hot spots in the network.

We prove that the SCBP problem is NP-hard and give an approximation algorithm called the Spanning Tree Scheduling (STS) to dynamically schedule mesh routers. The key idea of the STS algorithm is to construct a spanning tree according to the BLOS Policy in the mesh network. The time complexity of the STS algorithm is O(r) for a network with r mesh routers.
