5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree on <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters {{a little boy with}} a similar tree painted to <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get <b>his</b> <b>chest</b> and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith imply the tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E

5|$|In 1782, Prince Alfred was inoculated against smallpox. The {{sickness}} {{proved too}} much for the child and in June he was taken to Deal with his governess Lady Charlotte Finch to recover. It was hoped that the sea air, bathing in the water, and horseback riding would improve his condition. While he was there, Alfred endeared himself to many, including an old woman whom he waved to.
