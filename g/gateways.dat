5|$|Many Indiana {{residents}} {{participated in}} the underground railroad. Two major arteries in the underground railroad traveled through Indiana.

An important stopover was Westfield, where food and hiding places were provided to slaves trying to reach Canada. Other safe houses dotted Indiana, including one in Town Clock Church (pictured).

40|$|Abstract Background Invitrogen <b>Gateway</b> {{technology}} exploits the integrase/ att {{site-specific recombination}} system for directional cloning of PCR products {{and the subsequent}} subcloning into destination vectors. One or three DNA segments can be cloned using <b>Gateway</b> or MultiSite <b>Gateway</b> respectively. A vast number of single-site <b>Gateway</b> destination vectors have been created while MultiSite <b>Gateway</b> is limited to few destination vectors and therefore to few applications. The aim of this work {{was to make the}} MultiSite <b>Gateway</b> technology available for multiple biological purposes. Results We created a construct, pDONR-R 4 -R 3, to easily convert any available <b>Gateway</b> destination vector to a MultiSite <b>Gateway</b> vector in a single recombination reaction. In addition, we designed pDONR-R 4 -R 3 so that DNA fragments already cloned upstream or downstream of the <b>Gateway</b> cassette in the original destination vectors can still be utilized for promoter-gene or translational fusions after the conversion. Conclusion Our tool makes MultiSite <b>Gateway</b> a more widely accessible technology and expands its applications by exploiting all the features of the <b>Gateway</b> vectors already available. </p...|$|R

5|$|Many temples {{were now}} built entirely of stone, and their general plan became fixed, with the sanctuary, halls, courtyards, and pylon <b>gateways</b> {{oriented}} {{along the path}} used for festival processions. New Kingdom pharaohs ceased using pyramids as funerary monuments and placed their tombs a great distance from their mortuary temples. Without pyramids to build around, mortuary temples began using the same plan as those dedicated to the gods.|$|E

5|$|South India has two {{distinct}} styles of rock architecture, the Dravidian style of Tamil Nadu and the Vesara style of Karnataka. The temples considered of porches or mantapas preceding the door {{leading to the}} sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams, which are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more notable temples and pillared halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate {{at the entrance of}} any temple in Southern India. This forms a prominent feature of koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the kalasam, a spherical stone finial, and function as <b>gateways</b> through the walls that surround the temple complex. The origins of the gopuram {{can be traced back to}} early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century, under the Pandya rulers, these <b>gateways</b> became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the colossal size of the gopuram.|$|E

The Inner <b>Gateway</b> is one of only two {{buildings}} that survived the dissolution, the other being the Hospitium. The Inner <b>Gateway</b> marked the division between the area open to the public and the section accessible only to monks. The abbot used the <b>gateway</b> as a meeting area.

50|$|The <b>gateway</b> {{operates}} {{at the network}} layer (Layer 3) of the OSI Model. The <b>gateway</b> is used when transmitting packets.

The <b>gateway</b> address must have the same subnet mask as host devices. Each host on the network uses the same <b>gateway.</b>|$|R

After repair by architect Alfred Hoare Powell (1865â1960), it was the first house acquired by the National Trust, in 1907, on the recommendation of the antiquarian Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley (1851â1920). In the 1920s the house was renovated, the stable block turned into a residence and several outbuildings, gardens and <b>gateways</b> constructed.|$|E

5000|$|Encryption/Decryption at the <b>gateway</b> â in the WAP {{architecture}} {{the content}} is typically stored on the server as uncompressed WML (an XML DTD). That content is retrieved by the <b>gateway</b> using HTTP and compressed into WBXML, {{in order to}} perform that compression the <b>gateway</b> {{must be able to}} handle the WML in cleartext, so even if there is encryption between the client and the <b>gateway</b> (using WTLS) and between the <b>gateway</b> and the originating server (using HTTPS) the <b>gateway</b> acts as a man-in-the-middle. This <b>gateway</b> architecture serves a number of purposes: transcoding between HTML and WML; content providers need not implement WBXML compression; removes reliance on DNS; enables a walled garden ...|$|R

5|$|The royal {{compound}} on {{the hilltop}} {{is surrounded by}} a complex system of defensive ditches and stone walls and is accessed by 14 <b>gateways,</b> of which many were sealed by stone disc barriers. The <b>gateways</b> and construction of buildings within the compound are arranged according to two overlaid cosmological systems that value the four cardinal points radiating from a unifying center, and attach sacred importance to the northeastern direction. The complex inside the wall is subdivided into three smaller rova. Mahandrihono, the largest compound, was established between 1710 and 1730 by King Andriambelomasina; it remains largely intact and contains the royal tombs, house of King Andrianampoinimerina, summer palace of Queen Ranavalona II, and sites that figured in key royal rituals such as the sacrificial zebu pen, royal bath and main courtyard. Original buildings no longer remain in the compound of Bevato, established before 1710 by Andriamborona, and the Nanjakana compound, built for King Andrianjafy in the late 19th century. The hill and its royal fortified city were added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in 2001 and represent Madagascar's only cultural site following the destruction by fire in 1995 of its historic sister city, the Rova of Antananarivo, shortly before the latter's intended inscription to the list. Numerous governmental and civil society organizations support the conservation of Ambohimanga by restoring damaged features and preventing further degradation.|$|E
5|$|Various {{modifications}} {{were made}} to Valletta's fortifications during British rule. The most significant of these was the construction of Fort Lascaris between 1854 and 1856. Other alterations included the addition of batteries and concrete gun emplacements, changes to parapets and their embrasures, {{and the construction of}} gunpowder magazines. All three original Hospitaller <b>gateways</b> to Valletta were demolished, and two of them were replaced by larger gates.|$|E
5|$|Around 1800, Caernarfon's local {{corporation}} {{undertook a}} programme of modernisation work, inserting several new <b>gateways</b> {{in the town}} walls; other changes were also made to the walls during the period, with some towers being converted for use as administrative buildings and the gatehouses altered to accommodate more modern offices. During the 19th century the town of Caernarfon grew considerably, prompted by the slate trade {{and the construction of}} the Chester to Holyhead railway line. As a result of this population pressure, by the 20th century housing had encroached along the inside and outside of the town walls, so that in many places the walls had vanished from view. During the 20th century the walls were gradually acquired by the state and these houses demolished.|$|E
