5|$|Stan {{leads the}} kids to Terrance and Phillip, who have been cornered by the US army. La Resistance forms a human shield while Kyle tries to persuade the army and his mother against killing the two. Sheila refuses and shoots Terrance and Phillip, which results in Satan, his minions, and Saddam attacking Earth. As a result, Sheila regrets everything. Saddam tries to usurp Satan's authority, but is sent back to Hell and killed, thanks to Cartman's {{malfunctioning}} V-Chip and Kenny's encouragement. Satan then grants Kenny a wish; Kenny asks for everything to return to how {{it was before the}} war, even though <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> will {{have to go back to}} Hell. He takes off his hood to say goodbye to his friends, but instead of returning to Hell, Kenny ascends to Heaven due to his act of sacrifice. Everything returns to normal in South Park.|$|E

25|$|Rorke, who is {{six feet}} four inches, {{has a very}} short run which {{produces}} tremendous pace, and is another bowler whose action is subject to criticism. His delivery, to say the most, was unusual, and it was {{amazing to me that}} a bowler could generate so much pace from such a short run...he lands some four feet beyond the batting crease at the moment of delivery, with a tremendous drag, and <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> delivers the ball from some nineteen yards.|$|E
60|$|Yet that {{abandonment}} of the walks insisted on looking mean to him. And she would think <b>it</b> <b>mean.</b> Which was very much worse, somehow. Why mean? Why should she think <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He</b> grew angry again.|$|R
60|$|He {{said it was}} {{the bare}} idea of a temple that made it impossible. And there was this drawing here; what did <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>He</b> held <b>it</b> out to her. It {{represented}} a figure, distressingly like himself, robed as a priest in vestments.|$|R

25|$|ThunderClan {{medicine}} cat apprentice Jaypaw finds a washed-up stick {{when he is}} out gathering herbs {{with his}} mentor, Leafpool. It has odd scratches on it; some that are crossed out and some that are not. As he struggles {{to figure out what}} <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> <b>he</b> has a dream in which he experiences what Fallen Leaves experienced. Jaypaw then understands that the scratches record ancient cats who undertook the trial in the tunnels and that the last uncrossed one was Fallen Leaves' mark, indicating that he did not emerge.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the joke}} becomes a {{national}} sensation. Comedian Carlos Mencia goes on Conan O'Brien's show claiming {{credit for the}} joke. The joke is played on rapper Kanye West, who does not understand it. West grows angry when others say he does not get it, and will not allow anyone {{to explain it to}} him, because he claims to be a genius and [...] "the voice of a generation". Kanye abducts Carlos Mencia, who admits he stole the joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his [...] "dick don't work" [...] in a parody of Viggo Mortensen's character Lalin in Carlito's Way, but Kanye doesn't believe him and beats him to death {{with the help of his}} hired thugs. Cartman and Jimmy go on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and claim they invented the joke, prompting Kanye to go after them. Jimmy confronts Cartman, asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write. They are interrupted by Kanye, who threatens to kill them. By now, Cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote the whole joke without Jimmy's help, but believes he also saved his life from a black widow, slew a dragon, defeated an army of Jew robots, and has powers similar to the Human Torch. Cartman thinks he realizes what Kyle was trying to tell him, but he gets it completely backwards: Cartman believes that Jimmy's ego is the one that is twisted and Jimmy's ego trying to convince itself that he wrote the joke, while not accepting that Cartman wrote the whole thing, and Jimmy believes him. Kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands the joke. However, he incorrectly thinks <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> is, in fact, a gay fish. The episode ends with Kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off the Santa Monica Pier into the ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in the form of a music video, in which he happily swims around the sea, kissing and humping random fish.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2013 CNN {{segment on}} {{the origins of}} Festivus, O'Keefe spoke about the real-life {{experiences}} related to the holiday. O'Keefe's father, who originated some of the now-recognized Festivus traditions, used a clock, not an aluminum pole. O'Keefe told CNN: [...] "The real symbol of the holiday was a clock that my dad put in a bag and nailed to the wall every year...I don't know why, I don't know what <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> <b>he</b> would never tell me.

2500|$|Ryan Lindsay of CBR gave issue #4 {{three stars}} writing, [...] "The Fearless Defenders #4 is an {{entertaining}} issue {{chock full of}} story and solid moments. Bunn packs the pages with dialogue, which can feel bulky at times, but <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> can chock in {{quite a lot of}} narrative for one issue." [...] Lima also gave issue #4 four stars writing, [...] "This issue is very balanced: it has everything from mystery to humor and the pacing is really good. Of the issues before it, this is certainly {{one of the best in}} the way that it showcases these characters individually whilst continuing to develop a story that is both interesting and entertaining." [...] Grey again gave it a 7.9 writing, [...] "Now that the personalities of the Fearless Defenders are slotting into place and the shady force behind the rise of the Doom Maidens is amping up her villainy, The Fearless Defenders is shaping up to be one of the more unique and enjoyable titles in Marvel's monthly lineup." ...|$|E

"I dare say, {{you would}} call him a rebel," [...] {{answered}} Maud, laughing, for now Beulah chose to be silent, leaving her sister to explain, [...] "He is not fiery; but he calls himself an American, with emphasis; and that is saying a good deal, when <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> is not an Englishman.

6000|$|If a {{grown man}} does not like eating and {{drinking}} and exercise, {{if he is not}} something positive in his tastes, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>he</b> has a feeble body and should have some medicine; but children may be pure spirits, if they will, and take their enjoyment in a world of moonshine. Sensation does not count for so much in our first years as afterwards; something of the swaddling numbness of infancy clings about us; we see and touch and hear through a sort of golden mist. Children, for instance, are able enough to see, but they have no great faculty for looking; they do not use their eyes for the pleasure of using them, but for by-ends of their own; and the things I call to mind seeing most vividly were not beautiful in themselves, but merely interesting or enviable to me as I thought they might be turned to practical account in play. Nor is the sense of touch so clean and poignant in children as it is in a man. If you will turn over your old memories, I think the sensations of this sort you remember will be somewhat vague, and come to {{not much more than a}} blunt, general sense of heat on summer days, or a blunt, general sense of well-being in bed. And here, of course, you will understand pleasurable sensations; for overmastering pain--the most deadly and tragical element in life, and the true commander of man's soul and body--alas! pain has its own way with all of us; it breaks in, a rude visitant, upon the fairy garden where the child wanders in a dream, no less surely than it rules upon the field of battle, or sends the immortal war-god whimpering to his father; and innocence, no more than philosophy, can protect us from this sting. As for taste, when we bear in mind the excesses of unmitigated sugar which delight a youthful palate, [...] "it is surely no very cynical asperity" [...] to think taste a character of the maturer growth. Smell and hearing are perhaps more developed; I remember many scents, many voices, and a great deal of spring singing in the woods. But hearing is capable of vast improvement as a means of pleasure; and there is all the world between gaping wonderment at the jargon of birds, and the emotion with which a man listens to articulate music.|$|E
