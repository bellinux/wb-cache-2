5|$|In November 1792 James Reynolds and his {{associate}} Jacob Clingman {{were arrested}} for counterfeiting and speculating in veteran back wages. Clingman was released on bail and relayed information to James Monroe that Reynolds had <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> incriminate Hamilton. Monroe consulted with Congressmen Muhlenberg and Venable on what actions to take and the Congressmen confronted Hamilton on December 15, 1792. Hamilton refuted the suspicions of speculation by exposing his affair with Maria and producing as evidence the letters by both Reynoldses, proving that his payments to James Reynolds related to blackmail over his adultery, and not to treasury misconduct. The trio were to keep the documents privately with the utmost confidence.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment {{gives an}} {{individual}} suspected of crime a {{right not to}} be forced, by police or other government officials, into giving up <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> show {{he or she was}} guilty of a crime. Based on this constitutional prohibition against self-incrimination and to prevent coerced testimony by police or other government officials, the Supreme Court ruled in Miranda v. Arizona that an individual who was being held by police and was not free to leave had to be told of his/her right to remain silent. After Berghuis, a subsequent case, Salinas v. Texas, considered a suspect who was not being held against his will by police officers, but who had instead agreed to accompany officers and discuss a case upon their request. It extended Berghuis by ruling that in such a situation and prior to any arrest, the individual was not required to be explicitly told about his/her right to remain silent under the Fifth Amendment.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} name {{derives from the}} Latin word pilose, meaning 'covered with soft hair'. The ant was first identified in 1858 by British entomologist Frederick Smith in his Catalogue of hymenopterous insects {{in the collection of}} the British Museum part VI, under the binomial name Myrmecia pilosula from specimens he collected in Hobart in Tasmania. There, Smith described the specimens of a worker, queen and male. The type specimen is located in the British Museum in London. In 1922, American entomologist William Morton Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia characterised by its jumping behaviour, of which the jack jumper ant was designated as the type species. However, John Clark later synonymised Halmamyrmecia under the subgenus Promyrmecia in 1927 and placed the ant in the subgenus in 1943. William Brown synonymised Promyrmecia due to the lack of morphological <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make it distinct from Myrmecia and later placed the jack jumper ant in the genus in 1953.|$|E
5|$|In 1911 Emery {{classified}} the subgenera Myrmecia, Pristomyrmecia and Promyrmecia, {{based on}} {{the shape of the}} mandibles. Wheeler established the subgenus Halmamyrmecia, and the ants placed in it were characterised by their jumping behaviour. The taxon Wheeler described was not referred to in his later publications, and the genera Halmamyrmecia and Pristomyrmecia were synonymised by John Clark. At the same time, Clark reclassified the subgenus Promyrmecia as a full genus. He revised the whole subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1951, recognising 118 species and subspecies in Myrmecia and Promyrmecia; five species groups were assigned to Myrmecia and eight species groups to Promyrmecia. This revision was rejected by entomologist William Brown {{due to the lack of}} morphological <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make the two genera distinct from each other. Due to this, Brown would classify Promyrmecia as a synonym of Myrmecia in 1953. Clark's revision was the last major taxonomic study on the genus before 1991, and only a single species was described in the intervening years. In 2015, four new Myrmecia ants were described by Robert Taylor, all exclusive to Australia. Currently, 94 species are described in the genus, but as many as 130 species may exist.|$|E

25|$|Pinpointing {{the exact}} cause or {{causes of the}} Permian–Triassic {{extinction}} event is difficult, mostly because the catastrophe occurred over 250million years ago, and since then much of the <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have pointed to the cause has been destroyed or is concealed deep within the Earth under many layers of rock.

25|$|Appearing {{before some}} {{administrative}} tribunals may feel like appearing in court, but the tribunal's procedure is relatively less formal {{than that of}} a court, and more importantly, the rules of evidence are not as strictly observed, so that some <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> be inadmissible in a court hearing may be allowed in a tribunal hearing, if relevant to the proceeding. While relevant evidence is admissible, evidence which the adjudicator determines to have questionable reliability, or is otherwise questionable, is most likely to be afforded little or no weight.|$|E

25|$|On December 18, 2006, U.S. {{regulators}} filed 101 civil {{charges against}} chief executive Franklin Raines; {{chief financial officer}} J. Timothy Howard; and the former controller Leanne G.

The lawsuit sought to recoup more than $115 million in bonus payments, collectively accrued by the trio from 1998 to 2004, and about $100 million in penalties for their involvement in the accounting scandal. After 8 years of litigation, in 2012, a summary judgment was issued clearing the trio, indicating the government had insufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> enable any jury to find the defendants guilty.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{invalidate}} the organ harvesting allegations—such as a Chinese government registry showing the source of transplant organs— Kilgour and Matas concluded that the Chinese government and its agencies “have put to death a large but unknown number of Falun Gong prisoners of conscience. Their vital organs, including kidneys, livers, corneas and hearts, were seized involuntarily for sale at high prices, sometimes to foreigners, who normally face long waits for voluntary donations of such organs in their home countries.” They estimated that from 2000 to 2005, the source for 41,500 organ transplants was unexplained, and that Falun Gong prisoners were the most plausible source for these organs. The authors qualified their report by noting the inherent difficulties in verifying the alleged crimes: no independent organizations are allowed to investigate conditions in China, eyewitness evidence is difficult to obtain, and official information about both organ transplantation and executions is often withheld or is contradictory.|$|E
25|$|A fume event {{occurs when}} bleed air used for cabin {{pressurization}} {{and air conditioning}} in a pressurized aircraft is contaminated by fluids such as engine oil, hydraulic fluid, anti-icing fluid, and other potentially hazardous chemicals. Turbine engine oil is an irritant and contains neurotoxic chemicals such as tricresyl phosphate. The aviation industry claim that engine oil does not contain sufficient quantities of such chemicals to cause long-term damage. However, there is some historical <b>evidence</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> seem to contradict this statement. In 1959, over 10,000 people in Morocco were paralyzed or otherwise effected after ingesting small quantities of tricresyl phosphate in their cooking oil. Unlike tricresyl phosphate, hydraulic fluid — although non-toxic in small quantities — is extremely irritating to the eyes and skin, which creates a hazard to pilots during a fume event but causes no lasting damage. Deicing fluid has a strong smell but is not very irritating or toxic.|$|E
