40|$|Mixed crop-livestock {{farming is}} regaining {{interest}} worldwide {{as a way}} to reduce environmental problems while allowing productive and economically viable agriculture. However, the number of mixed crop-livestock farms has been falling steadily in Europe, where production has become concentrated on specialised and enlarged farms. This study aimed to design and assess technical innovations which could enhance the sustainability of mixed farming in the difficult conditions of Less Favoured Areas. It was conducted in a hilly region in south-western France where mixed crop-livestock farming continues to be practiced. Innovative technical scenarios consistent with the two main adaptive strategies implemented by local mixed farms were selected with farmers and other stakeholders. The first, the "maximising farm autonomy" strategy, consisted of sowing forage legumes between two cash crops to achieve herd feed self-sufficiency while maintaining soil fertility. The second, the "diversifying production" management strategy, consisted of adding a <b>heifer</b> <b>fattening</b> unit to increase farm income. Both scenarios were assessed on two actual farms using a whole farm simulation tool, CLIFS, based on feed and manure balances. They then were combined with prospective scenarios on public policies and markets to analyse farmers' capacity to cope with changes in their economic environment. Under current conditions, the two technical innovations allowed an increase of the total gross margin per hectare of cultivated area by respectively 8. 9 % and 17. 1 %. However, under contrasting future political and economic conditions, they were unable to mitigate the impact of drastic shocks. Public policy support would likely be needed to maintain local mixed crop-livestock farms in these contexts. The combination of discussions and simulations using concrete farm cases ensured a lively dialogue between researchers, farmers, and professionals. The process combined a broad range of empirical, technical and scientific knowledge and enriched both individual and collective learning. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

In the first grazing cycle, the heifers were raised together with the mothers on a pasture and stabled for the winter season. The heifers were slaughtered {{after the end of the}} second grazing cycle, which followed the next year. Light weight of the heifers was recorded at the end of the first grazing cycle, at the end of the winter season and again at the end of the second grazing cycle. The weight of the dressed carcass and the SEUROP classification was further recorded. The average daily gain was calculated for each period from the live weight. The data set was sorted by the month of birth of the heifer and by the SEUROP classification. Statistical data analyses were carried out using the Excel software. In order to evaluate the results, basic statistical parameters were calculated for each of the selected variables and the cogency of the differences between the groups was tested with the two-tailed t-test at the corresponding level of significance.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of physically effective neutral detergent fiber (peNDF) content in total mixed ration (TMR) on dry matter intake, digestibility, and chewing activity in fattening Hanwoo (Bos taurus coreanae) heifers. The experiment was designed as a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square using 12 <b>heifers.</b> <b>Fattening</b> <b>heifers</b> were offered one of three diets [high (T 1), medium (T 2), and low (T 3) peNDF] obtained by different mixing times (3, 10, and 25 min) for the same TMR feed. The peNDF content of TMR was determined by multiplying the proportion of dry matter retained by a 1. 18 mm-screen in a Penn State Particle Separator by the dietary NDF content. The peNDF 1. 18 content was 30. 36 %, 29. 20 %, and 27. 50 % for the T 1, T 2, and T 3 diets, respectively (p< 0. 05). Dry matter intake was not affected by peNDF content in TMR. Total weight gain in T 1 group was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) than in T 2 and T 3 groups. However, weight gain did not differ between T 2 and T 3 groups. The feed conversion ratio decreased with an increase in the peNDF content (T 1 : 12. 18, T 2 : 14. 17, and T 3 : 14. 01 g/g). An increase in the peNDF content of TMR was associated with a linear increase in the digestibility of dry matter, crude protein, crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber, and acid detergent fiber (p< 0. 05). Also, an increase in peNDF content of the TMR resulted in a linear increase in the number of chews in eating and ruminating (p< 0. 05), and consequently in the number of total chews (p< 0. 05). These results indicate that peNDF content affects digestibility and chewing activity. Consequently, the peNDF content of TMR should be considered for improving feed efficiency, digestibility, body weight gain, and performance in <b>fattening</b> <b>heifers...</b>|$|R

The general topic of this paper is the relationship between economic and envi-ronmental parameters and the choice of technology by firms.

40|$|Dairy farms produce {{significant}} {{greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions {{and are therefore}} a focal point for GHG-mitigation practices. To develop viable mitigation options, we need robust (insensitive to changes in model parameters and assumptions) predictions of GHG emissions. To this end, we developed a stochastic model to estimate the robustness of predictions based on input parameters (GHG emission factors and production traits) and their uncertainties. In our study we explored how sensitive predictions of GHG emissions are to three factors: (1) system boundaries of the emission model (2) the uncertainty of input parameters due to quality of data or methodological choices (epistemic uncertainty) and (3) inherent variability in input parameters (variability uncertainty). To assess the effect of system boundaries, we compared two different boundaries: the “dairy farm gate” boundary (all GHG emissions are allocated to milk) and “system expansion” (the model gives a GHG credit to beef derived from culled cows and bull, <b>heifer</b> and calf <b>fattening</b> of surplus dairy calves outside the farm). Results using the farm-gate boundary provide guidance to dairy farmers to reduce GHG emissions of milk production. The results using system expansion are important for defining GHG abatement policies for milk and beef production. We found that the choice of system boundary had the strongest impact on the level and variation of predicted GHG emissions. Model predictions were least robust for lower-yielding dairy cow production systems and when we used system expansion. We also explored which GHG-abatement strategies have the most leverage by assessing the influence of each input parameter on model predictions. Predicted GHG emissions were least sensitive to variability-related uncertainty in production traits (i. e. replacement rate, calving interval). Lower-yielding production systems had the highest variation, indicating the highest potential for GHG mitigation of all production systems studied. Variation in predicted GHG emissions increased substantially when both epistemic and variability uncertainty in emission factors and variability uncertainty in production traits were included in the model. If the system boundary was set at the farm gate, the emission factor of N 2 O from nitrogen input into the soil had the highest impact on variation in predicted GHG emissions. This variation stems from uncertainties in predicting N 2 O emissions (epistemic uncertainty) but also from inherent variability of N 2 O emissions over time and space. The uncertainty of predicted GHG emissions can be reduced by increasing the precision in predicting N 2 O emissions. However, this additional information does not reduce GHG emissions itself. Knowing site specific variability of N 2 O emissions can help reduce GHG emissions by specific management (e. g. reduce soil compaction, adopted manure management, choice of suitable crops). In case of system expansion, uncertainty in GHG emission credit for dairy beef contributed the most to increasing the variation in predicted GHG emissions. The stochastic-model approach gave important insights into the robustness of model outcomes, which is crucial in the search for cost-effective GHG-abatement options. Despite the high degree of uncertainty when using system expansion, its results help identifying global GHG mitigation options of combined milk and beef productio...|$|R
