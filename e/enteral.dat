5|$|In {{the second}} stage {{the aim is to}} reduce PD {{symptoms}} while controlling fluctuations in the effect of the medication. Sudden withdrawals from medication or overuse have to be managed. When oral medications are not enough to control symptoms, surgery, deep brain stimulation, subcutaneous waking day apomorphine infusion and <b>enteral</b> dopa pumps can be of use. The third stage presents many challenging problems requiring a variety of treatments for psychiatric symptoms, orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, etc. In the final stages of the disease, palliative care is provided to improve quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Administration {{through the}} {{gastrointestinal}} tract is sometimes termed <b>enteral</b> or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, {{in the sense}} that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as <b>enteral,</b> such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly <b>enteral</b> administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term <b>enteral</b> is reserved for substances with systemic effects.|$|E
25|$|<b>Enteral</b> routes are {{generally}} {{the most convenient}} for the patient, as no punctures or sterile procedures are necessary. <b>Enteral</b> medications are therefore often preferred {{in the treatment of}} chronic disease. However, some drugs can not be used enterally because their absorption in the digestive tract is low or unpredictable. Transdermal administration is a comfortable alternative; there are, however, only a few drug preparations that are suitable for transdermal administration.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of relapse after oral refeeding {{may be reduced}} by post-pyloric <b>enteral</b> rather than parenteral feeding prior to oral refeeding. IMRIE scoring is also useful.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the fecal occult blood test might be positive, if iron deficiency is the result of gastrointestinal bleeding; although the sensitivity of the test may mean that in some cases it will be negative even with <b>enteral</b> blood loss.|$|E
25|$|If defined {{strictly}} {{as having}} local effect, the topical {{route of administration}} can also include <b>enteral</b> administration of medications that are poorly absorbable by the gastrointestinal tract. One poorly absorbable antibiotic is vancomycin, which is recommended by mouth {{as a treatment for}} severe Clostridium difficile colitis.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with grade I or II encephalopathy, <b>enteral</b> feeding should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition {{should be used}} only if <b>enteral</b> feeding is contraindicated as it {{increases the risk of}} infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases the kidneys' ammonia production, potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in {{patients with}} acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and hypertonic glucose administered as needed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{drugs as}} tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods {{directly}} into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and <b>enteral</b> nutrition. Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach.|$|E
25|$|Parenteral {{administration}} generally acts {{more rapidly}} than topical or <b>enteral</b> administration, with onset of action often occurring in 15–30 seconds for IV, 10–20 minutes for IM and 15–30 minutes for SC. They also have essentially 100% bioavailability {{and can be used}} for drugs that are poorly absorbed or ineffective when they are given orally. Some medications, such as certain antipsychotics, can be administered as long-acting intramuscular injections. Ongoing IV infusions can be used to deliver continuous medication or fluids.|$|E
25|$|Premature babies {{can have}} {{difficulties}} coordinating their sucking reflex with breathing. They may also tire during feeds. Premature infants {{unable to take}} enough calories by mouth may need <b>enteral</b> or gavage feeding - inserting a feeding tube into the stomach to provide enough breast milk or a substitute. This is often done together with Kangaroo care (prolonged skin-to-skin contact with the mother) which makes later breastfeeding easier. For some suckling difficulties, such as may happen with cleft lip/palate, the baby can be fed with a Haberman Feeder.|$|E
25|$|In medicine, {{nutritional}} status {{can be assessed}} by measuring the concentration of transthyretin in the blood. In theory, other transport proteins such as albumin or transferrin could be used, but transthyretin is preferred because of its shorter half-life, although this means that its concentration more closely reflects recent dietary intake rather than overall {{nutritional status}}. Transthyretin concentration {{has been shown to}} be a good indicator of whether or not a malnourished patient will develop refeeding syndrome upon commencement of refeeding, via either the <b>enteral,</b> parenteral or oral routes.|$|E
25|$|Many {{patients}} {{will be in}} pain and have a loss of appetite after surgery. Part of the body's response to surgery is to direct energy to wound healing, which increases the body's overall energy requirements. Surgery affects nutritional status indirectly, particularly during the recovery period, as it can interfere with wound healing {{and other aspects of}} recovery. Surgery directly affects nutritional status if a procedure permanently alters the digestive system. <b>Enteral</b> nutrition (tube feeding) is often needed. However a policy of 'nil by mouth' for all gastrointestinal surgery has not been shown to benefit, with some suggestion it might hinder recovery.|$|E
25|$|Identical {{drugs can}} produce {{different}} results {{depending on the}} route of administration. For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after <b>enteral</b> administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration. This can be illustrated {{by the action of}} naloxone (Narcan), an antagonist of opiates such as morphine. Naloxone counteracts opiate action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the opiate.|$|E
25|$|As {{with mild}} acute pancreatitis, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to treat the underlying cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early <b>enteral</b> feeding within 48 hours has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Fluids and electrolytes are replaced intravenously. Nutritional support is initiated via tube feeding to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most affected by secreted pancreatic enzymes if there is no improvement in the first 72–96 hours of treatment.|$|E
25|$|Gastric impactions are {{relatively}} rare, and occur when food is not cleared {{at the appropriate}} rate. It is most commonly associated with ingestion of foods that swell after eating or feeds that are coarse (bedding or poor quality roughage), poor dental care, poor mastication, inadequate drinking, ingestion of a foreign object, and alterations in the normal function of the stomach. Persimmons, which form a sticky gel in the stomach, and haylage, have both been associated with it, as has wheat, barley, mesquite beans, and beet pulp. Horses usually show signs of mild colic that is chronic, unresponsive to analgesics, and may include signs such as dysphagia, ptyalism, bruxism, fever, and lethargy, although severe colic signs may occur. Signs of shock may be seen if gastric rupture has occurred. Usually, the impaction must be quite large before it presents symptoms, and may be diagnosed via gastroscopy or ultrasound, although rectal examinations are unhelpful. Persimmon impaction is treated with infusions of Coca-Cola. Other gastric impactions are often resolves with <b>enteral</b> fluids. Quick treatment generally produces a favorable prognosis.|$|E

2500|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a shift in the {{management}} paradigm from TPN (total parenteral nutrition) to early, post-pyloric <b>enteral</b> feeding (in which a feeding tube is endoscopically or radiographically introduced to the third portion of the duodenum). The advantage of <b>enteral</b> feeding is that it is more physiological, prevents gut mucosal atrophy, and is free from the side effects of TPN (such as fungemia). [...] The additional advantages of post-pyloric feeding are the inverse relationship of pancreatic exocrine secretions and distance of nutrient delivery from the pylorus, as well as reduced risk of aspiration.|$|E
2500|$|Women not {{responding}} to IV rehydration and medication may require nutritional support.

5000|$|In general medicine, <b>enteral</b> {{nutrition}} or {{drug administration}} (Greek enteros, [...] "intestine") is feeding or drug administration by the digestion process of a gastrointestinal (GI) tract, {{such as the}} human gastrointestinal tract. This contrasts with parenteral nutrition or drug administration (Greek para, [...] "besides" [...] + enteros), which occurs from routes outside the GI tract, such as intravenous routes. Generally, drugs are given by two general methods: <b>enteral</b> and parenteral administration. <b>Enteral</b> administration involves the esophagus, stomach, and small and large intestines (i.e., the gastrointestinal tract). Methods of administration include oral, sublingual (dissolving the drug under the tongue), and rectal. Parenteral routes do not involve the gastrointestinal tract. In pharmacology, the route of drug administration {{is important because it}} affects drug metabolism, drug clearance, and thus dosage.|$|E
