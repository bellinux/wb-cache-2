40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate aspects of hybrid joint design for a shear connection. Part 1 is design considerations and a case study based on a engine mount. In Part 2, an experimental study is conducted regarding how relaxation and creep affects properties of a hybrid joint between carbon fiber vinylester and steel. Failure modes, loss of clamped force and ultimate strength of the joint and how these are affected by elevated temperature and different clamped forces are presented. Test specimens were 184 × 45 × 5 mm CFRP, in double lap joint between two steel plates of same dimensions, with either a single or double M 10 hexagon <b>flange</b> <b>screw.</b> Creep/ relaxation testing was preformed over a 28 day period. Results shows that the amount of initial clamped force does not effect amount of loss of clamped force, but increase in temperature significantly does. Average loss was between 8. 3 an 8. 8 % for single joint specimens, initial torque of 28, 37 and 46 Nm, and 10. 8 % for double joint specimens, 37 Nm. But losses for specimens subjected to heat, 80 °C, was 35. 5 %. Ultimate bearing strength of the lamina was not effected by any circumstances. Slip load was lower for specimens clamped with lower clamped force, the loss over the 28 day period was not enough to produced any clear results regarding the amount of loss. But tendencies point towards a lowered slip load of the same magnitude as the loss of clamped force i. e around 8 - 9 %. Slip load for specimens subjected to 80 °C did not decreased, even though the clamped force had been lowered. All specimens fail in bearing, single bolted joints had a far more progressive failure than the double joints, which failed catastrophically...|$|E
40|$|Radiation {{leakages}} are {{a considerable}} problem when measuring waveguide structures at high frequencies. In {{order to maintain}} good electrical contact, flanges need to be tightly and evenly screwed to the device under test. This can be a time-consuming operation, especially with repeated measurements. We present a metamaterial-based adapter, which prohibits leakage even {{in the presence of}} gaps at the interconnects. This so-called gap adapter has been fabricated from a metallized polymer (SU 8). The reflection coefficient is below - 20 dB throughout the band for a 50 -mu m gap {{on both sides of the}} gap adapter. In comparison, a conventional waveguide with a 50 -mu m gap on both sides has a reflection coefficient of - 10 dB. The gap adapter can be used to perform fast measurements, since the normal <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> are redundant. We compare the SU 8 gap adapter with a Si version and to a smooth metal waveguide reference disc. The SU 8 gap adapter performed better than the Si version and much better than the waveguide disc in all test cases. SU 8 gap adapters were used to measure on a waveguide component. The SU 8 gap adapters with 50 -mu m gaps performed comparable with the waveguide component with the <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> carefully tightened. The polymer also makes the gap adapter mechanically robust and easy to mass fabricate. [2015 - 0113...|$|R

The corrosion results were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). In this study the screws were also crosscut and analyzed by means of FEG-SEM {{in order to determine}} the thickness and the elemental content of the surface coating.

40|$|The Sample Transfer Canister {{will be used}} by the Waste Receiving and Processing Facility (WRAP) for the {{transport}} of small quantity liquid samples that meet the definition of a limited quantity radioactive material, and may also be corrosive and/or flammable. Transport of the system will typically be north of the Wye Barricade between WRAP and the 222 -S Laboratory. The samples are intended to conform to the US Department of Transportation (DOT) regulation 49 CFR 1 73. 4, ``Exceptions for small quantities. `` The regulations require prototype testing of the package to demonstrate the effectiveness of the packaging system. The test procedure consisted of one 24 -hour compression test and five drop tests of various orientations onto an unyielding drop pad. The testing of the Sample Transfer Canister System was performed between February 16, 1998 and February 25, 1998. The results of the testing concluded that the Sample Transfer Canister System successfully met the testing requirements with certain modifications to the original system. The modifications included replacing the original eight <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> which were cold rolled 316 stainless steel with greater strength grade 8 high carbon-carbon steel screws, replacing the initial two glass receptacles with a better performing single glass receptacle which proved not to leak during testing, and adding more bubble wrap as extra padding...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} high {{frequency}} antennas is rapidly increasing {{with the development}} of new wireless rate communication technology. Planar antennas have an attractive form factor, but they require a distribution network. Microstrip technology is most commonly used at low frequency but suffers from large dielectric and ohmic losses at higher frequencies and particularly above 100 GHz. Substrate-integrated waveguides also suffer from dielectric losses. In addition, standard rectangular waveguide interfaces are inconvenient due to the four <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> that must be tightly fastened to the antenna to avoid leakage. The current paper presents a planar slot array antenna that does not suffer from any of these problems. The distribution network is realized by micromachining using low-loss gap waveguide technology, and it can be connected to a standard rectangular waveguide flange without using any screws or additional packaging. To realize the antenna at these frequencies, it was fabricated with micromachining, which offers the required high precision, and a low-cost fabrication method. The antenna was micromachined with DRIE in two parts, one silicon-on-insulator plate and one Si plate, which were both covered with Au to achieve conductivity. The input reflection coefficient was measured to be below 10 dB over a 15. 5 % bandwidth, and the antenna gain was measured to be 10. 4 dBi, both of which are in agreement with simulations...|$|R
40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) {{scattering}} parameters (S-parameters) {{play an important}} role to characterise RF signal transmission and reflection of active and passive devices such as transmission lines, components, and small-signal amplifiers. Vector network analysers (VNAs) are employed as instrumentation for such measurements. During the last years, the upper frequency limit of this instrumentation has been extended up to several hundreds of GHz for waveguide measurements. Calibration and verification procedures are obligatory prior to the VNA measurement to achieve accurate results and/or to obtain traceability to the International System of Units (SI). Usually, verification is performed by measuring well-matched devices with known S-parameters such as attenuators or short precision waveguide sections (shims). In waveguides, especially above 110 GHz, such devices may not exist and/or are not traceably calibrated. In some cases, e. g. filter networks, the devices under test (DUT) are partly highly reflective. This paper describes the dependency of the S-parameters a) on the calibration procedure, b) on the applied torque to the <b>flange</b> <b>screws</b> during the mating process of the single waveguide elements. It describes further c) how highly-reflective devices (HRD) can be used to verify a calibrated VNA, and d) how a measured attenuation at several hundreds of GHz can be substituted by a well-known coaxial attenuation at 279 MHz, the intermediate frequency (IF) of the VNA, to verify the linearity. This work is a contribution towards traceability and to obtain knowledge about the measurement uncertainty of VNA instrumentation in the millimetre-wave range...|$|R
40|$|Osseointegration {{is vital}} to the success of total knee arthroplasty. This {{intimate}} bone integration however, mostly occured on the femoral component but not on the tibial component. Failure to achieve sufficient primary fixation of the tibial component has been regarded as the major factor affecting bone growth. The problem would be more apparent under eccentric loading which created complex rocking motions in both flexion and extension during gait. Fixation features in terms of protrusion on the undersurface of the tibial component include <b>flange,</b> <b>screws</b> and stem. In this study, the effect of three fixation features under physiological loading was analysed using non-linear contact finite element analysis. Three dimensional model of a human tibia was reconstructed from CT dataset. Three different tibial compartments â€” the cross-flange, the linear flange and the tapered cylindrical shaft â€” were modeled without the polymeric tibial insert. The component was then positioned on the tibial plateau and bone preparation was virtually simulated. Each model was then meshed with solid tetrahedrals and material properties were assigned to the bone and the prostheses. Coefficient of friction between the bone and the implant was set to 0. 3. Pressure was applied on the medial plateau with magnitude corresponds to an eccentric load of 1250 N. Non-linear contact analysis was performed on each of the three components, together with a validated micromotion algorithm to predict instability at the bone-implant interface. Results showed that the cross flange was the most stable under eccentric load with micromotion values did not exceed the threshold limit for osseointegration...|$|R
50|$|Testing is done {{manually}} using {{a portable}} vapor analyzer that read in {{parts per million}} (ppm). Monitoring frequency, and the leak threshold, is determined by {{various factors such as}} the type of component being tested and the chemical running through the line. Moving components such as pumps and agitators are monitored more frequently than non-moving components such as <b>flanges</b> and <b>screwed</b> connectors. The regulations require that when a leak is detected the component be repaired within a set amount of days. Most facilities get 5 days for an initial repair attempt with no more than 15 days for a complete repair. Allowances for delaying the repairs beyond the allowed time are made for some components where repairing the component requires shutting process equipment down.|$|R

The column test strengths were compared with the theoretical design strengths, which were calculated using the Effective Width Method (EWM) and also the Direct Strength Method (DSM).

40|$|Many {{years of}} {{technological}} development and surgical experience in total hip arthroplasty, {{have increased the}} lifetime of implants to 15 years for 80 % of young patients (65). Complications after a primary hip implant often lead to a revision surgery as the only option to reconstruct the functionality of the hip joint. Loosening, failure or removal of implant components regularly involve bone loss, resulting in revision after revision surgery, leading to large acetabular defects and even pelvic dissociations. For these patients, a custom implant based on medical images is a new solution with good short to mid-term results. However, {{the complexity of the}} technology and the labor-intensive design process makes these implants very expensive for both the patient and the healthcare system. The goal of this thesis is to use state-of-the-art methods to reduce the implant design time, standardize the design process and improve the quality of the implants {{to take full advantage of}} the potential of patient-specific implant solutions. Before designing an implant, CT-images need to be segmented to make a 3 D-model of the pre-operative situation. Next, failed implant components need to be virtually removed. To determine the best treatment, it is important to quantify the bone loss and to consider biomechanical balancing of the contralateral hip joint. In this thesis, a statistical shape model of a healthy hemi-pelvis was constructed and an automatic method to compute a virtual anatomical reconstruction of a defect hemi-pelvis was developed. The reconstruction was later used to improve an existing bone loss quantification method, resulting in a more clinically relevant bone defect quantification. Finally, the shape model was used to determine the anatomical coordinate system of the pelvis, that is crucial for the positioning of the cup component of the implant and the biomechanical balancing compared to the contralateral hip joint center. The custom hip implant consists of a cup component, connected by three flanges that bridge the bone defect and are anchored in the remaining bone via <b>flange</b> <b>screws.</b> Underneath the <b>flanges</b> and around the cup, a porous structure is designed, filling the defect and allowing for bone ingrowth. Because the cup component is the most crucial component regarding biomechanics of the hip joint and because the rest of the implant is designed around this cup, research was done into objective cup evaluators that allow to compare different cup plannings. These evaluators were then used to develop an automatic cup optimization algorithm. Because every implant is unique, it is a challenge to guarantee the mechanical integrity of an implant during a normal implant lifetime. For economical reasons, this needs to be assessed without producing a copy of the implant and performing mechanical tests. Therefore, an automatic virtual mechanical test bench was developed using a finite element model, to allow identification and adaptation of weak spots in implants, during the implant design process. Through a validation experiment, it was shown that the virtual test bench gave good indications about the weak spots in the implant design that are prone to fatigue failure. In this research, a major step was taken in the direction of economically viable custom implants, by speeding up and standardizing the design process and improving the quality of the implants. Therefore, we expect that in the future it will be viable to bring custom implants to the market for patients with less severe bone defects. In that way, suboptimal solutions using standard revision components can be avoided. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the section moment capacity of cold-formed steel beams with rectangular hollow flanges. The new Rectangular Hollow Flange Beam (RHFB) is fabricated using a unique manufacturing process in which two cold-formed rectangular hollow <b>flanges</b> are <b>screw</b> fastened to a web plate. It possesses unique stress-strain characteristics and initial imperfections that are different from conventional open cold-formed steel sections and welded hollow flange beam sections. In this study, the section moment capacity of RHFBs was investigated using a series of full scale bending tests. Twenty two section moment capacity tests of RHFBs were conducted on short span flexural members with simply supported end conditions for three steel grades G 300, G 500 and G 550 and varying thicknesses. Test capacity results were compared with the capacities predicted by the current design rules in the Australian and North American steel design standards, AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100, to verify their applicability to RHFBs. The results show that although the current design rules based on effective width principles predicted the section moment capacities of RHFBs slightly unconservatively in comparison to test results, they can be used for RHFBs provided a suitable screw spacing is used. However, the Direct Strength Method (DSM) based design rules are found to predict the section moment capacity of this new screw-fastened hollow flange beam section conservatively in most cases. This research shows that the DSM based design rules including the new inelastic reserve bending capacity provisions in AISI S 100 can be used to predict the section moment capacities of both screw-fastened and welded hollow flange beam sections conservatively...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hip {{arthroplasty}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently performed orthopedic procedures with high scores of success while its most common complication is aseptic loosening of the acetabular component, which may result from host bone loss or even from pelvis discontinuity. The purpose of the study was to evaluate results in patients after revision acetabular arthroplasty with reconstruction rings and allografts. Materials and Methods: Retrospective data was collected from 69 revisions of acetabular components, performed in a group of 69 treated patients (the mean age 65. 1 years). Before surgery, the patients had bone defects of type IIb (n = 5), IIc (n = 20), IIIa (n = 27) or IIIb (n = 17), according to Paprosky et al. Results: The mean followup period of the patients was 7. 2 years (range 3 - 19 years). A Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a 3 - and 10 year survival rate was 92. 8 % and 84. 8 % respectively, using further revision for any reason of the acetabular device as an end point. Eight patients revealed implant related complications. Four patients presented with ring loosening, one with a loose acetabular polyethylene cup, two hips demonstrated recurrent dislocations and one patient was with deep infection. Regarding the remaining 61 patients without re-revision surgery, the mean Harris hip score improved from 30. 5 to 73. 8 points. Conclusion: A modified, antiprotrusion cage provides an acceptable survival rate and radiological results, but complications could still be expected. It seems that the observed massive bone loss with pelvic discontinuity and an insufficient fixation of the cage to the ischium may result in implant loosening. Stable fixation of the ischial ring <b>flange</b> with <b>screws</b> is an essential condition to expect a good outcome...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} column tests on cold-formed steel {{built-up}} closed sections with intermediate stiffeners {{is presented in}} this paper. The test specimens were first brake pressed from structural steel sheets to form open sections with intermediate web stiffeners, then two of the open sections were connected at their <b>flanges</b> using self-tapping <b>screws</b> to form the built-up closed sections. The high strength structural steel sheets had the measured 0. 2 % proof stress up to 586 MPa. Initial and overall geometric imperfections as well as material properties and residual stresses of the test specimens were measured. Tests were performed over a range of lengths such that column curves could be obtained. The test strengths are compared with the design strengths calculated using the direct strength method in the North American Specification and Australian/New Zealand Standard for cold-formed steel structures. Three different methods were used to obtain the local and distortional buckling stresses for the calculation of the direct strength method. Reliability analysis was performed to assess {{the reliability of the}} direct strength method on cold-formed steel built-up closed section columns. It is shown that the direct strength method using single section to obtain the buckling stresses is generally conservative. © 2008 ASCE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
