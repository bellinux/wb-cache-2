5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders wondered <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company {{planned to use}} them to develop their first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired the rights to the Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński {{had no idea how to}} develop a video game at that time.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015, fans mistook {{random numbers}} that were placed by Cawthon into the source {{code of the}} game's {{official}} website to be coordinates that pointed to a location significant to the games. Fans entered these numbers into Google Maps and consequently discovered a pizzeria in Virginia. Mass phone calls {{were made to the}} pizzeria by fans, attempting to discover <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> had a connection to the upcoming installment, Five Nights at Freddy's 4. It was later confirmed by Cawthon that this pizzeria had no connection with the Five Nights at Freddy's series.|$|E
5|$|On 24 August 1899, Sub-Inspector AM Harte-Barry of the British South Africa Police interviewed Chief Mubruma, who corroborated {{much of what}} Chintanda {{had said}} {{regarding}} Clark's claims to represent the Company. Mubruma said that Clark had visited the previous week and {{had told him to}} have his men ready for work south of the river within a month. When told that Clark had no connection with the BSAC, Mubruma said that he would not give Clark the workers, but would readily take part in the kind of scheme he had suggested <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Company</b> wished. He made no comment relevant to Clark's alleged sexual misconduct.|$|E
50|$|Example: A company hires a {{catering}} {{company to}} provide drinks and {{food for a}} retirement party. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> catering <b>company</b> fails to show up, it is considered nonfeasance. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> catering <b>company</b> shows up but only provides drinks (and not the food, which was also paid for), it is considered misfeasance. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> catering <b>company</b> accepts a bribe from its client's competitor to undercook the meat, thereby giving those present food poisoning, it is considered malfeasance.|$|R
50|$|Consequently, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> {{dominating}} a media market {{choose to}} suppress stories {{that do not}} serve their interests, the public suffers, since they are not adequately informed of some crucial issues that may affect them.|$|R
5000|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> {{have already}} {{borrowed}} in the currencies each needs the principal in, then exposure {{is reduced by}} swapping cash flows only, so that each company's finance cost is in that company's domestic currency.|$|R
5|$|With a {{loan from}} his cousin, Dudley Selden, and letters of {{recommendation}} from Ellsworth, Colt formed a corporation of venture capitalists in April 1836 {{to bring his}} idea to market. Through the political connections of these venture capitalists, the Patent Arms Manufacturing of Paterson, New Jersey, was chartered by the New Jersey legislature on March 5, 1836. Colt was given a commission for each gun sold {{in exchange for his}} dam of patent rights, and stipulated the return of the rights <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{wrote to}} the Company again on 12 April 1899, once more {{attaching}} copies of his concessions, with an offer to supply the BSAC settlements in Southern Rhodesia with contract labourers taken from among his neighbouring chiefs' populations. He said he had permission {{from all of the}} chiefs involved to do so. He requested as his fee £1 per man, and said that he had agreed a monthly wage of 10 shillings for each worker plus food, accommodation and fuel. Having split his concessions into two sections to draw labour from, Clark proposed to provide Salisbury with workers from his eastern concessions, and Bulawayo with those from the west. The chiefs had agreed to provide workers on contracts lasting six months, but Clark wrote that he could attempt to supply labour all year round <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>Company</b> wished.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the {{management}} of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was to stay competitive on charter flights. Larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, while the 737s {{could be used to}} smaller destination and from other cities. On 25 February 1980, the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767-200 planes, with an option for two addition craft. The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK500 million. This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter, and was configured with 242 seats. This was less than charter-only airlines, for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats. Braathens SAFE's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984. The following year showed increasing charter traffic, although it only made up 25% of the company's revenue. The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757, but did not have sufficient range. Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen.|$|E

50|$|Delivering {{adequate}} {{value to}} the shareholders {{seemed to be the}} issue. Uniliver offered to pay significantly more than <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> stock value on Nasdaq. Industry analysts speculated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> founders did not sell, they would have been open to legal attacks from major shareholders.|$|R
50|$|The {{arbitration}} board eventually {{sided with the}} union, and the Supreme Court ordered that <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> should meet <b>the</b> workers' demands. However, <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> protested, and Cárdenas offered a deal to end <b>the</b> strike <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> paid 26 million pesos {{for the loss of}} wage incurred by the strike. When neither option passed, Cárdenas decided to create <b>the</b> national oil <b>company,</b> Pemex.|$|R
5|$|The Royal Mail Case or R v Kylsant & Otrs was a noted English {{criminal}} case in 1931. The {{director of the}} Royal Mail Steam Packet Company, Lord Kylsant, had falsified a trading prospectus {{with the aid of}} the company accountant to make it look as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was profitable and to entice potential investors. Following an independent audit instigated by HM Treasury, Kylsant and John Moreland, the company auditor, were arrested and charged with falsifying both the trading prospectus and company records and accounts. Although they were acquitted of falsifying records and accounts, Kylsant was found guilty of falsifying the trading prospectus and sentenced to twelve months in prison. The company was then liquidated, and reconstituted as The Royal Mail Lines Ltd with the backing of the British government.|$|E
25|$|Canada Pension Plan Investment Board’s CEO Mark Wiseman {{stated that}} he would {{consider}} investing in BlackBerry <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> became private. Also on August 12, 2013, foremost shareholder Prem Watsa resigned from BlackBerry's board.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> {{subsequently}} {{goes into}} liquidation, then the directors remain in office {{but they are}} effectively divested of all of their powers of management and the liquidator takes control and custody of the assets and the business and affairs of the company.|$|E

Microsoft believed it would be able to better negotiate with a new board.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} of the reasons which lead to foreign investments shows a clear dominance of market-oriented goals. An excellent global sourcing strategy will lead to economical success only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> procurement department has a strong position within <b>the</b> <b>company</b> and even more at their foreign location. They must take on {{an active role in}} the market...|$|R
25|$|After this, an {{accounting}} period {{does not end}} other than by the expiration of 12 months from its beginning or by {{the completion of the}} winding up. However, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> later enters administration, this rule is disapplied from that point (and with {{an accounting}} period ending because the company has entered into administration).|$|E
25|$|Employers may put {{pressure}} on a union by declaring a lockout, a work stoppage in which an employer prevents employees from working until certain conditions are met. A lockout changes the psychological impact of a work stoppage and, <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> possesses information about an impending strike, can be enacted prior to the strike's implementation.|$|E
25|$|In 1868, {{the company}} finally secured a {{substantial}} contract, {{for the construction}} of five cargo ships for the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, which were duly completed between 1869 and 1870. Briefly it appeared as <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company,</b> with the patronage of the Railroad, might be able to overcome its difficulties, but then the Railroad decided to cancel its plans for more ships.|$|E
50|$|This {{accounting}} principle assumes that, a company {{will continue to}} exist long enough {{to carry out its}} objectives and commitments and will not liquidate in <b>the</b> foreseeable future. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>company's</b> financial situation is such that the accountant believes <b>the</b> <b>company</b> {{will not be able to}} continue on, the accountant is required to disclose this assessment.|$|R
50|$|Both private {{companies}} initially had {{to post a}} performance bond that could be called by MWSS <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> failed to fulfill their obligations. Maynilad had posted US$120 million because of its larger share both of the concession area and MWSS' old debts, and Manila Water posted US$80 million.|$|R

25|$|In {{spite of}} Can-Car's success in other markets, {{as early as}} 1981 the {{government}} had considered selling UTDC to the private sector. Their concern was that without a manufacturing business, UTDC would {{find it difficult to}} make enough income to justify its Kingston operations. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> did start a manufacturing side, it would be inappropriate for the company to remain government owned. The Can-Car deal put this on hold for a time.|$|E
25|$|There were {{questions}} over {{the extent to}} which Apple would retain control over the non-processor components of the system design. Apple is traditionally a systems builder, and some feared that Apple's industrial design philosophy may be affected <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> switched to commodity parts. Others noted that Apple has slowly been switching to standard parts since the introduction of the PCI Power Mac in 1995, and said that using a non-Apple chipset in itself would not harm the Mac's image.|$|E
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> is solvent, and {{the members}} have made a {{statutory}} declaration of solvency, the liquidation will proceed as a members' voluntary winding-up. In that case the general meeting will appoint the liquidator(s). If not, the liquidation will proceed as a creditors' voluntary winding-up, and a meeting of creditors will be called, to which the directors must report on the company's affairs. Where a voluntary liquidation proceeds as a creditors' voluntary liquidation, a liquidation committee may be appointed.|$|E
50|$|The Commission's {{decision}} {{comes after}} a thorough investigation, which {{established that the}} eight producers, which together account for the quasi totality of the production world-wide, operated a secret cartel {{during most of the}} 90s resulting in considerably higher prices than <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>companies</b> had competed against each other.|$|R
50|$|Economic {{growth and}} the {{essentiality}} of it are the key factors for the regional development {{in the region of}} Barents.

25|$|Network Rail's {{acquisition}} of Railtrack plc was welcomed {{at the time}} by groups that represented British train passengers.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, Pneumatic Tyre {{established}} divisions in Europe and North America sending there four of du Cros's six sons. Factories were established overseas because foreign patents rights {{would only be}} maintained <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was engaged in active manufacture where its tyres were sold. Pneumatic Tyre partnered with local cycle firms such as Clement Cycles in France and Adler in Germany in order to limit the necessary capital expenditure. An American business {{was established in the}} USA in 1893 with a factory in Buffalo, New York after Harvey du Cros junior was old enough (21) to sign the necessary deeds.|$|E
25|$|HyperCard {{was created}} by Bill Atkinson {{following}} an lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) trip. Work for it began in March 1985 {{under the name of}} WildCard (hence its creator code of 'WILD'). In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on HyperTalk and the name was changed to HyperCard for trademark reasons. It was initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the MacWorld Conference & Expo in Boston, Massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Titan Sports, {{the parent}} company of the World Wrestling Federation, sued World Championship Wrestling (WCW) over WCW {{implying}} that Scott Hall and Kevin Nash (Razor Ramon and Diesel) were invading WCW on the WWF's behalf. This led to a series of lawsuits filed by both companies as the Monday Night War heated up. The lawsuit went on for years, ending with a settlement in 2000. One of the terms gave then WWF the right to bid on WCW's assets <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>company</b> was liquidated. Time Warner, the then parent company of WCW, cancelled WCW's television shows in March 2001 and sold the company assets to WWE.|$|E
