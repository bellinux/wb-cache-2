30|$|The {{number of}} <b>flocks</b> per breed <b>registered</b> varied from 2 for SAMM to 3397 for Santa Inês. The breeds {{with the lowest}} number of <b>flocks</b> <b>registered</b> are {{classified}} as commercial and were imported into Brazil {{in recent years to}} diversify production options (such as Lacaune for milk, or Karakul for pelt). Several Brazilian naturalized ecotypes or genetic groups are not yet recognized as local breeds (such as the Pantaneira and Barriga Negra (called Black Belly in English)). The observations here are in agreement with FAO (2007 a, b) who observe that most livestock production systems depend on species originally domesticated in other regions of the world. They also state that these systems depend on breeds developed in other countries and regions, making most countries highly interdependent with respect to animal genetic resources. The limited geographical distribution of some breeds makes them vulnerable (Alderson, 2009), especially those in harsh environments and at risk from disease, drought or even human action such as crossbreeding.|$|R
30|$|The {{weighted}} mean center (latitude and longitude) for each breed was calculated using {{the number of}} <b>flocks</b> <b>registered</b> per municipality. No information was available on flock size. Information on vegetation type by municipality was collected from the 2006 Brazilian Agricultural Census (IBGE, 2012 a), the last available, as well as population, area and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of the Municipality from IBGE (2012 b). Human development Index (HDI) was available from the United Nations Development Programme (PNUD, 2013). This included percentage of cover of brush and pasture (natural, planted, degraded), areas of forest or shrub, population, GDP, HDI and number of animal units per farm. Variance Inflation (> 10) and collinearity (condition index – CI > 30) were examined using Proc REG as these are essentially characteristics of the explanatory variables. As expected THI, temperature and relative humidity showed high values for these traits. The final model included altitude, precipitation, NDVI, temperature, solar radiation, number of animals per farm and per km 2, area of native and planted pastures, shrub and forest as well as HDI and animals per area.|$|R

30|$|Poll Merino, Lincoln, Southdown, and Wiltshire Horn have no <b>flocks</b> <b>registered.</b> There {{were two}} wool {{naturalized}} breeds (Bergamácia Brasileira and Crioula) {{in this study}} while the rest were hair breeds (Table  1). International breeds recognised in Brazil include 20 international breeds ([URL] Australian Merino, Poll Merino, Ideal, Corriedale, Romney Marsh, Texel, Hampshire Down, Ile de France, Suffolk, Lincoln, Karakul, Border Leicester, Southdown, Lacaune, Wiltshire Horn, Polypay, Poll Dorset, Dorper, White Dorper and South African Mutton Merino (SAMM) and 7 breeds formed in Brazil include Bergamácia Brasileira, Morada Nova, Santa Inês, Somális Brasileira, Rabo Largo, Cariri and Crioula. It {{should also be noted}} that the “wool” from the Crioula is medulated like hair, different from wool from commercial breeds which is not (Moraes & Souza, 2011). Although the Santa Inês is a Brazilian breed, it was considered as commercial due to its wide distribution and recent history as to crossbreeding (Paiva et al., 2005, McManus et al., 2010). The number of animals per flock could be an important factor in making decisions on conservation priorities (Reist-Marti et al., 2006) but this information was not available in this study.|$|R
40|$|A {{mail survey}} of Canadian sheep <b>flocks</b> <b>registered</b> on the Record of Performance program was conducted, and the {{association}} of management practices and diseases with productivity was studied using multiple regression techniques. The relationships between management practices and diseases of lambs which were associated with production were also investigated using discriminant analysis. Flocks in the maritimes had a lower average flock productivity than those in Ontario-Quebec and the western provinces. In purebred flocks, the average adjusted weight at 100 days of age was higher than in other types of flocks, and the prevalence of scours was lower. At the herd level, the rates of pregnancy toxemia and vaginal prolapse were associated with heavier lambs, while the average daily weight gain between 50 and 100 days of age was lower in herds affected by scours and starvation. Using pasture and bush as winter housing was also detrimental to lamb productivity. No management practices discriminated between case and control flocks for scours and starvation in lambs. It was concluded that {{the reasons for the}} geographic differences should be investigated as should the management differences between purebred and other producers. Prevention of scours and starvation in lambs should be given priority in order to increase productivity. LR: 20061115; PUBM: Print; JID: 8607793; ppublishSource type: Electronic(1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Although modern {{commercial}} poultry production today {{is based on}} large farms and intensive husbandry, keeping backyard poultry has regained popularity in industrialized countries. However, the health status of backyard flocks is still relatively poorly documented. A questionnaire {{was sent to the}} owners of 376 backyard poultry flocks (< 500 birds) in order to study health management procedures and characterize backyard poultry populations in Finland. Information was also collected on the postmortem findings from non-commercial flocks using necropsy data from the Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira). Results Backyard flocks in Finland are small in size (< 50 birds), comprising mainly chickens. Based on the results of the questionnaire, the health of such flocks is good, mortality low and vaccinations are not commonly used. Most of the <b>flocks</b> were <b>registered</b> in the national poultry register. The standard biosecurity practices are not generally applied and contact with wild birds, pets and farm animals is frequent, which can make the flocks more prone to infectious diseases. We conducted an 11 -year retrospective study of the postmortem necropsy findings of the Evira in order to document the diseases, which caused mortality in backyard chickens in Finland. Necropsy was performed on a total of 132 non-commercial laying hens during 2000 &# 8211; 2011. The most common postmortem findings were Marek&# 8217;s disease (27 %) and colibacillosis (17 %). Conclusions This study is the first to report data on characteristics of and management practices for backyard chicken flocks in Finland. Close connections with commercial flocks are rare and farms are usually distantly located suggesting that the risk that these backyard flocks pose to {{commercial poultry}} is low...|$|R
40|$|Connectedness across <b>flocks</b> of the <b>registered</b> {{population}} of the Sardinian dairy sheep breed was evaluated. Used criteria were: number of sires {{used in the same}} contemporary group; number of direct links and the average within and between contemporary group relationship coefficients. Dataset including yearlings’ first lactation records of 1990 and 2008 were compared to evaluate the effect of coupling artificial insemination with controlled natural mating on connectedness. An increase of number of sires and direct links were registered between 1990 and 2008. These results confirm that the across years prolonged use of well planned moderate rates of artificial insemination had a strong effect on the overall statistical connectedness across flocks so permitting more accurate estimations of the management and genetic effects. As a whole, the decreasing of the average relationship within flock coupled to a marked enhance of the average relationship between contemporary groups, indicates that the genetic connectedness of the Sardinian registered population presents a clearly increasing trend. This fact assures that current genetic evaluations are reliable across flocks...|$|R

Frank Mundy and Bill Blair rounded out the top five, both driving Cadillacs. Forty-five new Strictly Stock automobiles went to the starting post, the most cars to stat a race in the 1949 season. Turner averaged 69.403 mph. Byron and Sosebee earned the front row starting positions in qualifying. Fonty <b>Flock,</b> however, <b>registered</b> the fastest time in [...] "Speed Trials" [...] with an 80.140 fast lap. Fonty challenged Byron and Sosebee at the start, but the engine in his Buick blew after three laps. Sosebee struggled with tire problems and wound up 19th.

Tim Flock was a contender for victory until sidelined by a lost wheel.|$|R
30|$|According to Carson et al. (2009) {{knowledge}} on breed distribution can indicate regions {{at risk from}} diseases that can wipe out populations of Animal Genetic Resources (AnGR). In Brazil, the smaller commercial breeds {{are at greater risk}} than the naturalized breeds which tend to have a wider distribution. Breeds such as Border Leicester, SAMM and Polypay were brought to Brazil for crossbreeding purposes and apparently were not successful, or the breeders were not interested in them. In contrast, the Romney Marsh, was formerly {{one of the most important}} breeds in the Southern Region, but nowadays presents only 92 <b>registered</b> <b>flocks</b> in 40 municipalities, which could an indication that some actions of conservation of animal genetic resources should be planned also for commercial exotic breeds. The Crioula could possibly be the breed with highest risk, for example, from a localized disease outbreak. It’s distribution is concentrated in the South of the country with the lowest variability making these populations more at risk. The Northeastern States are in a region called the drought polygon, highly susceptible to long periods of high temperatures and no precipitation (Lôbo et al., 2011) which may directly affect the local breed selection.|$|R
40|$|The Barbarine sheep is {{generally}} managed within small interconnected herds. The {{goal of the}} present work is to investigate {{the effect of the}} mating management on genetic variability in a <b>registered</b> <b>flock</b> which starts showing a productivity falling, especially in lamb’s survival and this despite a practice of outbreeding. Pedigree data of 11136 animals born between 1977 and 2007 were used to compute genealogical parameters. A first investigation of the lambs-parents relationships highlighted two periods that we denoted: P 1 and P 2. During P 1, the mating strategy had been progressively based on animals born within the flock, whereas during P 2, ewes and rams coming from outside the herd were gradually introduced as parents with unknown genealogy. This change in matings policy has been emphasised by plotting equivalent complete generations averaged whether by year of birth or maximum number of traced generations. All the computed genealogical parameters have been affected by the matings policy change and especially the individual average relatedness and realised effective size, which seem to be powerful tools to monitor the genetic variability within a population that is not closed to exchanges. An important effect of pedigree depth has been detected; this would require special attention to the matings of individuals with deepest genealogy. In spite of this effect, the heterozygote deficiency within the herd confirmed that the genetic variability has not been much affected along the flock life, which confirms that the decline in productivity should not be allotted to matings’ policy, but probably to other management factors...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia Agronómica - Agro-Pecuária - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaIn this study, {{growth and}} {{reproductive}} records from two Portuguese breeds of sheep - Merino Branco (MB) and Merino Preto (MP) {{were analyzed by}} linear model methodologies to assess the importance of systematic environmental factors on these traits. Data were gathered from <b>flocks</b> <b>registered</b> in the Herd Books owned by the Portuguese Merino Breeders Association from 1995 to 2008. Growth traits evaluated were adjusted weights at 30 (PA 30), 60 (PA 60) and 90 (PA 90) days of age and average daily weight gains from birth to 30 (GMD 30), 60 (GMD 60) and 90 (GMD 90) days of age. A total of 36029 weighing records were used for MB and 16098 records for MP. To evaluate prolificacy, 29008 and 12827 records were analyzed for MB and MP, respectively. Separated {{statistical analyses were performed}} for each breed. Growth data were analyzed as a trait of the lamb and models included the fixed effects of sex, type of birth, age of dam, season of birth and the interactions sex * type of birth, year of birth * breeder, age of dam * type of birth and type of birth * season of birth and ewe and residual as random effects. Prolificacy was evaluated as a repeated trait of the ewe and the model contained the fixed effects of season of birth of the ewe, lambing season, age of ewe at lambing and the interactions year of lambing * breeder and age of ewe at lambing * lambing season and the residual as random effect. Adjusted weights for MB single born lambs were 11, 12 ± 0, 03 Kg for PA 30, 17, 74 ± 0, 06 Kg for PA 60 and 24, 20 ± 0, 09 Kg PA 90. Corresponding weights for MP were 11, 17 ± 0, 04 Kg for PA 30, 17, 40 ± 0, 08 Kg for PA 60 and 23, 42 ± 0, 13 Kg PA 90, respectively. MB twin lambs weighted 1, 85 Kg, 2, 71 Kg and 3, 16 Kg less than singles (p < 0, 001), for PA 30, PA 60 and PA 90, respectively. On average, single born MP lambs were 14 % heavier than twins and, as observed for MP lambs, differences increased with age. Males were significantly heavier than females (p < 0, 001). Observed differences were 0, 4 Kg for PA 30, 0, 7 Kg for PA 60 and 1, 0 Kg for PA 90 in the MB breed and 0, 5 Kg for PA 30, 0, 9 Kg for PA 60 and 1, 3 Kg for PA 90 for MP. For both breeds, ewes of intermediate ages (4 and 5 years old) had in general heavier lambs than younger or older ewes (p < 0, 001). Lambs born in the Fall were lighter as compared to those born in Winter (p < 0, 001) (11 % for MB and 13 % for MP). Average daily gains for MB singles were 220 ± 0, 001 gr/day for GMD 30, GMD 60 and GMD 90, respectively. Corresponding values for MP were 230 ± 0, 001 gr/day, 220 ± 0, 001 gr/day and 210 ± 0, 001 gr/day. In both breeds, differences between singles and twins (p < 0, 001) ranged from 20 to 30 gr/day for all growth intervals. Males grew faster than the females (p < 0, 001), with differences of 8 gr/day for GMD 30 and 10 gr/day for GMD 60 and GMD 90 in the MB. For MP larger differences were observed between sexes (10 gr/day for GMD 30 and GMD 60 and 20 gr/day for GMD 90). As for fixed age weights, a quadratic effect of age of dam was also observed for all weight gains in the two breeds. Consistently higher weight gains were obtained in lambs born in Winter than in the Fall (range 20 to 50 gr/day). Prolificacy was low for both breeds (average 1, 10 lambs/ewe lambing). For MB, most of the variation was due to the interactions year of lambing * breeder and age (P< 0, 001) of ewe at lambing * lambing season (P< 0, 001) reflecting probably large management differences. In the MP breed,besides these effects, age of ewe at lambing was significant (p< 0, 001). Four year old and older ewes showed higher prolificacies (range 1, 14 to 1, 16) than younger ewes (range 1, 06 to 1, 10). The results of this study show that the same environmental factors affect growth performance in both breeds. Growth rate is slower than typical meat sheep breeds, but having in perspective that animals are raised in extensive grazing conditions, the growth potential shown by both breeds is reasonable. In terms of reproduction, prolificacy is rather low, showing however an increase with increasing age. The combined results of growth and reproductive performance reveal that these genotypes show great longevity and adaptability to local production systems. [...] Procedeu-se à análise, pelo método dos quadrados mínimos, de alguns efeitos ambientais sistemáticos sobre caracteres produtivos e reprodutivos de ovinos das raças Portuguesas Merina Branca e Merina Preta. Os dados foram recolhidos nos efectivos dos criadores inscritos na ANCORME, entre 1995 - 2008. Os pesos ajustados aos 30, 60 e 90 dias para os borregos da raça MB e nascidos de partos simples foram 11, 12 ± 0, 03 Kg; 17, 74 ± 0, 06 Kg; 24, 20 ± 0, 09 Kg, respectivamente e 11, 17 ± 0, 04 Kg; 17, 40 ± 0, 08; 23, 42 ± 0, 13 Kg para borregos MP. Para as duas raças em estudo, os machos superiorizaram-se significativamente (P < 0, 001) às fêmeas e borregos nascidos no Inverno foram sempre mais pesados (P < 0, 001) comparativamente aos nascidos na época do Outono. Observou-se que borregos MB e MP, oriundos de partos simples fizeram ganhos médios diários de 220 gr/dia. O valor da prolificidade foi baixo para as duas raças, relativamente a outras raças de ovinos (valor médio de 1, 10 borr. /parto) aumentando com a idade da ovelha. Este estudo revela que estas raças possuem uma taxa de crescimento mais lento relativamente a outras raças vocacionadas para a produção de carne, assim como a baixa prolificidade registada.
