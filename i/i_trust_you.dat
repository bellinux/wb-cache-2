2500|$|Tritt and Stuart began a [...] "No Hats Tour" [...] in 1992. In August of {{that same}} year, Tritt {{released}} the album T-R-O-U-B-L-E. Its first single was [...] "Lord Have Mercy on the Working Man," [...] a song written by Kostas. This song, which featured backing vocals from Brooks & Dunn, T. Graham Brown, George Jones, Little Texas, Dana McVicker (who also sang backup on Tritt's first two albums), Tanya Tucker and Porter Wagoner, peaked at number four. Its follow-up, [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>You</b> with My Heart," [...] became Tritt's third Billboard number one in early 1993. The album's next three singles did not perform as well on the charts: the title track (a cover of an Elvis Presley song), peaked at 13, followed by [...] "Looking Out for Number One" [...] at number 11 and [...] "Worth Every Mile" [...] at number 30. T-R-O-U-B-L-E became the second album of his career to achieve double-platinum certification. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic thought that T-R-O-U-B-L-E followed too closely the formula of It's All About to Change, but said that the songs showed Tritt's personality. Nash gave the album a similar criticism, but praised the rock influences of [...] "Looking Out for Number One" [...] and the vocals on [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>Trust</b> <b>You</b> with My Heart." ...|$|E
