This work focused on the role of nanosilica on papermaking wet end system in response to some processing parameters (drainage, retention, and electrostatic force of the whole system). The observations indicated that the nanosilica performance is defined by interactions of nanosilica with the complex aqueous environment of wet end system.

It was found that the maize starch would have the same function as the OMP if carboxymethyl groups were introduced; moreover, the performance of carboxymethyl starch as a retention and <b>drainage</b> <b>aid</b> could be enhanced by grafting some cationic groups on the backbone of the starch so that it could absorb on fibers through electrostatic attraction. In this study, the introduced groups of cationic-modified carboxymethyl starch (CCMS) prepared from waxy maize were determined by FT-IR and 1 H NMR spectroscopy. Factors affecting retention and drainage, comparison between CCMS and OMP systems, and also the strengthening effect of CCMS were studied. The results showed that CCMS had excellent performance when it was used with cationic polyacrylamide (CPAM) as a retention system. Compared with the OMP, CCMS had better retention performance when the dosage was in the range from 0. 01 % to 0. 08 %, and it yielded much more uniform formation of the handsheets. Additionally, CCMS had a strengthening effect on the paper, which distinguished it from other retention aids...|$|E

The manmade East Fen Catchwater Drain passes close to Keal Cotes ensuring that, although low lying, the possibility of flooding is almost non existent. Minor problems have occurred in recent years through farmers and householders failing to properly complete the expected annual clearing of minor feeder drains around their properties.

40|$|Various {{strength}} properties of paper are measured {{to tell how}} well it resists breaks in a paper machine or in printing presses. The most often measured properties are dry tensile strength and dry tear strength. However, in many situations where paper breaks, it is not dry. For example, in web breaks after the wet pressing the dry matter content can be around 45 %. Thus, wet-web strength is often a more critical paper property than dry strength. Both wet and dry {{strength properties}} of the samples were measured with a L&W tensile tester. Originally this device was not designed for the measurement of the wet web tensile strength, thus a new procedure to handle the wet samples was developed. The method was tested with Pine Kraft (never dried). The effect of different strength additives on the wet-web and dry paper tensile strength was studied. The polymers used in this experiment were aqueous solution of a cationic polyamidoamine-epichlorohydrin resin (PAE), cationic hydrophilised polyisocyanate and cationic polyvinylamine (PVAm). From all three used chemicals only Cationic PAE considerably increased the wet web strength. However it was noticed that at constant solids content all chemicals decreased the wet web tensile strength. So, since all chemicals enhanced solid content {{it can be concluded}} that they work as <b>drainage</b> <b>aids,</b> not as wet web strength additives. From all chemicals only PVAm increased the dry strength and two other chemicals even decreased the strength.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: The {{proliferation}} of minimally invasive cardiac surgery has increased dependence on augmented venous return techniques for cardiopulmonary bypass. Such augmented techniques {{have the potential}} to introduce venous air emboli, which can pass to the patient. We examined the potential for the transmission of air emboli with different augmented venous return techniques. Methods: In vitro bypass systems with augmented venous drainage were created with either kinetically augmented or vacuum-augmented venous return. Roller or centrifugal pumps were used for arterial perfusion in combination with a hollow fiber oxygenator and a 40 -μm arterial filter. Air was introduced into the venous line via an open 25 -gauge needle. Test conditions involved varying the amount of negative venous pressure, the augmented venous return technique, and the arterial pump type. Measurements were recorded at the following sites: pre-arterial pump, post-arterial pump, post-oxygenator, and patient side. Results: Kinetically augmented venous return quickly filled the centrifugal venous pump with macrobubbles requiring continuous manual clearing; a steady state to test for air embolism could not be achieved. Vacuum-augmented venous return handled the air leakage satisfactorily and microbubbles per minute were measured. Higher vacuum pressures resulted in delivery of significantly more microbubbles to the “patient” (P <. 001). The use of an arterial centrifugal pump was associated with fewer microbubbles (P =. 02). Conclusions: Some augmented venous return configurations permit a significant quantity of microbubbles to reach the patient despite filtration. A centrifugal pump has air-handling disadvantages when used for kinetic venous drainage, but when used as an arterial pump in combination with vacuum-assisted venous <b>drainage</b> it <b>aids</b> in clearing air emboli.
