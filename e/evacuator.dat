25|$|The Leclerc is {{equipped}} with a GIAT (Nexter) CN120-26 120mm smoothbore cannon. This cannon is capable of firing the same NATO standard 120mm rounds as the German Leopard 2 and US M1 Abrams, but in practice only French-produced ammunition is issued. The gun is insulated with a thermal sleeve and has an automatic compressed-air fume extraction system instead of the usual bore <b>evacuator.</b> The Leclerc has a unique autoloading system which was specifically designed for it, and reduces the crew to three by eliminating the human loader. The turret of the Leclerc was designed around the auto-loading system {{in order to avoid the}} problems common to other tanks with an autoloader. The Leclerc autoloader allows a rate of fire of 12 shots per minute and holds 22 rounds of ready ammunition; it can accommodate up to six different types of ammunition at once, although like most autoloader systems it cannot change ammunition types once a round has been loaded. The most common types are the armour piercing fin-stabilised discarding sabot (APFSDS) with a tungsten core and the high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) round. There are 18 other rounds available for reload. A Leclerc tank can fire while traveling at a speed of 50km/h on a target 4,000 metres away. The gun is 52 calibres long instead of the 44 calibres common on most tanks of the Leclerc's generation, giving the rounds a higher muzzle velocity.|$|E

40|$|Copper {{has been}} well known {{for its ability to}} conduct heat and/or {{electricity}} and is equally appreciated in automobile as well as electronic industries. However, at higher temperatures copper suffers from grain growth and hence subsequent decrease in thermal conductivity. Hence, stabilization of the microstructure becomes an important issue especially since copper finds applications in brake pads as heat <b>evacuators.</b> Friction Stir Processing (FSP) is a solid state processing technique which is effective in producing severely deformed microstructures and is capable of mixing/welding/processing nearly any combination of materials. FSP has been adapted to process copper with Yttria particles to obtain nanosized Yttria particles uniformly distributed in copper. Yttria being stable up to 1400 oC, it is expected to anchor the grain boundary migration of the copper at medium to high temperatures. Grain size evolution {{as a function of the}} number of passes is studied with a simulative heat treatment that raises the samples temperature to 200 oC and subsequently quenches it. Thermal conductivity will be correlated to the microstructure...|$|R
40|$|Architects have a {{responsibility}} to understand clearly, and sensibly plan housing units and ultimately the cities so as to achieve a sustainable whole. By so doing, these professionals cannot afford to neglect any aspect of the housing envelope, nor consider it in part or as a whole as un-important. It is for this purpose, that we look at the aspects of harnessing daylight through a variety of systems and methods so as to make best use of this free and in-exhaustible commodity for both visual and thermal comfort. The major question which this thesis attempted to answer was to find a means of improving visual and thermal comfort in our homes {{while at the same time}} reducing our fossil fuel emissions. It was to this end that attention was turned towards the earth‟s major source of energy and to see how best to harness this resource and put it to passive use in the best possible non-intrusive manner. This thesis as a whole, attempted to evaluate existing lighting and thermal devices with an aim to enhancing them as well as suggesting novel devices to replace the existing ones. This thesis reviewed and tested the performance of solar <b>evacuators,</b> optical rods known to have high transmittance, as well as light pipes to see their applicability in residential dwellings in terms of the provision and lighting and heating within the residential buildings. Studies were also done to determine the effect of the combination of two technologies on the same platform i. e. light-pipes combined with light rod, as well as light rods combined with solar <b>evacuators</b> to ascertain and enhance their viability. These tests were carried out in three ways, viz; laboratory tests, outdoor tests as well as field tests on existing real life applications on the singular technology in use as a base-line for assessing the new technologies. Further studies were also carried out with the introduction of nano-technology, i. e. aerogel, so as to test its suitability as an insulator of heat and to examine its economic viability and use in residential buildings. Aerogel was also tested as filler in double-paned glass window to determine its transmittability whilst still maintaining its properties of being a good insulator. Consequently, suggestions were made into the application of the investigated devices, and how best they can be used in new buildings and retro-fitted in existing ones...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{investigated}} householder self-evacuation decision-making during bushfires in the Perth and Adelaide Hills in 2014 and 2015. It {{explored the}} factors that influenced householders&rsquo; decisions to evacuate, identified factors that predict self-evacuation and established the characteristics of self-evacuators. The Protective Action Decision Model (PADM) provided a conceptual framework for the research. Its theoretical and analytical usefulness in an Australian context, was assessed. A mixed methods research strategy was used involving quantitative telephone surveys of 457 bushfire-affected participants and face-to-face interviews of 109 participants in 59 households. The study concluded that environmental and social cues and warnings and householders&rsquo; perceptions of the threat, of hazard adjustments and of other stakeholders, influenced self-evacuation decision-making. Protective action perceptions, particularly the effectiveness of evacuating or not evacuating in protecting personal safety or property, were most important in predicting self-evacuation. Receipt of official warnings {{and the perception of}} likely impact of the bushfire on property were also important predictors. Undertaking long-run hazard adjustments, although not predictive of self-evacuation, was pivotal in shaping perceptions of the effectiveness of evacuating and remaining in protecting personal safety and property and indirectly influenced evacuation decisions. Seven archetypes that characterised householders&rsquo; self-evacuation attitudes and behaviour were identified. These included Threat, and Responsibility Deniers, Dependent, and Considered <b>Evacuators,</b> Community Guided and Experienced Independents all who took different decisional &lsquo;rules of thumb&rsquo; and routes toward evacuating or remaining. The PADM needs to be split into two separate models to incorporate the influence of long-run hazard adjustments on protective action decision-making in an Australian bushfire. The findings suggest that future research on those who wait and see during a bushfire should take account of their decisional rules of thumb and that design and targeting of Australian bushfire safety policy should better account for self-evacuator characteristics...|$|R

50|$|The <b>evacuator</b> is {{a simple}} passive device. It {{consists}} of a ring of holes drilled into the barrel, surrounded by a cylindrical pressure reservoir. As the shell moves down the barrel during firing, it creates a high pressure {{in front of the}} projectile and the <b>evacuator</b> is filled with high pressure air, it reaches a point where the base of the shell passes the set of holes. The high-pressure is then released through these holes. As the shell continues down the barrel the pressure begins to drop, and then suddenly returns to near atmospheric pressure as the shell leaves the barrel. During this process the high-pressure air in the reservoir begins to blow back into the barrel towards the front of the gun tube. By aiming these holes forward, their exhaust causes the pressurized air to be blown forward and out of the barrel extracting fumes from the barrel.|$|E
