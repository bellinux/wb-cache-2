5|$|Fields {{serve as}} {{foundational}} notions in several mathematical domains. This includes different branches of analysis, {{which are based}} on fields with additional structure. Basic theorems in analysis hinge on the structural properties of the field of real numbers. Most importantly for algebraic purposes, any field may be used as the scalars for a vector space, which is the standard <b>general</b> <b>context</b> for linear algebra. Number fields, the siblings of the field of rational numbers, are studied in depth in number theory. Function fields can help describe properties of geometric objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} circumstellar {{habitable}} zone {{was introduced}} in 1953 by Hubertus Strughold and Harlow Shapley and in 1959 by Su-Shu Huang as the region around a star in which an orbiting planet could retain water at its surface. From the 1970s, planetary scientists and astrobiologists began to consider various other factors required for the creation and sustenance of life, including the impact that a nearby supernova may have on life's development. In 1981, Jim Clarke proposed that the apparent lack of extraterrestrial civilizations in the Milky Way {{could be explained by}} Seyfert-type outbursts from an active galactic nucleus, with Earth alone being spared from this radiation by virtue of its location in the galaxy. In the same year, Wallace Hampton Tucker analyzed galactic habitability in a more <b>general</b> <b>context,</b> but later work superseded his proposals.|$|E

Some may be general: , which is one expression of Newton's second law, is applicable {{to a wide range}} of physical situations. Other formulas may be specially created to solve a particular problem; for example, using the equation of a sine curve to model the movement of the tides in a bay. In all cases, however, formulas form the basis for calculations.|$|E
25|$|Any ring {{can be seen}} as a preadditive {{category}} with {{a single}} object. It is therefore natural to consider arbitrary preadditive categories to be generalizations of rings. And indeed, many definitions and theorems originally given for rings can be translated to this more <b>general</b> <b>context.</b> Additive functors between preadditive categories generalize the concept of ring homomorphism, and ideals in additive categories can be defined as sets of morphisms closed under addition and under composition with arbitrary morphisms.|$|E

It then gives a rigorous construction of jets and jet spaces between Euclidean spaces. It concludes with a description of jets between manifolds, and how these jets can be constructed intrinsically. In this more <b>general</b> <b>context,</b> it summarizes some of the applications of jets to differential geometry and the theory of differential equations.|$|E
25|$|Graph minors {{are often}} {{studied in the}} more <b>general</b> <b>context</b> of matroid minors. In this context, {{it is common to}} assume that all graphs are connected, with self-loops and {{multiple}} edges allowed (that is, they are multigraphs rather than simple graphs); the contraction of a loop and the deletion of a cut-edge are forbidden operations. This point of view has the advantage that edge deletions leave the rank of a graph unchanged, and edge contractions always reduce the rank by one.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19th century, the {{increasing}} interest in Egyptian history, culture and art led to a veritable contest between various European nations, all aiming to secure ancient finds of the best possible quality (and quantity) for their national museums. In this <b>general</b> <b>context,</b> the German archaeologist Richard von Kaufmann undertook a short campaign of excavations at Haware in March 1892; his most important find was the so-called Tomb of Aline. A shaft led to a simple mud-brick-lined pit of 2.8 by 3.5 m which contained eight mummies. Three were undecorated, two had paper masks and three were adorned with mummy portraits. The grave had no superstructure.|$|E
25|$|This {{means that}} if a formula is {{deducible}} from the laws of intuitionistic logic, being derived from its axioms {{by way of the}} rule of modus ponens, then it will always have the value 1 in all Heyting algebras under any assignment of values to the formula's variables. However one can construct a Heyting algebra in which the value of Peirce's law is not always 1. Consider the 3-element algebra {0,½,1} as given above. If we assign ½ to P and 0 to Q, then the value of Peirce's law ((P→Q)→P)→P is ½. It follows that Peirce's law cannot be intuitionistically derived. See CurryHoward isomorphism for the <b>general</b> <b>context</b> of what this implies in type theory.|$|E
25|$|In a 2010 {{interview}} with the Los Angeles Times, Mitchell {{was quoted as saying}} that singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, with whom she had worked closely in the past, was a fake and a plagiarist. The controversial remark was widely reported by other media. Mitchell did not explain the contention further, but several media outlets speculated that it may have related to the allegations of plagiarism surrounding some lyrics on Dylan's 2006 album Modern Times. In a 2013 {{interview with}} Jian Ghomeshi, she was asked about the comments and responded by denying that she had made the statement while mentioning the allegations of plagiarism that arose over the lyrics to Dylan's 2001 album Love and Theft in the <b>general</b> <b>context</b> of the flow and ebb of the creative process of artists.|$|E
40|$|Retrieving {{images from}} very large collections, using image content as a key, is {{becoming}} an important problem. Users prefer to ask for pictures using notions of content that are strongly oriented {{to the presence of}} abstractly defined objects. Computer programs that implement these queries automatically are desirable, but are hard to build because conventional object recognition techniques from computer vision cannot recognize very general objects in very <b>general</b> <b>contexts.</b> This paper describes our approach to object recognition, which is structured around a sequence of increasingly specialized grouping activities that assemble coherent regions of image that can be shown to satisfy increasingly stringent constraints. The constraints that are satisfied provide a form of object classification in quite <b>general</b> <b>contexts.</b> This view of recognition is distinguished by: far richer involvement of early visual primitives, including color and texture; hierarchical grouping and learning strategies [...] ...|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} {{different}} calls have been recorded from captive birds, including harsh, harmonic, chatter and whistle vocalisations.

25|$|Developing itself {{later than}} {{witnessed}} {{in the rest}} of Europe, in Portugal it only gained real significance after the second quarter of the 12th century, although previous buildings of the same style already existed. Various factors contribute to this aspect, mainly the unstable environment experienced in the Iberian Peninsula at the time due to the Reconquista and the consequent political reorganisation of peninsular geography. In fact, {{one of the most significant}} aspects of Romanesque architecture in the Peninsula, but particularly in Portugal, is the noticeable connotation that we find between its spreading and land organisation and occupation. The arrival in Portugal of the religious orders mentioned above must be understood in the <b>general</b> <b>context</b> of the Reconquista. In fact, those monastical institutions received immense privileges from the Portuguese monarchs and nobility, contributing to the security of the territory, but above all, to its social organization. This Reconquista took place from North to South, resulting in the same spread of Romanesque architecture with a decreasing density to the South. Almost no Romanesque artifacts survive in Southern Portugal.|$|E
25|$|Russian culture {{grew from}} that of the East Slavs, with their pagan beliefs and {{specific}} way of life in the wooded areas of far Eastern Europe. Early Russian culture was much influenced by neighbouring Finno-Ugric tribes and by the nomadic peoples of the Pontic steppe (mainly of Kipchak and Iranic origin). In the late 1st millennium AD the Varangians (supposedly Scandinavian Vikings), also took part in the forming of Russian identity and the Kievan Rus' state. Orthodox Christian missionaries began arriving from the Eastern Roman Empire in the 9th century, and Kievan Rus' converted to Orthodox Christianity in 988. This largely defined the Russian culture of the next millennium as the synthesis of Slavic and Byzantine cultures. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, Russia remained the largest Orthodox nation in the world and claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy {{in the form of the}} Third Rome idea. At different points in its history, the country was also strongly influenced by the culture of Western Europe. Since the reforms of Peter the Great, for two centuries Russian culture largely developed in the <b>general</b> <b>context</b> of European culture rather than pursuing its own unique ways. The situation changed in the 20th century, when the Communist ideology became a major factor in the culture of the Soviet Union, where Russia, in the form of the Russian SFSR, was the largest and leading part.|$|E

The hymn is sung during a service in preparation for the holy communion, and imagines a bride getting ready for her wedding. An unknown author kept the text of the first, middle and last stanzas (1, 4, and 9), and paraphrased the other stanzas to arias and recitatives: stanzas 2 and 7 to arias; stanzas 3, 5–6 and 8 to recitatives.

500|$|These prefaces {{have proven}} {{atypical}} {{in a couple}} of ways. For one, they do not spell out a specific, step-by-step scenario that the music would follow but rather a <b>general</b> <b>context.</b> Some of them, in fact, are little more than autobiographical asides on what inspired Liszt to compose a piece or what feelings he was trying to inspire through it. While these insights could prove [...] "both useful and interesting" [...] in themselves, Walker admits, will they aid listeners to [...] "pictorialize the music that follows?" [...] For Liszt, Walker concludes, the [...] "pictorialization of a detailed program is simply not an issue." [...] Moreover, Liszt wrote these prefaces long after he had composed the music. This was the complete opposite of other composers, who wrote their music to fit a pre-existing program. For both these reasons, Walker suggests, Liszt's prefaces could be called [...] "programmes about music" [...] with equal logic or validity. He adds that the prefaces might not have entirely been of Liszt's idea or doing, since evidence exists that his then-companion Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein helped shape or create them.|$|E
