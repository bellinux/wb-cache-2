5|$|Minerals in {{the acid}} mine {{drainage}} {{areas of the}} Mahanoy Creek watershed include <b>goethite,</b> ferrihydrite, schwertmannite, amorphous aluminum-hydroxysulfates, quartz, muscovite, kaolinite, and gypsum. Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in {{a substantial part of}} the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are interbedded sedimentary rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
5|$|Once in the environment, {{neptunium}} generally oxidizes fairly quickly, {{usually to}} the +4 or +5 state. Regardless of its oxidation state, the element exhibits {{a much greater}} mobility than the other actinides, largely due to its ability to readily form aqueous solutions with various other elements. In one study comparing the diffusion rates of neptunium(V), plutonium(IV), and americium(III) in sandstone and limestone, neptunium penetrated more than ten times {{as well as the}} other elements. Np(V) will also react efficiently in pH levels greater than 5.5 if there are no carbonates present and in these conditions it has also been observed to readily bond with quartz. It has also been observed to bond well with <b>goethite,</b> ferric oxide colloids, and several clays including kaolinite and smectite. Np(V) does not bond as readily to soil particles in mildly acidic conditions as its fellow actinides americium and curium by nearly an order of magnitude. This behavior enables it to migrate rapidly through the soil while in solution without becoming fixed in place, contributing further to its mobility. Np(V) is also readily absorbed by concrete, which because of the element's radioactivity is a consideration that must be addressed when building nuclear waste storage facilities. When absorbed in concrete, it is reduced to Np(IV) in a relatively short period of time. Np(V) is also reduced by humic acid if it is present on the surface of <b>goethite,</b> hematite, and magnetite. Np(IV) is absorbed efficiently by tuff, granodiorite, and bentonite; although uptake by the latter is most pronounced in mildly acidic conditions. It also exhibits a strong tendency to bind to colloidal particulates, an effect that is enhanced when in soil with a high clay content. The behavior provides an additional aid in the element's observed high mobility.|$|E
25|$|Nickel {{mineralisation}} in the regolith, in {{the upper}} saprolite typically exists as <b>goethite,</b> hematite, limonite and {{is often associated with}} polydymite and violarite, nickel sulfides which are of supergene association. Within the lower saprolite, violarite is transitional with unaltered pentlandite-pyrite-pyrrhotite ore.|$|E
25|$|Clay-sized {{hematite}} crystals {{can also}} {{occur as a}} secondary mineral formed by weathering processes in soil, and along with other iron oxides or oxyhydroxides such as <b>goethite,</b> {{is responsible for the}} red color of many tropical, ancient, or otherwise highly weathered soils.|$|E
25|$|Minerals {{produced}} through {{hydrothermal alteration}} and weathering of primary basaltic minerals are also present on Mars. Secondary minerals include hematite, phyllosilicates (clay minerals), <b>goethite,</b> jarosite, iron sulfate minerals, opaline silica, and gypsum. Many of these secondary minerals require liquid water to form (aqueous minerals).|$|E
25|$|They are {{commonly}} {{composed of a}} carbonate mineral such as calcite; an amorphous or microcrystalline form of silica such as chert, flint, or jasper; or an iron oxide or hydroxide such as <b>goethite</b> and hematite. They can also be composed of other minerals that include dolomite, ankerite, siderite, pyrite, marcasite, barite and gypsum.|$|E
25|$|Much of the Martian {{surface is}} deeply covered by dust {{as fine as}} talcum powder. The global {{predominance}} of dust obscures the underlying bedrock, making spectroscopic identification of primary minerals impossible from orbit over {{many areas of the}} planet. The red/orange appearance of the dust is caused by iron(III) oxide (nanophase Fe2O3) and the iron(III) oxide-hydroxide mineral <b>goethite.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gossans {{of nickel}} mineralisation, {{especially}} massive sulfides, are dominated in the arid Yilgarn Craton by boxworks of <b>goethite,</b> hematite, maghemite and ocher clays. Non-sulfide nickel minerals are typically soluble, and preserved rarely at surface as carbonates, although often can be preserved as nickel arsenates (nickeline) within gossans. Within subtropical and Arctic regions, {{it is unlikely}} gossans would be preserved or, if they are, would not contain carbonate minerals.|$|E
25|$|In summary, Spirit found {{evidence}} of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals <b>goethite</b> and carbonates that only form {{in the presence of}} water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component that was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of water-formed minerals on Mars including hematite and jarosite, by the Opportunity rover and <b>goethite</b> by the Spirit rover, {{has led to}} the conclusion that climatic conditions in the distant past allowed for free-flowing water on Mars. The morphology of some crater impacts on Mars indicate that the ground was wet at the time of impact. Geomorphic observations of both landscape erosion rates and Martian valley networks also strongly imply warmer, wetter conditions on Noachian-era Mars (earlier than about 4 billion years ago). However, chemical analysis of Martian meteorite samples suggests that the ambient near-surface temperature of Mars has most likely been below 0°C for the last four billion years.|$|E
25|$|After 1000 CE Angkorian {{construction}} {{changed from}} circular or irregular earthen walls to rectangular temple enclosures of laterite, brick and stone structures. Geographic surveys show areas which have laterite stone alignments {{which may be}} foundations of temple sites that have not survived. The Khmer people constructed the Angkor monuments—which are widely distributed in Cambodia and Thailand—between the 9th and 13th centuries. The stone materials used were sandstone and laterite; brick {{had been used in}} monuments constructed in the 9th and 10th centuries. Two types of laterite can be identified; both types consist of the minerals kaolinite, quartz, hematite and <b>goethite.</b> Differences in the amounts of minor elements arsenic, antimony, vanadium and strontium were measured between the two laterites.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, a {{skeleton}} of this genus (specimen NCSM 15728) informally known as [...] "Willo", now {{on display at}} the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, was described as including the remnants of a four-chambered heart and an aorta. It had been originally unearthed in 1993 in northwestern South Dakota. The authors had found the internal detail through computed tomography (CT) imagery. They suggested that the heart had been saponified (turned to grave wax) under [...] burial conditions, and then changed to <b>goethite,</b> an iron mineral, by replacement of the original material. The authors interpreted the structure of the heart as indicating an elevated metabolic rate for Thescelosaurus, not reptilian cold-bloodedness.|$|E
500|$|The main {{rocks of}} the volcano are {{andesite}} and dacite, which contain biotite and pyroxene as well as blebs containing iron oxide. The iron-containing rocks are a less important component. [...] The whole rock falls into the calc-alkaline class of volcanic rocks. The andesites contain plagioclase clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and phenocrysts of magnetite. Magnetite, and in lesser measure hematite, are the most abundant iron minerals; anhydrite, diopside, <b>goethite,</b> limonite, maghemite, pyrite, and diadochite are also found. Erupted magma was probably gas-rich, as the magnetite lavas would otherwise have melting points of over [...] The lavas lost most of their sulfur and phosphorus after their eruption. High oxygen-18 amounts in the Laco magmas indicate either crustal contamination or isotopic effects during fractional crystallization. Some atmospheric water influence has been inferred from isotope data as well.|$|E
500|$|Further {{evidence}} that liquid water once existed {{on the surface}} of Mars comes from the detection of specific minerals such as hematite and <b>goethite,</b> both of which sometimes form in the presence of water. In 2004, Opportunity detected the mineral jarosite. This forms only in the presence of acidic water, which demonstrates that water once existed on Mars. More recent evidence for liquid water comes from the finding of the mineral gypsum on the surface by NASA's Mars rover Opportunity in December 2011. It is believed that the amount of water in the upper mantle of Mars, represented by hydroxyl ions contained within the minerals of Mars's geology, is equal to or greater than that of Earth at 50–300 parts per million of water, which is enough to cover the entire planet to a depth of [...]|$|E

From these methods, the authors found the following: the object's internal structure does not include chambers but is made up of three unconnected areas of lower density material, and is not comparable to the structure of an ostrich's heart; the [...] "walls" [...] are composed of sedimentary minerals not known to be produced in biological systems, such as <b>goethite,</b> feldspar minerals, quartz, and gypsum, as well as some plant fragments; carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, chemical elements important to life, were lacking in their samples; and cardiac cellular structures were absent. There was one possible patch with animal cellular structures. The authors found their data supported identification as a concretion of sand from the burial environment, not the heart, with the possibility that isolated areas of tissues were preserved.|$|E
2500|$|The Clovis {{group is}} {{especially}} interesting because the Mossbauer spectrometer (MB) detected <b>goethite</b> in it. <b>Goethite</b> forms {{only in the}} presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks.

These sites all contain fluvial landforms indicating that abundant water was once present. [...] Spirit rover discovered sulfates and <b>goethite</b> in the Columbia Hills.|$|E

Percolating waters caused degradation of the parent basalt and preferential precipitation by acidic water through the lattice left the iron and aluminium ores. Primary olivine, plagioclase feldspar and augite were successively broken down and replaced by a mineral assemblage consisting of hematite, gibbsite, <b>goethite,</b> anatase, halloysite and kaolinite.|$|E

2500|$|Between Bonao and Maimon, Falconbridge Dominicana {{has been}} mining nickel laterites since 1971. [...] The Cerro de Maimon copper/gold open-pit mine {{southeast}} of Maimon has been operated by Perilya since 2006.

2500|$|The Mahnomen Formation {{has a lower}} member, which lacks {{iron oxide}} components, and an upper member {{dominated}} by beds of iron oxide argillite and lean iron-formation interlayered with non-iron oxide argillite, siltstone and quartzose sandstone.

50|$|Goethite-like {{structures}} are common because <b>goethite</b> {{is in the}} same space group as olivine. This allows for <b>goethite</b> to grow within the olivine making the close packed planes common for both structures. Goethite-like structures have cell dimensions a=4.6, b= 10.0 and c = 3.0 Å. Diffraction spots caused by <b>goethite</b> are diffuse even though the material is well oriented. These {{structures are}} aligned parallel to the original olivine with a-axis (<b>goethite)</b> parallel to a-axis (olivine), b-axis (<b>goethite)</b> parallel to b-axis (olivine) and c-axis (<b>goethite)</b> parallel to c-axis (olivine). The preferred orientation of olivine and <b>goethite</b> are when they are parallel with their z-axis.|$|E
50|$|The most {{prominent}} metal by percent composition is iron {{in the form}} of <b>goethite.</b> <b>Goethite</b> has the chemical formula of FeO(OH) and belongs to a group known as oxy-hydroxides. There exists amorphous silica between the <b>goethite</b> crystals; surrounding the <b>goethite</b> is a matrix of chitin. Chitin has a chemical formula of C8H13O5N. Other metals {{have been shown to be}} present with the relative percent compositions varying on geographic locations. The <b>goethite</b> has been reported to have a volume fraction of approximately 80%.|$|E
50|$|<b>Goethite</b> often forms {{through the}} {{weathering}} of other iron-rich minerals, {{and thus is}} a common component of soils, concentrated in laterite soils. The formation of <b>goethite</b> is marked by the oxidation state change of Fe2+ (ferrous) to Fe3+ (ferric), which allows for <b>goethite</b> to exist at surface conditions. Because of this oxidation state change, <b>goethite</b> is commonly seen as a pseudomorph. As iron-bearing minerals are brought to the zone of oxidation within the soil, the iron turns from iron(II) to iron(III), while the original shape of the parent mineral is retained. Examples of common <b>goethite</b> pseudomorphs are: goethites after pyrite, <b>goethite,</b> siderite, and marcasite, though any iron(II)-bearing mineral could become a <b>goethite</b> pseudomorph if proper conditions are met. It may also be precipitated by groundwater or in other sedimentary conditions, or form as a primary mineral in hydrothermal deposits. <b>Goethite</b> has also {{been found to be}} produced by the excretion processes of certain bacteria types.|$|E
50|$|Continued {{oxidation}} of polydymite {{leads to}} replacement by <b>goethite</b> and {{formation of a}} gossanous boxwork, with nickel tending to remain as impurities within the <b>goethite</b> or hematite, or rarely as carbonate minerals.|$|E
50|$|Limonite type laterites (or oxide type) {{are highly}} enriched in iron due to very strong {{leaching}} of magnesium and silica. They consist largely of <b>goethite</b> and contain 1-2% nickel incorporated in <b>goethite.</b> Absence of the limonite {{zone in the}} ore deposits is due to erosion.|$|E
50|$|Channel iron {{deposits}} {{are formed}} by accumulation of massive deposits {{of what is}} generally referred to as “pisolite iron gravels”, which are ooids and pisoids of <b>goethite.</b> CIDs were initially considered to be analogous to accumulations of pisolite gravels within palaeochannels via sedimentary means. Modern evidence points to an in-situ formation of the classic pisoilitic textures. <b>Goethite</b> ooids and pisoids show evidence of being formed by concretion of layers of <b>goethite</b> (cortex) around a core fragment (nucleus) which is typically ferruginised wood fragments, but may be quartz grains, hematite grains or other detrital material. It is considered that the mechanism for enrichment and formation of the <b>goethite</b> cortex is related to near-surface alteration of an existing highly ferruginous material by groundwater action. Ferruginised wood is ubiquitous and {{a major component of}} CIDs, existing as porous, friable limonite. Fossilised wood fragments are present but are usually extremely rare and of very small size (<50 mm). The <b>goethite</b> pisolites are cemented via a variety of agents, usually a mixture of <b>goethite,</b> clays, carbonate minerals (magnesite, calcite and sometimes siderite), and occasionally silica. This process may form an in-situ concretion of pisolites which may be very resistant to erosion - some mesas in the Pilbara, and Yilgarn are in fact old cemented ferruginous pisolite river gravels.|$|E
50|$|Iron {{compounds}} are {{the primary}} coloring agents in saprolites. At most outcrops the color comes from ferric compounds; the color relates to the mineralogy and particle size. Submicron-sized <b>goethite</b> FeO(OH) is yellow; coarse <b>goethite</b> is brown. Submicron-sized hematite Fe2O3 is red; coarse hematite is gray to black.|$|E
50|$|The {{first factor}} is the {{nanometer}} length scale of <b>goethite</b> nanofibers in limpet teeth; at this length scale, materials become insensitive to preexisting flaws that would otherwise decrease failure strength.
