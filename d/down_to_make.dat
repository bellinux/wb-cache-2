Boon has said that some of {{the characters}}' abilities, especially those from the DC Universe, had been toned <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them balanced within Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe. For example, Boon specifically mentioned that Superman became vulnerable because of magic.

5|$|Opened in 1967, Wayzata Bay Center was {{constructed}} in two phases; the first phase was completed in 1964 while the second phase was completed in 1967. The mall initially featured several regional retailers, along with small businesses, but eventually made way for various national chains, including The Original Pancake House and True Value. After increasing vacancies throughout the center in the 2000s, a Minnesota construction firm purchased the center from United Properties for $16 million in 2009.

5|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans were was a massive trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; in turn, the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> room for the 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.|$|E
5|$|After the Norman {{conquest of}} England, William the Conqueror {{established}} a motte-and-bailey castle at Warwick in 1068 {{to maintain control}} of the Midlands as he advanced northwards. Building a castle in a pre-existing settlement could require demolishing properties on the intended site. In the case of Warwick, the least recorded of the 11urban castles in the 1086 survey, four houses were torn <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> way for the castle. A motte-and-bailey castle consists of a mound– on which usually stands a keep or tower– and a bailey, which is an enclosed courtyard. William appointed Henry de Beaumont, {{the son of a}} powerful Norman family, as constable of the castle. In 1088, Henry de Beaumont was made the first Earl of Warwick. He founded the Church of All Saints within the castle walls by 1119; the Bishop of Worcester, believing that a castle was an inappropriate location for a church, removed it in 1127–28.|$|E

5|$|Framlingham Castle {{was given}} to Pembroke College as a philanthropic gesture in 1636, after which the {{internal}} buildings were taken <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> way {{for the construction of}} a poorhouse within the site. The castle was used in this way until 1839 when the facility was closed; the castle was then used as a drill hall and as a county court. In 1913, Pembroke College placed Framlingham into the guardianship of the Commissioner of Works. During the Second World War, Framlingham Castle was used by the British military as part of the regional defences against a potential German invasion. Today, Framlingham Castle is managed by English Heritage and run as a tourist attraction. It is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building and a scheduled monument.|$|E
