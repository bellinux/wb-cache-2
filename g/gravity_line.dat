After substantial opposition to the concept, this was accomplished the following year with the incorporation of the Black Heath Colliery. In 1827, Beverley Randolph had also {{been one of the}} organizers of the Chesterfield Railroad, a 12-mile <b>gravity</b> <b>line</b> built from Falling Creek to Manchester for the purpose of transporting coal to ships in the navigable portion of the James River for export.

5000|$|Ozawa station - A 762mm (2'6") gauge horse-drawn tramway {{opened to}} the port at Iwanai in 1905. In 1912 it was {{replaced}} by a 1067mm (3'6") gauge line, which closed in 1985. Near Iwanai the first tramway in Hokkaido, and possibly Japan, opened in 1869 as a 2.8 km <b>gravity</b> <b>line</b> linking a coal mine to the port of Kayanuma. It used timber rails and a ~1050mm gauge, with brakemen riding the loaded wagons, and horses and cattle hauling the empty wagon back to the mine. In 1881 the line was rebuilt to 762mm gauge with iron rails, and steam locomotives were introduced in 1927. In 1931 the tramway {{was replaced by a}} 10 km cableway linking the mine to Iwanai port, which in 1946 was replaced by a 6.3 km 1067mm gauge line. A bridge on the new line collapsed during a typhoon in 1962, and the line was closed, with the coal mine closing two years later.|$|E
40|$|Gravity, it {{eventually}} gets us all. The challenge for our bodies {{is to maintain}} stability and move efficiently {{against the forces of}} gravity. Disease, injury, environment, emotions, body type, kinesthetic sense and repetitive activities can lead to adverse movement patterns and further dysfunction. Identifying abnormal movement patterns and understanding the interplay between gravity, buoyancy and our bodies is essential for the aquatic therapist. Ideal alignment especially the curves of the spine are important in withstanding the forces of gravity. For a weight bearing joint to be stable the <b>gravity</b> <b>line</b> must fall through the joint’s axis of rotation. For example: in standing the <b>gravity</b> <b>line</b> should fall just anterior to the knee and posterior to the patella this allows the knee to remain straight and the person upright without excessive forces at the joint or excessive effort from the quadriceps. If the <b>gravity</b> <b>line</b> falls anterior to the patella the forces of gravity tend to push the knee into hyperextension causing increased stress to the soft tissue of the posterior knee. This position causes the ACL to be on slack and over time leads to weakness of the ligament and possibly increasing risk of ACL injury in young women who tend to have this alignment. The first step in postural assessment is evaluation of where the <b>gravity</b> <b>line</b> falls at each joint. Posture is often described based on static position, forward head, military style, sway back, kyphosis-lordosi...|$|E

An en echelon lineament follows North Scappoose Creek, Alder Creek, and the Clatskanie River along the same trend, through Columbia County, Oregon. The possibility that this lineament follows a fault or fault zone was investigated in this study. Geophysical methods were used, with seismic refraction, magnetic and <b>gravity</b> <b>lines</b> run perpendicular to the lineament. The seismic refraction models indicate the near surface basalt is broken in many places, with 15 - 30 meters (50 - 100 feet) vertical displacement, down to the west, at Bunker Hill along the Alder Creek fault.
