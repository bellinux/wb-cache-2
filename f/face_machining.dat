Brittle materials have natural tendency for edge chipping what leads to beveling the sharp edges. Not beveled sharp edges on glass capillary are important for special applications like surface tension measurement of small liquid samples. We use common {{grinding and polishing process}} for capillary end <b>face</b> <b>machining</b> modified with gradual decreasing of grinding load based on the relation of the critical chipping load. Achieved surface roughness is measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Capillary inner edge quality is checked both with optical microscopes and electron microscope too.

40|$|Abstract. Serials of {{ultrasonic}} <b>face</b> <b>machining</b> {{experiments were}} designed {{and carried out}} on glass materials with free abrasives. Two different kinds of ultrasonic machining, namely, non-rotary ultrasonic machining (NRUSM) with free abrasives and rotary ultrasonic machining (RUSM) with free abrasives were compared. Two systems were set up to in-process monitor the changes of static forces and frequency respectively. The effects of static force, spindle speed and amplitude of ultrasonic vibration on material removal rate (MRR) and surface roughness were analyzed. The surface of workpieces was also observed by a digital video microscope system. The experimental results indicated that, at the given conditions, there exists an optimal value of static force and amplitude of vibration to obtain the maximum MRR, and RUSM {{was found to be}} superior to NRUSM in the MRR, but inversely in surface roughness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Ultrasonic {{machining}} {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} promising machining method on hard and brittle materials. However, due to the absence of high power ultrasonic machine tools, reported studies on ultrasonic machining were mainly concerned of relatively small hole drilling of the given materials. In the present work, with the development of the higher power Rotary Ultrasonic Machine Tool, two kinds of ultrasonic <b>face</b> <b>machining</b> with free abrasives, namely, Non-rotating Ultrasonic Machining with Free Abrasives (NRUSM) and Rotary Ultrasonic Machining with Free Abrasives (RUSM) are designed and comparatively conducted for the red granite, which is a typical hard-to-machine natural material. The effects of static force, spindle speed and amplitude of ultrasonic vibration on the performance of the machining are evaluated in terms of the material removal rate and surface quality. Experimental results indicate that ultrasonic machining is effective for face milling of the stone material with the designed machine tool. Furthermore, machining performances in RUSM are superior to those in NRUSM...|$|E
40|$|Embossing by {{patterned}} rollers {{is one of}} {{the most}} efficient machining approaches for manufacturing plastic films with patterned microstructures, and the precision roller with patterned microstructures is the key tooling component in the roll-to-roll process. Single-point diamond turning with a slow or fast tool servo is an enabling and efficient ultra-precision machining process to fabricate microstructures through a simple process to achieve optical surface finish directly. Most of the current studies on slow or fast tool servo machining processes either focus on <b>face</b> <b>machining</b> of patterned microstructures, or on tool servo machining of microstructures in the radial direction of precision rollers. Relatively little research work is found in relation to machining patterned microstructures on a precision roller by using the tool servo in the axial direction. This paper presents a pilot study on the development of a tool path generator for machining precision rollers with wavy patterned microstructures by using slow tool servo machining in the axial direction on a precision roller. The machining mechanism is firstly explained, based on which the tool path generator is developed for machining wavy patterned microstructures on a precision roller surface. Preliminary experimental work was conducted to study the generation of wavy patterned microstructures on a precision roller using a four-axis ultra-precision machine. The machined wavy microstructures on the roller surface are measured and analyzed to successfully validate the performance of the proposed tool path generator.

These films are widely used in optical applications such as the backlight guide and brightness enhancement films in LCD and LED displays. Compared with other fabrication processes, such as lithography, Single-Point Diamond Turning (SPDT), using a Fast Tool Servo (FTS) or Slow Tool Servo (STS) process, is an enabling and efficient machining method to fabricate microstructures. Most studies of the tool servo machining process focus on either machining microstructures in the axial direction for <b>face</b> <b>machining</b> of flat parts or in the radial direction {{on the surface}} of a precision roller. There is relatively little research work found on the machining of patterned microstructures {{on the surface of}} precision rollers using the tool servo in the axial direction.

The machining concept of OSTS is first explained, and then the tool path generator is developed in detail for machining wavy microstructure patterns on a roller surface. Modelling and simulation of pattern generation for different microstructures with different wavy patterns and grooves are presented based on the proposed tool path generator. Preliminary experimental work using SPDT on a 4 -axis ultra-precision machine tool is presented and clearly shows the generation of unique wavy microstructure patterns on a precision roller.

40|$|Abstract: The {{comparisons}} of performance characteristics between the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> using variable air pressure developed in this laboratory to grind precisely the sliding {{face of a}} surface hardened workpiece with thermal spray and the conventional one are investigated by measuring the surface roughness and hardness for a SCM 440. To process variously workpiece according to shape, size and materials, the rotating and contacting forces of the developed grinding machine can be changed by air pressure. The surface roughness of processed workpiece can be also attained to state of mirror face by grinding precisely the sliding face with changing the rotating speed of diamond wheel. It is possible to {{be attached to the}} various machine tools because the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> using variable air pressure is a small size. The grinding efficiency is elevated because it can be worked by two or more grinding machines attached to concurrently a machine tool for the large workpiece. In this study, results show that the cusp height of the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> for the particle size of 100 and 1500 No. /mm 2 is lower than that of the conventional one because the vibration is reduced by rotating very fast the diamond wheel with a pressed air and it can be processed by rotating the diamond wheel with a constantly varied air pressure perpendicular to workpiece surface, and that the workpiece in the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machine</b> for the particle size of 3000 No. /mm 2 can be processed to state of mirror face that is rarely seen by the cusp height. It is also found that the surface hardness of both the conventional and the super-mirror <b>face</b> grinding <b>machines</b> are increased as the particle size of diamond wheel is reduced...|$|R

Moreover, when we switch the tuning function from BLEU to the LRscore which promotes reordering, we observe total improvements of 1. 21 BLEU, 1. 30 LRscore and 3. 36 TER over the baseline. On aver-age our approach improves reordering preci-sion and recall by 6. 9 and 0. 3 absolute points, respectively, and is found to be especially ef-fective for long-distance reodering. ...|$|R
