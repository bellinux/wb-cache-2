40|$|Traditionally globe {{artichoke}} and leafy cardoon have been cultivated {{for use as}} vegetables but these crops are now finding multiple new roles in applications ranging from paper production to cheese preparation and biofuel use, with interest in their functional food potential. So far, their chromosome complements have been poorly investigated and a well-defined karyotype was not available. In this paper, a detailed karyo-morphological analysis and molecular cytogenetic studies were conducted on {{globe artichoke}} (Cynara cardunculus Linnaeus, 1753 var. scolymus Fiori, 1904) and leafy cardoon (C. cardunculus Linneaus, 1753 var. altilis De Candolle, 1838). Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization In Suspension (FISHIS) was applied to nuclei suspensions as a fast method for screening of labelling probes, before metaphase spread hybridization. Classic Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) on slide, using repetitive telomeric and ribosomal sequences and Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) oligonucleotide as probes, identified homologous chromosome relationships and allowed development of molecular karyotypes for both varieties. The close phylogenetic relationship between <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardoon</b> {{was supported by the}} very similar karyotypes but clear chromosomal structural variation was detected. In the light of the recent release of the globe artichoke genome sequencing, these results are relevant for future anchoring of the pseudomolecule sequence assemblies to specific chromosomes. In addition, the DNA content of the two crops has been determined by flow cytometry and a fast method for standard FISH on slide and methodological improvements for nuclei isolation are described...|$|E

In Central Italian environments, the Romanesco type is widespread. In the last years, the development of in vitro technologies allowed the propagation of Romanesco globe artichoke type and its rapid expansion. As a result, the micropropagated Romanesco clone C 3 has replaced many landraces traditionally grown in the Latium Region and has led either to a significant erosion of local genetic resources.

For the wild cardoon, no specialized crop is present and it represents mainly a weed in Italian environments. The great variability existing in Cynara spp. has not been described, the nomenclature of Italian germplasm is not always very clear since there are many cases of homonyms. In addition, Italian globe artichoke sector is facing a crisis due principally to the appearance on the market of foreign products and to the high labor cost required for crop cultivation and harvesting. In order to overcome this crisis several possible industrial uses were considered for the species. Considering these preliminary remarks, a strategy for valorizing Italian germplasm using biomass and biocompound production has been carried out during the three years of PhD program. The first objective of PhD work consisted in (i) characterizing agro-morphologically Italian germplasm using UPOV descriptors, (ii) assessing the genetic variability existing within and among landraces/clones and (iii) identifying and preserving genetic resources for the development of future plant breeding programs.

The aerial biomass yield resulted very high underlining the possibility of using this crop as raw industrial material. A focal point of PhD program was to set up biocompound extraction methods and analysis techniques to optimize polyphenol recovery from biomass of Cynara spp at a laboratory scale.

Italy is the richest reserve of globe artichoke (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.) autochthonous germplasm, which is vegetatively propagated and well adapted to the different pedoclimatic conditions of the Country. On the basis of head harvest time, these traditionally grown genetic resources are classified as early or late distinct clonal varietal groups. Other distinct varietal groups are also identified, according to the morphological traits of the head, into four main typologies such as Violetto di Sicilia, Spinoso Sardo, Catanese and Romanesco. In Central Italian environments, the Romanesco type, characterized by a spherical or sub-spherical and non-spiny green-violet heads, is widespread. In the last years, the development of in vitro technologies allowed the propagation of Romanesco globe artichoke type and its rapid expansion. As a result, the Romanesco clone C 3 has been in vitro micropropagated and widely distributed to the farmers. This clone has replaced many Romanesco landraces traditionally grown in the Latium Region and has led either to a significant erosion of local genetic resources or a loss of diversity. Moreover, introduction of new seed-propagated F 1 hybrids such as Madrigal, Concerto, Opal, Tema, and Romolo, well suited to market demands, represents a further factor increasing the risk of genetic erosion for autochthonous germplasm. As regards Italian cultivated cardoon (Cynara cardunculus var. altilis DC) germplasm, there are few studies on its genetic characterization and identification {{and there is a}} lack of information about the genetic variability existing within and among accessions. For the wild cardoon (Cynara cardunculus var. sylvestris Lam.), no specialized crop is present and it represents mainly a weed in Italian environments. The great variability existing in Cynara spp. has not been described, the nomenclature of Italian germplasm is not always very clear since there are many cases of homonyms. In addition to this risk of genetic erosion, in the last years, Italian globe artichoke sector is facing a crisis due principally to the appearance on the market of foreign products and to the high labor cost required for crop cultivation and harvesting. In order to overcome this crisis several possible uses of Cynara spp. were considered such as i) seeds for oil, ii) roots for inulin, iii) biomass for energy, iv) fiber for pulp and paper and as potential reinforcement in polymer composites v) green forage for ruminant feeding, vi) proteins as natural rennet for traditional cheese making, and vii) entire plant for metalaccumulation. These new possible applications of the crop are linked principally to the European Union research support on new agricultural by-products (industrial raw materials) and led to an increasing interest also in aboveground globe artichoke biomass. Considering these preliminary remarks, a strategy for valorizing Italian germplasm using biomass and biocompound production has been carried out during the three years of PhD program. In particular, nine Italian spring landraces (Ascolano, Campagnano, Castellammare, Jesino, Montelupone A, Montelupone B, Bianco di Pertosa, Pisa and Tondo Rosso di Paestum), ten ‘Romanesco’ clones (S 2, S 3, S 5, S 11, S 17, S 18, S 22,S 23, Grato 1 and Campagnano), seven cultivated cardoon accessions (AFB, AFFG, AFGR, AFGI, AFM, AFM 2, AFN) and AFS wild cardoon {{belonging to}} the joint germplasm collection of Tuscia University and ENEA have been considered in our PhD study. Open field trials were conducted at the Experimental Field Station of ARSIAL (Latium Regional Agency for the Development and the Innovation of Agriculture) in Cerveteri, Rome and in Tarquinia, Viterbo while greenhouse experiments were carried out at the Experimental Station of Tuscia University in Viterbo (Italy). The first objective of PhD work consisted in (i) characterizing agro-morphologically Italian germplasm using UPOV descriptors, (ii) assessing the genetic variability existing within and among landraces/clones and (iii) identifying and preserving genetic resources for the development of future plant breeding programs. As a result of this characterization, three genotypes have been selected and registered under the names of Michelangelo, Donatello and Raffaello. In order to analyze Italian Cynara spp. germplasm also from a biomass point of view, different traits explaining plant vigor and dry matter production have been considered. The aerial biomass yield resulted very high underlining the possibility of using this crop as raw industrial material. In particular, some genotypes, such as Ascolano, Campagnano, Pisa, Bianco di Pertosa for globe artichoke and AFFG and AFM for cardoon showed the highest biomass yield. A focal point of PhD program was to set up biocompound extraction methods and analysis techniques to optimize polyphenol recovery from biomass of Cynara spp at a laboratory scale. In particular, conventional (i. e. Soxhlet and maceration) and modern extraction techniques (such as Microwave-Assisted Extraction MAE, and Accelerated Solvent Extraction ASE) have been compared and, using a full two-level factorial experimental design, ASE was found as the best extraction technique which allows to reduce extraction time and solvent consumption, increase nutraceutical yield and improvement of extract quality. Moreover, the kinetics of biomass and biocompound production has been evaluated and the optimal physiological stage to collect plant material grown in open field has been identified. Biochemical characterization has been performed using the methods set up and collecting plant material in the optimal physiological stage identified in order to distinguish which genotypes were more suitable for bio-compound production purpose. As a result of morphological and biochemical characterization, genotypes were well distinguished from each other and were identified those which are the most suitable for food use, for biomass production and/or for dual-production (food and non-food). The last focal point of PhD program was the development of an alternative technique for biomass and biocompound production in greenhouse grown conditions. The adaptation of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardoon</b> genotypes to floating system has been evaluated and the biochemical and molecular responses of the plant to the salinity stress have been also investigated. Results obtained in the three PhD years, highlighted the possibility of using successfully some Cynara spp. genotypes for biomass and bio-compound production, in particular in open field condition. Also the real prospect of using some globe artichoke genotypes for food and non-food dual-production (biomass for biocompound extraction and heads for human food) has been underlined. Il carciofo e il cardo, appartenenti alla famiglia delle Asteraceae (Compositae), sono delle piante erbacee, perenni, originarie del bacino del Mediterraneo e tradizionalmente coltivate a scopo alimentare rispettivamente per i capolini e le foglie carnose. L’Italia rappresenta una delle più ricche riserve di germoplasma autoctono di carciofo (Cynara cardunculus var. scolymus L.), il quale è propagato vegetativamente e ben adattato alle differenti condizioni pedoclimatiche del nostro Paese. Sulla base dell’epoca di maturazione commerciale dei capolini, i genotipi di carciofo vengono classificati in tipologie precoci e autunnali. Un altro criterio di classificazione, basato sulle caratteristiche morfologiche dei capolini, suddivide i suddetti genotipi in quattro gruppi varietali: ‘Violetto di Sicilia’, dello ‘Spinoso Sardo’, del ‘Catanese’ e del ‘Romanesco’. La tipologia ‘Romanesco’, caratterizzata da capolini inermi di forma rotonda o ellittica e di colore verde-viola, è molto diffusa negli ambienti di coltivazione cinaricola dell’Italia centrale. Negli ultimi anni, la messa a punto della tecnica di propagazione in vitro per il carciofo, ha portato ad una rapida diffusione di cloni della tipologia ‘Romanesco’. In particolare, il clone C 3 propagato in vitro ha conosciuto una grande diffusione nelle aree di coltivazione cinaricola, sostituendo molte varietà afferenti alla tipologia ‘Romanesco’ tradizionalmente coltivate nel Lazio e determinando rischi di erosione genetica per queste risorse genetiche. Inoltre, l’introduzione sul mercato di nuovi ibridi F 1 come Madrigal, Concerto, Opal, Tema, and Romolo, meglio rispondenti alle richieste dei consumatori, rappresenta un ulteriore fattore di rischio per la perdita del germoplasma autoctono. Per quanto riguarda il cardo coltivato (Cynara cardunculus var. altilis DC), esistono pochi studi sulla caratterizzazione genetica e sull’identificazione del germoplasma autoctono e mancano dati riguardanti la variabilità genetica esistente tra ed entro accessioni diverse. Per il cardo selvatico (Cynara cardunculus var. sylvestris Lam.), non sono presenti coltivazioni specializzate ed esso rappresenta un’infestante negli ambienti di coltivazione cinaricola italiani. L’ampia variabilità esistente nel germoplasma di Cynara spp. non è stata descritta; la nomenclatura delle risorse genetiche non è spesso chiara e spesso si trovano casi di omonimia. Oltre a questo rischio di erosione genetica, negli ultimi anni assistiamo anche ad una forte crisi del settore cinaricolo dovuta alla comparsa sul mercato di prodotti stranieri e all’alto costo di produzione e di raccolta previsti dalla coltura. Negli ultimi decenni, per far fronte a questa crisi, sono stati considerati diversi possibili usi per la specie quali, ad esempio, i) la produzione di olio dai semi; ii) l’estrazione di inulina dalle radici; iii) la produzione di energia dalla biomassa; iv) l’estrazione della fibra per l’industria cartaria; v) la produzione di foraggio da destinare all’alimentazione animale; vi) la produzione di formaggi come caglio vegetale mediante impiego di estratti fiorali; vii) l’accumulo di metalli pesanti nella pianta. Lo studio di questi nuovi possibili utilizzi è stato reso possibile grazie ai finanziamenti della Comunità Europea che ha incentivato e supportato la ricerca nel settore delle agrorisorse e ha portato anche ad un forte interesse nell’uso della biomassa di carciofo. Nel corso dei tre anni di dottorato è stata portata avanti una strategia di ricerca volta alla valorizzazione del germoplasma italiano di carciofo e cardo basata sull’uso della biomassa per l’estrazione di biomolecole. In particolare, sono stati considerati nove genotipi autoctoni primaverili (Ascolano, Campagnano, Castellammare, Jesino, Montelupone A, Montelupone B, Bianco di Pertosa, Pisa and Tondo Rosso di Paestum), dieci cloni della tipologia ‘Romanesco’ (S 2, S 3, S 5, S 11, S 17, S 18, S 22, S 23, Grato 1 and Campagnano), sette genotipi di cardo coltivato (AFB, AFFG, AFGR, AFGI, AFM, AFM 2, AFN) e un genotipo di cardo selvatico (AFS), tutti appartenenti alla collezione di germoplasma dell’Università della Tuscia e dell’ENEA. Le prove sperimentali di campo sono state svolte presso l’Azienda sperimentale ARSIAL (Agenzia Regionale per lo Sviluppo e l’Innovazione in Agricoltura) di Cerveteri (Roma) e di Tarquinia (Viterbo), mentre le prove di serra sono state condotte nella Azienda Sperimentale dell’Università della Tuscia, a Viterbo (Italia). Il primo obiettivo del dottorato ha riguardato i) la caratterizzazione agro-morfologica del germoplasma italiano per mezzo dei descrittori UPOV, ii) la valutazione della variabilità genetica esistente tra ed entro i genotipi, e iii) l’identificazione e la conservazione delle risorse genetiche in collezione per lo sviluppo futuro di programmi di miglioramento genetico. La caratterizzazione del germoplasma ha portato alla selezione di tre genotipi validi per la produzione edule che sono stati validati e proposti per l’iscrizione al Registro Nazionale delle Varietà con i nomi di Michelangelo, Donatello e Raffaello. Al fine di caratterizzare il germoplasma anche da un punto di vista della biomassa, sono stati anche considerati diversi caratteri morfologici atti a descrivere il vigore della pianta e a quantificare la produzione di sostanza secca. La produzione di biomassa è risultata davvero molto interessante nel nostro lavoro e si è sottolineato il grande potenziale di utilizzo della coltura nel settore industriale. Alcuni genotipi come Ascolano, Campagnano, Pisa e Bianco di Pertosa, per il carciofo, e AFFG e AFM, per il cardo, sono risultati davvero interessanti dal punto di vista della produzione di biomassa. Un altro importante obiettivo del dottorato è stato quello di mettere a punto un metodo per l’estrazione di polifenoli al fine di ottimizzare le rese. Sono state messe a confronto tecniche convenzionali (ad esempio metodo Soxhlet e macerazione) ed altre più innovative (ad esempio Microwave Assisted Extraction - MAE e Accelerated Solvent Extraction - ASE). La tecnica ASE ha fornito i migliori risultati, consentendo anche di ridurre i tempi d’estrazione e il consumo di solvente, fornendo al tempo stesso alte rese e elevata qualità degli estratti. E’ stato anche condotto lo studio della cinetica di accumulo della biomassa e delle biomolecole in campo al fine di individuare il momento migliore per la raccolta del materiale in campo ed ottimizzare le rese. Una volta messo a punto il metodo d’estrazione e individuata l’epoca ottimale per il prelievo delle biomasse in campo, si è andati ad effettuate le estrazioni al fine di caratterizzare biochimicamente i genotipi in prova e di selezionere quelli più rispondenti a tale attitudine. La caratterizzazione morfologica e biochimica hanno permesso di ben identificare i genotipi e di selezionare quelli più adatti per la produzione di capolini (‘food production’), di biomassa o per la duplice attitudine (food and non-food). Nel corso del dottorato si è anche valutato un sistema alternativo per la produzione di biomassa e di biomolecole in serra. E’ stata valutata l’adattabilità del carciofo e del cardo al sistema di coltivazione fuori suolo (floating system), soprattutto per evidenziare risposta biochimica e molecolare delle piante sottoposte allo stress salino in termini di aumento nella produzione di sostanze fenoliche. I risultati ottenuti nel corso del dottorato hanno messo in luce la reale possibilità di usare alcuni genotipi di carciofo e di cardo per la produzione edule, altri per quella di biomassa e di biomolecole, soprattutto in condizioni di pieno campo. Si è inoltre delineata una reale prospettiva per l’impiego di alcuni genotipi di carciofo in una duplice destinazione commerciale (biomassa per l’estrazione di biomolecole e capolini per la destinazione alimentare).

40|$|Abstract Background The {{leaves of}} <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> {{cultivated}} <b>cardoon</b> (Cynara cardunculus L.) have significant pharmaceutical properties, which mainly result from their high content of polyphenolic compounds such as monocaffeoylquinic and dicaffeoylquinic acid (DCQ), {{and a range}} of flavonoid compounds. Results Hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HQT) encoding genes have been isolated from both <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> cultivated <b>cardoon</b> (GenBank accessions DQ 915589 and DQ 915590, respectively) using CODEHOP and PCR-RACE. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that their sequences belong to one of the major acyltransferase groups (anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase). The heterologous expression of <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> HQT in E. coli showed that this enzyme can catalyze the esterification of quinic acid with caffeoyl-CoA or p -coumaroyl-CoA to generate, respectively, chlorogenic acid (CGA) and p -coumaroyl quinate. Real time PCR experiments demonstrated an increase in the expression level of HQT in UV-C treated leaves, and established a correlation between the synthesis of phenolic acids and protection against damage due to abiotic stress. The HQT gene, together with a gene encoding hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate/quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) previously isolated from <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke,</b> have been incorporated within the developing <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> linkage maps. Conclusion A novel acyltransferase involved in the biosynthesis of CGA in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> has been isolated, characterized and mapped.

40|$|Understanding the {{distribution}} of genetic variations and accession structures {{is an important factor}} for managing genetic resources, but also for using proper germplasm in association map analyses and breeding programs. The <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> is the fourth most important horticultural crop in Europe. Here, we report the results of a molecular analysis of a collection including <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> leafy <b>cardoon</b> germplasm present in the Italian, French and Spanish gene banks. The aims of this study were to: (i) assess the diversity present in European collections, (ii) determine the population structure, (iii) measure the genetic distance between accessions; (iv) cluster the accessions; (v) properly distinguish accessions present in the different national collections carrying the same name; and (vi) understand the diversity distribution in relation to the gene bank and the geographic origin of the germplasm. A total of 556 individuals grouped into 174 accessions of distinct typologies were analyzed by different types of molecular markers, i. e. dominant (ISSR and AFLP) and co-dominant (SSR). The data of the two crops (<b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> leafy <b>cardoon)</b> were analyzed jointly and separately to compute, among other aims, the gene diversity, heterozygosity (He, Ho), fixation indexes, AMOVA, genetic distance and structure. The findings underline the huge diversity present in the analyzed material, and the existence of alleles that are able to discriminate among accessions. The accessions were clustered not only {{on the basis of their}} typology, but also on the basis of the gene bank they come from. Probably, the environmental conditions of the different field gene banks affected germplasm conservation. These outcomes will be useful in plant breeding to select accessions and to fingerprint varieties. Moreover, the results highlight the particular attention that should be paid to the method used to conserve the Cynara cardunculus germplasm and suggest to the preference of using accessions from different gene banks to run an association map...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cynara cardunculus is {{a species}} {{native to the}} Mediterranean basin. It {{includes}} <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> cultivated <b>cardoon</b> {{as well as their}} progenitor wild cardoon. The species is a source of biophenols, and its leaf extracts have been widely used in herbal medicine as hepatoprotectors and choleretics since ancient times. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of increasing the level of salinity in the nutrient solution (1 or 30 mmol L− 1 NaCl) on biomass production, mineral composition, radical-scavenging activity, caffeoylquinic acids and flavonoids in three artichoke (‘Romolo’, ‘Violetto di Provenza’ and ‘Violetto di Romagna’) <b>and</b> three cultivated <b>cardoon</b> (‘Bianco Avorio’, ‘Bianco Gigante Inerme’ and ‘Gigante di Romagna’) cultivars grown in a floating system. RESULTS: Increased salinity in the nutrient solution decreased the leaf dry biomass and leaf number of <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> cultivated <b>cardoon</b> cultivars. Salinity reduced macro- and microelement accumulation in leaves (e. g. N, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn and B) but improved their antioxidant activity, total polyphenols, chlorogenic acid, cynarin and luteolin. The cultivated cardoons, especially ‘Bianco Avorio’ and ‘Gigante di Romagna’, showed higher biomass and leaf number than those observed in artichoke genotypes. ‘Violetto di Provenza’ exhibited the highest content of chlorogenic acid, closely followed by ‘Violetto di Romagna’, whereas for cynarin content the highest values were recorded in ‘Violetto di Provenza’, ‘Bianco Avorio’ and ‘Gigante di Romagna’. The highest content of luteolin was recorded in ‘Gigante di Romagna’ and ‘Bianco Avorio’, while the highest content of apigenin was observed in ‘Gigante di Romagna’. CONCLUSION: The results showed that the floating system could be considered an effective tool to improve quality aspects through proper management of the salt concentration in the nutrient solution. They also suggest that specific cultivars should be selected to obtain the desired profile of bioactive compounds...|$|R
40|$|The dietary {{value of}} many plant {{polyphenols}} {{lies in the}} protection given against degenerative pathologies. Their in planta role {{is associated with the}} host's defence response against biotic and abiotic stress. The polyphenol content of a given plant tissue is strongly influenced by the growing environment, but is also genetically determined. Plants belonging to the Cynara cardunculus species (<b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> the cultivated <b>and</b> wild <b>cardoon)</b> accumulate substantial quantities of polyphenols (mainly mono and di-caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) in their foliage. Transgressive segregation for CQA content in an F 1 population bred from a cross between a <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> a cultivated <b>cardoon</b> led to the selection of eight segregants which accumulated more CQA in their leaves than did those of either of their parental lines. The selections were grown over two seasons to assess their polyphenol profile (CQAs, apigenin and luteolin derivatives and narirutin), and were also fingerprinted using a set of 217 microsatellite markers. The growing environment exerted a strong effect on polyphenol content, but two of the selections were able to accumulate up to an order of magnitude more CQA than either parent in both growing seasons. Since the species is readily vegetatively propagable, such genotypes can be straightforwardly exploited as a source of pharmaceutically valuable compounds, while their SSR-based fingerprinting will allow the genetic identity of clonally propagated material to be easily verified...|$|R
40|$|The {{ligno-cellulosic biomass}} of Cynara cardunculus has great {{potential}} {{for the production of}} renewable energy. Its caloric values does not significantly differ among the cultivated and wild forms of the species, however, the yield expressed in total energy obtainable by 1 ha of crop is greater for cultivated cardoon due to its higher biomass production. Within the Project CYNERGIA (funded by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural, Food and Forestry Policies), nine varieties/landraces of cultivated cardoon are being evaluated for biomass yield in three environments located in north and south Italy. During the first year the biomass production reached, on average, up to 8. 3 t/ha (dry matter), a value which is expected to consistently increase starting from the second year. An AFLP-based genetic characterization was conducted identifying 3 gene pools (Spain, north/centre and south Italy derived genotypes). The analysis also highlighted a wide range of within variety genetic variation. An F 1 progeny, from a cross between a <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> a cultivated <b>cardoon</b> genotypes, contrasting in biomass yield, has been already genetically characterized and measured for traits related to biomass yield.

40|$|Abstract Background The Asteraceae species Cynara cardunculus (2 n [*]=[*] 2 x [*]=[*] 34) {{includes}} the two fully cross-compatible domesticated taxa <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> (var. scolymus L.) <b>and</b> cultivated <b>cardoon</b> (var. altilis DC). As both are out-pollinators and suffer from marked inbreeding depression, linkage analysis has focussed {{on the use}} of a two way pseudo-test cross approach. Results A set of 172 microsatellite (SSR) loci derived from expressed sequence tag DNA sequence were integrated into the reference C. cardunculus genetic maps, based on segregation among the F 1 progeny of a cross between a <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> a cultivated <b>cardoon.</b> The resulting maps each detected 17 major linkage groups, corresponding to the species’ haploid chromosome number. A consensus map based on 66 co-dominant shared loci (64 SSRs and two SNPs) assembled 694 loci, with a mean inter-marker spacing of 2. 5 [*]cM. When the maps were used to elucidate the pattern of inheritance of head production earliness, a key commercial trait, seven regions were shown to harbour relevant quantitative trait loci (QTL). Together, these QTL accounted for up to 74 % of the overall phenotypic variance. Conclusion The newly developed consensus as well as the parental genetic maps can accelerate the process of tagging and eventually isolating the genes underlying earliness in both the domesticated C. cardunculus forms. The largest single effect mapped to the same linkage group in each parental maps, and explained about one half of the phenotypic variance, thus representing a good candidate for marker assisted selection. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cynara cardunculus L. is an edible plant of {{pharmaceutical}} interest, {{in particular with}} respect to the polyphenolic content of its leaves. It includes three taxa: <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke,</b> cultivated <b>cardoon,</b> <b>and</b> wild <b>cardoon.</b> The dominating phenolics are the di-caffeoylquinic acids (such as cynarin), which are largely restricted to Cynara species, along with their precursor, chlorogenic acid (CGA). The scope {{of this study is to}} better understand CGA synthesis in this plant. Results: A gene sequence encoding a hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) involved in the synthesis of CGA, was identified. Isolation of the gene sequence was achieved by using a PCR strategy with degenerated primers targeted to conserved regions of orthologous HCT sequences available. We have isolated a 717 bp cDNA which shares 84 % aminoacid identity and 92 % similarity with a tobacco gene responsible for the biosynthesis of CGA from p-coumaroyl-CoA and quinic acid. In silico studies revealed the <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> HCT sequence clustering with one of the main acyltransferase groups (i. e. anthranilate N-hydroxycinnamoyl/benzoyltransferase). Heterologous expression of the full length HCT (GenBank accession DQ 104740) cDNA in E. coli demonstrated that the recombinant enzyme efficiently synthesizes both chlorogenic acid and p-coumaroyl quinate from quinic acid and caffeoyl-CoA or p-coumaroyl-CoA, respectively, confirming its identity as a hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate HCT. Variable levels of HCT expression were shown among wild and cultivated forms of C. cardunculus subspecies. The level of expression was correlated with CGA content.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of chloride salts (NaCl, KCl and CaCl 2) on biomass production, mineral composition, phenolic and flavonoid contents and antioxidant activity in leaves of <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> <b>cardoon</b> grown in a floating system. RESULTS In both crops, NaCl and KCl treatments reduced biomass production, while similar values were recorded in CaCl 2 and control treatments. In both crops, KCl treatment enhanced total phenolic and flavonoid contents, antioxidant activity and target polyphenols in leaves harvested at 48, 82 and 105 days after sowing (DAS), while leaf quality was improved by NaCl and CaCl 2 treatments only at 82 and 105 DAS. Irrespective of salinity, leaves of cardoon had higher total phenolic and flavonoid contents, antioxidant activity and target polyphenols than those of artichoke.

This paper reports the development of an experimental system to induce caffeoylquinic acids. This system may serve to study the regulation of the biosynthesis of (poly) phenolic compounds in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> <b>and</b> the genetic basis of this metabolic regulation. By means of HPLC-PDA and accurate mass LC-QTOF MS and MS/MS analyses, the major phenolic compounds in <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> leaves were identified: four isomers of dicaffeoylquinic acid, three isomers of caffeoylquinic acid, and the flavone luteolin 7 -glucoside. Next, plant material was identified in which the concentration of phenolic compounds was comparable in the absence of particular treatments, with the aim to use this material to test the effect of stress application on the regulation of biosynthesis of caffeoylquinic acids. Using this material, the effect of UV-C, methyl jasmonate, and salicylic acid treatments on (poly) phenolic compounds was tested in different <b>globe</b> <b>artichoke</b> genotypes. UV-C exposure consistently increased the levels of dicaffeoylquinic acids in all genotypes, whereas the effect on compounds from the same biosynthetic pathway, for example, chlorogenic acid and luteolin- 7 -glucoside, was much less pronounced and was not statistically significant. No effect of methyl jasmonate or salicylic acid was found. Time-response experiments indicated that the level of dicaffeoylquinic acids reached a maximum at 24 h after UV radiation.
