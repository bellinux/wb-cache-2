5|$|Harrison Scott, {{a retired}} engineer, was {{traveling}} north on I-5 {{with his son}} in 1991, when his son speculated about the difficulty of driving over the first road through the rugged terrain. Having some extra time, and recalling a <b>drive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> old road in 1955, they left the freeway and traveled along most of the abandoned section. Near SR138, Scott asked a county road crew which was resurfacing the road if it was still maintained by the county, and the crew replied that they didn't know who maintained it through the desert. It {{turned out that the}} county officially owned it but did not maintain it; Scott has since convinced the county and forest to exchange ownership with the Santa Anita Canyon Road, then a county road.|$|E
5|$|In September the {{regiment}} {{was sent to}} Italy {{with the rest of}} the division and fought in the Moro River Campaign on the Adriatic coast in December. The division fought in the Battle of Monte Cassino, for which Div Cav provided support. The regiment then participated in the <b>drive</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Gothic Line, where elements entered Florence in August. In October it was reorganised as the Divisional Cavalry Battalion, an infantry unit, because its armoured cars were unsuitable for Italian terrain. The battalion fought in the final Allied offensive in Italy, Operation Grapeshot, during early 1945. It reached Trieste in the first week of May and was stationed there until February 1946. That month the Divisional Cavalry deployed to Japan, once again as a regiment. Stationed in southern Kyushu, it was disbanded on 1 September 1947.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{possession}} of the second half, the Terrapins were forced to punt after a run attempt for loss, a false start penalty, and two incomplete passes. The Maryland defense took the field and stopped a Clemson <b>drive.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> first play of their second series, wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey executed a reverse to gain 76yards before being stopped at the Clemson four-yard line. This set up a short Chris Turner touchdown pass to receiver Torrey Smith, and shifted the game's momentum in favor of Maryland. In the fourth quarter, three completions to Danny Oquendo {{set the stage for}} a one-yard rush into the endzone by Da'Rel Scott. In the second half, the Maryland defense allowed Clemson just 31rushing yards and zeropoints, compared with 204rushing yards and 17points in the first half.|$|E

However, the Crimson Tide was unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover after McCarron was sacked twice and were forced to punt. The defense responded on the next drive with their second recovered fumble of the game. This time, Adrian Hubbard caused the Antonio Andrews fumble that was recovered by Brandon Ivory at the WKU 33-yard line. On the next play, McCarron threw a 33-yard touchdown pass to Kevin Norwood for a 14–0 Crimson Tide lead.|$|E

The first play was stopped for no gain, DeShazo threw two {{incomplete}} passes, and Virginia Tech punted after going three and out. Indiana recovered the ball at its 23-yard line, where their offense began work. A five-yard false start penalty against the Hoosiers pushed them back, and Indiana was stopped for little gain {{on the first two}} plays of its <b>drive.</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> third play, however, Paci connected on a 75-yard pass to Thomas Lewis, who ran into the end zone for a touchdown and the game's first points.
