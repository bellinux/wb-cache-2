25|$|A letter box, letterbox, letter plate, letter hole, {{mail slot}} or mailbox is a {{receptacle}} for receiving <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> {{at a private}} residence or business. For the opposite purpose of collecting outgoing mail, a post box is generally used instead.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{designs of}} {{mailboxes}} with improved construction and security have been patented in recent years, {{particularly in the}} United States. In 2001, the USPS first approved designs for locking curbside mailboxes to stem a rise in identity and mail theft. With these secure designs, the <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> is placed into a slot or hopper by the mail carrier, where it drops into a secure locked compartment for retrieval by only the homeowner (who retains a key or combination to the lock). Locking mailboxes are generally constructed of heavy-gauge steel or aluminum plate, though some models are made of roto-moulded polymer plastic.|$|E
25|$|Rural {{and some}} {{suburban}} areas of North America may utilize curbside mailboxes, {{also known as}} rural mailboxes. These receptacles generally consist of a large metal box mounted on a support designed primarily to receive large quantities of <b>incoming</b> <b>mail,</b> often with an attached flag to signal the presence of outgoing mail to the mail carrier. In the US and Canada, rural curbside mailboxes may be found grouped together at property boundaries or road/driveway intersections, depending upon conditions. Although the United States Postal Service (USPS) has general regulations stating the distance a letter box may be from the road surface, these requirements may be changed by the local postmaster according to local environment and road conditions.|$|E

5000|$|For example, {{addresses}} in Simpang Pulai in Perak {{should be}} written as [...] "Kampung Kepayang", even though Kampung Kepayang {{is now a}} ghost town. This is simply because the <b>incoming</b> <b>mails</b> are handled by the Kampung Kepayang post office which has moved to Simpang Pulai.

500|$|The Scarborough {{post office}} dates to December 3, 1864, when the U.S. Postal Service {{established}} a [...] "catch and throw" [...] office {{there in the}} same small building as the earlier established station. A hook was installed along the tracks to hang mail bags to be grabbed by workers on the passing trains for outgoing mail distribution; in turn workers threw mail bags off the train for <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> distribution. The first postmaster of the Scarborough Post Office facility was James Van Velsor who had an annual salary of $200 ($ in [...] ) in 1873.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{designed}} {{only for}} <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> delivery, curbside mailboxes were soon {{fitted with a}} [...] or signal flag mounted on an attached arm to signal the postman to pickup outgoing mail. Originally, this flag was raised {{not only by the}} resident of the property to signal the postman of outgoing mail, but also by the postman to inform the recipient that <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> had been delivered - a convenience to all during periods of freezing or inclement weather.|$|E

2500|$|Currently, US {{curbside}} mailboxes {{are classified}} as (T) Traditional, (C) Contemporary, or (L) Locking. Traditional or Contemporary non-locking curbside mailboxes are approved in three sizes - No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, measured by minimum interior dimensions. The largest acceptable curbside mailbox is the No. 3, which measures 22.81inches long, 11inches wide, and 15inches in height (58cm x 28cm x 38cm) at the peak. Locking mailbox designs that provide security for the recipient's <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> have fewer restrictions on shape and size, though designs with a slot for <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> {{must be at least}} 1.75inches high by 10inches wide. Residential locking mailboxes cannot require the postal carrier to have a key, by USPS Specifications. [...] Therefore, no USPS approved residential locking mailbox has secure outgoing mail. Installation requirements vary from standard unlocked mailboxes: with locking mailboxes, the <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> slot must be 41"-45" [...] above the roadside surface, and the front of the mailbox must be 6"-8" [...] back from the curb. [...] USPS specifications for all mailboxes mandate the same, except the placement of the 'incoming mail area' varies with a locking mailbox.|$|E
2500|$|In the US, {{wall-mounted}} or curbside mailboxes {{that are}} only designed for receiving <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> are known as [...] "limited-service" [...] mailboxes, while mailboxes equipped with a mechanism for notifying the postman to collect outgoing mail from the mailbox are known as [...] "full service" [...] mailboxes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{speed of}} mail {{traveling}} between Guam {{and the states}} varies depending on size and time of year. Light, first-class items generally take {{less than a week}} to or from the mainland, but larger first-class or Priority items can take a week or two. Fourth-class mail, such as magazines, are transported by sea after reaching Hawaii. Most residents use post office boxes or private mail boxes, although residential delivery is becoming increasingly available. <b>Incoming</b> <b>mail</b> not from the Americas should be addressed to [...] "Guam" [...] instead of [...] "USA" [...] to avoid being routed the long way through the U.S. mainland and possibly charged a higher rate (especially from Asia).|$|E
2500|$|Wall-mounted or {{attached}} mailboxes {{may also}} be used in place of mail slots, usually located close {{to the front door}} of the residence. They are known as [...] "full-service" [...] mailboxes when they have provisions for securing outgoing as well as <b>incoming</b> <b>mail.</b> Attached wall-mounted mailboxes are still used in older urban and suburban neighbourhoods in North America. They are especially common in urban and suburban areas of Canada, where the curbside mailbox is rarely seen except in rural areas. Attached mailboxes are less common in newer urban and suburban developments and in rural areas of the United States, where curbside delivery or delivery to a community mail station (cluster mailbox, known as a bank of post boxes in the UK) is generally used.|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to present the interest of the human perceptive vision for document analysis. We focus on two aspects of the model of perceptive vision: the perceptive cycle and the visual attention. We present the key elements of the perceptive vision that can be used for document analysis. Thus, we introduce the perceptive vision in an existing method for document structure recognition, which enable both to show how we used the properties of the perceptive vision and to compare the results obtained with and without perceptive vision. We apply our method for the analysis of several kinds of documents (archive registers, old newspapers, <b>incoming</b> <b>mails...)</b> and show that the perceptive vision signicantly improves their recognition. Moreover, the use of the perceptive vision simplies the description of complex documents. At last, the running time is often reduced...|$|R

60|$|I {{received}} {{your most}} interesting and clear-sighted letter about Plorn {{just before the}} departure of the last mail from here to you. I did not answer then because another <b>incoming</b> <b>mail</b> was nearly due, and I expected (knowing Plorn so well) that some communication from him such as he made to you would come to me. I was not mistaken. The same arguing of the squatter question--vegetables and all--appeared. This gave me an opportunity of touching on those points by this mail, without in the least compromising you. I cannot too completely express my concurrence with your excellent idea that his correspondence with you should be regarded as confidential. Just as I could not possibly suggest a word more neatly to the point, or more thoughtfully addressed, to such a young man than your reply to his letter, I hope you will excuse my saying that it is a perfect model of tact, good sense, and good feeling. I had been struck by his persistently ignoring the possibility of his holding any other position in Australasia than his present position, and had inferred from it a homeward tendency. What is most curious to me is that he is very sensible, and yet does not seem to understand that he has qualified himself for no public examinations in the old country, and could not possibly hold his own against any competition for anything to which I could get him nominated.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a complete system able to categorize handwritten documents, i. e. to classify documents {{according to their}} topic. The categorization approach {{is based on the}} detection of some discrim- inative keywords prior {{to the use of the}} well known tf-idf representation for document categorization. Two keyword extraction strategies are explored. The rst one proceeds to the recognition of the whole document. However, the performance of this strategy strongly de- creases when the lexicon size increases. The second strat- egy only extracts the discriminative keywords in the handwritten documents. This information extraction strategy relies on the integration of a rejection model (or anti-lexicon model) in the recognition system. Ex- periments have been carried out on an unconstrained handwritten document database coming from an indus- trial application concerning the processing of <b>incoming</b> <b>mails.</b> Results show that the discriminative keyword ex- traction system leads to better recall/precision trade- o s than the full recognition strategy.

40|$|Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a {{well known}} attack in which a {{malicious}} webpage instructs the victim's browser to send out requests to legitimate sites {{on behalf of the}} victim, while piggybacking on the authorized sessions of the victim. CSRF attacks are typically transparent for the victim, and for legitimate websites it is hard to differentiate between requests initiated by the victim, and requests initiated by the malicious webpage. Although this type of vulnerability is already known for about a decade, CSRF recently gained much more attention because of its impact on contemporary e-society. In November 2007, a vulnerability in GMail was exploited to forward <b>incoming</b> <b>mails</b> of the victims to an arbitrary account.
