5|$|Warren Jeffs' prison {{life has}} been tumultuous. At Utah's Purgatory Correctional Facility, he {{suffered}} from infected ulcers on his knees, which resulted from praying days on end during solitary confinement. He attempted to commit suicide by hanging himself at one point. In August 2008, Jeffs went into convulsions after banging <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> walls of his cell repetitively {{and had to be}} taken to a hospital by helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Lefevre retired Tristan {{to stand}} as a {{stallion}} in France at his stud near Chamant. In 1891 he was purchased by Caroline, Duchess of Montrose, who returned him to England {{as a replacement for}} the recently deceased Isonomy. Three years later he was sold again and exported to Austria-Hungary. In 1897 he {{died as a result of}} injuries sustained after dashing <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall of his stable in a fit of temper. Tristan was not a great success as a stallion, but he did sire Canterbury Pilgrim, who won The Oaks in 1896 and became a highly successful and influential broodmare. Other good winners included Le Nord (Dewhurst Stakes) and Le Nicham (Champion Stakes).|$|E
5|$|Within {{weeks of}} his arrival at prison, Berkman began {{planning}} his suicide. He tried to sharpen a spoon into a blade, but his attempt {{was discovered by}} a guard and Berkman {{spent the night in}} the dungeon. He thought about beating <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bars of his cell, but worried that his efforts might injure him but leave him alive. Berkman wrote a letter to Goldman, asking her to secure a dynamite capsule for him. A letter was smuggled out of the prison and arrangements were made for her to visit Berkman in November 1892, posing as his sister. Berkman knew {{as soon as he saw}} Goldman that she had not brought the dynamite capsule.|$|E

25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging {{in the behavior}} decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.|$|E
25|$|A special, high gibbet {{was erected}} in the {{marketplace}} at Launceston, and Mayne was executed there on 29 November 1577. He {{was not allowed to}} speak to the crowd, but only to say his prayers quietly. Just {{as he was about to}} be hanged, he refused to implicate his co-religionists. It is unclear if he died on the gibbet. One source states that he was cut down alive, but in falling struck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> butcher's scaffold. In any case, he was unconscious when being drawn and quartered.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, Twitty was exiting {{his tour}} bus when he {{slipped on the}} steps and fell, hitting <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> steps. John Hughey, who was Twitty's steel guitar player, found him on the ground. Many people, {{including}} family members, said that Twitty underwent a change in personality after the accident. According to his daughter Joni, Twitty {{was not in a}} right state of mind for several months, saying {{in an interview that he}} had picked up a TV remote and began talking into it, thinking it was a phone.|$|E

25|$|On 9 April 1937, eleven {{days after}} ceremonially handing over Evans's ashes and thirty-four days before King George VI's coronation, Sullivan {{died when he}} was {{returning}} to his accommodation and accidentally slipped in Birdcage Walk, Westminster, near the Wellington Barracks, and struck <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> kerb. He {{died as a result of}} the severity of the head injuries he had sustained. He was afforded a full military funeral in London where the Australian contingent's salute volley was respectfully returned by the Foot Guards. Field Marshal Lord Birdwood and a dozen British VC winners attended the funeral. His body was cremated at Golders Green in London and his ashes were returned to Sydney and interred at the Northern Suburbs Crematorium where they rest by a plaque on Tree 267A in the North section. A month after the funeral, a gap was deliberately left in the ranks of the Australian contingent as they marched in the coronation parade.|$|E
25|$|Out of {{the twelve}} {{passengers}} who suffered major injuries, nine suffered the injuries from the impact and three suffered the injuries from the evacuation. Most of the injuries occurred to passengers and crew located in the flight deck and forward cabin. According to passenger reports, the leap from the aircraft to the ground caused many of the injuries, including broken legs, and ruptured vertebrae. The Captain sustained back and head injuries during {{the impact of the}} crash when his seat was wrenched out of place by the force of the impact, causing him to hit <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> overhead controls. Minor injuries included twisted ankles, sore necks, bruises and effects from smoke inhalation. A total of 33 persons were taken to various hospitals within and outside Toronto for treatment, of which 21 were treated for minor injuries and released. The York-Finch campus of the Humber River Regional Hospital treated seven people for smoke inhalation. William Osler Health Centre, Etobicoke General Hospital, Credit Valley Hospital, and Peel Memorial Hospital were additional nearby hospitals that had admitted victims of the crash.|$|E
25|$|Lauren meets Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), a man {{who works}} in her father Max Branning's (Jake Wood) office, and they are {{attracted}} to each other. Josh encourages Lauren {{to apply for a}} job there but Steven is unimpressed by Lauren's plans as he wants her {{to spend more time with}} him and Louie. He suggests that they start trying for a baby but Lauren refuses because she wants to concentrate on her career, so Steven secretly pieces holes in condoms. Lauren gets a job at the company and tells Steven that she barely sees Josh but Steven visits her at work and sees her with Josh, and he becomes suspicious. Steven is unaware that Lauren is pregnant and planning an abortion, although her sister Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) makes him question Lauren and Josh's relationship. During an argument with Abi, who resents Lauren, Steven is stunned to hear Lauren aborted his child. A few days later, following Abi's 21st birthday party, another disagreement between Abi and Steven ends with them sleeping together. Some time after, Steven has sex with Abi again after seeing footage of Lauren and Josh. Despite the affair with Abi, Steven insists he wants to be with Lauren and Abi does her best to poison his mind against her. When Lauren tells Josh that she doesn't love Steven, Abi persuades her to return to New Zealand. Just as she is about to leave, Josh visits Steven and tells him that Lauren has resigned from her job. Steven bashes <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, causing it to bleed. He later bumps into Lauren before she leaves and she plans to end their relationship, but notices Steven's head injury. In a desperate act to keep Lauren with him, Steven lies the injury is caused by him trying to remove a brain tumour, claiming that he has cancer and he is dying.|$|E
60|$|The {{distinguished}} journalist {{leaning on}} <b>his</b> elbow, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> resting <b>against</b> <b>the</b> knuckles {{of his left}} hand, listened with great attention, but gave no sign of that surprise which Renouard, pausing, seemed to expect.|$|R
60|$|There was a struggle, and {{the broker}} aimed a blow at Dick's head. Then the oldest Rover boy {{suddenly}} caught the rascal {{by the neck}} and banged <b>his</b> <b>head</b> vigorously <b>against</b> <b>the</b> window casing.|$|R
60|$|He sprang forward and, {{catching}} Mr. Simpson by the collar, {{shook him}} violently until <b>his</b> <b>head</b> banged <b>against</b> <b>the</b> dresser. The next moment {{the hands of}} Mrs. Simpson were in the hair of Mr. Cooper.|$|R
500|$|A {{helicopter}} winches Homer out, slamming <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side of {{the gorge}} {{several times in the}} process before he is loaded into a waiting ambulance, which immediately crashes into a tree as it starts to leave for the hospital. The gurney carrying Homer rolls out of the back, and he once again falls {{to the floor of the}} canyon. Having arrived at the hospital he is put in the same ward next to Lance Murdock, where he tells him, [...] "You think you've got guts, try raising my kids." ...|$|E
500|$|Both {{domestic}} and international pressure called for a public inquest to be held, to which the government agreed. It began in Pretoria's Old Synagogue courthouse in November 1977, and lasted for three weeks. Both {{the running of the}} inquest and the quality of evidence submitted came in for extensive criticism. An observer from the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law stated that the affidavit's statements were [...] "sometimes redundant, sometimes inconsistent, frequently ambiguous"; David Napley described the police investigation of the incident as [...] "perfunctory in the extreme". The security forces alleged that Biko had acted aggressively and had sustained his injuries in a scuffle, in which he had banged <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cell wall. The presiding magistrate accepted the security forces' account of events and refused to prosecute any of those involved.|$|E
500|$|The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 {{attracted}} {{a crowd of}} 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3–2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5–2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging {{as they entered the}} stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by [...] lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths further back in third.|$|E
60|$|She {{could only}} see the outline of <b>his</b> <b>head</b> silhouetted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wind-tossed sky; {{she could not see}} his eyes, nor his lips, but she felt his nearness, and the {{happiness}} of that almost caused her to swoon.|$|R
60|$|He swung out of {{the office}} with a mazurka step. His silk hat, gaily tilted on the side of <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> struck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door-jamb, and fell rolling across the entry floor. Lemuel laughed wildly. At twenty these things are droll.|$|R
60|$|Now Umbelazi rose, {{and went}} with a broad smile upon his face, while Panda, {{somewhat}} fatigued with all his speech-making--for he was very fat and the day was very hot--leaned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> hut and closed his eyes.|$|R
2500|$|Over 11 {{years in}} prison, his health deteriorated: [...] "His teeth fell out, his {{digestive}} system collapsed {{so that he}} could not eat solid food... he had convulsions when he vomited blood, and suffered headaches so violent that he beat <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> walls of his cell." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 28 July 2015: A 27-year-old man, {{suspected}} of being a pickpocket, was handcuffed and violently thrown into the ground whilst under police custody.

Video evidence showed him being passive and compliant prior to the altercation.|$|E
2500|$|Hicks was a well-behaved detainee, {{but he was}} {{in solitary}} {{confinement}} for 23 hours a day. The window in his cell was internal, facing onto a corridor. Hicks claimed to have declined a visit from Australian Consular officials because he had been punished for speaking candidly with consular officials about the conditions of his detention on previous visits. Hicks was talking about suicidal impulses during his periods in isolation at Camp Echo, [...] "He often talked about wanting to smash <b>his</b> <b>head</b> ... <b>against</b> <b>the</b> metal of his cage and just end it all." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Teak, {{wondering}} as to {{the operations}} of Mr. Chase, agreed dumbly. He stopped the car {{at the corner of}} their road, and, holding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> down <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rain, sprinted towards home. Mrs. Teak, anxious for her hat, passed him.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early 1960s, the Los Angeles Rams {{went from being}} the only major {{professional}} sports franchise in Southern California and Los Angeles to being one of five. The Los Angeles Dodgers moved from Brooklyn in 1958, the Los Angeles Chargers of the upstart AFL was established in 1960, the Los Angeles Lakers moved from Minneapolis in 1960, and the Los Angeles Angels were awarded to Gene Autry in 1961. In spite of this, the Rams continued to thrive in Southern California. In {{the first two years}} after the Dodgers moved to California, the Rams drew an average of 83,681 in 1958 and 74,069 in 1959. The Rams were so popular in Los Angeles that the upstart Chargers chose to relocate to San Diego rather than attempt to compete with the immensely popular Rams. The Los Angeles Times put the Chargers plight as such: [...] "Hilton [...] quickly realized that taking on the Rams in L.A. was like beating <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{returned}} to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Upon his arrival, he gave {{an interview with a}} San Francisco newspaper in which he stated that the common people of Korea were benefiting from the increasing Japanese presence and protection in their country, and that, in the state that Korea was in, Korea was not fit to be a liberated country. These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Independence Club, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that {{something had to be done}} about Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether [...] "Japanese were not killing off the Koreans". He answered yes to the first question and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had [...] "probably been too long away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government." [...] Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> marble flooring; Stevens backed up against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted as saying, [...] "We are all very sorry that we did not do more to him." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was in its}} use of {{pre-recorded}} {{and live}} sound effects that The Goon Show broke the most new ground. [...] Part {{of the problem was}} that [...] "not even Milligan knew how to capture electronically the peculiar sounds that came alive in his head– he just knew when it had not yet happened". An example of this comes from an often cited story of Milligan filling his two socks with custard in the Camden Theatre canteen, in an attempt to achieve a squelching effect. Milligan asked the BBC canteen ladies to make some custard; they thought he must have some stomach trouble so lovingly made him a fresh custard– which he accepted with thanks and immediately poured into his sock, much to their horror. Secombe recalled [...] "Back in the studio, Spike had already placed a sheet of three-ply near a microphone." [...] One after the other, he swung them around <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wood, but failed to produce the sound effect he was seeking ("So, a sock full of custard and no sound effect!"). Secombe noted that [...] "Spike used to drive the studio managers mad with his insistence on getting the sound effects he wanted. In the beginning, when the programme was recorded on disc, it was extremely difficult to achieve the right sound effect. There were, I think, four turntables on the go simultaneously, with different sounds being played on each– chickens clucking, Big Ben striking, donkeys braying, massive explosions, ships' sirens– all happening at once. It was only when tape came into use that Spike felt really happy with the effects." [...] An FX instruction in one script read [...] "Sound effect of two lions walking away, bumping against each other. If you can't get two lions, two hippos will do". [...] Over time, the sound engineers became increasingly adept at translating the script into desired sounds, assisted [...] from the late 1950s onwards by specialists in the BBC's newly formed Radiophonic Workshop.|$|E
