5|$|On August 9, {{the same}} day ETA claimed {{responsibility}} for the July 30 attack, four bombs exploded in three restaurants and one shopping centre around Palma. The bombs, which contained small amounts of explosives and caused little damage and no injuries, went off after three warning calls from ETA. At 11:16 am local time, a man speaking on behalf of ETA called the firefighters of Calvià, warning that three bombs would <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> Palma. Half an hour later, another person also speaking on behalf of ETA called a taxi company in Gipuzkoa, giving details of the location and time the bombs would explode. Finally, another warning call was mistakenly made to the personal mobile phone of an inhabitant of Córdoba. Authorities reported that the bombers had given contradicting details in each call, leading to confusion on the location of the bombs.|$|E
5|$|Out {{of sight}} of the band members, two of the gunmen placed a ten-pound (4.5kg) time bomb {{in the rear of the}} minibus. The UVF's plan was that the bomb would explode once the minibus had reached Newry, killing all on board. However, Martin Dillon alleged that the bomb was meant to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> the Irish Republic. He {{suggested}} that had all gone according to plan, the loyalist extremists would have been able to clandestinely bomb the Republic of Ireland, yet claim that the band were republican bomb-smugglers carrying explosives on behalf of the IRA. They had hoped to embarrass the Government of Ireland, as well as to draw attention to its level of control of the border. This may have resulted in the Irish authorities enforcing tighter controls over the border, thus restricting IRA operations. Dillon opined that another reason the UVF decided to target the Miami Showband was because Irish nationalists held them in high regard; to attack the band was to strike the nationalists indirectly.|$|E

25|$|George {{appeared}} before the Old Bailey on 14 December 2007 and again {{pleaded not guilty to}} the murder. His retrial began on 9 June 2008. Initially there was a large amount of coverage in the press, especially of the prosecution portrayal of the defendant as being highly obsessive, lacking in social skills and a danger to women. The prosecution case differed from that of the first trial in that there was practically no scientific evidence as the evidence relating to the FDR was ruled inadmissible by the trial judge (Mr Justice Griffith Williams). There was much evidence of George's bad character which was admitted in the re-trial (at the discretion of the trial judge) {{as a result of the}} enactment of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 since the original trial. There were delays due to legal arguments and to the illnesses of the defendant and one of the jurors. For the defence William Clegg QC reminded the jury that evidence from three women from HAFAD (Hammersmith and Fulham Action on Disability) placed the defendant's arrival at their offices at 11:50 or 12:00, which, according to Clegg's argument, would have made it impossible for him to have committed a murder at Dando's house at 11:30 and then gone home (in the wrong direction) to change. Two neighbours who almost certainly saw the murderer immediately after the shooting had seen him <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> this direction, and later failed to identify George at an identification parade. The trial ended with George's acquittal on 1 August 2008.|$|E

According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted that his eyes had been damaged as well, either [...] "by the flash of a large-caliber gun" [...] or when he had [...] "a bomb <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> my face".

[...] In April 2017, Shyamalan announced the official title, release date, and returning actors for the third movie. The film, titled Glass, will be released January 18, 2019 and will feature Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy, and James McAvoy returning to their respective roles in the series.|$|E

In order to celebrate its fifteen years in the music industry, Dutch symphonic rock band, Within Temptation covered several songs by other artists, including [...] "Grenade", during a special program on the Belgian radio station Q music, called Within Temptation Friday. The band chose this song because [...] "It's a really good song and instead of making a grenade go off on stage, we figured we’d make a bomb of astonishment <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> the studio", {{in the words of}} the lead vocalist Sharon den Adel. On April 19, 2013 Within Temptation's cover was released and available for download as part of their cover album The Q-Music Sessions.

500|$|Thomas Moulton, Hubbard's {{executive}} {{officer on the}} USS PC-815, testified in 1984 that Hubbard had {{said that he had}} been shot in the Dutch East Indies, and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him that his eyes had been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had [...] "a bomb <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> my face." [...] He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that [...] "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." [...] According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he [...] "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again". Hubbard was said to have been [...] "twice been pronounced dead" [...] and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he [...] "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein". The techniques that he developed [...] "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because [...] "I was utterly exhausted.

500|$|No further {{information}} was forthcoming until 2000, when during a Raidió Teilifís Éireann interview a former IRA member, Liam Sutcliffe {{claimed he had}} placed the bomb which detonated in the Pillar. In the 1950s [...] Sutcliffe {{was associated with a}} group of dissident volunteers led by Joe Christle (1927–98), who had been expelled from the IRA in 1956 for [...] "recklessness". [...] In early 1966 Sutcliffe learned that Christle's group was planning [...] "Operation Humpty Dumpty", an attack on the Pillar, and offered his services. According to Sutcliffe, on 28 February he placed a bomb within the Pillar, timed to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> {{the early hours of the}} next morning. The explosive was a mixture of gelignite and ammonal. It failed to detonate; Sutcliffe says that he returned early the next morning, recovered the device and redesigned its timer. On 7 March, shortly before the Pillar closed for the day, he climbed the inner stairway and placed the refurbished bomb near to the top of the shaft before going home. [...] He learned of the success of his mission the next day, he says, having slept undisturbed through the night. Following his revelations, Sutcliffe was questioned by the police but not charged. He did not name [...] others involved in the action, apart from Christle and his brother.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the sound of}} their studio recordings, Joy Division typically played loudly and aggressively during live performances. The band were unhappy with Hannett's mixing of Unknown Pleasures, which reduced the abrasiveness of their sound. According to Sumner, [...] "the music was loud and heavy, and we felt that Martin had toned it down, especially with the guitars". In concert, the group interacted little with the crowd; Paul Morley wrote, [...] "During a Joy Division set, outside of the songs, you'll be lucky to hear {{more than two or three}} words. Hello and goodbye. No introductions, no promotion". While singing, Curtis would often perform what was referred to as his [...] "'dead fly' dance", where the singer's arms would [...] "start flying in [...] semicircular, hypnotic curve". Simon Reynolds noted that Curtis's dancing style was reminiscent of an epileptic fit, and that he was dancing in the manner for some months before he was diagnosed with epilepsy. Live performances became problematic for Joy Division, due to Curtis's condition. Sumner later said, [...] "We didn't have flashing lights, but sometimes a particular drum beat would do something to him. He'd <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> a trance for a bit, then he'd lose it and have an epileptic fit. We'd have to stop the show and carry him off to the dressing-room where he'd cry his eyes out because this appalling thing had just happened to him".|$|E
500|$|Irvine {{argued that}} though all of Austen's novels {{are set in}} provincial England, there {{is in fact a}} global {{component}} to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in Persuasion; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in Mansfield Park; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in Sense and Sensibility. Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793-98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a [...] "home". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the [...] "home" [...] that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could [...] "not" [...] write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the [...] "stories of empire" [...] are placed in a [...] "context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response".|$|E

500|$|Nolan {{wanted the}} story for {{the third and final}} {{installment}} to keep him emotionally invested. [...] "On a more superficial level, I have to ask the question," [...] he reasoned, [...] "how many good third movies in a franchise can people name?" [...] He returned out of finding a necessary way to continue the story, but feared midway through filming he would find a sequel redundant. The Dark Knight Rises is intended to complete Nolan's Batman trilogy. By December 2008, Nolan completed a rough story outline, before he committed himself to Inception. In February 2010, work on the screenplay was commencing with David S. Goyer and Jonathan Nolan. When Goyer left to work on the Superman reboot, Jonathan was writing the script based on the story by his brother and Goyer. Tom Hardy was cast as Bane and Anne Hathaway plays Selina Kyle. Joseph Gordon-Levitt was cast as John Blake, and Marion Cotillard was cast as Miranda Tate. Filming began in May 2011 and concluded in November. Nolan chose not to film in 3-D but, by focusing on improving image quality and scale using the IMAX format, hoped to push technological boundaries while nevertheless making the style of the film consistent with the previous two. Nolan had several meetings with IMAX Vice-President David Keighley to work on the logistics of projecting films in digital IMAX venues. The Dark Knight Rises featured more scenes shot in IMAX than The Dark Knight. Cinematographer Wally Pfister expressed interest in shooting the film entirely in IMAX. During the film, set eight years after Dark Knight, the arrival of new foe Bane forces Bruce to return to his old role as Batman, only to find himself overpowered and captured by Bane as Gotham is cut {{off from the rest of}} the world with a stolen Wayne Enterprises fusion generator prototype set to <b>go</b> <b>off</b> <b>in</b> a few months. With the aid of thief Selina Kyle, Bruce is able to return to Gotham and defeat Bane while redeeming his image as Batman. The film concludes with Bruce having 'retired' as Batman after faking his death to live with Selina Kyle, evidence suggesting that he has passed on the Batcave to new ally Detective John Blake (real first name Robin) while Gotham rebuilds in memory of the Dark Knight's heroism.|$|E
