50|$|The {{company is}} {{responsible}} for the origination of the bowler hat. In 1849, Edward Coke, nephew of Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester and the younger brother of Thomas Coke, 2nd Earl of Leicester, requested a hat {{to solve the problem of}} gamekeepers' headgear. Traditional top <b>hats</b> <b>were</b> <b>too</b> fragile and too tall (often getting knocked off by low branches) for the job. The company commissioned London hat-makers William and Thomas Bowler to solve the problem. Anecdotally, when Coke returned for his new hat, he dropped it on the floor and stamped on it twice to test its strength before paying 12 shillings and leaving satisfied.|$|R

50|$|In some synagogues, the {{president}} and honorary officers may wear a top hat on Shabbat or the great festivals. The custom of wearing a top hat, or tzylinder in the Yiddish language, originated in 19th-century England, replacing the wig and tricorn hat. The custom became widespread in Europe until The Holocaust. In some traditional Sephardi synagogues, {{members of the congregation}} may also wear top hats on special occasions. The custom is said to have started at the Bevis Marks Synagogue in London on a hot day, when the Chazzan was preparing for a service and decided that it <b>was</b> <b>too</b> hot to wear his wig, throwing it out of the window in a fit of bad temper. He then found that his tricorn <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> big, as it had been made to fit over the wig, and so wore his top hat instead.|$|R
60|$|Weston held up {{the lamp}} so the rest could see him. His face was black, and {{the sleeve of his}} duck jacket had several big holes in it. His {{trousers}} were rent in places, and one of his long boots was burst, while Devine's <b>hat,</b> which <b>was</b> <b>too</b> big for him, hung shapeless and dotted with charred holes on his head.|$|R
5000|$|The Hardee hat, {{also known}} as the Model 1858 Dress Hat and {{sometimes}} nicknamed the [...] "Jeff Davis", was the regulation dress hat for enlisted men in the Union Army during the American Civil War. The Hardee <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> also worn by Confederate soldiers. [...] However, most soldiers found the black felt <b>hat</b> to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> hot and heavy and shunned its use, preferring a kepi or slouch hat. The hardee <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> most famously worn and easily identified, as the hat worn, by the Union Army's Iron Brigade, which became their trademark and were popularly known, by the nickname, [...] "The Black Hats". However, the unadorned, plain and often field-modified Hardee <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> worn, by Union troops, especially in the Western theater.|$|R
60|$|He {{was tall}} and thin and dark. His finely-shaped {{intelligent}} face--hidden, as to {{the lower part of}} it, by a curly black beard--would have been absolutely handsome, even in the eyes of a schoolgirl, but for the deep furrows that marked it prematurely between the eyebrows, and at the sides of the mouth. In the same way, an underlying mockery impaired the attraction of his otherwise refined and gentle manner. Among his fellow-creatures, children and dogs were the only critics who appreciated his merits without discovering the defects which lessened the favorable appreciation of him by men and women. He dressed neatly, but his morning coat was badly made, and his picturesque felt <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> old. In short, {{there seemed to be no}} good quality about him which was not perversely associated with a drawback of some kind. He was one of those harmless and luckless men, possessed of excellent qualities, who fail nevertheless to achieve popularity in their social sphere.|$|R

6000|$|On {{this day}} he had not found Mrs. O'Hara at the cottage. She had gone down to Liscannor, Kate told him. He had sent his boat back to the strand near that village, round the point and into the bay, as it could not well lie under the rocks at high tide, and he now asked Kate to {{accompany}} him as he walked down. They would probably meet her mother on the road. Kate, as she tied on her <b>hat,</b> <b>was</b> only <b>too</b> happy to <b>be</b> his companion. [...] "I think," [...] he said, [...] "that I shall try and see Father Marty as I go back. If your mother has really heard anything about your father, she ought to have told me." ...|$|R
60|$|As for our Dalmatian friends, we {{met them}} and bowed {{to them a}} great deal, and we heard them {{overhead}} in frequent athletic games, involving noise as of the maneuvering of cavalry; and as they stood a good deal on their balcony, and looked down upon us on ours, we sometimes enjoyed seeing them admirably foreshortened like figures in a frescoed ceiling. The father of this family was a little man of a solemn and impressive demeanor, who had no other occupation but to {{walk up and down}} the city and view its monuments, for which purpose he one day informed us he had left his native place in Dalmatia, after forty years' study of Venetian history. He further told us that this was by no means worth the time given it; that whereas the streets of Venice were sepulchres in point of narrowness and obscurity, he had a house in Zara, from the windows of which you might see for miles uninterruptedly! This little gentleman wore a black hat, in the last vivid polish of respectability, and I think fortune was not his friend. The <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> large for him, as the hats of Italians always are; it came down to his eyes, and he carried a cane. Every evening he marched solemnly {{at the head of a}} procession of his handsome young children, who went to hear the military music in St. Mark's Square.|$|R
60|$|Crawshay {{found himself}} a popular hero when {{at a few}} minutes before eleven o'clock the next morning he made his {{appearance}} on deck. With little regard to the weather, which was fine and warm, he was clad in a thick grey suit and a voluminous overcoat. The fact that his borrowed <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> several sizes <b>too</b> large for him detracted a little from the dignity of his appearance, a misfortune for which he endeavoured to atone by a distinct aloofness of manner. The newspaper men, however, were not to be denied.|$|R

60|$|Upon the {{threshold}} stood Mr. Cullen, {{and by his}} side a lady {{who might have been}} anywhere between fifty and sixty years old. She was dressed in a particularly unattractive checked traveling suit, with a little satchel suspended from a shiny black leather band round her waist. She wore a small <b>hat</b> that <b>was</b> much <b>too</b> juvenile for her; and from the back of it a blue veil, which she had pushed on one side, hung nearly to the floor. Her complexion was very yellow; she had a square jaw; and through her spectacles her eyes glittered in a most unpleasant fashion. Her greeting was scarcely conciliatory.|$|R
60|$|Mr. George {{advanced}} to the policeman, {{and asked him if}} that building was the Horse Guards. The policeman listened to and answered his question in a very polite and gentlemanly manner. Mr. George made several additional inquiries in respect to the building, and received in reply to them a great deal of useful information. Rollo stood by all the while, listening to the conversation, and observing with the greatest interest the details of the uniform which the policeman wore. He was dressed, Rollo saw, in a suit of dark blue, which fitted his form very nicely. The coat had a standing collar, and was buttoned snugly up to the chin with bright buttons. On the collar was worked the letter and number, A 335, in white braid, which denoted the division that this officer belonged to, and his number in the division. The <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> peculiar, <b>too,</b> being glazed at the top and at the brim, and having an appearance as if covered with cloth at the sides. The figure of the policeman was very erect, and his air and bearing very gentlemanly, and he answered all Mr. George's inquiries in the most affable manner.|$|R
60|$|Altogether he had {{returned}} to the schools decidedly more interested in her than when they had parted. And the curious vague memories of her appearance as something a little frayed and careless, vanished at sight of her emerging from the darkness of the lift. Her hair was in order, as the light glanced through it it looked even pretty, and she wore a well-made, dark-green and black dress, loose-gathered as was the fashion in those days, that somehow gave a needed touch of warmth to her face. Her <b>hat</b> <b>too</b> <b>was</b> a change from the careless lumpishness of last year, a hat that, to a feminine mind, would have indicated design. It suited her--these things are past a male novelist's explaining.|$|R
2500|$|As {{an example}} of his later {{vaudeville}} career, during the off-seasons of 1892-93, which extended into the 1893 season, he appeared in January 1893 in New York at the Imperial Music Hall on West 29th Street. He was billed as [...] "King Kelly, the Monarch of the Baseball Field." [...] His trousers and shirt collar <b>were</b> <b>too</b> big and he buttoned his jacket wrong. [...] Also, his straw <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> a size <b>too</b> small. [...] "It was impossible {{to look at this}} vaudeville make-up and not laugh", the New York Sun said. [...] "Kelly laughed, too, and shook a roll of music at a lot of friends up in the private boxes." [...] Kelly came on after two French singers of opera. Stage partner William [...] "Billy" [...] Jerome [...] "took off his hat to him, and introduced him as 'Mr. Kelly, the famous $10,000 peach.'" [...] They sang a parody. [...] Later, after reciting [...] "Casey at the Bat", he said, according to the Sun, [...] "I'm right at home with Casey." [...] Also, [...] "It's the first time I’ve been in these clothes, and I don’t quite understand them. [...] Besides I’ve been over to Guttenberg [...] to-day, and that is an excuse for anything that a man may do. Come and see me again. I’m obliged for your welcome." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new <b>hat,</b> which <b>was</b> otherwise <b>too</b> large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive during this phase of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{had ordered}} A.P. Hill {{to avoid a}} general {{engagement}} with the enemy before he could assemble his full army, but Heth's actions had now rendered that order moot. They were engaged and Union reinforcements started arriving quickly. Heth's decision to deploy his two brigades {{before the arrival of}} the rest of his division was an error as well; they were repulsed in hard fighting against an elite division of the Army of the Potomac's I Corps, including the famously tenacious Iron Brigade. After a lull in fighting, Heth brought two more brigades into the fray in the afternoon and the Union forces were driven back to Seminary Ridge, but principally because the XI Corps' right flank was crushed by Richard S. Ewell's corps coming in from the north. Finally, Heth attacked again in conjunction with the division of Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes and the Union corps were routed, retreating back through town to Cemetery Hill. But Confederate losses were severe; Heth should have better coordinated his attack with the division of Maj. Gen. Dorsey Pender. Heth was wounded during the attack when a bullet struck him in the head. Fortunately for him, he <b>was</b> wearing a <b>hat</b> that <b>was</b> <b>too</b> large and stuffed with papers to make it fit. The papers probably deflected the bullet to avoid a fatal wound, but Heth was knocked unconscious and effectively out of the battle. Parts of his division, under the command of Brig. Gen. Johnston Pettigrew, saw more action two days later in Pickett's Charge and he recovered enough to command during the retreat back to Virginia and the minor engagements of the fall of 1863.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{contemporary}} Aymaran urban culture {{was developed in}} the working-class Aymara neighborhoods of La Paz, such as Chijini and others. Both Quechua and Aymara women in Peru and Bolivia took up the style of wearing bowler hats since the 1920s. According to legend, a shipment of bowler <b>hats</b> <b>was</b> sent from Europe to Bolivia via Peru for use by Europeans working on railroad construction. When the <b>hats</b> <b>were</b> found to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> small, they <b>were</b> given to the indigenous peoples. The luxurious, elegant and cosmopolitan Aymara Chola dress, which is an icon of Bolivia (bowler hat, aguayo, heavy pollera, skirts, boots, jewellery, etc.) began and evolved in La Paz. It is an urban tradition of dress. This style of dress has become part of ethnic identification by Aymara women. Many Aymara live and work as campesinos in the surrounding Altiplano.|$|R
50|$|The members wear {{outrageous}} headwear {{during their}} performances. This is explained {{as an act}} of rebellion, remembering their slave ancestors, who had to work bare-headed in the sun. According to N.W.H., <b>hats</b> <b>are</b> a symbol for resistance and revolution since their hatless ancestors <b>were</b> <b>too</b> tired from working all day in the sun to revolt. This is a typical example of the bizarre logic the group uses to explain the deeper meanings behind their otherwise crude and base music and images.|$|R
50|$|A straw <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> a brimmed <b>hat</b> that <b>is</b> woven out {{of straw}} or straw like {{materials}} from different plants or synthetics.

60|$|When {{she came}} to the glass cases filled with trimmed hats she remembered having seen upon the heads {{of the women in the}} street similar creations. So she {{selected}} one that suited her fancy and placed it carefully upon her yellow locks. I won't attempt to explain what instinct it was that made her glance into a near-by mirror to see if the <b>hat</b> <b>was</b> straight, but this she certainly did. It didn't correspond with her dress very well, but the poor thing <b>was</b> <b>too</b> young to have much taste in matching colors.|$|R
50|$|Now that <b>hats</b> <b>are</b> {{infrequently}} worn, turbans <b>too</b> <b>are</b> relatively uncommon. They {{are worn}} primarily by women of West Indian descent, Karinas. Some women wear {{them to make}} a statement of individuality, such as the British social entrepreneur Camila Batmanghelidjh, who usually wears a colourful matching turban and robe.|$|R
40|$|Hat {{of green}} velvet. The toque style <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> {{formed as a}} high, {{cylindrical}} crown of olive and light green velvet in a tiny checkerboard pattern. The entire crown, including flattened top, has a small green rhinestone set {{in each of the}} light green squares of the checkerboard. At the front of the <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> a bow of olive green velvet. The entire <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> overlaid with an olive green veil/netting. The <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> lined with green satin, and has an inner hatband of dark olive green grosgrain ribbon inside the base of the crown. Sewn to the inner hatband is manufacturer's label: "Paris / Gardner / New York". The <b>hat</b> <b>is</b> accompanied by a single short hatpin with faux pearl head...|$|R
50|$|Because hard <b>hats</b> <b>are</b> {{intended}} to protect the wearer's head from impacts, <b>hats</b> <b>are</b> made from durable materials, originally from metal, then fiberglass, and most-commonly (from the 1950s onward) rigid plastic.|$|R
