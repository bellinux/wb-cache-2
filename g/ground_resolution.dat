40|$|In this paper, an {{innovative}} technique is presented for {{synthetic aperture radar}} (SAR) <b>ground</b> range <b>resolution</b> improvement using multiple transmit and receive platforms with adequate cross-track displacement. Using orthogonal waveforms, which occupy the same bandwidth in the range frequency domain, for the different platforms of the constellation, a multiple-inputmultiple-output SAR system is configured. The proposed technique allows one to achieve a maximum theoretical range resolution improvement factor that is significantly greater {{than the number of}} operating SAR sensors by jointly exploiting both mono- and bistatic acquisitions. This can be exploited to obtain a <b>ground</b> range <b>resolution</b> that is much higher than the resolution corresponding to the frequency bandwidth transmitted by the single platform.

40|$|This study {{develops}} and assesses {{two methods}} for estimating median surface grain sizes using {{digital image processing}} from centimeter-resolution airborne imagery. Digital images with <b>ground</b> <b>resolutions</b> of 3 cm and 10 cm were combined with field calibration measurements to establish predictive relationships for grain size {{as a function of}} both local image texture and local image semivariance. Independently acquired grain size data were then used to assess the algorithm performance. Results showed that for the 3 cm imagery both local image semivariance and texture are highly sensitive to median grain size, with semivariance being a better predictor than image texture. However, in the case of 10 cm imagery, sensitivity of image semivariance and texture to grain size was poor, and this scale of imagery was found to be unsuitable for grain size estimation. This study therefore demonstrates that local image properties in very high resolution digital imagery allow for automated grain size measurement using image processing and remote sensing method...|$|R

40|$|Aerial cameras {{manufactured}} by Carl Zeiss {{have been successfully}} used {{around the world for}} many decades. Z/IImaging is continuing this tradition with the digital camera system DMC. The DMC uses a modular design to achieve high geometrical resolution together with multispectral capabilities. It comprises a variable number of synchronously operating CCD-matrix based array cameras that can be built together in different configurations. Four parallel cameras can generate multi-spectral R,G,B and Near Infrared imagery for the acquisition of color composites. Four panchromatic images from converging cameras, are mosaiced digitally to form a single high resolution image. The color composite image and the composed panchromatic image have the same ground coverage. The resulting image is based on central perspective view and can be handled by existing photogrammetric workstations. Based on its outstanding electronic Forward Motion Compensation the DMC reaches <b>ground</b> <b>resolutions</b> better than 2 inches.
