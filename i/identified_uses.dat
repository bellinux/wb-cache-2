In non-computing use — for example in mathematics, physics and general typography — the broken bar is not an acceptable substitute for the vertical bar. Aforementioned usages in computing rely on the abstract character with code point 124 (0x7C) in ASCII (or ASCII compatible code page) and do not depend on visual rendering, which actually may be a broken bar in some environments.|$|E
5000|$|In all {{of these}} {{language}} groups, reflexive forms often present an obstacle for foreign learners (notably native speakers of English, where the feature is practically absent) due to the variety of uses. Even in languages which contain the feature, {{it is not always}} applicable to the same verbs and uses (although a common subset can be generally extracted, as outlined below). For example, the Spanish reflexive construct [...] "se hundió el barco" [...] ("the boat sank") has no reflexive equivalent in some Slavic languages (which use an intransitive equivalent of sink), though for example Czech and Slovak do use a reflexive verb: [...] "loď se potopila"/"loď sa potopila".Reflexive verbs can have a variety of uses and meanings, which often escape consistent classification. Some language-common <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> are outlined below. For example, Davies et al. identify 12 uses for Spanish reflexive constructions, while Vinogradov divides Russian reflexive verbs into as many as 16 groups.|$|E

All the same, the question arises how, e.g. the burdens on craftspeople and consumer-related users can be eased without lowering the protection goals, and which simplifications are possible. Where important items of information are lost in the flood of information, intelligent courses of action should be identified and coordinated between the competent authorities and industry. The overarching goals of REACH need to be respected whilst reducing bureaucratic obstacles. In this regard, strategies, e.g. like that of Berufsgenossenschaft der Bauwirtschaft (BG BAU; employers' liability insurance of the construction industry), make interesting starting points; the BG BAU strategy {{is supported by the}} Federal Environment Ministry and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Generic exposure scenarios are another example.|$|E

The analysis revealed 1, 728 substances with unambiguous identity for which 4, 765 DNELs and DMELs for workers were derived. Number and type of DNELs and DMELs depend on the <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> and exposure scenarios submitted with the registration of a substance. In ECHA's public database, the DNELs and DMELs are presented deep within the structure. An easily accessible and searchable source which specifically provides DNELs and DMELs for registered substances was made available by the German social accidence insurance [20]. It {{is not possible to}} conclude whether all DNELs and DMELs required by REACH have been derived because the number of DNELs and DMELs depend on the hazard, the existing exposure and the approach chosen.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a long-term filed data collection system {{from a person}} living house required for designing a life pattern sensor. The life pattern sensor is an activity recognition sensor both for measuring electric power consumption and detecting use of electronic devices by utilizing high-frequency electrical current waveform as a signature of each device. A prototype of the life pattern sensor has been developed and evaluated in five homes. The results show the life pattern sensor measured power consumption within 1 % error and <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> of devices with over 95 % accuracy. The capability of the sensor is enough for realizing home energy management system. The long-term data collection system is constructed so as to collect annotated field data for sophisticating the sensor in practical level. In this paper, the overview of the data collecting system and discussion about the following questions based on the field data: 1. Can current waveform be in stable at any conditions in a house? 2. Can sequence of electronic devices describe residents’ real life pattern? 3. Can residents manage energy efficiently by knowing their own life pattern...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} {{of a number of}} large-scale semantically-rich ontologies for biomedicine attests to the interest of life science researchers and clinicians in Semantic Web technologies. To date, however, the dental profession has lagged behind other areas of biomedicine in developing a commonly accepted, standardized ontology to support the representation of dental knowledge and information. This paper attempts to identify some of the potential uses of dental ontologies {{as part of an effort}} to motivate the {{development of}} ontologies for the dental domain. The <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> of dental ontologies include support for advanced data analysis and knowledge discovery capabilities, the implementation of novel education and training technologies, the development of information exchange and interoperability solutions, the better integration of scientific and clinical evidence into clinical decision-making, and the development of better clinical decision support systems. Some of the social issues raised by these uses include the ethics of using patient data without consent, the role played by ontologies in enforcing compliance with regulatory criteria and legislative constraints, and the extent to which the advent of the Semantic Web introduces new training requirements for dental students. Some of the technological issues relate to the need to extract information from a variety of resources (for example, natural language texts), the need to automatically annotate information resources with ontology elements, and the need to establish mappings between a variety of existing dental terminologies...|$|E

40|$|Information Technology ManagementThis thesis {{examines}} US Army's {{infrastructure for}} data communication in a tactical environment, {{in light of}} anticipated requirements. The {{first part of the}} study covers the nature of this problem; it is a technology forecast for an infrastructure project. This is followed in Chapter II by an examination of the existing infrastructure. This is used as a foundation for the discussion of the Army's approach to determining its future acquisition plan in Chapter III. Chapter IV considers the future use of the network in terms of the types of application programs that are likely to run over the network. Chapter V then considers the communications capacity that will be required simply to establish and operate the network itself. The conclusions are summarized in Chapter VI. The conclusion {{of this study is that}} the optimum future network capacity will greatly exceed the level that would be predicted by extrapolating from currently <b>identified</b> <b>uses.</b> This future level of demand will need to be supported by the network infrastructure, which requires a long lead time and large capital investment to put in place. Because future demand for digital communications will grow so rapidly, an aggressive approach to determining the future network capacity requirement is recommended. In the next ten year period, any capacity available will likely be utilized rapidly resulting in desirable operational and cost saving benefits. Therefore, future capacity should be determined to a large degree by the maximum that it is technically and economically feasible to provide. NAU. S. Army (USA) autho...|$|E
40|$|This {{is the age}} of {{the virtual}} customer. A silent virtual {{revolution}} has led to tumultuous and disruptive changes in environmental, financial, educational, and information environments. As the Library becomes increasingly virtual, it is becoming virtually invisible – as are library customers. Libraries are redefining their roles, managing their migration from the print past to an online future in a time of spiralling costs and declining incomes, redefining their products and services and refocusing on their customers, many of whom they rarely if ever see. How do we position the Library in the marketplace? What is the message to be conveyed to a new generation of customers? What are the information needs to be met? What are the Library’s products and services? What is the story to be told? How are the Library’s products and services most effectively marketed? What communication strategies should be used to bridge the virtual and the real worlds? The paper explores ways in which the Library and its message can be “flipped”. The promotion of goods and services that simplify client experiences is one direction. Less can be more. Ways of rebuilding relationships and establishing rapport with clients are presented. Possible approaches to the development of meaningful engaging content for particular audiences are outlined. Strategies in use by leading edge libraries are <b>identified.</b> <b>Uses</b> of social media in marketing and improving website content are obvious strategies. Designing product and promotional means for mobile devices is an essential component. Collaborating with others and using “influencers” and recommender services will enhance capacity. Ways of making the virtual library visible and telling the story effectively in a largely invisible domain are outlined and transformative strategies explored...|$|E
30|$|The safety {{data sheet}} (SDS) shall enable the {{recipient}} to take the necessary measures to protect the health of workers and the environment. Under current health and safety legislation the SDS is the main information source for employers undertaking risk assessment involving hazardous substances. The legal obligations of article 37 (7) of REACH require those who prepare a CSR to place the relevant exposure scenario in an annex to the SDS. This SDS is called extended {{safety data sheet}} (eSDS). The (e)SDS links legislations of placing chemicals {{on the market and}} worker protection. A CSR has to be provided for specific registered substances only; however, in workplaces, mixtures of substances are commonly used [22]. Therefore, most employers will be confronted with exposure scenarios that apply only for a minority of their workplace chemicals. It is the formulator as the first downstream user who mainly has {{to deal with the problem}} of utilising the exposure scenarios provided in the eSDS, and to consolidate them along with relevant information into SDSs for their products. Exposure scenarios, especially those for the workplace, are likely to be numerous and specific to bespoke processes and business practices. For a widely used solvent with for example 10 <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> often as many as 80 different contributing exposure scenarios are compiled. Many of these exposure scenarios may be quite similar and differ only in minor details. It is difficult to consolidate all of this information into a handful of relevant specifications for safe handling as required in Sections 7 and 8 of the SDS. This is an important issue as the SDS is intended to be a clear and concise document, which takes into account the specific needs and knowledge of the user group.|$|E

The assignment {{was to develop}} one of IDEXX Laboratories new products for urine analysis that is current-ly, only available as a prototype. The goal has been to identify user {{needs to be able}} to design an intuitiveproduct with small margins for error. From the <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> needs, a mission statement was made. “A reliable product that is easy to use and deliver fast results. ”From the identified user needs, research questions for the project were compiled. Those have been:How can the design be made more intuitive for users?How can the functions be integrated into one design the best possible way?How can the design be integrated with IDEXX design guidelines?How can we prevent accidental cuvette spill from the cuvette holder by the users?How can we change the design of the cuvette holder without removing the only one way fit in the instru-ment?Through creative methods such as morphological analysis, brainstorming and Osborn’s checklist, solu-tions for all the six interaction points were developed. These were illustrated by sketches, drawings andCAD models which were then used in the evaluations of the ideas and the concepts. The concepts werefurther developed and down selected to eventually become two final concepts. The first one, Vänorts, is a concept for the instrument door, with buttons, waste drawer and other intuitivesolutions, to make the workflow for the veterinarians easier. The second final concept, Dalälven, is a solution for the Cuvette holder and the holder attachment.

40|$|This {{research}} {{identified and}} evaluated possible uses of environmental monitoring data collected and reported by industrial facilities under the Clean Water Act requirements and determined whether the current regulatory system supported {{any of those}} uses. Federal policies and state-level policies in the United States, Florida, and California were evaluated {{in order to determine}} whether the current regulatory system supported any of the <b>identified</b> <b>uses.</b> Monitoring programs and currently available monitoring data were evaluated from Hillsborough County, Florida, and Los Angeles County, California, from the perspective of 1) the current implementation of the monitoring program, and 2) perfect implementation under full compliance with the monitoring program. Four possible uses for monitoring data were identified by this research: (1) identification of high polluting facilities within a given jurisdiction, (2) assessment of pollutant load to receiving waterbodies, (3) documentat ion of improvement over time in the amount of pollutants discharged from a given industrial facility, (4) self-evaluation purposes, such as identifying on-site pollutant sources, adapting pollution prevention efforts, and evaluating the monitoring protocol. The research conducted a telephone survey and evaluated industrial facilities 2 ̆ 7 reported analytical monitoring data. Telephone questionnaires were administered to 63 industrial facilities, and analytical monitoring data were obtained from industrial facilities in Hillsborough County, Florida and Los Angeles County California. The representativeness, sampling frequency and variation in the industrial facilities 2 ̆ 7 analytical monitoring data do not assist in the identification of high polluting facilities within a given jurisdiction nor provide for documentation of facilities 2 ̆ 7 improvements. Pollutant loads to receiving watebodies can not be assessed through the use of industrial facilities 2 ̆ 7 analytical monitoring data because of the sampl e measurement, variation, and sample frequency of the data.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify and determine how school practitioners, i. e., teachers, guidance counselors, department chairs, principals, district office staff, and school board/citizens, should most practically use norm-referenced test data. The <b>identified</b> <b>uses</b> would then serve as test data usage guidelines for these practitioners in a typical school setting. A Delphi study was designed which named a panel of 27 experts and/or practitioners charged with utilizing norm-referenced test data in schools (Round One). In Round Two of the Delphi procedure, the panel generated a list of 575 practical use statements (by the school job categories listed above) for norm-referenced test data. Of these 575 uses, 102 uses were listed for teachers, 77 for department chairs, 90 for guidance counselors, 108 for principals, 108 for district office staff and 90 for school board/citizens. These 575 uses were condensed to a list of 226 district use statements for test data by the elimination of duplicates. The 226 uses were then sent to the panelists to rate for practical usage on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 being of low practical use and 5 being of high practical use). This process constituted Round Three of the Delphi study. The mean rating score for each test data use was calculated and only those uses that scored a mean rating of 4 or higher were retained for Round Four. In Round Four, these 122 uses were rerated by the panelist for practical usage. In this round, 62 of the 122 were rated with a mean score of four or higher. Of these 62 uses, 8 test data uses were rated with a mean score of 4 or higher for teachers, 8 for department chairs, 8 for guidance counselors, 13 for principals, 14 for district office, and 11 for school board/citizens. Analysis of the findings concluded that (1) there are 62 practical ways in which to use standardized test data, (2) all school personnel can use these data, (3) some uses of standardized test data should be avoided, (4) uses of test data are associated closely with various job categories within a school district, (5) some overlap of test data usage between jobs exists, (6) traditional school job responsibility perspectives fit test data use, and (7) standardized test data should be considered only as one of many tools available for school practitioners' use...|$|E
