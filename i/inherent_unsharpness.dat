40|$|The {{quality of}} images {{generated}} during an infrared thermal inspection depends on many system variables, settings, and parameters {{to include the}} focal length setting of the IR camera lens. If any relevant parameter is incorrect or sub-optimal, the resulting IR images will usually exhibit <b>inherent</b> <b>unsharpness</b> and lack of resolution. Traditional reference standards and image quality indicators (IQIs) are made of representative hardware samples and contain representative flaws of concern. These standards are used to verify that representative flaws can be detected with the current IR system settings. However, these traditional standards do not enable the operator to quantify the quality limitations of the resulting images, i. e. determine the inherent maximum image sensitivity and image resolution. As a result, the operator {{does not have the}} ability to optimize the IR inspection system prior to data acquisition. The innovative IQI described here eliminates this limitation and enables the operator to objectively quantify and optimize the relevant variables of the IR inspection system, resulting in enhanced image quality with consistency and repeatability in the inspection application. The IR IQI consists of various copper foil features of known sizes that are printed on a dielectric non-conductive board. The significant difference in thermal conductivity between the two materials ensures that each appears with a distinct grayscale or brightness in the resulting IR image. Therefore, the IR image of the IQI exhibits high contrast between the copper features and the underlying dielectric board, which is required to detect the edges of the various copper features. The copper features consist of individual elements of various shapes and sizes, or of element-pairs of known shapes and sizes and with known spacing between the elements creating the pair. For example, filled copper circles with various diameters can be used as individual elements to quantify the image sensitivity limit. Copper line-pairs of various sizes where the line width is equivalent to the spacing between the lines can be used as element-pairs to quantify the image resolution limit...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and clinical testing of digital detector designs for mammography are making rapid progress {{and there is}} widespread interest in comparing the performance of these new detectors to that of analogue screen-film mammography systems. In this report, Monte Carlo calculations of the x-ray absorption characteristics (single-event distribution), the quantum absorption, Aq, and detective quantum, DQEq, efficiencies are made and compared to results from the literature. Detectors of CsI and Si of various thicknesses are compared to a state-ofthe art analogue, screen-film system (Gd 2 O 2 S) in the energy range 1 - 35 keV. The results show that 1. 5 mm thick Si detectors {{will have the same}} DQEq as commonly used Gd 2 O 2 S fluorescent screens and that a CsI phosphor of 80 mm has similar DQEq as 1. 0 mm Si. The total DQE (including added noise and <b>inherent</b> detector <b>unsharpness)</b> of fluorescent screen-film systems will be significantly reduced from this value due to the light scatter, film noise and the inherent limitations caused by the film characteristic curve. This indicates that also thinner Si detectors (0. 3 - 0. 5 mm), which do not suffer from these limitations but from a comparably low Aq may have a total performance DQE(f) comparable to that of traditional screen-film based, image detectors...|$|R
