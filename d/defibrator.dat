5000|$|Dr. Arne Asplund (1903-1993) {{invented the}} <b>Defibrator</b> pulping refiner and the defibrator-method (also called Asplund-method) for pulping wooden chips in 1930s. His {{invention}} {{resulted in the}} company AB <b>Defibrator</b> in Stockholm which was merged with Sunds AB to form Sunds <b>Defibrator</b> in 1979.|$|E
5000|$|Sunds <b>Defibrator,</b> a {{maker of}} <b>defibrator</b> {{equipment}} was also part of this merger. It was owned by SCA, Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget. From 1987, Sunds <b>Defibrator</b> had acquired the equipment companies Jylhävaara and Rauma Repola Pulping Engineering, whilst in exchange becoming owned by the overall groups UPM and Rauma-Repola. In 1991, SCA sold the final third of Sunds <b>Defibrator,</b> it becoming wholly owned by Repola Oy. This made it the largest industrial company in Finland.|$|E
50|$|In 1931 the Swedish {{engineer}} Arne Asplund filed {{a patent}} on a method to defibrate wood chips. As opposed to the Masonite-method, the defibrator-method (also known as the Asplund-method) uses pressurised steam to soften the wood chips, then grinding discs to pull the wood fibres apart. This grinding unit is what Asplund called the <b>defibrator.</b> It became the key product of his company, AB <b>Defibrator.</b> The <b>Defibrator</b> trademark is now held by Valmet, the successor of AB <b>Defibrator,</b> for its line of refiners for the panelboard industry.|$|E
50|$|The {{chips are}} then {{compacted}} using a screw feeder, are heated/steamed for 30-120 seconds {{to soften the}} wood, then joined with liquefied wax and fed into a <b>defibrator.</b> The <b>defibrator</b> maintains a {{high pressure and temperature}} while grinding the wood chips into a pulp.|$|E
50|$|From the <b>defibrator,</b> {{the pulp}} enters a blowline, {{where it is}} joined with resin, often urea-formaldehyde. The wax {{improves}} moisture resistance and the resin initially helps reduce clumping, but ultimately is the primary binding agent. The material dries quickly when it enters an expansion chamber and expands into a fine, fluffy and lightweight fibre that is stored until needed at the forming line.|$|E
50|$|Several of the {{companies}} forming {{part of the new}} Valmet Corporation that was born in the 2010's date back to the 19th century. The Karlstad Mekaniska Werkstad (KMW) in Sweden began in 1865. Beloit Corporation began in 1858 as a foundry in the city of Beloit, Wisconsin, US. Sunds Bruk, the predecessor of Sunds <b>Defibrator</b> Industries Ab, was established in Sweden in 1868.|$|E
50|$|Medium-density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) is an {{engineered wood}} product made by breaking down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, often in a <b>defibrator,</b> combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure. MDF is generally denser than plywood. It {{is made up of}} separated fibres, but {{can be used as a}} building material similar in application to plywood. It is stronger and much denser than particle board.|$|E
50|$|Firefly AB is a Swedish {{company in}} the fire safety business. Firefly designs systems that {{prevents}} industrial fires and explosions in industrial processes all over the world. It was spun off from <b>Defibrator</b> AB in 1973. Firefly has two business areas: Industrial applications and Infrasystems (Sentio®). Industrial applications include customized fire prevention systems, which monitor industrial processes {{in areas such as}} woodworking, tissue, food, bioenergy, and recycling. The business area of Infrasystems include fire monitoring of subways, trains, road, and cable tunnels.Firefly supplies products ranging from spark detection and water spray extinguishing to flame detection and water mist suppression.Firefly has been publicly traded since 1997 and is listed on the NASDAQ OMX First North.|$|E
50|$|The <b>defibrator</b> is a thermo {{mechanical}} pulping refiner {{in which}} the pulp material, such as wood chips, is ground {{in an environment of}} steam between a rotating grinding disc (rotor) and a stationary disc (stator) each with radial grooves that provides the grinding surface. Wood chips are fed into the centre and are broken down as the centrifugal force pushes them towards the circumference of the discs where the grooves are finer to produce wood fibre. The size of the refined fibres can to some extent be controlled by altering the distance between the discs where a closer distance produces finer fibres but also requires higher grinding force. The capacity per machine is largely determined {{by the size of the}} machine, as well as the motor speed 1500 rpm or 1800 rpm.|$|E
30|$|Although {{the effect}} of {{digester}} conditions, <b>defibrator</b> disc distance, and tree species on the dimensional stability and mechanical properties of MDF {{used in this study}} has been investigated by Benthien et al. [6], the wettability of the MDF panels has not determined. Based on the extensive literature search, there has not been any research on {{the effect of}} digester conditions and <b>defibrator</b> disc distance on the wettability of MDF. In this study, the effect of digester conditions, <b>defibrator</b> disc distance, and wood species on the wettability of MDF was investigated.|$|E
40|$|<b>Defibrator</b> of {{vertical}} working of wood chip nemalining and milling is investigated in this work. The principle of <b>defibrator</b> operation is described and principal and functional schemes are given. Diagnostic investigation of defibrators operation parameters {{was carried out}} changing expenditure of <b>defibrator</b> steam and influencing different unacceptable factors. The obtained results of measurements are summarised and its analysis is done. The more optimal work regimes of the investigated system are determined, that are secured the most productivity of work of searching system maximum by getting results of the analysis. Interdependence of work parameters of investigated mechanism is determined...|$|E
30|$|The {{wettability}} of the MDF decreased {{with increasing}} <b>defibrator</b> disc distance. The contact angle values (5  s) of the MDF specimens at the 0.06, 0.15, and 0.60  mm <b>defibrator</b> disc distance {{were found to}} be 78.6 °, 86.4 °, and 95.2 °, respectively. There were significant differences in the wettability (5  s) values of the MDF panels produced from the fibers at the <b>defibrator</b> disc distances of the 0.06, 0.15, and 0.60  mm. However, {{there were no significant differences}} between 0.15 and 0.60  mm distances at 10 and 30  s measurement intervals. Since the 5  s contact angle value of the MDF panels produced from the fibers at the <b>defibrator</b> disc distances of the 0.60  mm was above 90 °, its wettability was poor as compared to the 0.06 and 0.15  mm distances. The amount of fine fibers significantly increased with decreasing disc distance (Fig.  1).|$|E
30|$|Three {{series of}} wood fibers were {{produced}} in the experiments. In the first series, the wood fibers were produced from different wood species. In the second series, the wood fibers were produced at different digester conditions. In the third series, the wood fibers were produced at different <b>defibrator</b> disc distances. Typical images of fibers produced from scots pine fibers produced at different <b>defibrator</b> disc distances are presented in Fig.  1. The experimental design is given in Table  1.|$|E
30|$|This {{research}} work {{showed that the}} surface wettability of MDF panels was significantly affected by the digester conditions, <b>defibrator</b> disc distance, and the wood species. The wettability of the MDF decreased with increasing the <b>defibrator</b> disc distance. At the same digestion conditions and <b>defibrator</b> disc distance, the highest wettability (the lowest contact angle) {{was found in the}} MDF specimens produced with beech wood, followed by poplar wood, birch wood, scots pine/beech wood, and scots pine wood, respectively. The increment in the severity of the digestion conditions improved the wettability of the specimens, which resulted in a decrement in the contact angle values. The better wettability of MDF panels would contribute to the improvement of the bondability between MDF panel and water-soluble UF resin, thus to improved performances of the products. The findings of the present study can be also used by the MDF manufacturers, which produce paintable MDF panel for furniture industry.|$|E
30|$|Wettability {{of medium}} density {{fiberboard}} (MDF) surface affects paint or adhesive application and is, thus, of importance {{in the course of}} furniture manufacturing. This study investigated the effects of wood species, digester conditions and <b>defibrator</b> disc distance on the wettability properties. It was found that the wettability of the MDF significantly decreased with increasing the <b>defibrator</b> disc distance and increased with the increment in the severity of the digestion conditions. The highest wettability was found for samples made of beech wood having an average contact angle value of 74.5 °, followed by poplar wood (76.5 °), birch wood (79.7 °), the mixture (1 : 1) of scots pine and beech wood (82.9 °), and scots pine wood (86.4 °), respectively.|$|E
30|$|An {{analysis}} of variance, ANOVA, was conducted (p[*]<[*] 0.05) {{to evaluate the}} effect of wood species, digester conditions, and <b>defibrator</b> disc distance on the wettability of the MDF panels. Significant differences between the average values of the MDF types were determined using Duncan’s multiple range test.|$|E
40|$|Elongation at {{failure is}} an {{important}} but underrated functional property of paper. Traditionally, elongation has been of specific importance for sack and bag paper grades. Mechanical treatments at high consistency are known to induce fibre deformations {{that contribute to the}} elongation of paper. However, it is not clear to what extent different fibre deformations can improve the elongation of paper. The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of three mechanical treatments on fibre and paper properties. The wing <b>defibrator,</b> the E-compactor, and the Valley beater were used for treating chemical softwood pulp. It was found that the type and intensity of mechanical treatments significantly affect the formation of fibre deformations, and thus the resulting properties of paper. The combination of high-consistency wing <b>defibrator</b> treatment and subsequent low-consistency valley beating provided paper with high elongation potential and good strength properties without impairing the dewatering properties...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of addition of abraded fiber, as a partial substitute of softwood fibers, on the properties of insulating fiberboard. The fiber used was characterized by fractional composition of fiber length according to McNett (STN 50 0289) using the apparatus for the measurement of fiber length in aqueoussuspension (ADV) and according to Brecht-Holl (STN 50 0289) by the determination of water retained by fiber, speed of dewatering and <b>defibrator</b> seconds. Insulating fiberboards were prepared with different content of abraded fiber. Mechanical properties (bending strength and tension strength perpendicular to the board plane) {{as well as physical}} properties (swelling, water uptake, thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity specific heat and volumetricspecific heat) were measured for the boards...|$|E
30|$|The {{defibration}} {{process is}} one of the significant parameters in the production of dry-processed fiberboard. The parameters of the digester conditions, such as press temperature, time, pressure, and <b>defibrator</b> disc distance, significantly affect the wood fiber properties [6 – 8]. In the MDF manufacture, digesting and refining conditions play important function to produce fibers of target quality. These manufacturing conditions affect the physical and mechanical properties of the MDF panel. In a previous study, Benthien et al. [7] reported that digester and defibration conditions, as well as raw material properties affect wood fiber characteristics and thereby the physical and mechanical properties of MDF. It was concluded that wood species, digester conditions, and grinding disc distance are the most influential parameters on the fiber quality.|$|E
30|$|At {{the same}} {{digestion}} conditions and <b>defibrator</b> disc distance, the highest wettability (the lowest contact angle) {{was found in}} the MDF specimens produced with the fibers of beech wood, followed by poplar wood, birch wood, scots pine/beech wood, and scots pine wood, respectively. The camera captures of the MDF specimens produced by scots pine wood fibers (MDF type A 1) and the specimens produced from beech wood fibers (MDF type C 1) are presented in Fig.  2. There was no significant differences in the contact angle values of birch and poplar MDF specimens, while this was not observed for other species. The anatomical and chemical properties of wood significantly affect the morphological characteristics of the fiber surface, which affect the wettability of the wood fiber [16]. Mantanis and Young [10] reported that the separation of the middle-lamella during the pulping process for beech wood should be less of a rupture, since the lignin had less cross-links and therewith could contribute to a smoother surface roughness. This could partly explain that the MDF panels produced from beech wood fibers had the highest wettability among the MDF types. The results showed that decreasing fiber length positively affected the wettability of the MDF specimens.|$|E
40|$|By {{replacing}} coal with renewable fuels, such as wood, {{the consumption}} of coal {{and the amount of}} fossil fuel emissions can be reduced. The wood fuels need however processing before combustion in pulverized fuel firing boilers. The aim of this work is to study the applicability of the DustComb-process as a pretreatment method for wood fuels. The principle of the DustComb-process is to defibrate the woody feedstock with a mechanical <b>defibrator,</b> and the produced fines are dried with a flash dryer integrated into the process. The dried fines are either fed into a pulverized fuel burner or stored for later use. In this work, the co-firing of biomass in a pulverized coal boiler is discussed, and the principles of mechanical defibration and flash drying are explained. In the experimental part of this study, the influence of the disc clearance on the defibrator’s specific energy consumption is determined. The disc clearance in the defibration tests are varied between 0. 60 and 1. 80 mm. Also the effect of the particle size on the drying rate is studied. In the calculations part, the costs of producing the DustComb-fuel are estimated and their dependence on the market price of electricity, the price of heat, and the price of the feedstock are evaluated. The costs are further compared with the market prices of coal and wood pellets. The experimental results show that the energy consumption of the defibration starts to increase rapidly when the disc clearance is narrowed from 1. 00 mm. According to the test results, the studied particle size changes do not have any remarkable effect on the drying rate of the material. A significant observation is that a great amount of the wa-ter in the wood is evaporated already during the defibration (16 – 25 % of the initial moisture). The calculation results show that the production of the DustComb-fuel is economically viable when compared to the price of coal, and especially when com-pared to the price of wood pellets. The results also show that the costs of the energy needed for the DustComb-process are low compared to the price of the raw material...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work was to study the {{possibilities}} of radical formation in wood fiber surfaces to enable direct fiber-to-fiber adhesion by radical-based reactions {{in the manufacture of}} fibreboard, particularly medium-density fiberboard (MDF). The fibers were produced by defibration at high temperatures. Radical formation was achieved by treatment with laccase, treatment with Fenton's reagent, or gamma-irradiation. High-temperature defibration was found to cause cleavage of interunit beta-aryl ether linkages of lignin, resulting in formation of mechanoradicals and phenolic hydroxyl groups. The proportion of water-extractable low-molecular weight lignin and hemicelluloses present in the fibers increased with an increase in defibration temperature. In the laccase treatment of fibers in water suspension, much more radicals were formed in hardwood than in softwood fibers for fibers produced at equal temperature. Radical formation increased with increasing defibration temperature. The treatment of fibers with Fenton's reagent in water suspension resulted in the formation of similar numbers of radicals in hardwood and softwood fibers. Radical formation increased with increasing defibration temperature but not so drastically as with laccase treatments. Also the gamma-irradiated fibers contained large numbers of radicals. Their content increased as a function of increasing defibration temperature and was higher for hardwood than for softwood fibers. The internal bond strength (IB) of fiberboards made from fibers treated with laccase or Fenton's reagent in the <b>defibrator</b> blowline improved with increasing defibration temperature. The IB of boards made from laccase-treated fibers correlated with the number of radicals formed in the fibers on laccase treatment in water suspension, indicating that adhesion in the boards was largely due to reactions of radicals on the fiber surfaces. The IB of boards made from fibers treated with Fenton's reagent also correlated with the radical content of the fibers, but this relationship was not as strong as with the laccase treatments. This suggests that bonding mechanisms other than radical coupling may have contributed significantly to adhesion. Gamma-irradiation of fibers before their fabrication into boards resulted in a marked increase in board IB, indicating that radicals {{play a significant role in}} the adhesion of boards made from gamma-irradiated fibers. reviewe...|$|E
