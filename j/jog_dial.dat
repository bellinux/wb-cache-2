40|$|Over {{one billion}} people own or use {{cellular}} mobile telephones. Therefore, industry practitioners {{are faced with}} a question: how big steps can they take when designing the user interfaces for their new products, or how closely should they stick with the already existing user interface conventions that may already be familiar to the consumers. The objective of this research work is to create and communicate new knowledge for design and usability practitioners about how to design and evolve interaction style conventions in mainstream, voice-centric mobile telephones. In the context of this study, interaction style denotes the framework consisting of the physical interaction objects, the abstract interaction elements, and the associated behavior or interaction conventions that are applied throughout the core functionality of the mobile phone, but excludes the stylistic appearance elements of the user interface. The main research problem — how do mobile phone interaction style changes affect the initial usability of a mobile phone for users with earlier experience with mobile phones — is approached via several methods. A literature study compares the interaction styles applied in mainstream computing domains against the aspects relevant in the mobile phones domain. A heuristic analysis of contemporary mobile phones is used to formulate an understanding of the available interaction styles and analyze whether there is convergence towards specific types of interaction styles in the industry. An empirical usability testing experiment with 38 test users is conducted with a novel mobile phone interaction style to investigate differences between users who are already familiar with different mobile phone interaction styles. The study reveals that interaction styles applied in contemporary mobile telephones are designed around menu navigation, and they implement the three primary operations — Select, Back and Menu access — with dedicated hardkeys, context-sensitive softkeys, or using special control devices like joysticks or <b>jog</b> <b>dials.</b> The control keys in the contemporary interaction styles are converging around various two- and three-softkey conventions. The aspects related to indirect manipulation and small displays pose specific usability and UI design challenges on mobile phone user interfaces. The study shows that the mobile handset manufacturers are applying their usually proprietary interaction styles in a rather consistent manner in their products, with the notable exception of mobile Internet browsers that often break the underlying interaction style consistency. Based on the results from the empirical usability testing, we claim that despite differences between interaction styles in contemporary mobile phones, users do not face significant difficulties when transferring to a novel mobile phone model. reviewe...|$|R
50|$|The first Pioneer {{player to}} have a <b>Jog</b> <b>Dial,</b> (although Technics {{were the first to}} feature a <b>jog</b> <b>dial</b> in 1986 with the SL-P1200), {{allowing}} for cueing of the CD unlike rack-mounted CD players that were common at the time. It included a loop function, as well as loop-out adjust, and other facilities associated with looping samples from the track being played. The pitch control was +/- 10% only, and Master Tempo allowed the pitch to be locked despite tempo changes being made.|$|E
5000|$|E series {{developed}} the user's interface(UI) {{based on the}} stability and the color reproducing up to the exterior design. With the finder and <b>jog</b> <b>dial,</b> the brightness can be easily adjusted and the LED lamp indicating the warning of [...] "Over-charged" [...] which can be recognized visibly was added.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>jog</b> <b>dial,</b> jog wheel, shuttle dial, or shuttle {{wheel is}} a type of knob, ring, wheel, or dial which allows the user to shuttle or jog through audio or video media. It is {{commonly}} found on models of CD players which are made for disc jockeys, and on professional video equipment such as video tape recorders. More recently, they are found on handheld PDAs, and as the scroll wheel on computer mice. [...] "Jog" [...] refers to going at a very slow speed, whereas [...] "shuttle" [...] refers to a very fast speed.|$|E
5000|$|Power Console (PI-PD7) - An {{unreleased}} cockpit-sized controller that attaches {{onto the}} SuperGraph unit itself, connecting via the expansion port {{on the front}} side. The peripheral would've added numerous control options such as an eight-way joystick, four action buttons, a flight yoke with two triggers (one on each handle), a throttle lever, a <b>jog</b> <b>dial,</b> three mode switches, an LCD panel, an LED indicator, four additional controller ports and a numerical keypad. The Power Console {{was scheduled to be}} released in Spring 1990 with a suggested retail price of 59,800 yen, but was never released due to its high production cost and the poor sales of the SuperGrafx itself.|$|E
5000|$|Pioneer {{introduced}} the CLD-D703 {{to provide a}} [...] "stop gap" [...] model to fit in between the CLD-D503, a lower mid-range player, and the more expensive, prior models in their Elite lineup. Although lacking an AC-3 RF output for transmission of Dolby Digital sound, it did include many high-end features including a 51db video signal-to-noise ratio, 116db audio signal-to-noise ratio, quick Gamma-Turn side flip, Digital Field Memory (allowing for freeze frame and slow motion options on CLV discs), One Shot Memory (for displaying a frame as a background), coaxial and TOSLINK audio outputs, adjustable digital noise reduction, digital time base correction, twin 1-bit DLC digital-to-analog converters, and a backlit remote control with <b>jog</b> <b>dial</b> (CU-CLD098). This model is also a combi player, meaning it could also play Compact Disc and CD video via an independent standard CD-sized tray. For 1995, Pioneer upgraded the player, adding the AC-3 RF output and rebadging it as the CLD-D704. Other than an AC-3 RF output, the player largely remained the same. However, the 703 can be modified with an aftermarket AC-3 RF circuit for Dolby Digital capability. The optical TOSLINK output provides the 703 with full DTS audio capability with LDs carrying such tracks to any DTS-equipped AV receiver or processor. The unit also possesses excellent, [...] "sync-to-play" [...] capability with older LDs bearing the LaserVision and DiscoVision label.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work we introduced Total Recall, {{a system for}} in-place viewing of captured whiteboard annotations using a handheld display. To improve on our system we now introduce a method for navigating through time-based whiteboard annotations using a <b>jog</b> <b>dial.</b> By turning the dial, the user can navigate {{back and forth in}} time to reach a desired point in the captured session, which is then displayed on the handheld device at the correct location. The tracking system supports drawing as well as erasing, which are both immediately reflected on the handheld display. We argue that our system introduces new application possibilities, e. g. in education...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to realise an {{interface}} between a digital music source such as a CD player or a computer and a turntable. The overall work during this research was signal processing. One of the main parts {{of the project was}} a discovery of the CD players' signals and characteristics and a discovery of the characteristics of the vinyl disc and the turntable {{in order to determine the}} project specifications. To realise the project, many compromises had to be made in order to solve every problem as well as possible. The first part of the project was the realisation of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the vinyl saw tooth signal in order to determine the bandwidth of four saw tooth signals with different frequencies given that a saw tooth is composed of a fundamental and several harmonics. The {{aim of the}}se measurements is to determine which signal is the most suitable for the realisation of the project. Then the work is focused on the vinyl disc signal in order to determine precisely the speed of rotation and the direction of rotation of the vinyl disc. And the final part is the generation of the signal which simulates the CD player <b>jog</b> <b>dial</b> (or wheel) signal. The detection of the direction of rotation is now working correctly and the generation of the CD player <b>jog</b> <b>dial</b> signals is possible. The last part which has not been completely achieved during the project is the accurate detection of the speed of rotation of the vinyl disc. This project is an on-going personal investigation into DJs system that is why this work will continue after the Master's projectSchool of Computing, Communications and Electronic...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{examined}} {{the strengths and}} weaknesses of three diverse scroll control modalities for photo browsing on personal digital assistants (PDAs). This exploration covered nine alternatives in a design space that consisted of three visual interfaces and three control modalities. The three interfaces were a traditional thumbnail layout, a layout that placed a single picture on the screen at a time, and a hybrid that placed one large photo in the center of the display, while also displaying a row of neighboring thumbnails at the top and bottom of the screen. In a user experiment we paired each of these interfaces with each of the following three scroll control modalities: a <b>jog</b> <b>dial,</b> a squeeze sensor, and an on-screen control that was activated by tapping with a stylus. We offer a simple model that classifies our experiment's interfaces by how much they provide visual context within the photo collection. The model also classifies the scroll modalities by how tightly they correlate scroll input actions to effects on the screen. Performance and attitudinal results from the user experiment are presented and discussed. ...|$|E
