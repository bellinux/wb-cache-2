As formal language is extremely important in diplomacy, the connotations of most alternative terms were found to be inappropriate, and so taikun was chosen to best represent the shogun in formal diplomatic communications.|$|R

5|$|Fearing <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> {{guarantee}} {{the integrity of}} the polling places, Clayton canceled fall elections in counties where political violence had broken out.
