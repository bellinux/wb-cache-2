At <b>first</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> a presence of the Central Security Force, then army troops who were ordered into major cities to quell street fighting.

5|$|The Eighteenth Dynasty tombs {{within the}} valley vary {{quite a bit}} in decoration, style, and location. It seems that at <b>first</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> no fixed plan. The tomb of Hatshepsut has a unique shape, {{twisting}} and turning down over 200metres from the entrance, so that the burial chamber is 97metres below the surface. The tombs gradually became more regular and formalised, and those of Thutmose III and Thutmose IV, KV34 and KV43, are good examples of Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, both with their bent axis, and simple decoration.|$|E
5|$|The report {{suggests}} two hypotheses for the accident. In the <b>first,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{a flaw in}} {{the power}} control of the plane's engines, which would have kept one of the thrust levers into acceleration, regardless of their actual position. In such circumstances, there was mechanical failure of the aircraft. However, the occurrence of this failure is one in 400 billion hours of flight and therefore highly improbable. In the second hypothesis, the pilot has performed a procedure different from that provided in the manual, and put the thrust lever in an irregular position, a configuration of human error for the accident.|$|E

5|$|At <b>first,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> {{only one}} {{political}} party of any consequence in Indiana, the Democratic-Republicans. The party was, however, broken into three divisions {{that would later}} split off into their own parties. The divisions were mainly {{over the issue of}} slavery, but they would develop more differences in later years. The Jennings party, made up of abolitionists, was dominant in the beginning. The Noble party was in favor of slavery, and the Hendricks party was generally neutral, although Hendricks himself was openly anti-slavery. In 1818, the Noble party tried to impeach Governor Jennings over his role in the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary's. After two months of debate in the House, and Jennings having destroyed the evidence of his role, the House of Representatives dropped the investigation and issued a resolution that confirmed Jennings in his position as governor.|$|E
5|$|With the new consensus, {{the major}} issues {{concerning}} Poland and Germany were settled in {{the second week of}} February 1815. Austria gained land in the partition of Poland and prevented the Prussian annexation of Saxony, but was forced to accept Russian dominance in Poland and increasing Prussian influence in Germany. Metternich now focused on getting the various German states to cede historic rights to a new Federal Diet that could stand up to Prussia. He also assisted the Swiss Committee and worked on a myriad of smaller issues, like navigation rights on the Rhine. The beginning of Lent on 8 February brought him more time to devote to these congressional issues as well as private discussions about southern Italy, where Joachim Murat was said to be raising a Neapolitan army. On 7 March Metternich was awakened with the news that Napoleon had escaped from his island prison of Elba and within an hour had met with both the Tsar and the King of Prussia. Metternich wanted no rash change of course, and at <b>first</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> little impact on the Congress. Finally, on 13 March the Big Five declared Napoleon an outlaw and the Allies began preparations for renewed fighting. On 25 March they signed a treaty committing each to sending 150,000 men with little sign of their prior divisive stances. After the military commanders left, the Vienna Congress settled down to serious work, fixing the boundaries of an independent Netherlands, formalising proposals for a loose confederation of Swiss cantons, and ratifying earlier agreements over Poland. By late April only two major issues remained, the organisation of a new German federation and the problem of Italy.|$|E

However no law ever prescribed a specific design for use, as a result several designs are in use by various government departments.|$|E

The 984 covered a huge area, out to hundreds of kilometers against high-flying targets, but was very large.|$|E

25|$|Under the Community, the European Parliament (formerly the European Parliamentary Assembly) had an {{advisory}} role to the Council and Commission. There {{were a number}} of Community legislative procedures, at <b>first</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only the consultation procedure, which meant Parliament had to be consulted, although it was often ignored. The Single European Act gave Parliament more power, with the assent procedure giving it a right to veto proposals and the cooperation procedure giving it equal power with the Council if the Council was not unanimous.|$|E
25|$|OPP’s {{research}} revealed {{two significant}} factors; <b>first,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> unlimited demand for {{products and services}} of these family units.

At <b>first,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only one hut at the samadhi, but in 1924 two huts, one opposite the samadhi and the other to the north, were erected. The so-called Old Hall was built in 1928. Ramana lived there until 1949.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the constitutional basis for establishing an institution for women, several other factors came into play. <b>First,</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> an extensive need for qualified public school teachers, a career path assumed to be especially attractive to women. Also, there was overwhelming evidence that {{the public school system}} in North Carolina was among the worst in the nation. For example, the average national expenditure per student enrolled in the public schools was $17.62, but North Carolina spent only $3.36 per student. Similarly, the average national length of the school year was 135 days, but it was only 60 days in North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The {{year before}} he started composition, Wagner had {{abandoned}} his first attempt at writing an opera, Die Hochzeit (The Wedding). There {{were a number of}} difficulties facing new German-language opera in the 1830s. <b>First</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> deemed to be a lack of good quality libretti to set. This may have influenced Wagner's decision to write the libretto for Die Feen himself. Second, there was a fear among the authorities in Germany and Austria that the performance of operas in German would attract nationalist and revolutionary followers. This would have added to the difficulties faced by a novice composer seeking an opportunity for his new opera to be performed.|$|E
