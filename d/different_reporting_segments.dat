40|$|Alcohol {{consumption}} {{is becoming an}} increasingly important social marketing target in the Asia Pacific region as recognition of the true cost to the community of alcohol consumption increases. This paper examines data from a national {{survey conducted by the}} Australian Bureau of Statistics to uncover differences in household expenditure on alcohol among various segments of the Australian market. Our analysis indicates that 58 percent of households reported spending a total of $ 9. 41 billion on alcohol annually. The data revealed important differences in both propensity to spend money on alcohol and the proportion of total expenditure on goods and services among <b>different</b> demographic <b>segments.</b> <b>Reported</b> expenditure on alcohol had the greatest impact on household expenditure in those which were headed by a male whose occupation was of a lower social status and who was either born in Australia or came from an English-speaking background. These groups provide priority targets for media and message strategies. 8 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of <b>segment</b> <b>reporting</b> is grounded on {{the presumption of}} diversities of returns and risks across <b>reported</b> <b>segments.</b> We {{examine the effect of}} country-specific factors, reporting incentives, and choices on an ANOVA-based measure of cross-segment diversities (CSD) in risk and returns for a sample of Japanese and U. S. multi-segment firms. We find that, in contrast to our expectations, Japanese firms exhibit greater CSD than U. S. firms. Moreover, we find that in both countries CSD is driven especially by reporting incentives associated with profitability and foreign sales, but not by proprietary costs. Further, the manager's choice of the number of <b>reported</b> <b>segments</b> is an important factor affecting CSD.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{integrated}} approach to discriminate news reporting from {{everything else in}} broadcast news data based on both audio and visual information. The separation of news <b>reporting</b> <b>segments</b> from others not only can provide useful indices for video streams but {{also serves as a}} pre-processing step for tasks such as speaker identi#cation and speech recognition so that only speech segments are passed on for further processing. A set of audio and visual features are adopted that aim at capturing the intrinsic properties of the underlying classes. Four types of classi#ers #threshold, fuzzy, Gaussian Mixture Model based, and Support Vector Machine# are tested. Some of the experimental results arepresented and discussed in the paper. 1 Introduction Extracting news <b>reporting</b> <b>segments</b> is an important task. For example, to obtain transcription from automated speech recognition #ASR# or to recognize a speaker from speech signals, it is more e#cient to #lter out the non-speech or no [...] ...|$|R
