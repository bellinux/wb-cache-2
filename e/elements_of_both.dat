50|$|Western Neo-Platonism is an {{essential}} <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Christian contemplation and mysticism, and of Western esotericism and modern spirituality, especially Unitarianism, Transcendentalism, Universalism and Perennialism.|$|R
25|$|While {{community}} {{service is a}} major <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the World Organization of the Scout Movement and World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts programmes, Girl Guides include it as an extra <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the Scout method.|$|R
5|$|On {{the night}} of July 2, all of the {{remaining}} <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> armies had arrived: Stuart's cavalry, George Pickett's division, and John Sedgwick's VI Corps. The stage was set for the bloody climax of the three-day battle.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} partnership {{was formed}} between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca {{to develop the}} Adour afterburning turbofan engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both.</b> The new engine, which {{would be used for}} the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier's, Reasons of State (El recurso del método, 1974), is a {{synthesis}} of several historical figures from Latin American, most prominently Gerardo Machado, dictator of Cuba. This fictional character, in his bid to be refined, spends half {{of his life in}} Europe, perhaps reminiscent of Sarmiento's dichotomy of civilization and barbarism. This novel is tragicomic in nature, the only novel by Carpentier to combine <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> tragedy and comedy.|$|E
50|$|Given subspaces U and W of a {{vector space}} V, then their {{intersection}} U ∩ W := {v ∈ V : v is an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> U and W} {{is also a}} subspace of V.|$|R
50|$|The {{ideal of}} the Imitation of Christ has been an {{important}} <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Christian ethics and spirituality. References to this concept and its practice are found in the earliest Christian documents, e.g. the Pauline Epistles.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{cultural}} identity {{is a crucial}} <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> social and individual self-descriptions, especially in post-colonial societies and literatures. This article examines its importance for (Anglo-) Irish poetry in the twentieth century, using a selection of texts by W. B.

5|$|An {{example of}} a {{developing}} nation establishing its own model of emergency medicine {{may be seen in}} southern Brazil. <b>Elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> of the major conventional models have been incorporated, with the EMS system following French influences and the ambulances being staffed by physicians, while an American approach to emergency medical residency training is also present.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by 80s arcade {{games and}} more recent titles of the time, such as Super Metroid and Super Mario 64, Jet Force Gemini blends <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> shoot 'em up and action-adventure games. Works such as Aliens, Stargate and Battle of the Planets were also major influences. The game {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Praise {{was given to}} its detailed graphics and satisfying gameplay, while criticism was levelled at the game's difficult controls and insistence on having to save every Tribal to fully complete the game. In 2015, Jet Force Gemini was included {{as part of the}} Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Music of Turkey {{includes}} mainly Turkic {{elements as}} well as partial influences ranging from Central Asian folk music, Arabic music, Greek music, Ottoman music, Persian music and Balkan music, {{as well as}} references to more modern European and American popular music. The roots of traditional music in Turkey span across centuries {{to a time when}} the Seljuk Turks migrated to Anatolia and Persia in the 11th century and contains <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Turkic and pre-Turkic influences. Much of its modern popular music can trace its roots to the emergence in the early 1930s drive for Westernization.|$|E
50|$|Choosing a {{research}} {{question is the}} central <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> quantitative and qualitative research {{and in some cases}} it may precede construction of the conceptual framework of study. In all cases, it makes the theoretical assumptions in the framework more explicit, most of all it indicates what the researcher wants to know most and first.|$|R
50|$|The London Sinfonietta {{consciously}} aims to {{blur the}} boundaries between an artistic experience and an educational one, acknowledging that much of its work—whether on the platform or off—embraces an <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both.</b> This results in an innovative strand of collaborative work with young artists, enabling the ensemble to introduce its music to new audiences and partners.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an unaccustomed view of F. Chopin, {{from the point}} of view of his contemporary F. Liszt. The aim of the thesis is to become acquiantant with Liszt´s both personal and professional perspective on Chopin. The thesis attemps to discover connections between Liszt´s opinion on Chopin and his own life experience and career, artistic conviction and apprehension of society at that time. It enables to take a look into cogitation of a 19 th century´s music genius and particulary its goal is to describe the human <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> the artists...|$|R
5|$|The {{approach}} quickly {{caught on}} in Chicago. In 1889 the Tacoma Building replaced the bolted metal design with a stronger riveted approach, and Chicago's Chamber of Commerce Building introduced interior light courts to the structural design of skyscrapers. The 1890 Rand McNally Building became {{in the first}} entirely self-supporting, steel-framed skyscraper. Some buildings, such as The Rookery and the Monadnock Building, combined <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the newer and older styles, but generally Chicago rapidly adopted steel structures as a flexible and effective way to produce a range of tall buildings. Structural engineers specializing in the steel frame design began to establish practices in Chicago.|$|E
5|$|The main tournament {{combined}} <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> previous WBC editions. The {{first round}} was split all teams into fourpools, where the teams competed in a round-robin, {{as was the}} case in the 2006 tournament. The second round used the same modified double-elimination format as used in the 2009 tournament and the 2013 qualifying tournament. The final round was contested in the same manner as both previous tournaments: the top two teams from each group in the second round qualifying for the two semi-final matches, the winners of which played in the championship game.|$|E
5|$|Tropical cyclone {{forecasting}} also {{relies on}} {{data provided by}} numerical weather models. Three main classes of tropical cyclone guidance models exist: Statistical models are based on an analysis of storm behavior using climatology, and correlate a storm's position and date to produce a forecast that {{is not based on}} the physics of the atmosphere at the time. Dynamical models are numerical models that solve the governing equations of fluid flow in the atmosphere; they are based on the same principles as other limited-area numerical weather prediction models but may include special computational techniques such as refined spatial domains that move along with the cyclone. Models that use <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> approaches are called statistical-dynamical models.|$|E
5|$|The {{principles}} of Scouting describe {{a code of}} behavior for all members, and characterize the movement. The Scout method is a progressive system designed to achieve these goals, comprising seven elements: law and promise, learning by doing, team system, symbolic framework, personal progression, nature, and adult support. While community service is a major <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the WOSM and WAGGGS programs, WAGGGS includes it as an extra <b>element</b> <b>of</b> the Scout method: service in the community.|$|R

40|$|The {{conquest of}} native ruled Wales, {{completed}} by Edward I (1272 - 1307) was the pivotal {{event in the}} history of medieval Wales. One important, but often overlooked, <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Edward's victory and his subsequent military enterprises was the role of Welsh soldiers in his armies. This piece serves as an introduction to their role and to the effects of military service on Welsh society in this period...|$|R
5|$|While Lazzell is most {{well known}} for her white-line woodcuts, she also created ceramics, hooked rugs, paintings, and gouache studies. The {{subjects}} of her paintings and prints included landscape scenery and harbor scenes in Provincetown as well as flowers and still lifes. These and her abstract works incorporated <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Synthetic and Analytic cubism and frequently comprised arrangements of vibrantly colored geometric shapes. She was among the earliest women artists in the United States {{to work in a}} modernist style.|$|E
5|$|It {{was while}} {{operating}} off the Iberian Peninsula that Collier devised {{a need for}} an improved type of ships' boat. He developed a design based on <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> a whaleboat and a jolly boat, and had one built for him at Plymouth Dockyard. The boat proved extremely useful after tests aboard the Surveillante, especially at being able to land safely on a flat beach to give close support. Collier further modified it by installing a howitzer in the bows, and soon boats of its type were being requested by other captains for their ships. In 1813 Collier succeeded Sir Home Popham in commanding the north coast squadron, Spain. He and a small squadron supported General Arthur Wellesley and General Sir Thomas Graham in the capture of San Sebastián and the siege of Bayonne.|$|E
5|$|The new {{classical}} school {{culminated in}} real business cycle theory (RBC). Like early classical economic models, RBC models assumed that markets clear and that business cycles {{are driven by}} changes in technology and supply, not demand. New Keynesians tried to address many of the criticisms leveled by Lucas and other new classical economists against Neo-Keynesians. New Keynesians adopted rational expectations and built models with microfoundations of sticky prices that suggested recessions could still be explained by demand factors because rigidities stop prices from falling to a market-clearing level, leaving a surplus of goods and labor. The new neoclassical synthesis combined <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> new classical and new Keynesian macroeconomics into a consensus. Other economists avoided the new classical and new Keynesian debate on short-term dynamics and developed the new growth theories of long-run economic growth. The Great Recession led to a retrospective {{on the state of}} the field and some popular attention turned toward heterodox economics.|$|E
50|$|Some authors {{hold that}} the young girl {{at the foot of}} the tree is based on an ancient {{fertility}} symbol of the Indian Subcontinent. Yakshis were important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient Buddhist archaeological sites. They became Salabhanjikas (sal tree maidens) with the passing of the centuries, a standard decorative <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Indian sculpture and Indian temple architecture.|$|R
5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians argue that one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. Others argue that magic was an important <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|R
25|$|The Hirshhorn is sited {{halfway between}} the Washington Monument and the US Capitol, {{anchoring}} the southernmost end of the so-called L’Enfant axis (perpendicular to the Mall’s green carpet). The National Archives/National Gallery of Art Sculpture Garden across the Mall, and the National Portrait Gallery/Smithsonian American Art building several blocks to the north, also mark this pivotal axis, a key <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> the 1791 city plan by Pierre L’Enfant and the 1901 MacMillan Plan.|$|R
5|$|Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie {{have argued}} that modern Ethiopian studies were an {{invention}} of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars {{to the understanding of}} Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> uncertain extraction and negroid origin.|$|E
5|$|On 9 April, the Germans {{continued}} their advance, and all <b>elements</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> divisions of LI Infantry Corps had finally unloaded in Graz. In view of German success, the Italian 2nd Army in north-eastern Italy accelerated its preparations and issued orders for its V and XI Corps to conduct preliminary operations {{aimed at improving}} their starting positions for the planned attack on Yugoslavia. In the meantime, the 7th Army continued rapidly withdrawing its right wing, while withdrawing its centre and keeping the Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski in place on its left flank. The 38th Infantry Division Dravska continued to withdraw south from Ptuj through Krapina towards Zagreb, while the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and Mountain Detachment Triglavski fell back to the southern bank of the Krka river. Units of LI Infantry Corps crossed the Drava along the line Maribor—Ptuj and further east, and continued to expand their bridgehead south of Maribor. Elements of XLIX Mountain Corps secured the southern exit of the Karawanks railway tunnel near Jesenice and expanded their bridgehead at Dravograd. Italian units made several attacks on the weakened sector of the 32nd Infantry Division Triglavski and against Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski, and Detachment Lika took up positions on the coast. On the same day, the 6th Air Reconnaissance Group airfield at Cerklje was again attacked by German aircraft.|$|E

40|$|The {{compositional}} {{style of}} Samuel Zyman's two flute works, Concerto for Flute and Small Orchestra and Sonata for Flute and Piano, is examined through formal and stylistic analyses, {{as well as}} interviews with the composer and with the flutist who commissioned both works, Marisa Canales. The two Neo-Romantic works make use of clear formal structures, such as sonata allegro and rondo forms. These traditional structures are greatly expanded, mainly {{through the use of}} highly active and extended development sections. Rhythmic drive is an essential <b>element</b> <b>of</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these works. These aspects, along with highly contrapuntal writing, cyclical elements, and the expansive use of melody allow for two very cohesive but complex works. Modal inflection also adds a very original and interesting musical flavor to the works...|$|R
