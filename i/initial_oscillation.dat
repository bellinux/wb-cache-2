40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{convergence}} {{behavior of}} the Møller]Plesset MP perturbation series is investigated utilizing MP correlation energies up to order 65 calculated at the. full CI FCI level. Fast or slow convergence, <b>initial</b> <b>oscillations,</b> or divergence of the MPn series depend on the electronic system investigated and the basis set used for the FCI calculation. <b>Initial</b> <b>oscillations</b> in the MPn series are observed for systems with electron clustering {{due to the fact}} that MP theory exaggerates electron-correlation effects at even orders and corrects this at odd orders. In such cases, it is important that the s, p basis is first saturated before diffuse functions are added. With a VDZ q diff basis, too much weight is given to high-order correlation effects described by pentuple and higher excitations, which leads to the formation of artificial intruder states and to the divergence of the MPn series. This can be corrected by extending to VQZ or VPZ basis sets before one adds diffuse functions. Alternatively, one can use m-order Feenberg scaling to exclude backdoor intruder states from the convergence region of the MPn series. For all cases considered, divergence of the MPn series caused by unbalanced basis sets including diffuse functions can be suppressed by Feenberg scaling.

40|$|We {{show that}} the phase of the {{spectrum}} of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) is immune {{to the effects of}} nonlinear evolution. This suggests that any new physics that contributes to the initial phase of the BAO spectrum, such as extra light species in the early universe, can be extracted reliably at late times. We provide three arguments in support of our claim: First, we point out that a phase shift of the BAO spectrum maps to a characteristic sign change in the real space correlation function and that this feature cannot be generated or modified by nonlinear dynamics. Second, we confirm this intuition through an explicit computation, valid to all orders in cosmological perturbation theory. Finally, we provide a nonperturbative argument using general analytic properties of the linear response to the <b>initial</b> <b>oscillations.</b> Our result motivates measuring the phase of the BAO spectrum as a robust probe of new physics.

40|$|Abstract: We {{describe}} diffraction for rapidly oscillating, periodically modulated nonlinear waves. This phenomenon arises {{for example}} when considering long-time propagation, or through perturbation of <b>initial</b> <b>oscillations.</b> We show existence {{and stability of}} solutions to variable coefficient, nonlinear hyperbolic systems, together with 3 -scales multiphase infinite-order WKB asymptotics: the fast scale is that of oscillations, the slow one describes the modulation of the envelope, which is along rays for the oscillatory components, and the intermediate one corresponds to transverse diffraction. It gives rise to nonlinear Schrödinger equations on a torus for the profiles. The main difficulty resides {{in the fact that}} the coefficients in the original equations are variable: thus, phases are nonlinear, and rays are not parallel lines. This induces variable coefficients in the integro-differential system of profile equations, which in general is not solvable. We give sufficient (and, in general, necessary) geometrical coherence conditions on the phases for the formal asymptotics to be rigorously justified.

40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} a simple Levi {{compatibility}} condition determines stability of WKB solutions to semilinear hyperbolic initial-value problems issued from highly-oscillating initial data with large amplitudes. The compatibility condition involves the hyperbolic op-erator, the fundamental phase associated with the <b>initial</b> <b>oscillation,</b> and the semilinear source term; it states roughly that hyperbolicity is preserved around resonances. If the compatibility condition is satisfied, the solutions are defined over time intervals independent of the wavelength, and the associated WKB solutions are stable under a large class of initial perturbations. If the compatibility condition is not satisfied, resonances are exponentially amplified, and arbitrarily small initial perturbations can destabilize the WKB solutions in small time. The amplification mechanism {{is based on the}} observation that in frequency space, res-onances correspond to points of weak hyperbolicity. At such points, the behavior of the system depends on the lower order terms through the compatibility condition.

40|$|To {{measure a}} microflow rate and to {{accelerate}} the reaction between proteins by an unbalanced impingement of feedback flow, we have proposed and verified {{the design of a}} self-flapping microfluidic oscillator. Three specific features-the large aspect ratio of the micronozzle, the structure of the sudden-expansion inlet, and the asymmetric feedback channels-are developed to induce stable oscillation. The large aspect ratio of the micronozzle diminishes the influence of viscous force, and the inlet structure triggers flow instability. The conjunction of both factors promotes the occurrence of the Coanda effect, and initiates oscillation. The asymmetric feedback channels produce an unbalanced impingement of the inlet flow, thus reinforcing the <b>initial</b> <b>oscillation</b> to become stably periodic. Beyond the function of a microflowmeter, the oscillatory characteristics are applicable {{to accelerate the}} biochemical reaction between two fluorescent proteins, B-phycoerythrin and an allophycocyanin alpha subunit.

40|$|We {{study the}} damping of {{longitudinal}} oscillations of a prominence thread {{caused by the}} mass accretion. In this model we considered a thin curved magnetic tube filled with the plasma. The parts of the tube at {{the two sides of}} the thread are filled with hot rarefied plasma. We assume that there are flows of rarefied plasma toward the thread caused by the plasma evaporation at the magnetic tube footpoints. Our main assumption is that the hot plasma is instantaneously accommodated by the thread when it arrives at the thread, and its temperature and density become equal to those of the thread. Then we derive the system of ordinary differential equations describing the thread dynamics. We consider linear and nonlinear oscillation. The nonlinearity reduces the damping time, however this reduction is small. The damping time is inversely proportional to the accretion rate. We also obtain that the oscillation periods decrease with time. However even for the largest <b>initial</b> <b>oscillation</b> amplitude considered in our article the period reduction does not exceed 20 %. We conclude that the mass accretion can damp the motion of the threads rapidly. Thus, this mechanism can explain the observed strong damping of large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations. In addition, the damping time can be used to determine the mass accretion rate and indirectly the coronal heating. Comment: Accepted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics {{of atomic}} and {{molecular}} bright solitons in a hybrid atom-molecular BEC (Bose Einstein Condensate) system of 85 Rb coupled through Magnetic Feshbach Resonance (MFR) has been investigated. By solving the time independent atom-molecular coupled equations, the initial atomic and molecular wavefunctions were obtained and {{the dynamics of}} the initial atomic and molecular waves in a spherical one-dimensional trap were studied by solving the time-dependent atom-molecular coupled equations. During evolution two types of induced or stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules were switched on. These two types of stimulated decays of the feshbach molecules to the two-atom continuum and to the bound level of the lowest hyperfinee state of the molecule were induced by laser or Radio Frequency fields. Hence the strength of these two induced decays can be controlled by varying the laser or RF field parameters e. g. intensity, detuning etc. It is found that depending on the relative strength of these two types of stimulated or induced decays initial atomic and molecular waves assume solitonic nature as bright solitons during evolution and the stability of these solitonic waves can be achieved by controlling the relative strength of induced decays in two different channels. It is shown that these two induced decays lead to the formation of stable atomic and molecular solitons by suppressing the <b>initial</b> <b>oscillations</b> and instability in the atom-molecular coupled system of 85 Rb atoms.
