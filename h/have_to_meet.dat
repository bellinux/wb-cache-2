5|$|Some breeders {{have shown}} concern {{regarding}} {{the lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed due to inbreeding caused by a small gene pool. Researchers who completed the 2007 DNA {{study found that the}} Singapura (along with the Burmese) have the least genetic diversity among the 22 breeds studied. The possibility of outcrossing with another breed to increase the genetic diversity had been raised among CFA breeders, but not many were receptive to the idea, preferring to use Singapuras from around the world that are not so closely related to the CFA line. In April 2013, UK's Governing Council of the Cat Fancy started allowing outcrossing for the breed. Individuals chosen <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> certain health and appearance requirements.|$|E
5|$|The JV6 engines {{used in the}} Jaguar racing {{cars were}} {{produced}} by Swiss engineer Max Heidegger, but delivering the number of engines required for the XJ220 program was considered beyond his capacity. TWR formed a division, TWR Road Engines, to manage the design, development, construction and testing of the engines for the production cars. The JV6 engine used in the XJ220 featured little commonality with the engines Heidegger built {{for use in the}} XJR racing cars, being specifically engineered to meet performance and in particular, the European emissions requirements, which the race engines didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after the 1969 debut of Sesame Street on PBS in the US, {{producers}} from Brazil, Mexico, Canada, Iran and Germany requested that the organization responsible for the show's production, the Children's Television Workshop (CTW), create and produce versions of Sesame Street in those countries. Even before the American show's debut, the CTW established an international division, which oversaw its licensing in other countries. According to Gregory J. Gettas, the division immediately developed four main licensing policies: (1) Like the American version, all foreign versions had to be broadcast without commercials; (2) any changes would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> high production standards, which protected the CTW's proprietary interests; (3) all versions had to reflect the country's cultural values and traditions; and (4) all changes would have to be approved, initiated, and supervised by a local committee working with the CTW.|$|E

(3) Von Neumann 2 ̆ 7 s answer: it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the precision and reliability of computers criterion, the single error criterion (i. e. addressing the impacts of errors) and the distinction between analogue and digital computers criterion.

5|$|In 1872, the Dole Gudbrandsdal {{was split}} into two types - a class for heavier {{agriculture}} and driving horses and a class for lighter racing and riding horses. In 1875, the Norwegian Trotting Association was formed by enthusiasts of the second type. In 1902, the first Dole Gudbrandsdal stud book was published, containing stallions from both types born between 1846 and 1892. In 1903, the Norwegian Trotting Association split their registration between purebred Norwegian trotters and trotting crosses. At the same time, standards for entry were tightened and the first inspection committee was created. In 1965, the Norwegian or Dole Trotter studbook {{was taken over by}} the Norwegian Trotting Association, as part of the new Coldblood trotter program approved by the Norwegian Ministry for Agriculture. The Dole Trotter studbook is still coordinated with the original Dole Gudbrandsdal registry, and horses <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> many of the same standards. The Dole Trotter is alternately considered a subtype of the Dole Gudbrandsdal and a separate breed.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, including installation of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E

25|$|Primary education, {{normally}} {{starting at}} age seven, is a four-year foundation stage (Primary 1 to 4) and a two-year orientation stage (Primary 5 to 6).

However, parents <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> the requirements set out by the Ministry of Education before these exemptions are granted.

25|$|Hedge {{funds are}} {{structured}} to avoid most direct regulation (although their managers may be regulated) {{and are not}} required to publicly disclose their investment activities, except to the extent that investors generally are subject to disclosure requirements. This is in contrast to a regulated mutual fund or exchange-traded fund, which will typically <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> regulatory requirements for disclosure. An investor in a hedge fund usually has direct access to the investment adviser of the fund, and may enjoy more personalized reporting than investors in retail investment funds. This may include detailed discussions of risks assumed and significant positions. However, this high level of disclosure is not available to non-investors, contributing to hedge funds' reputation for secrecy, while some hedge funds have very limited transparency even to investors.|$|E
