He {{was accused of}} {{suspicious}} correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perronet was helpful is unknown: Perronet, as a bishop, would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> {{the activities of the}} Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.|$|E
5|$|The {{long-term}} success of implants is determined, in part, {{by the forces}} they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support.</b> As implants have no periodontal ligament, there is no sensation of pressure when biting so the forces created are higher. To offset this, the location of implants must distribute forces evenly across the prosthetics they support. Concentrated forces can result in fracture of the bridgework, implant components, or loss of bone adjacent the implant. The ultimate location of implants is based on both biologic (bone type, vital structures, health) and mechanical factors. Implants placed in thicker, stronger bone like that found in the front part of the bottom jaw have lower failure rates than implants placed in lower density bone, such as the back part of the upper jaw. People who grind their teeth also increase the force on implants and {{increase the likelihood of}} failures.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

25|$|By a {{bilateral}} treaty signed in Stockholm on 3 March 1813, Sweden promised the British {{that they would}} make a common front against Napoleon's France. In return, the British would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the ambitions of Stockholm on Norway.

25|$|Newman {{believed}} {{in a middle}} way between free thinking and moral authority – one that would respect the rights of knowledge {{as well as the}} rights of revelation. His purpose was to build a Catholic university, in a world where the major Catholic universities on the European continent had recently been secularised, and most universities in the English-speaking world were Protestant. For a university to claim legitimacy in the larger world, it would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> research and publication free from church censorship; however, for a university to be a safe place for the education of Catholic youth, {{it would have to be}} a place in which the teachings of the Catholic church were respected and promoted.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{a history}} of disputed and {{lopsided}} land sales, there were strict laws in place regarding the sale of lands by the Native Americans. This handcuffed them {{from being able to}} support themselves when they had no other means of generating income, such as in old age or to settle their debts. On this subject, Timothy lobbied the government during the winter of 1763-1764 and wrote to Andrew Oliver in November 1764, asking that they be allowed the same rights to sell their lands as the English. By this time, most citizens on both sides, including Timothy Woodbridge, were in favor of creating a separate township for the Native Americans and the Woodbridge family and friends. However, when the commissioners proposed that the English would then <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> their own school and church, without the mission funding, the proposal was almost universally opposed by the English.|$|E
25|$|At {{least part}} of the novel may have been autobiographical. In 1802, the Reverend Harris Bigg Wither of the Church of England {{proposed}} marriage to Austen, which she declined. The reaction of her family is not known as after Jane's death in 1817, her letters from the year 1802 were burned by her family, but it is likely that her father who was anxious to get his daughter married off so that he would cease to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> her would have been one of great disapproval. In Mansfield Park, Sir Thomas Bertram harshly lectures Fanny Price for refusing the marriage proposal of Henry Crawford, telling her she was being disgracefully selfish in not marrying a man she did not love, but who would have brought great material advantages. The novel ends with Price being vindicated in rejecting Crawford as supremely unsuitable husband material. Austen's sister Cassandra Austen wanted the novel to end with Price marrying Crawford, and this dispute {{is one of the few}} known between the sisters. The American scholar John Halperin also noted that Austen's mother loved all of her novels except Mansfield Park, which he suggests may have been in part because of the similarities between Sir Thomas and her husband. Another additional autobiographical influence might be Austen's brother, Charles Austen who served as a Royal Navy officer during the Napoleonic wars. In the novel, Fanny's brother William joins the Royal Navy as an officer, whose ship, the HMS Thrush is sited right next to the HMS Cleopatra at Spithead. Captain Austen commanded the HMS Cleopatra during her cruise in North American waters to hunt French ships from September 1810 to June 1811, and assuming that the same HMS Cleopatra that had just arrived back in Spithead in the novel is the same HMS Cleopatra commanded by Captain Austen would date the main's events of the novel to 1810–1811. Likewise, the gift that William gives Fanny of an amber cross echoes the gift of a topaz cross given by Captain Austen to his sister Jane before he set sail to the Royal Navy's North America station based in Halifax and Bermuda.|$|E

2500|$|Margaret {{was born}} in England around 1615, likely {{migrating}} to the colonies with her parents. From the status of her future husband, it is most probable {{that they were a}} lower class family. The first record of her in America is her marriage to Benjamin Scott in 1642. They had seven children, though only three survived to adulthood. (It was then a common perception that witches had difficulty rearing children.) The town of Rowley granted Benjamin land in 1664. Shortly after, he was declared a freeman. A man by the same name (presumably the same man) was fined and [...] "admonished" [...] for theft. Benjamin died in 1671, leaving an estate of only 67 pounds and 17 shillings, which would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Margaret and her family {{for the rest of her}} life, as she never remarried.
