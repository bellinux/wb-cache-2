5|$|The {{average age}} of the Politburo's members was 58 years in 1961, and 71 in 1981. A similar <b>greying</b> also took place in the Central Committee, the median age rising from 53 in 1961 to 62 in 1981, with the {{proportion}} of members older than 65 increasing from 3 percent in 1961 to 39 percent in 1981. The difference in the median age between Politburo and Central Committee members {{can be explained by the}} fact that the Central Committee was consistently enlarged during Brezhnev's leadership; this made it possible to appoint new and younger members to the Central Committee without retiring some of its oldest members. Of the 319-member Central Committee in 1981, 130 were younger than 30 when Stalin died in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The {{dogs have}} blue, liver or sandy colouration, {{all three of}} which may have tan points. Bedlingtons carry {{what is known as}} the <b>greying</b> gene, a {{dominant}} trait carried on the G locus. This gene causes puppies born with black or dark brown fur to lighten to grey or liver with age. The fur of the Bedlington creates a shape on the top of the dog's head known as a topknot. Although most modern breed standards call for the dog's topknot to be lighter than its body, when the breed was first being formed there was at least one prominent breeder, Mr. Pickett, who believed that the topknot should be darker, not lighter.|$|E

25|$|The ageing of Europe, {{also known}} as the <b>greying</b> of Europe, is a {{demographic}} phenomenon in Europe characterized by a decrease in fertility, a decrease in mortality rate, and a higher life expectancy among European populations. Low birth rates and higher life expectancy contribute to the transformation of Europe's population pyramid shape. The most significant change is the transition towards a much older population structure, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of the working age while the number of the retired population increases. The total number of the older population is projected to increase greatly within the coming decades, with rising proportions of the post-war baby-boom generations reaching retirement. This will cause a high burden on the working age population as they provide for the increasing number of the older population.|$|E

[...] Andrew Mitchell, the British envoy who was with them, and normally wrote positively about Frederick, attributed Frederick's loss to the contempt he had for Daun's supposedly cautious nature and his unwillingness to give credit to intelligence that did not agree with what he imagined was true: according to Mitchell, {{there was no one to}} blame but himself. That winter, Mitchell described the 46-year-old Frederick as [...] "an old man lacking half of his teeth, with <b>greying</b> hair, without gaiety or spark or imagination."

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to advance new rules about {{operations}} of <b>grey</b> numbers.

Findings – Up to now, the operation of general <b>grey</b> numbers has been transformed to operation of real numbers; thus, the difficult problem for set up operation of general <b>grey</b> numbers has been solved to a certain degree. Practical implications – The method exposed in the paper can be used to integrate information from a different source.

Fisher opines that because of his tireless war work, Formby had become too synonymous with the war, causing the public to turn away from him, much as they had from the wartime British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill. Bret believes that post-war audiences wanted intrigue, suspense and romance, through the films of James Mason, Stewart Granger, David Niven and Laurence Olivier. Bret also indicates that Formby's cinematic decline was shared by similar performers, including Gracie Fields, Tommy Trinder and Will Hay. Formby's biographers, Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, opine that in his late 40s, Formby [...] "was <b>greying</b> and thickening out", and was too old to play the innocent young Lancashire lad.
