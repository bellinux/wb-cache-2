500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. Then I saw him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
2500|$|A Royal North-West Mounted Police {{investigation}} {{began after}} word reached Fort Norman that Inuit {{had been seen}} wearing the priests' clothing, {{and the two men}} surrendered themselves without incident in May 1916. Part of Uloqsaq's police statement read, [...] "I wanted to speak; Ilogoak [...] put his hand over my mouth... Ilogoak pointed the gun at us. I was afraid and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying...</b> Sinnisiak said to me 'We ought to kill these white men before they kill us.'" [...] Partly due to a previous incident with similar circumstances following which no action was taken, the authorities wished to make an example out of the two Inuit men, and Sinnisiak was tried in Edmonton for the murder of Rouvière, largely because it was thought that Sinnisiak had been the 'ringleader'. He was found not guilty because the jury thought that the Inuit man had cause to kill the priest.|$|E
2500|$|La Toya Jackson ended her estrangement {{with the}} entire Jackson family and {{returned}} home to Hayvenhurst. Jackson forgave her parents for her stifled upbringing reasoning, [...] "I've {{come to realize that}} as we get older, we grow and learn a lot more. And I think that my father and my mother, they raised children the best way they know how." [...] According to La Toya, Michael knew that she was forced to attack him in the press against her will and he did not blame her. [...] "He never held any of that against me, I remember when I'd got away from this total hell I'd been through where I'd been beaten, abused, controlled and forced to say those terrible things about Michael, which I didn't for a moment believe, he held out his arms and just hugged me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> saying: 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.' He just held me tight and said: 'I am your brother, I always knew it wasn't you saying those words." ...|$|E
60|$|LADY WINDERMERE. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying,</b> for <b>I</b> have {{something}} to tell you, Arthur.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} I {{can say that}} I will do that. It {{is not for the}} {{property}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying.</b> <b>I</b> hope you don't think that of me, Mr. Walker." ...|$|R
60|$|He wrung my hand, {{and taking}} up his hat, went {{straight}} out of the room without looking back, without a tear or a quiver or a pause, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying</b> like a baby.|$|R
60|$|I {{went on with}} my hair now, quite comfortably. I sobbed {{a little}} still, but that was because I had been crying, not because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> then.|$|E
60|$|MRS WARREN. Don't {{tell her}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying.</b> [Vivie comes in. She stops gravely on seeing Mrs Warren, who greets her with hysterical cheerfulness]. Well, dearie. So {{here you are}} at last.|$|E
60|$|Percy strode up {{and down}} the room. Once or twice he stopped before me, as if he would speak, but he did not. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> freely now, and I could not look up at him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Alas!" [...] she answered; [...] "no {{wonder that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying,</b> seeing that <b>I</b> {{have lost the}} basket of cake that was to help me to get safely to the cave of the Fairy of the Desert." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They <b>are</b> wet, and <b>I</b> did {{not know}} it! It is hard to me to cry in sorrow, but I can <b>cry</b> for joy. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying</b> because it has all come right, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so much afraid that it never would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Minnie and I never quarrel. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying</b> {{because we}} can't have the school {{decorated}} on Monday for the examination, after all. The Dickeys {{have gone back}} on us ... after promising, too," [...] and the tears began to swell up in the blue eyes again.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} between us, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> and I believe, at heart, {{he was crying}} too. At last he dropped my hand, and seemed to change back, by an effort, to his former calmness.|$|E
6000|$|... "My poor girl," [...] said I, laying my {{face against}} her forehead, for indeed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> too, and trembling, [...] "it seems cruel to trouble you now, but more depends on our knowing {{something}} about this letter than I could tell you in an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} he said. I know that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> and that he kissed me. It {{was the first time}} in his life. I know that he was pleased,--beyond measure pleased. After a while he became animated, and talked of doing ever so many things. He promised that very {{painting}} of which you spoke." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Crying!" [...] Of course <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying,</b> and <b>I</b> {{guess you}} would <b>be</b> <b>crying,</b> [...] too, [...] If people were telling such stories as they tell about me, about YOU. [...] Oh yes, you can laugh if you want to, and smoke as you didn't care [...] how, [...] And get your brains {{softened}} like uncle's. Dr. Jones says you're [...] gettin' it now.|$|R

6000|$|Why can't {{they let}} a girl marry three men, or {{as many as}} want her, and save all this trouble? But this is heresy, and I must not say it. I am glad to say that, though <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> I was able to look into Mr. Morris' brave eyes, and I told him out {{straight}} [...] .|$|E
60|$|That was {{a dismal}} day. It began to rain soon after Sara left {{and it just}} poured. I never saw a soul all day except the milkman, and I was really frantic by night. I never was so glad of {{anything}} as when I heard Sara's step on the verandah. I flew {{to the front door}} to let her in--and there was Walter all dripping wet--and his arms were about me and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> on the shoulder of his mackintosh.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{might have}} been quite ineffectual; still it might {{possibly}} have done good. But now--really, Agnes," [...] he said, stopping short, [...] "I don't know what to do: it is a dreadful affair. There, don't distress yourself, my child"--for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> now--"matters {{may not be as}} bad as we fancy, although I confess that I do not see any possible interpretation which can put the affair in a better light. The only question is, what is to be done? ...|$|E

60|$|MARCHBANKS (in wild alarm). Stop: it's not fair. You mustn't {{show her}} that you suffer, Morell. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> on the rack, too; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>crying.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "`Here <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> Provost,' <b>cried</b> a stout, active young fellow; {{something}} {{like what the}} captain must have been when he <b>was</b> young, <b>I</b> should think!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{discipline}} at Christ's Hospital in my {{time was}} ultra-Spartan;--all domestic ties were to be put aside. [...] "Boy!" [...] I remember Bowyer saying to me once when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> {{the first day of}} my return after the holidays, [...] "Boy! the school is your father! Boy! the school is your mother! Boy! the school is your brother! the school is your sister! the school is your first cousin, and your second cousin, {{and all the rest of}} your relations! Let's have no more crying!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, when I am miserable I am {{just too}} miserable for words. I've sat and cried {{for days and}} days at Smith's College, and the other girls were just crazy to know what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> about, and {{guessing}} what the reason was that I wouldn't tell, when all the time the real true reason was that I didn't know myself. You know how it comes like a great dark shadow over you, and you don't know why or wherefore, but you've just got to settle down to it and be miserable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{how do you}} do, Miss Mitchell!" [...] exclaimed {{the other}} Ida with shy pleasure. [...] "Come in. I didn't know you were in town. It's real {{good of you to}} come and see me. And just see what I've had sent to me! Isn't it a beauty? I was so {{surprised}} when it came--and, oh, so glad! I was feeling so blue and lonesome--as if I hadn't a friend in the world. I--I--yes, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> when that cake came. It has just made the world over for me. Do sit down and I'll cut you a piece. I'm sure you're as fond of fruit cake as I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, then!" [...] I flung her Mark's letter. There wasn't {{anything}} {{in it that}} it was sacrilege to let another person see. That was one reason why <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>crying.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Only nervousness," [...] said Marian. [...] "How did {{you find}} out that <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> <b>crying?</b> it <b>was</b> only for an instant, because Nelly annoyed me. Does my face shew it?" ...|$|R
30|$|The {{most extreme}} {{emotions}} {{came out of}} me. A lot of crying, and crying {{to the point of}} hyperventilation. I’d come home - all I’d do <b>was</b> <b>cry</b> all night. I’d go to work - <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> <b>crying</b> at work (Joanna).|$|R
6000|$|... 21st.--A busy day. We go to Appletreewick to-morrow. Paying {{bills and}} packing up. All poor William's new canvases and painting-things huddled {{together}} into a packing-case. He looked so sad, sitting silent with his green shade on, while his old familiar working materials were disappearing around him, as if he and they were never to come together again, that the tears would start into my eyes, though I am sure I am {{not one of the}} crying sort. Luckily, the green shade kept him from seeing me: and I took good care, though the effort nearly choked me, that he should not hear <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> at any rate.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought of}} the oddest things. Of {{the shape of the}} room, of the cracks in the ceiling, of the paper on the walls, of the flaws in the window-glass making ripples and dimples on the prospect, of the washing-stand being rickety on its three legs, and having a discontented {{something}} about it, which reminded me of Mrs. Gummidge {{under the influence of the}} old one. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying</b> all the time, but, except that I was conscious of being cold and dejected, I am sure I never thought why I cried. At last in my desolation I began to consider that I was dreadfully in love with little Em'ly, and had been torn away from her to come here where no one seemed to want me, or to care about me, half as much as she did. This made such a very miserable piece of business of it, that I rolled myself up in a corner of the counterpane, and cried myself to sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{went up to}} the bedside, and I {{followed}} him. She {{was lying}} with her face hidden away from us on the pillow, just as it was when I left her. The doctor says to me, 'Don't disturb her, don't let her look round, so that she can see us--I'm going to call to her.' And he called 'Mary' out loud, twice; and she never moved. The third time he tried her, it was with such a shout {{at the top of his}} voice, that the landlady come up, thinking something had happened. I was looking over his shoulder, and saw that my dear child never started in the least. 'Poor little thing,' says the doctor, quite sorrowful, 'this is worse than I expected.' He stooped down and touched her, as he said this; and she turned round directly, and put out her hand to have her pulse felt as usual. I tried to get out of her sight, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>crying,</b> and didn't wish her to see it; but she was too sharp for me. She looked hard in my face and the landlady's, then in the doctor's, which was downcast enough; for he had got very fond of her, just as everybody else did who saw much of little Mary.|$|E
5000|$|Armen Kouptsios' father {{watched the}} scene of his execution. Chrysostomos invited Armen's father in the episcopate in order to comfort him. Armen's father said to bishop [...] "I <b>am</b> not <b>crying</b> for losing my son. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying</b> for you, because you lost your henchman." [...] In World War I, in 1916, when Bulgarians came back to Drama, they arrested Armen's father, they {{tortured}} him and then they let him die inside a well. Bulgarians also, cut the plane tree, to leave no memories of the sacrifice to the younger Dramins.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{remember}} it {{at any other}} time in my life. Is it trouble? How can I tell?--I have had so little trouble. It must be many years since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> wretched enough to cry. I don't even understand why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>crying</b> now. My last sorrow, so far as <b>I</b> can remember, <b>was</b> the toothache. Other girls' mothers comfort them when they are wretched. If my mother had lived--it's useless to think about that. We lost her, while I and my sister were too young to understand our misfortune.|$|R
6000|$|... "However, it {{was very}} ill taken of me. All over that Thuringian region <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>cried</b> out upon as a headstrong foolish person: The Herr Graf von Werthern, so ran the story, had of his own kindness, without request of mine, offered me a living; RARA AVIS, {{singular}} instance; and I, rash and without head, flung away such gracious offer. In short, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told to my face [by good-natured friends], Nobody would ever think of me for promotion again;"--universal suffrage giving it clear against poor Linsenbarth, in this way.|$|R
