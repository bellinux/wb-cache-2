40|$|The M ≥ 6 {{earthquakes}} {{occurred in}} the South-North Seismic Belt, Mainland China (longitudes from 98 - 107 °E and latitudes from 21 - 41 °N) during 1900 - 2016 are taken to measure the multifractal dimensionsspatial distribution and time sequence of events and the dominant periods. The multifractal dimensions, Dq, are measured from the log-log plots of Cq(r) versus r and Cq(t) versus t, where Cq(r) and Cq(t) are the generalized correlation integrals for the epicentral distribution and time sequence of events, respectively. r and t are the epicentral distance and inter-event time, respectively, at positive q. The log-log plot of Cq(r) versus r shows a linear por­tion when log(rl) ≤ log(r) ≤ log(ru). The rl and ru values are, respectively, 120 and 560 km <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6 events, 100 and 560 km <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6. 5 events, and 63 and 560 km <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 7 events. The rl value decreases with the lower-bound magnitude. Dq monotonically decreases with increasing q. The Dq values are between 1. 618 and 1. 426 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6 events, between 1. 562 and 1. 108 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6. 5 events, and between 1. 365 and 0. 841 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 7 events. The log-log plot Cq(t) versus t show a linear distribution when log(tl) ≤ log(t) ≤ log(tu), where tl and tu are, respectively, 5 and 50. 1 years <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6 events, 5 and 50. 1 years <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 6. 5 events, and 16 and 63. 1 years <b>for</b> <b>M</b> ≥ 7 event, thus sug­gesting that the time sequences of earthquake in the study region are multifractal.

The Morlet wavelet technique is applied to analyze the dominant periods of temporal variations in num­bers of yearly earthquakes for the three magnitude ranges, i. e., M ≥ 6, M ≥ 6. 5, and M ≥ 7.

5|$|Advances {{during the}} last decades {{has led to the}} recent {{approval}} of several oral drugs. These drugs are expected to gain in popularity and frequency of use at the expense of previously existing therapies. Further oral drugs are still under investigation, the most notable example being laquinimod, which was announced in August 2012 to be the focus of a third phase III trial after mixed results in the previous ones. Similarly, Other studies are aimed to improve efficacy and ease of use of already existing therapies through the use of novel preparations. Such is the case the PEGylated version of interferon-β-1a, that has a longer life than normal interferon and therefore it is being studied if given at less frequent doses has a similar efficacy than the existing product. With the completion of a robust two-year study, it is shown that the PEGylated interferon beta-1a has greater efficacy in decreasing relapse rate and disability progression compared to placebo <b>for</b> <b>MS</b> patients.|$|E

40|$|We {{carried out}} wide-field BVI CCD {{photometric}} {{observations of the}} GCs M 3 and M 13 using the BOAO 1. 8 m telescope equipped with a 2 K CCD. We present CMDs of M 3 and M 13. We have found AGB bumps at V = 14. 85 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 at V = 14. 25 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13. It is found that AGB stars in M 3 are more concentrated near the bump, while those in M 13 are scattered along the AGB sequence. We identified the RGB bump of M 3 at V = 15. 50 and that of M 13 at V = 14. 80. We have estimated the ratios R and R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 and M 13 and found that of R <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 is larger than that <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13 while R 2 's <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 and M 13 are similar when only normal HB stars are used in R and R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13. However, we found that R's <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 and M 13 are similar while R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 is larger than that <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13 when all the HB stars are included in R and R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13. We have compared the observed RGB LFs of M 3 and M 13 with the theoretical RGB LF of Bergbusch & VandenBerg at the same radial distances from the cluster centers as used in R and R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 and M 13. We found "extra stars" belonging to M 13 in the comparison of the observed RGB LF of M 13 and the theoretical RGB LF of Bergbusch & VandenBerg. In the original definition of R of Buzzoni et al., N(HB) corresponds to the lifetime of HB stars in the RR Lyrae instability strip at log T_eff = 3. 85. So, the smaller R value resulting <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13 compared with that <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 in the case where only normal HB stars are included in R and R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13 may be partially caused by "extra stars", and the similar R's <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 and M 13 in the case where the all HB stars are included in R and R 2 <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 13 {{may be caused by}} "extra stars" in the upper RGB of M 13. If "extra stars" in the upper RGB of M 13 are caused by an effective "deep mixing" these facts support the contention that an effective "deep mixing" could lead to different HB morphologies between M 3 and M 13 and subsequent sequences.

5|$|Monoclonal antibodies, {{which are}} drugs {{of the same}} family as natalizumab, have also raised high levels of {{interest}} and research. Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments <b>for</b> <b>MS.</b> Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E

After the breakout he awaits his trial in a new prison, this one controlled by his cult members. Using his staged persona as a voice for the 'disenfranchised', Osborn plans to regain the Iron Patriot armor and creates a new team of Dark Avengers, this time substituting June Covington for Scarlet Witch, Ai Apaec for Spider-Man, Barney Barton for Hawkeye, Skaar for Hulk, Superia <b>for</b> <b>Ms.</b> Marvel, Gorgon for Wolverine and an A.I.M.-rebuilt Ragnarok for Thor. In the team's first fight with the New Avengers, Osborn reveals he has the Super-Adaptoid's powers, declares himself the head of world security, and orders that the Avengers be arrested for war crimes. However, double agent Skaar betrays Osborn, allowing the Avengers to dogpile Osborn's body, overloading him with superpowers and sending him into a coma. A.I.M. and HYDRA pick up Osborn's leftover resources, and H.A.M.M.E.R. is disbanded.
