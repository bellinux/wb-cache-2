5|$|The {{game was}} played in much warmer {{conditions}} than the Flames-Canadiens game the night previous, as the temperature <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> the freezing mark. It was a considerably more physical game than the NHL contest, and was won by the Pats, 3–2, on a last-minute goal by Chandler Stephenson. Played before 20,888 fans, the game set new Western and Canadian Hockey League attendance records and set the world record for highest attended junior game.|$|E
5|$|England's bodyline tactics, which {{involved}} bowling at speeds of around 150km/h at the heads and torsoes of the Australian batsmen—including Woodfull—and employing a close leg-side cordon to catch balls fended {{away from the}} upper body, caused great controversy and ill-feeling among Australian players and crowds. England devised the tactics {{in an attempt to}} curb Donald Bradman, Australia's star batsman, whose average <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> 100, around twice that of all other world-class batsman. However, they also hoped to restrict the other batsmen, Woodfull among them, through such means.|$|E
5|$|The roof {{had long}} been in bad shape {{by the time of}} Jacob Spiegel's death in 2001 and it was {{threatening}} to collapse. In December of that year, Shmuel Spiegel managed to raise $25,000 for emergency repairs. However, despite offering cholent (the traditional Sabbath lunch stew) at the Sabbath morning kiddush, Spiegel had to search local streets to make the ten men for the minyan. In 2004 the regular membership <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> 40. Spiegel kept the synagogue running at an annual cost of around $75,000.|$|E

5|$|In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, {{attempted}} an amalgamation. This was {{the third}} such attempt; the previous two had failed when the members could not agree on synagogue ritual. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members; members would be refunded half the purchase price of the pews in their existing buildings. Mosche and the rabbi of Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi. Though this attempt also failed, {{in the following year}} the three congregations carried out combined activities, including a picnic and a celebration of the 100th birthday of Moses Montefiore. Membership at that time still <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> 50.|$|E
5|$|Manual's {{enrollment}} numbers, {{which had}} <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> 400 since the 1890s, soared from 429 in 1919 to 1,039 in 1925. The Manual Crimsons football team, which {{had also been}} consolidated with Male's from 1915 to 1918, had great success in the 1920s, beating Male {{two years in a}} row for the first time in its history. Manual shared athletic facilities with Male for many years, but in the early 1920s alumni raised funds to construct Manual Stadium. The stadium opened in 1924 with 14,021 permanent seats. It was one of the largest high school stadiums in America at the time. The original structure was condemned and closed in 1952 after years of heavy use and minimal upkeep, and was reopened after being rebuilt in 1954. Its modern capacity is 11,463.|$|E
5|$|The Australian cricket team toured England in 1930. Australia won the five-Test series 2–1, and Donald Bradman scored 974 runs at a {{batting average}} of 139.14, an {{aggregate}} record that still stands in 2017. By {{the time of}} the next Ashes series of 1932–33, Bradman's average <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> 100, approximately twice that of all other world-class batsmen. The English cricket authorities felt that new tactics would be required to prevent Bradman being even more successful on Australian pitches; some critics believed that Bradman could be dismissed by leg-spin as Walter Robins and Ian Peebles had supposedly caused him problems; two leg-spinners were included in the English touring party of 1932–33.|$|E

5|$|What's the Story was {{released}} on 2 October 1995. The album sold quickly; the Daily Mirror reported the day after release that central London HMV stores were selling copies of the album {{at a rate of}} two per minute. At {{the end of the first}} week of sales, the album had sold a record-breaking 347,000 copies, making it (at the time) the second-fastest-selling album in British history, behind Michael Jackson's Bad. After initially entering the UK charts at number one, it <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> the top three for the rest of the year before initiating a six-week stay at the top in mid January, followed by a further three weeks at number one in March. In total, the album didn't leave the top three for an astonishing seven months.|$|E
5|$|The Peach Bowl {{game was}} created in 1968 by the Lions Club of Atlanta {{as a means to}} attract tourism to the city. First played at Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech, the game was moved to Fulton County Stadium in 1971. By the mid-1980s, the Peach Bowl was facing hard times. At the time, NCAA {{guidelines}} for bowls required 75percent of gross receipts to go to participating schools, with 33percent of tickets to the game also required to go to each school. In 1983, the NCAA threatened to revoke the Peach Bowl's charter when ticket sales <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> 25,000 with a week to go before the bowl. Last-minute sales saved the game, as attendance at the 1983 game climbed to 40,000 and a new television contract allowed the bowl to make a payout of $580,000 to each team. Still, the bowl's future was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|The {{next night}} at 1945 hrs, a craft {{similar to the}} one the night before {{approached}} the base. In addition to being tracked on radar, it <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> the area for 30 minutes, with characteristics of movement similar to a helicopter. Additionally, it hovered above the weapons storage area at the same altitude as the night before. At this time, possibly another object (it is unclear if it was the same one as the over the weapons storage area, but it is possible) was spotted over the flightline. The cigar-shaped object was described as hovering in mid-air, jerking around, and turning on and off its lights once. During the blackout, it traveled from the flightline, to the northern end of the runway. According to one service member, the object was chased, and eventually discovered to be hovering five feet off the ground. During this time, it was determined that the object was four car lengths long.|$|E

5|$|After {{the battle}} the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa {{continued}} his flight southward throughout {{the month of}} January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January {{the pursuit of the}} Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to either party. On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag. The next day, the Bhagwa Zenda —the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas— was raised in its place. To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion. They announced that all Watans, Inams, pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao. During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Sutter {{engineered}} a seven player {{trade at}} the end of January that sent Dion Phaneuf and Fredrik Sjostrom to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for four players led by Matt Stajan, Ian White and Niklas Hagman. The deal ended weeks of speculation about the Calgary defenceman's future amid reports that Phaneuf had requested a trade – a claim he had denied. One day later, the Flames sent Olli Jokinen and Brandon Prust to the New York Rangers in exchange for Ales Kotalik and Chris Higgins. The deals resulted in the change of over one third of the roster in the period of a day, moves that were seen as a sign of panic as the Flames <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> the final playoff spot. While rumours circulated that Phaneuf was dealt because he was a divisive influence in the locker room, Jokinen later blamed the fans in Calgary for the defenceman's departure. Jokinen admitted that he was traded because he failed to produce in Calgary, while in Kotalik, the Flames received a player who was having a similarly disappointing season in New York.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued {{to stay out of}} the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the first time in three seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush <b>hovered</b> <b>around</b> the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E
