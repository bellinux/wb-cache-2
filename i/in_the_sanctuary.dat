5|$|Scott's {{work in the}} 1870s {{included}} the installation of large gas chandeliers made by the Coventry metalworker Francis Skidmore. They were converted to electricity in 1979. Other new features included a new pulpit and seating. A marble altarpiece from General George Wade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> was removed and replaced with a decorative reredos.|$|E
5|$|The {{entrance}} to the chancel from the crossing has a red marble step, with mosaic, and Minton encaustic tile panels of a three-branch lamp, then another marble step and black marble main chancel flooring in small paving slabs. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> there are a further three marble steps, with paving of pink marble with black in square or zigzag patterns.|$|E
5|$|Inside, the {{building}} held a two-story balconied main sanctuary and dining room, {{in addition to}} the basement kitchen and bathrooms. The heating system was in a sub-basement. The front ark and wood bimah <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> were ornate; the red velvet draped ark was elaborately decorated, and the bimah was also decorated, and supported a large bronze candelabra. The sanctuary floor was wood, with wood wainscoting and plaster walls.|$|E

50|$|As per the 2010-11 tiger {{estimation}} report, {{there are}} 24 tigers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pench and Bor landscape.The Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimated {{the presence of}} 12 tigers <b>in</b> and around <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> but <b>the</b> number has increased to 15, with three new cubs sighted in March 2011.

5|$|Maribojoc {{had five}} {{intricately}} carved Neo-Gothic retablos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> and transepts. Striking {{features of the}} retablo were the presence of arches, crockets, Mudéjar stars and the profusion of carving. The whole retablo was probably completed in January 7, 1934 as a project of the Comité de Obras during the term of Father Quiterio Sarigumba (P.Q.S.) as seen on the inscription in {{the upper reaches of}} the central retablo. An older retablo, built from 1616 to 1692, predated the church.|$|E
5|$|The 1970s {{also saw}} a return to more {{traditional}} practices in the service, under Weider's guidance. Some members began wearing head coverings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> some Hebrew prayers {{were added to the}} Sabbath service, and the Reform movement's new High Holy Days prayer book The Gates of Repentance was adopted. The synagogue building and Temple House were contributing properties to the Park Slope historic district, which was listed as a New York City Landmark district in 1973, and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.|$|E
5|$|To {{accommodate}} {{the large number}} of people attending on the High Holy Days, since 2001 Temple Sinai has held its main High Holy Day services at Oakland's NRHP-listed Art Deco Paramount Theater. While it still holds smaller High Holy Day services <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> at 2808 Summit Street, the main services at the Paramount fill the entire 1,800 seats on the mezzanine of the theater, and most of the 1,200 seats in the balcony.|$|E

5|$|Helen Magnus awakens in a {{dilapidated}} corridor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> and finds {{that both the}} building, and the surrounding city skyline lie in ruins; Magnus has no memory on how the devastation occurred. While venturing the streets, Magnus finds herself under attack by a savage humanoid creature, but is saved by two men in Hazmat suits, who proceed to capture and decontaminate her. Magnus is later shocked to discover that her protégé, Will Zimmerman (Robin Dunne), {{is the leader of}} the survivalist group. Unlike his original personality, Zimmerman is acting far more violent and aggressive, and believes Magnus to be an imposter, citing she died three years ago. As more creatures attack the base, Magnus escapes and returns to the Sanctuary, where on the way she is joined by a young girl, Jessica Mitchell (Nicole Muñoz).|$|E
5|$|Several {{other rooms}} {{neighbored}} the sanctuary. Many of these rooms {{were used to}} store ceremonial equipment, ritual texts, or temple valuables; others had specific ritual functions. The room where offerings {{were given to the}} deity was often separate from the sanctuary itself, and in temples without a barque <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary,</b> there was a separate shrine to store the barque. In late temples the ritual areas could extend to chapels on the roof and crypts below the floor. Finally, in the exterior wall {{at the back of the}} temple, there were often niches for laymen to pray to the temple god, as close as they could come to its dwelling place.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} {{began with the}} {{original}} cast from the first season. Amanda Tapping returns as series protagonist Helen Magnus, a 158-year-old English scientist who runs the Sanctuary Network. The producers intended for Magnus to be more angry and vulnerable following Ashley's death after the first three episodes. Robin Dunne returns as Will Zimmerman, a former forensic psychiatrist who has been Magnus' protégé since the pilot. After the first season, the producers made Will more confrontational towards Magnus after feeling more comfortable working with her. Christopher Heyerdahl portrays two characters: Bigfoot, an abnormal who works <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary,</b> and John Druitt, Magnus' former fiancé and father to Ashley. Ryan Robbins returns as Henry Foss. A recurring actor in the first season, Robbins was upgraded to a series regular in the second.|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{uniqueness}} of this area, {{and the fact that}} all animals are “protected” by law <b>in</b> <b>the</b> park, <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> has been little developed and both conservation and protection efforts have largely failed. <b>In</b> fact, <b>the</b> Banyang-Mbo <b>sanctuary</b> suffers from well organized commercial poaching, where professional hunters come into the area, kill animals and transport the meat to large cities to be sold. This illegal hunting combined with habitat degradation is a major problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Banyang-Mbo Wildlife <b>Sanctuary.</b>|$|R
5|$|To {{insulate}} {{the sacred}} power <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> from the impurities {{of the outside}} world, the Egyptians enclosed temple sanctuaries and greatly restricted access to them. People other than kings and high priests were thus denied contact with cult statues. The only exception was during festival processions, when the statue was carried out of the temple but still enclosed in a portable shrine. People did have less direct means of interaction. The more public parts of temples often incorporated small places for prayer, from doorways to freestanding chapels near {{the back of the}} temple building. Communities also built and managed small chapels for their own use, and some families had shrines inside their homes. Despite the gulf that separated humanity from the divine, the Egyptians were surrounded by opportunities to approach their gods.|$|E
5|$|Link is told by {{the priest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> that Agahnim, a wizard who has usurped the throne, is {{planning}} to break a seal made {{hundreds of years ago}} by the Seven Sages. The seal was placed to imprison a dark wizard named Ganon in the Dark World, a near-mirror of Hyrule which was once known as the Sacred Realm before Ganon invaded it, obtained the legendary Triforce held there, and used its power to turn the realm into a land of darkness. Agahnim intends to break the seal by sending the descendants of the Seven Sages who made the seal into the Dark World. The only thing that can defeat Agahnim is the Master Sword, a sword that can only be wielded by the chosen hero and forged to combat evil. To prove that he is worthy to wield it, Link needs three magic pendants, hidden in dungeons guarded by mythical defenders. On his way to retrieve the first, he meets an elder, Sahasrahla, who becomes Link's mentor, offering hints and advice at key stages of the journey. After retrieving the pendants, Link takes them to the resting place of the Master Sword. As Link draws the sword from its pedestal, Zelda telepathically calls him to the Sanctuary, informing him that soldiers of Hyrule Castle have arrived. Link arrives at the Sanctuary moments after the soldiers have vacated, where he learns from the dying Sanctuary keeper that Zelda has been taken to Hyrule Castle. Link goes to rescue her but arrives too late; Agahnim sends Zelda to the Dark World. Link then faces Agahnim in battle and defeats him, but Agahnim's last act is to send Link to the Dark World as well.|$|E

50|$|Attic pottery was valued <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuaries</b> of <b>the</b> Etruscans, {{where they}} had {{additional}} roles: cultic ritual, banqueting and votive offerings.
