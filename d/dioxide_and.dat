5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved {{them to be}} a mixture of carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to be very high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.|$|E
5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations of carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the fruit is removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen easily diffuses through heated palladium, and {{membrane}} reactors with Pd membranes {{are used}} in the production of high purity hydrogen. Palladium is used in palladium-hydrogen electrodes in electrochemical studies. Palladium(II) chloride readily catalyzes carbon monoxide gas to carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> is useful in carbon monoxide detectors.|$|E

5|$|More recently, the {{building}} and its materials have started showing signs of damage and discolouration due to the air pollution. The pollutants such as sulphur <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> other emissions, have already affected the white marble of the nearby Sheesh Mahal in the Lahore Fort Complex.|$|E
5|$|Pollution is a {{major concern}} in Kolkata. , sulphur <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> {{nitrogen}} dioxide annual concentration were within the national ambient air quality standards of India, but respirable suspended particulate matter levels were high, and on an increasing trend for five consecutive years, causing smog and haze. Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution-related respiratory ailments, such as lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Some {{chemical}} {{differences exist}} among the Negriales rocks, the Lastarria lavas, and the Lastarria pyroclastics.

5|$|Sponges' cells absorb oxygen by {{diffusion}} {{from water}} into cells as water flows through body, into which carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> other soluble waste {{products such as}} ammonia also diffuse. Archeocytes remove mineral particles that threaten to block the ostia, transport them through the mesohyl and generally dump them into the outgoing water current, although some species incorporate them into their skeletons.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmospheric}} pressure on Earth's surface averages 101.325kPa, with a scale height of about 8.5km. It has a composition of 78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, with trace {{amounts of water}} vapor, carbon <b>dioxide,</b> <b>and</b> other gaseous molecules. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8km at the poles to 17km at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.|$|E
5|$|The {{material}} {{ejected from}} the volcano mainly consisted of water vapor, along with smaller amounts of carbon <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide.

5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} increased {{again in}} November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur <b>dioxide</b> <b>and</b> elemental sulfur {{began to appear}} in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of Nevado del Ruiz became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.|$|E
