5|$|In August Belgrano again took {{command of}} the Army of the North, but with very limited people and resources. He was ordered to avoid trying to advance against the royalists in the north, and was {{to stay in a}} {{defensive}} state at Tucumán. With Güemes in Salta, his task was to prevent the Royalists from moving to the south. The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín: create the Army of the Andes at Cuyo and, after making the Crossing of the Andes, defeat the royalists in Chile, <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Chilean navy, and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it.|$|E
5|$|As {{the fire}} was going into its sixth hour it had spread up to the 26th floor. With {{inadequate}} water pressure coming from the standpipes, firefighters stretched hoses up the building's stairwells to help fight the fire. While hoses were being taken up to the fire a sprinkler technician arrived to fix the water pressure. This improved the hose streams, but the fire had engulfed several floors {{and could not be}} contained with just hoses. By 7:00 AM, almost eleven hours into the fire, firefighters were able to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the fire on the 22nd through 24th floors, but {{the fire was}} still out of control on the 25th and 26th floors and was spreading upwards. Structural damage observed inside the building by firefighters and consultations with a structural engineer led to fears that the damaged floors might collapse. At 7:00 AM an order to evacuate the building was issued by Fire Commissioner Roger Ulshafer, and the building was completely evacuated by 7:30 AM. After the evacuation, the only fire suppression efforts left were water streams being directed to the building from the neighboring Girard Trust Building and One Centre Square.|$|E

25|$|The {{methods used}} in a typical pirate attack have been analyzed. They show that while attacks can be {{expected}} at any time, most occur during the day; often in the early hours. They may involve two or more skiffs that can reach speeds of up to 25 knots. With the help of motherships that include captured fishing and merchant vessels, the operating range of the skiffs has been increased far into the Indian Ocean. An attacked vessel is approached from quarter or stern; RPGs and small arms are used to intimidate the operator {{to slow down and}} allow boarding. Light ladders are brought along to climb aboard. Pirates then will try to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the bridge to take operational control of the vessel.|$|E

25|$|When a goaltender blocks or stops a {{shot from}} going into his goal net, that action {{is called a}} save. Goalies often use a {{particular}} style, but in general they make saves any way they can: catching the puck with their glove hand, deflecting the shot with their stick, blocking it with their leg pads or blocker or another part of their body, or collapsing to butterfly position to block any low shot coming, especially in close proximity. After making a save, the goaltender attempts to control the rebound to avoid a goal scored by an opposing player when the goaltender is out of position ('scoring on a rebound'), or to allow the goalie's own team to <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the puck. Goalies may catch or hold a puck shot at the net to better control how it re-enters play. If there is immediate pressure from the opposing team, a goalie may choose {{to hold on to}} the puck (for a second or more, with judgment from the referee) to stop play for a face-off. If a goalie holds on to the puck for too long without any pressure they may be subject to a 2-minute delay of game penalty. Recently, in the NHL and AHL, goalies have been restricted as to where they can play the puck behind the net.|$|E

500|$|As an heir to {{the wealth}} of the Tunt family—who were trailblazers in the {{railroad}} industry—Cheryl is often subjected to numerous threats and kidnappings. As a result of her parents' death, she and her brother, Cecil Tunt, inherit an estimated US$1 billion in trust funds; it is split evenly amongst each party, which culminated with Cheryl's net worth increasing tenfold. This prompts a group of robbers to cultivate a plan to abduct her, which ultimately fails as they mistake Pam for her. In that same episode, it is also revealed that she owns an ocelot named Babou, for which Archer develops a fondness (similar to Salvador Dalí, who had a pet ocelot by that name with whom he frequently traveled.) Cecil later tricks ISIS into a mission with the intent to videotape members talking of Cheryl's insanity so he can <b>get</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> her half of the fortune. It turns out Cecil has spent all of his half of the fortune on various charities, including an undersea base whose insane leader used the funds to buy nerve gas missiles.|$|E

2500|$|Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton (21 December 1698 – 31 May 1731) was a {{powerful}} Jacobite politician, {{was one of the}} few people in English history, and the first since the 15th century, to have been raised to a Dukedom whilst still a minor and not closely related to the monarch.

2500|$|Army {{officials}} {{consider the}} GMV a needed {{addition to a}} global response force like the 82nd Airborne Division.

[...] The GMV would allow light infantry to be driven right to their destination, allowing them to be airdropped further away from potential enemy fire and use mobility to find an off-road avenue of approach an adversary isn't expecting, and not be fatigued once they need to fight. [...] The idea was to acquire up to 300 vehicles {{by the end of}} 2016 at a unit cost of $149,000, which could decrease if a second increment was bought and stationed at installations for training; predicted dates were not certain as the entire effort remains subject to funding availability.
