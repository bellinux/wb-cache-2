5000|$|Sotion (fl. 1st century), {{a native}} of Alexandria, was a Neopythagorean philosopher {{who lived in the}} age of Tiberius. He belonged to the school of the Sextii, which was founded by Quintus Sextius and {{combined}} Pythagoreanism with Stoicism. Sotion was the teacher of Seneca the Younger, who [...] "sat as a lad, in the school of the philosopher Sotion." [...] Seneca derived from him his admiration of Pythagoreanism, and quotes Sotion's views concerning vegetarianism and the migration of the soul:You do not believe that souls are assigned, first to one body and then to another, and that our so-called death is merely a change of abode? You do not believe that in cattle, or in wild beasts, or in creatures of the deep, the soul of him who was once a man may linger? You do not believe that nothing on this earth is annihilated, but only changes its haunts? And that animals also have cycles of progress and, so to speak, an orbit for their souls, no less than the heavenly bodies, which revolve in fixed circuits? Great men have put faith in this idea; therefore, while holding to your own view, keep the whole question in abeyance in your mind. If the theory is true, it is a mark of purity to refrain from eating flesh; if it be false, it is economy. And what harm <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> you to give such credence? I am merely depriving you of food which sustains lions and vultures.|$|E

This master thesis {{is an attempt to}} get a clear yet diverse picture of the effects that {{classical}} music has on a listener. It is a broad subject that has been discussed in philosophy and psychology for centuries. In the first chapter this work briefly goes through the history of the question, starting in the ancient Greece and finishing in our time. Its second chapter is an experiment {{with a small group of}} people that share their experiences in listening to classical music. The subject is looked into considering different points of view...|$|E

40|$|The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) is a {{landmark}} {{in terms of}} creating multilateral disciplines in virgin territory, but is a failure in terms of generating liberalization and locking-in existing policy regimes affecting international transactions in services. There are two key issues that should be addressed in evaluating the GATS. First, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> bind policies? Second, has it established a mechanism that will induce significant liberalization through future rounds of negotiations? This paper concludes that the GATS does not score very high on either dimension. A number of suggestions are made to strengthen the Agreement and support more far-reaching liberalization in the future. GATS; Multilateral Trade Negotiations; Trade in Services; Trade Policy...|$|E

The experts discuss how the "fight or flight response," a result of adrenalin and cortisol secretion triggered by stress, might be appropriate for fleeing from lions but is not a useful reaction in the office and can be detrimental over time. Type A and B personalities are explained, as well as how the ability to manage stress may be determined before birth. A Discovery Channel Production. (50 minutes, color...|$|E
3000|$|I {{believe the}} real {{difference}} between {{success and failure}} in a corporation can very often {{be traced to the}} question of how well the organization brings out the great energies and talents of its people.

And how can it sustain this common cause and sense of direction through the many changes which take place from one generation to another? [...]... [I think the answer lies] in the power of what we call beliefs and the appeal these beliefs have for its people.... I firmly believe that any organization, in order to survive and achieve success, must have a sound set of beliefs on which it premises all its policies and actions. Next, I believe that the most important single factor in corporate success is faithful adherence to those beliefs.... Beliefs must always come before policies, practices, and goals. The latter must always be altered if they are seen to violate fundamental beliefs.|$|E
