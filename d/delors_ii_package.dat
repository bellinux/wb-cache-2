40|$|The European Union {{regarded}} as an economic reenhancement force in Europe {{and in the world}} must fund the needs of 500 million citizens. To do that, it should possess an innovative budget adjusted to the new facts of globalization meant to meet present challenges and create various opportunities for the future. In order to improve budgetary procedures, the need to reform the community bugdet has emerged, namely to change the way it is designed and spent. The manner of setting and distributing the community budget has been changed several times whenever the context in member states has demanded. Thus, European institutions concluded in 1988 interinstitutional agreements which have been covering budgetary process and budget allocation ever since. Agreements are concluded for several years and bear the name of “financial prospects”. Other two agreements have been made (during 2007 - 2013 and, respectively, 2014 - 2020) in compliance with Delors I and <b>Delors</b> <b>II</b> <b>Packages.</b> The present paper focuses on approaching the progress of budgetary indicators {{in the context of the}} multiannual financial framework where the European Union budget is set...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{asks how}} ex ante and ex post control {{mechanisms}} structuring {{the involvement of}} national parliaments in EU policy-formulation affect the {{size and scope of}} conflict of parliamentary debates. The direct and indirect effects of control mechanisms are assessed in a comparative case study on plenary parliamentary debates in the Danish Folketing and Dutch Tweede Kamer on the EU multiannual budgets <b>Delors</b> <b>II,</b> Agenda 2000 and Financial Perspectives 2007 - 2013. It finds that control mechanisms have direct effects on the size of parliamentary debate and indirectly on the scope of conflict. As control mechanisms structure the timing of debates, different interactions with the policy-formulation process and media coverage are created leading to different scopes of conflict. It finds that ex ante mechanisms trigger smaller, more partisan debates at an early stage of the policy-formulation process, whereas ex post mechanisms stimulate larger, later and intergovern-mental debates. If, from a normative democratic point of view, we value large, partisan debates, these findings present a problem as {{there appears to be a}} trade-off between high quantity on the one hand, and partisan conflict on the other hand. agenda 2000; budget; Denmark; national parliaments; Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|The current Eurosceptic {{political}} climate in the European Union, {{known as the}} ‘constraining dissensus’, may place negotiations on the multiannual EU budget center-stage. If media portray political conflict about the budget as international polarization pitting Member States against each other or against European Union (EU) institutions, it may increase Euroscepticism as such polarization resonates with exclusive national identity perceptions. If the budget is polarized transnationally, emphasizing conflict within Member States, it may alleviate the constraining dissensus as it negates exclusive national identity while strengthening cross-cutting cleavages. This study tests hypotheses about patterns and trends in politicization of the EU budget in three budgets (<b>Delors</b> <b>II,</b> Agenda 2000, Financial Perspectives 2007 - 2013), three countries (the Netherlands, Denmark and Ireland) and two forums (media and national parliaments) using claims-making analysis and controlled multivariate comparisons. It finds predominant international polarization with no clear trend over time and no clear difference between countries. It therefore seems likely that politicization of the EU budget reinforces the constraining dissensus, rather than loosening it. However, the more politicized budget debates become, the less likely they will stimulate Euroscepticism as the dominance of international polarization decreases. ...|$|R
