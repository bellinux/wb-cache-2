25|$|In {{patients}} with grade I or II encephalopathy, <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> should be initiated early. Parenteral nutrition {{should be used}} only if <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is contraindicated as it {{increases the risk of}} infection. Severe restriction of protein is not beneficial; 60 g/day of protein is generally reasonable. Fluid replacement with colloid (e.g. albumin) is preferred rather than crystalloid (e.g. saline); all solutions should contain dextrose to maintain euglycemia. Multiple electrolyte abnormalities are common in ALF. Correction of hypokalemia is essential as hypokalemia increases the kidneys' ammonia production, potentially exacerbating encephalopathy. Hypophosphatemia is especially common in {{patients with}} acetaminophen-induced ALF and in those with intact renal function. Hypoglycemia occurs in many patients with ALF and is often due to depletion of hepatic glycogen stores and impaired gluconeogenesis. Plasma glucose concentration should be monitored and hypertonic glucose administered as needed.|$|E
25|$|As {{with mild}} acute pancreatitis, {{it will be}} {{necessary}} to treat the underlying cause—gallstones, discontinuing medications, cessation of alcohol, etc. If the cause is gallstones, it is likely that an ERCP procedure or removal of the gallbladder will be recommended. The gallbladder should be removed during the same hospital admission or within two weeks of pancreatitis onset so as to limit the risk of recurrent pancreatitis. If the cause of pancreatitis is alcohol, cessation of alcohol consumption and treatment for alcohol dependency may improve pancreatitis. Even if the underlying cause is not related to alcohol consumption, doctors recommend avoiding it for at least six months as this can cause further damage to the pancreas during the recovery process. Oral intake, especially fats, is generally restricted initially but early <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> within 48 hours has been shown to improve clinical outcomes. Fluids and electrolytes are replaced intravenously. Nutritional support is initiated via tube feeding to surpass the portion of the digestive tract most affected by secreted pancreatic enzymes if there is no improvement in the first 72–96 hours of treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a shift in the {{management}} paradigm from TPN (total parenteral nutrition) to early, post-pyloric <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> (in which a feeding tube is endoscopically or radiographically introduced to the third portion of the duodenum). The advantage of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeding</b> is that it is more physiological, prevents gut mucosal atrophy, and is free from the side effects of TPN (such as fungemia). [...] The additional advantages of post-pyloric feeding are the inverse relationship of pancreatic exocrine secretions and distance of nutrient delivery from the pylorus, as well as reduced risk of aspiration.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{systematic}} review is to evaluate the role of enteral nutrition in managing patients with diabetes on <b>enteral</b> <b>feed.</b> The prevalence of diabetes is on {{the increase in the}} UK and globally partly due to lack of physical activities, poor dietary regimes and genetic susceptibility. The development of diabetes often leads to complications such as stroke, which may require enteral nutritional support. The provision of <b>enteral</b> <b>feeds</b> comes with its complications including hyperglycaemia which if not managed can have profound consequences for the patients in terms of clinical outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to develop strategies for managing patients with diabetes on <b>enteral</b> <b>feed</b> with respect to the type and composition of the feed. This is a {{systematic review}} of published peer reviewed articles. EBSCOhost Research, PubMed and SwetsWise databases were searched. Reference lists of identified articles were reviewed. Randomised controlled trials comparing enteral nutrition diabetes specific formulas with standard formulas were included. The studies which compared diabetes specific formulas (DSF) with standard formulas showed that DSF was more effective in controlling glucose profiles including postprandial glucose, HbA 1 c and insulinemic response.

40|$|AIM—To {{assess the}} {{efficacy}} of cisapride in reducing {{the time required to}} establish <b>enteral</b> <b>feeds</b> in preterm infants.  METHODS—A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial was conducted of 34 infants of ⩽ 32 weeks of gestation, assigned to receive either cisapride 0. 2 mg/kg/dose four times daily (n= 18) or placebo (n= 16).  RESULTS—The time taken by the babies to tolerate full <b>enteral</b> <b>feeds</b> was not significantly different between the groups (median 9. 5 days vs 10 days). There was a significantly lower incidence of large gastric residuals and regurgitation in the treated group compared with the placebo group. The number of episodes of large gastric residuals per infant was also significantly less. No adverse effects were noted.  CONCLUSION—The routine use of cisapride in preterm infants cannot be recommended to decrease the time to establish <b>enteral</b> <b>feeds.</b> Its use may be justified for clincally significant gastric stasis or regurgitation. ...|$|R

Study Design. Infants ≥ 35 weeks gestational age and ≥ 1800 grams birth weight with moderate-to-severe HIE treated from 2000 to 2012 were compared. 68 patients had documented strictly defined criteria for WBTH: 32 historical control patients did not receive WBTH (non-WBTH) and 36 cohort patients received WBTH.

Objective: We hypothesized that in women with HG, early <b>enteral</b> tube <b>feeding</b> in addition to standard care improves birth weight. Design: We performed a multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trial [Maternal and Offspring outcomes after Treatment of HyperEmesis by Refeeding (MOTHER) ] in 19 hospitals in the Netherlands. A total of 116 women hospitalized for HG between 5 and 20 wk of gestation were randomly allocated to <b>enteral</b> tube <b>feeding</b> for >/= 7 d in addition to standard care with intravenous rehydration and antiemetic treatment or to standard care alone. Women were encouraged to continue tube feeding at home. On the basis of our power calculation, a sample size of 120 women was anticipated.

Results: Between October 2014 and March 2016 we randomly allocated 59 women to <b>enteral</b> tube <b>feeding</b> and 57 women to standard care. The mean +/- SD birth weight was 3160 +/- 770 g in the <b>enteral</b> tube <b>feeding</b> group compared with 3200 +/- 680 g in the standard care group (mean difference: - 40 g, 95 % CI: - 230, 310 g).
