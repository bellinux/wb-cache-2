50|$|After charging, {{the roof}} is swung back over the furnace and {{meltdown}} commences. The electrodes are lowered onto the scrap, an arc is struck and the electrodes are then set to bore into the layer of shred {{at the top of}} the furnace. Lower voltages are selected for this first part of the operation to protect the roof and walls from excessive heat and damage from the arcs. Once the electrodes have reached the heavy melt at the base of the furnace and the arcs are shielded by the scrap, the voltage can be increased and the electrodes raised slightly, lengthening the arcs and increasing power to the melt. This enables a molten pool to form more rapidly, reducing tap-to-tap times. Oxygen is blown into the scrap, combusting or cutting the steel, and extra chemical heat is provided by wall-mounted oxygen-fuel burners. Both processes accelerate scrap meltdown. Supersonic nozzles enable oxygen jets to penetrate <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> and reach the liquid bath.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{the scrap}} has {{completely}} melted {{down and a}} flat bath is reached, another bucket of scrap can be charged into the furnace and melted down, although EAF development is moving towards single-charge designs. After the second charge is completely melted, refining operations take place to check and correct the steel chemistry and superheat the melt above its freezing temperature in preparation for tapping. More slag formers are introduced and more oxygen is blown into the bath, burning out impurities such as silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, aluminium, manganese, and calcium, and removing their oxides to the slag. Removal of carbon takes place after these elements have burnt out first, as they have a greater affinity for oxygen. Metals that have a poorer affinity for oxygen than iron, such as nickel and copper, cannot be removed through oxidation and must be controlled through scrap chemistry alone, such as introducing the direct reduced iron and pig iron mentioned earlier. A <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> is maintained throughout, and often overflows the furnace to pour out of the slag door into the slag pit. Temperature sampling and chemical sampling take place via automatic lances. Oxygen and carbon can be automatically measured via special probes that dip into the steel, but for all other elements, a [...] "chill" [...] sample—a small, solidified sample of the steel—is analysed on an arc-emission spectrometer.|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} slag foaminess in an {{electric}} arc furnace {{has emerged as a}} critical variable in electric arc steelmaking, as a good <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> contributes significant efficiency benefits to the process. Many arc furnaces utilise harmonics generated in the electrical supply by the arcs as a <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> monitor, as a better <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> leads to a more stable arc and fewer harmonics. Monitoring via sound and light emissions from the EAF have also been attempted as a method of foam monitoring. This study examines EAF mass inputs and some outputs, EAF energy inputs and some outputs, the potential to monitor the quality of the <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> using sound analysis, and the interdependence of an electrical harmonic –based foaming indicator and the increase of the steel temperature during refine. It was found that a broad trend exists between increasing metal refine power and increasing averages of <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> indicators during refine which could be used to adjust the foaming indicator such that {{it can be used to}} gauge the heating rate of the steel. A method for examining the relationship between actual electrical harmonics and metal refine power is proposed. As the furnace studied used both normal coke injection and a rubber and coke blend as <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> agents, a comparative analysis of the coke-injectant and rubber/coke-injectant heats also took place. Analysis of input and output energy found that heats using a rubber/coke blend as inject carbon were more efficient in energy consumption than heats using the standard inject coke. Analysis of the energy released from combustion of the inject carbon types found that the combustion of rubber could not account for all of the savings in specific electrical energy consumption that were recorded, indicating that the improvement in electrical efficiency of the EAF seen when a rubber/coke injectant blend is used arrives from better slag foaming increasing heat transfer from the arc to the steel, not from substitution of electrical energy by combustion energy. On the whole, foaming indicator trends appeared better for heats using a blend of rubber and coke for inject carbon...|$|E

40|$|In {{steel mills}} that operate with {{electric}} arc furnaces (EAF), {{it is interesting}} to ensure greater stability to the electric arc to aim at less distortion in the electrical system, with consequent reduction in electric power consumption. The slag foaming increases electric arc stability by reducing the total harmonic distortion (THD) between EAF phases. In this study, information about the chemical composition of the slag and electrical parameters of an EAF were collected. With the composition data, it was possible to determine the FeO and MgO content and basicity of the foamy slag which caused a reduction in THD and in electric power consumption.

In recent years the fuming plant has been experiencing foaming of the slag during slag tapping to the settling furnace, sometimes leading to slopping. During this master thesis work the slag has been characterised to investigate the foaming. The slag has been sampled from different steps in the process and analysed chemically. Certain samples have been analysed with Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to determine the phases and mineralogy of the slag. The fusibility was determined {{through the use of a}} Thermo microscope and the viscosity and melting behavior was examined by simple comparative melting. In addition to the practical examination of the slag, a literature survey was made focusing on slag foaming. From the literature it was concluded that the most influential parameters affecting foaming are; viscosity, the presence of solid particles and emulsions and the presence of surface active components. The SEM and XRD-study found chromium containing magnetite spinells and matte droplets in the slag. It was also noted that the phases and structures of the slag changed with the CaO content in the slag. Observations with the thermo microscope and the melting tests showed a difference in melting point and viscosity between foaming and non <b>foaming</b> <b>slag.</b> Foremost this study has shown that the slag exhibits large fluctuations in foaming behavior even during small variations within the slag.

40|$|Emulsification {{behaviour}} {{caused by}} gas bubbles rising through a slag/metal interface was studied in both a thin-slice model and a three-dimensional model using low temperature oil/aqueous and oil/mercury analogues. A generalized model characterizing the transitional volume of droplets entrained {{in the upper}} phase in the emulsification process was developed. The transient volume of "metal" entrained, $ rm V sb{d}(t),$ following the start of bubbling followed the relation $ rm V sb{d}(t) =V sb{ propto}(1 -e sp{-t/ tau}). $ Based on this model, the birth rate and mean residence time of droplets dispersed by rising bubbles could be quantified. Dimensional {{analysis was used to}} express the volume of lower liquid carried up into the emulsion per bubble, thereby allowing better estimates of the droplet birth rate in a practical emulsification process induced by bottom blowing. Emulsification behaviour in industrial in-bath smelting processes were interpreted with the present modelling results. Slag foaming in "in-bath" iron smelting was modelled by injecting gas through a porous disc into a vertical cylinder containing a variety of low temperature liquids. Based on experimental evidence and theoretical arguments, difficulties with previous studies characterizing foam height as a function of fluid properties were addressed, and an alternative analysis {{in the form of a}} general relationship was developed. The fractional volume of gas holdup, $ varepsilon,$ in foaming slags containing large spherical cap bubbles could be expressed as $ rm varepsilon=U sb{g}/ lbrack U sb{g}+(0. 5 gd sb{b}) sp{ 0. 5 } rbrack. $ The average bubble size in the <b>foaming</b> <b>slag</b> of the AISI pilot trials on the smelting reduction of iron ores was estimated to be 10 - 25 cm equivalent diameter, suggesting that significant coalescence of small bubbles (such as CO) occurs in the process. In modelling the mixing behaviour of ferroalloy additions in intensively stirred reactors, the AOD process was used to simulate slag chrome oxide reduction period by ferro-silicon additions. These phenomena were examined with the aid of a two dimensional slice model and then a three dimensional model using low temperature oil/aqueous analogues. Based on these modelling studies, it was observed that the ascending gas/liquid plume created two asymmetric mixing zones: a smaller mixing zone near the side wall fitted with tuyeres and a larger main mixing zone away from it. In "slag free" experiments, a dead zone formed at the far surface corner opposite the tuyeres. There, the particles simulating ferro-alloy additions accumulated. However, in the "slag covered" model experiments, the injected gas generated an emulsified "slag/metal" phase of lower apparent density which lead to the entrainment of the buoyant ferro-silicon alloy additions. This, in conjunction with the significantly modified flow patterns, and absence of any dead zones, allowed the particles simulating ferroalloy additions to be readily entrained within the recirculation flow. These results suggest that the mixing-in of such additions into the molten slag during the chrome oxide reduction period can be accomplished efficiently...|$|E

CaO from the bakelite caused desulphurization of steel and formed CaS at the metal/carbon interface. A small improvement in carbon transfer was observed compared to coke. HDPE/Coke and PET/Coke blends exhibited slightly better wetting behaviour with liquid steel compared to coke, and contact angles increased marginally with increasing polymers content. Volatiles from HDPE/Coke and PET/Coke slowed down the coverage of interfacial region by reaction products; oxygen from PET/Coke blends helped form FeO at the interface.

In addition, two types of lightweight glass aggregates were used for improving the properties and to reduce the amount of paste in the material. The results shows that the wet bulk density of the AASFC is consistent with the designed value if prepared with suitable volume of foam and water/slag ratio. For these materials, the compressive strength is between 0. 1 and 7 MPa and the thermal conductivity ranges from 0. 09 to 0. 35 W m- 1 K- 1.

Furthermore, it is shown that the use of lightweight glass aggregates (LGA) in AASFC can reduce the amount of paste by 50 % (by volume) without any negative influence on mechanical properties, although the concretes showed poorer flowability.

The {{relationship among}} the binders, microstructure, mineral phases and strength of the foam concrete were explored and the reasons of why {{the strength of the}} cement foam concrete and cement-slag foam concrete is much higher than that of the cement-steel <b>slag</b> <b>foam</b> concrete are proposed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work studies were {{performed}} to provide understanding for further model development of the two-phase phenomena, film formation from o/w emulsions and <b>slag</b> <b>foaming.</b> The drying of o/w emulsions of different oil viscosities on hydrophobic and hydrophilic substrates was studied. The hydrophobic substrate was found to destabilise the oil droplets and {{to result in a}} different mechanism for forming continuous oil film. Studies of adsorption behaviour of a series of non-ionic diblock copolymers at relevant interfaces showed that the adsorption behaviour at hydrophobic and hydrophilic solid surfaces differed at high polymer concentration. Emulsion droplets were found to interact with the hydrophobic interface. Adsorption at silicone oil-water interface resembled adsorption at solid hydrophobic surfaces. Gas was generated through chemical reaction at the interface between two immiscible liquids and the bubbles formation from the generated was studied optically. The gas bubble size was seen to be uninfluenced by the reaction rate. However, bubble formation was seen to take place in one of the phases, held up at the interface before detaching from the interface with a surrounding aqueous film. It was argued that this may affect the final bubble sizes. <b>Slag</b> <b>foaming</b> at high temperatures was studied in laboratory scale with X-ray imaging under dynamic conditions. The foam displayed a fluctuating behaviour, which the presently available models are not able to take into account. The concept of foaming index was found to be unsatisfactory in describing the foaming behaviour under dynamic conditions, thus emphasizing the need for alternative theories. The rate of fluctuations was seen {{to be related to the}} difference between rate of gas generation and rate of gas escape from the system (Ug-Ue) as well as the bubble sizes. Thus, it seems like model development of dynamic foaming phenomenon has to take the effective chemical reaction rate as well as the bubble sizes into consideratio...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{interactions}} of carbonaceous materials (metallurgical coke, natural graphite and HDPE/coke blends) with three EAF slags [FeO: 24 % to 32 %]. Experiments were conducted using the sessile drop technique (1500 °C- 1600 °C) with off-gases (CO, CO 2) measured using an IR analyzer; the wetting behaviour was determined from contact angle measurements. Estimation of <b>slag</b> <b>foaming</b> behaviour was determined from the droplet volume changes calculated using specialized software. At 1550 °C, all slags were non-wetting with coke due to increased surface tension due to sulphur. At 1550 °C, slag 1 was initially non-wetting on natural graphite due to gas entrapment in the slag droplet; the wetting improved after that. Other slags showed comparatively better wetting. At 1600 °C, all slags were non-wetting with coke. Slags showed a shift from non-wetting to wetting behaviour with natural graphite. Slag/coke reactions produced high off-gases levels causing extensive FeO reduction; gas entrapment in the slag was poor (small volume droplets). Slag/natural graphite interactions revealed both slow gas generation rates and FeO reduction, and excellent gas entrapment (higher droplet volumes) with minor changes in slag properties due to low ash levels. The iron oxide reduction rates were determined to be 1. 54 x 10 - 5 and 4. 2 x 10 - 6 mol. cm- 2 /sec (Slag 1, 1550 °C) for metallurgical coke and natural graphite respectively. Slag interactions with coke/HDPE blends showed increasing off-gas levels with increasing HDPE levels. Blend# 3 produced the highest off-gas levels, extensive FeO reduction and displayed significantly higher <b>slag</b> <b>foaming</b> and better wetting compared to coke. Our line on trends compared well for slag/carbon interactions and resulted in deceased specific energy consumption and carbon usage and increased productivity. These findings have enhanced the possibility of utilizing polymeric wastes in blends with coke in EAF steelmaking for slag/carbon interactions...|$|R
