40|$|Tese apresentada à Universidade Fernando Pessoa como parte dos requisitos para obtenção do Grau de Doutor em Ciências da Informação, especialidade em Sistemas e Tecnologias da InformaçãoThe nineties {{were marked}} by futuristic visions of massive {{proliferation}} and interconnection of ubiquitous off-the-shelf systems. This innovation movement became known as ubicomp (ubiquitous computing). This new computing age raised new challenges in different areas, such as, ambient intelligence and applied artificial intelligence, software engineering planning, distributed systems and services, machine learning and security. These research trends gained preponderance in ubicomp but particularly the generic use of commercial off-the-shelf systems became pivotal in the massive integration and deployment of pervasive computing technology. This gains special importance {{when we think about}} device integration in the same household where unplanned interactions between users and ubicomp systems may occur (e. g., entertainment, communication, and health-related devices). Unplanned interactions are a serious concern since they may cause unsafe behavior on some of the systems. Think, for example, behavior interferences between communication or entertainment applications with health-related devices. In such ubicomp scenarios the deployed system {{should be aware of the}} surrounding context and adapt to cope with the user needs and nearby deployed systems. These systems are supposed to support and execute services for the users but are usually planned and developed independently and by different vendors. Therefore, the deployment and integration of these systems in the same environment or house are usually conducted in an unplanned manner, i. e., without a standard integration procedure that may allow inter-system connection and reconfiguration. Moreover, the traditional software development processes do not aim to avoid interference between systems during the conception stage. Furthermore, it is hard to identify and understand a priori all possible interactions between every possible system. The integration task is therefore complex since there are multiple possible systems combinations and variations. Moreover, since these systems are not usually aware of other systems in the same household, their behavior may potentially trigger a chain of unexpected reactions and jeopardize other systems operations. When these actions result in unexpected behavior, this problem is known as functional behavior interference or feature interaction. The ubicomp integration of off-the-shelf systems suffers from potential interference issues, and current deployment strategies do not cope with such problems yet. This thesis presents a novel graph-based approach for representing the expected behavior of commercial off-the-shelf devices and applications, their interactions, and for detecting interference among pervasive computing systems deployed on the same home context. A set of home care scenarios is used to assess the applicability of this approach. We consider also two setups where this approach can be applied: i) in a pre-deployment setup, where simulation is used to detect possible instances of interference, and ii) at run-time, collecting observations from devices and applications and detecting interference as it occurs. For pre-deployment and simulation, we use Opensim to recreate a household with several deployed systems. For run-time, we use Simple Network Management Protocol for systems state introspection and a sliding window mechanism to process the collected data-stream. The proposed model uses graph-analysis algorithms, which together with behavior introspection mechanisms, allow us to identify the occurrences of functional interferences, their potential sources and subjects, and the associated shared media through which such interferences may occur. The interference analysis is performed through a chain of working filters, each performing a specific check for interference. The intra-system filter provides mechanisms for identifying uncommon individual system behavior. The <b>intersystem</b> filter analyzes <b>interferences</b> between systems by inspecting if each medium is affected and shared by more than one system during their operations. A combined approach, using intra-system and inter-system outputs, allows us to identify any misbehavior and associated causing interactions and media dependencies. The detection of functional interference, both in predeployment and post-deployment scenarios, will allow defining reconfiguration or adaptation strategies, thus guaranteeing a safe integration of ubicomp systems...|$|R

In this paper, we address the multiuser detection problem for overlaid code-division multiple-access (CDMA) scenarios. However, {{in contrast to the}} well-studied conventional single-rate CDMA, miscellaneous systems overlay almost always indicates the presence of multirate traffic that introduces an additional degree of freedom in receiver design—i. e., differences in the symbol rates. In this paper, we concentrate on receiver design for multirate traffic, while assuming a lack of information exchange between the constituent (new and legacy) systems, as is commonplace in practice. We propose a receiver architecture based on linear parallel interference cancellation where the out-of-rate <b>intersystem</b> <b>interference</b> is estimated and subtracted by means of its characteristic subspace, thereby avoiding the need for the exact knowledge of signature waveforms of the interfering system.

40|$|Tuning spectra by pulse shaping is {{feasible}} in both impulse radio (IR) and continuous radio transmissions, since, as well known, the impulse {{response of the}} pulse shaper affects the spectral properties of radiated signals. What is peculiar to IR-UWB, and makes pulse shaping particularly appealing, is the impulsive nature of the carrier. Given their very short duration, transmitted pulses in different intervals overlap neither on clock beats nor in between two clock beats. Spectrum matching in IR can thus be restricted with reasonable approximation to a single inter-pulse interval, and as such be redirected in a rather straightforward way into a waveform representation problem. This paper analyzes the above problem of tuning radiated IR-UWB signals to reference spectral patterns by pulse shaping, and shows the correspondence between spectrum and waveform matching problems. Examples of application include three case studies: matching the FCC emission masks, mitigating interference in the ISM bands, and reducing <b>intersystem</b> <b>interference</b> for two coexisting UWB networks.

This present work computes transmission loss on horizontally polarized signals based on two models (Awaka and Capsoni). The results obtained are compared and it is observed that there is only a difference of 1 dB in the transmission loss between the models.

The multi-polarized adaptive array investigated in [5. 9] Mutual coupling effects are modeled using a method of moments computer code. With the corner reflector the array has a half power beamwidth of approximately 42 in elevation and 21 in azimuth. Sidelobe levels are- 10 dB in elevation and- 5 dB in azimuth. For identical desired and interfering signal polarization states, with the desired signal at broadside, the array provided an SINR improvement of 20 dB for a 3 difference in azimuth or elevation angles, and 30 dB for a 10 difference.

40|$|During {{the past}} few years, a {{worldwide}} interest and unanimous consensus has arisen on personal communication services (PCS), where satellites can {{play a crucial role}} in a global scenario for the provision of PCS's all over the world. While for maritime and aeronautical communication services, the mature technologies of geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellite systems seem the most suitable for present and future enhanced systems, other orbital configuration such as low earth orbit (LEO) and medium earth orbit (MEO) are being considered for the provision of satellite personal communication services to hand-held mobile terminals. One of the main objectives of personal communication services is the capability to provide personal (or continuous) mobility, communication anytime, anywhere. In general, satellite systems can provide a limited capacity with respect to terrestrial networks, nevertheless they are particularly suited in order to cover large terrestrial areas offering a scarce amount of traffic. The problem of radio frequency management for mobile applications has been addressed by World Administrative Radio Conference (WARC- 92). One of the most relevant decisions taken at WARC- 92 was to allocate the radio determination satellite system (RDSS) 1610 - 1626. 5 MHz (L-Band) and 2483. 5 - 2500 MHz (S-Band) slots to LEO satellite services on a worldwide, primary basis. This enables "big LEO's" to have a reasonable amount of spectram (i. e. capacity) to serve a substantial number of subscribers. However, the available amount of spectrum at L-band and S-band out of WARC- 92 appears hardly sufficient to permit several systems to operate. Hence, to enable all the systems to operate and fulfil the capacity demand, S-PCNs need to share the limited available frequency spectrum.

In essence, the GNSS signals operating in overlapping bands are identified, and, for each of them, the Spectral Separation Coefficient (SSC) is computed. Moreover, the Effective Carrier Power to Noise Density, versus the number of visible satellites and power levels of each interfering constellation is evaluated with main focus is addressed to Galileo E 1 BC and GPS L 1 C/A signals. For each investigated scenario, the analysis results show that interference effects on GNSS user receiver increase almost linearly {{with the number of}} visible interfering satellites. Finally, the paper describes a possible solution to the RF interference: an innovative design of a Controlled Radiation Pattern Antenna (CRPA) operating in Radio Frequency interference conditions as a means to mitigate the navigation performance degradation caused by the interference. Specifically, FRPA (Fixed Radiation Pattern Antenna), and CRPA phased array design of L-band RHCP micro-strip antennas is studied by means of electro-magnetic commercial tools and optimization algorithms. Phased array single radiator is designed in conventional and meta-material technology. Different CRPA configurations are traded-off in terms of “beam-forming” capability (e. g. radiation pattern nulls depth and width), antenna gain and RF pattern shape, antenna physical envelope. Advantages and drawbacks for GNSS applications are highlighted. In order to evaluate the CRPA benefits in terms of interference resilience, a realistic interference scenario is studied, considering the geometry-dependent and time-varying terms such as GNSS space constellation, RF interfering sources, signal modulation, emission RF power levels, satellite antenna gain and GNSS receiver characteristics. GNSS service performances (i. e., user location accuracy, and service time availability) are computed taking into account the adaptive array radiation pattern in two different modes (i. e., FRPA or CRPA) and under band-limited white noise interference. More specifically, to assess the performance of the proposed mitigation scheme, “ad – hoc” simulation making use of a GNSS simulator has been employed. The simulator consists of a) a Satellite Orbit Generator providing precision ephemeris to support evaluation of accurate propagation delays and Doppler effects, b) a propagation module evaluating the transformations affecting the satellite signals received at a specific location, including incremental ionosphere and troposphere incremental delays, c) a GNSS receiver motion generator computing the Kinematic data of a receiver on board of a mobile unit; d) a jammer signal generator; e) a GNSS receiver; f) the GNSS Localization module...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSatellite {{navigation}} {{has become}} such a worldwide priority that many countries are actively deploying or considering their own systems or modernizing those that already exist. As a consequence, the number of signals transmitted in L band will be significantly increased {{in the next few years}} so that only scant spectrum will be available for new systems or signals. Since current signals will have to be maintained many years in order to guarantee backward compatibility for legacy receivers, we can foresee that the search for new frequency allocations will be ranked at the highest level with a view to future evolutions of current systems. In this context S-band spectrum between 2483. 5 and 2500 MHz, which is already allocated to the radio determination satellite service (RDSS), can be used for satellite navigation - although the allocation in the Radio Regulations is only primary in parts of Asia, Africa and the Americas - is a particularly interesting possibility as synergies with future mobile communication systems in the band immediately above could be exploited to provide both navigation and communication services using one unique S-band terminal with an efficient, common antenna. Only at the next World Radiocommunications Conference in 2012 will the decision be made whether to make the existing patchwork of RDSS allocations global, but the studies completed so far show this to be promising. A global allocation will provide an important opportunity for a worldwide convergence between systems of the mobile satellite service (MSS) and the radio determination/navigation satellite service (RDSS / RNSS). This paper aims to analyze the suitability of this band for navigation purposes as well as the effects that the introduction of these kind of signals would produce on the other radio services present in the same and adjacent bands. We will also present the results obtained from link and error budget calculations and interference assessment that have been performed using various hypothethical of navigation signals in S band. Opportunities for Galileo- 2 signals are currently being studied having in mind possible additional frequencies in C and/or S band and/or L band, in complement to the E 5 a, E 5 b, E 6 and E 1 legacy OS, SoL, CS and PRS signals. The paper will give special attention to possible synergies between a hypothetical Galileo- 2 S-band signal, IRNSS/GINS and Beidou/COMPASS, which will use L and S bands, other RNSS/RDSS systems and mobile satellite service systems such as GLOBALSTAR- 2. These signals will be compared, and synergies between them explored. Several possible waveforms centred on a frequency close to 2491 MHz will be analysed in terms of <b>intersystem</b> <b>interference</b> and in terms of navigation and data transmission performance. The analysed waveforms in Sband will be BPSK(1 * 1. 023 Mcps), BPSK(4 * 1. 023 Mcps), BPSK(8 * 1. 023 Mcps), BOC(1, 1) and MBOC [...] Power flux density (pfd) and interference computations showing compatibility between a potential Galileo- 2 Sband component, S-band GNSS signals, GLOBALSTAR, mobile services (MS) and fixed services (FS) will be presented...|$|E
