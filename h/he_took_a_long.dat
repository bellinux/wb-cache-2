5|$|On 19 June 1853 La Pauline reached Valparaíso, where letters {{informed}} Roger {{that his}} father had succeeded to the baronetcy, Sir Edward having died in May. In all, Roger spent 10 months in South America, accompanied in the first stages by a family servant, John Moore. In the course of his inland travels he may have visited the small town of Melipilla, which lies on the route between Valparaíso and Santiago. Moore, who had fallen ill, was paid off in Santiago, while Roger travelled to Peru, where <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> hunting trip. By the end of 1853 he was back in Valparaíso, and early in the new year he began a crossing of the Andes. At the end of January, he reached Buenos Aires, where he wrote to his aunt, Lady Doughty, indicating that he was heading for Brazil, then Jamaica and finally Mexico. The last positive sightings of Roger were in Rio de Janeiro, in April 1854, awaiting a sea passage to Jamaica. Although he lacked a passport he secured a berth on a ship, the Bella, which sailed for Jamaica on 20 April.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> trip to North China, {{beginning}} 2 April 1873 in Shanghai, {{arriving at}} Tianjin by boat, then travelling by mule cart and arriving in Peking on 16 April 1873, where he {{stayed at the}} London Missionary Society headquarters. He visited the Great Wall, Ming Tombs and the Temple of Heaven, where he felt compelled {{to take off his}} shoes with holy awe. He left Peking, accompanied by Joseph Edkins, and headed for Shandong by mule cart to visit Jinan, Taishan, where they ascended the sacred Mount Tai, carried by four men on chairs. Leaving Mount Tai on 15 May, they visited Confucius Temple and the Forest of Confucius at Qufu, where he {{climbed to the top of}} Confucius' burial mound. Legge returned to Shanghai by way of the Grand Canal, and thence to England via Japan and the USA in 1873.|$|E
25|$|Dollery was a right-arm fast-medium bowler and a {{right-handed}} lower order batsman. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time {{to establish}} himself in first-class cricket, playing without success in two first-class matches for Queensland in 1947–48 {{and in two}} further games in New Zealand for Auckland in 1949–50. He finally took his first wickets in his fifth game, played for Tasmania against Victoria in what was traditionally a first-class match, although Tasmania was at that stage not included in regular first-class fixtures with other Australian state teams: having taken two wickets in the first innings, in the second innings of this match Dollery took five for 60. That same Tasmanian season, he played twice against the English touring team, which included senior Warwickshire professional Eric Hollies, and {{from the start of}} the 1951 English cricket season Dollery began the residential qualification period for Warwickshire. He also played for Stockport in the Central Lancashire League.|$|E

25|$|Sun Ce's younger brother, Sun Quan, favoured Zhou Tai so he {{requested}} for Zhou {{to be transferred}} to his unit. Once, when Sun Ce was away on a campaign against some bandits who had emerged in the six counties of Kuaiji, Sun Quan was left in Xuancheng County (宣城縣; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) with less than 1,000 men. Out of negligence, Sun Quan did not set up defence posts, so when thousands of bandits suddenly attacked Xuancheng, he attempted to flee. However, by then, Sun Quan had already been surrounded by the bandits, who attacked him and slashed at his saddle, causing much panic among his men. Only Zhou Tai, with his spirits roused, rushed to protect Sun Quan, emboldening those near him and making them able to fight again. When the bandits finally dispersed, Zhou Tai had sustained 12 deep wounds all over his body and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to recover. If Zhou Tai was not there on that day, Sun Quan would have surely perished. Zhou Tai's act of bravery was greatly appreciated by Sun Ce, who appointed him as the Chief (長) of Chungu County (春穀縣; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui).|$|E
500|$|An early {{version of}} the film focused on Joy and Fear getting lost together, as {{it seemed to be}} the most humorous choice. By July 2012, the project was set for an {{evaluation}} screening with other Pixar filmmakers. Docter gradually began to feel that the story was not working, which made him think that he might get fired. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> walk one Sunday, where he began to consider himself a failure, and that he should resign from the film. While pondering what he would miss about Pixar, he concluded that he would miss his coworkers and friends most of all. He soon reached a breakthrough: that emotions are meant to connect people together, and that relationships are the most important things in life. He decided to replace Fear with Sadness, which he felt is crucial to renewal. He met with Rivera and Del Carmen that night to explain his change of plans, and to his surprise, they reacted positively to it. At the screening, he informed his superiors that new plans for the film were in order. Although it was a [...] "scary moment", the film remained in production.|$|E

[...] Taft joined the Industrial Workers of the World and, while working in the northern Great Plains as a harvest hand, became an organizer. [...] Later he assisted with legal defense of IWW members in New York City where he was befriended by Roger Baldwin, {{a founder of the}} American Civil Liberties Union.|$|E
2500|$|After {{graduating from}} Miami in 1956, Burton played {{one year of}} {{professional}} football for the Ottawa Rough Riders in the Canadian Football League. [...] After a November 1956 win over the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, the Ottawa Citizen described Burton as one of Ottawa's stars: [...] "Burton, one of Ottawa's stars, {{played a leading role}} in the 95-yard drive which brought the Riders their game-winning field goal. [...] <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> 40-yard pass from Ledyard at center field and scurried like a scared rabbit to the Hamilton 27 before being nailed." [...] In his one season of professional football, Burton led the league with eight interceptions. [...] He scored four touchdowns (three rushing, one receiving), and had 155 rushing yards (29 carries for 5.34 yards per carry), 319 receiving yards (14 receptions for 22.79 yards per reception), and 175 kickoff return yards (11 returns for 15.91 yards per return).|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, Grey {{became friends}} with a fellow Midwestern architect, Myron Hunt. [...] The two rode horses {{together}} on Sunday mornings in Pasadena and formed a partnership in that city as Hunt and Grey. [...] Grey later wrote that he began by working {{only a short time}} each day [...] "until my nerves got in better shape." [...] Grey's health again failed {{during the early years of}} his partnership with Hunt, and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> trip to the South Sea Islands. [...] Yet, it was during his partnership with Hunt that Grey produced some of his finest work. [...] The two designed fine residences for the wealthy of Pasadena and also worked on larger projects, including schools, churches and hotels. [...] In 1905, The Architectural Record published articles on both Grey and Hunt, noting: [...] "Both Mr. Hunt and Mr. Grey stand for the attempt to naturalize in this country the best traditions of European architecture. [...] Mr. Grey, for instance, believes that a very genuine American style is in the process of making; but that as yet it is only in its infancy." ...|$|E

Homer visits the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant's psychiatrist, who suggests that <b>he</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> vacation. The Simpsons go on a trip to Florida and find themselves {{in the middle of a}} raucous spring break when they get there. Marge wants Homer to stay in his hotel room, but he escapes to party and attends a concert featuring Joe C. and Kid Rock. Homer becomes the life of spring break until it ends and the wild college students return to their studies.|$|R
50|$|When both Harvey and Wendell come home, {{they soon}} {{discover}} {{that for every}} day they spend in the Holiday House, a year has passed {{in the rest of}} the world. When Harvey meets his parents, he thinks he went to the wrong house, but he is wrong. The moment he sees his mother he realizes that something is fishy. His parents also realize who he is and invite him in. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> nap and then tells them what happened. At first they don't believe him, but Harvey tells them it's true. They go on the search of the House, but Harvey had forgotten all the roads <b>he</b> <b>took</b> coming home. It seems like everything is different. They try all day, but Harvey and his parents can't find the House.|$|R

2500|$|However, as is {{customary}} in EastEnders, {{their marriage}} didn't remain happy for long, and after {{an array of}} family and monetary problems, Frank began to sink into deep depression. Playing a depressed character took its toll on Mike Reid and he also began to suffer with depression, so in 1994 <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> hiatus from EastEnders. On-screen his character attempted an insurance scam by having his car-lot torched {{and was unable to}} cope with the resulting guilt after the fire claimed the life of a homeless man. Frank disappeared from the show under a cloud of mystery in April 1994 and for a while he was presumed dead, as none of his family had heard anything from him. Pat eventually moved on, and moved in with another man only for Frank to make a shocking return. Almost 17 million viewers tuned in to see Frank reunited with Pat on Christmas day 1995. His stay was brief, lasting only a few months, but it drew a line under his relationship with Pat and after failing to win her back, Frank was forced to move on too. Frank made several brief appearances in the show after this time, but in May 1998 he made a full-time return, this time as a love interest to landlady Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor). However Frank's affinity with Pat remained an underlying theme for both characters, and despite being separated, viewers were regularly reminded of their lustful connection. Pat's fourth husband Roy Evans (Tony Caunter) was deliberately made impotent in the series, so Pat would not be sexually unfaithful to Frank. In an interview Pam St. Clement has suggested that Pat and Frank are the biggest [...] "love story" [...] in EastEnders, commenting; [...] "the trouble is, they're a classic example of a couple who can't live with each other and yet don't want to live without each other." ...|$|E

50|$|Andrews’s {{innovation}} is {{to wonder whether}} “energy systems” might provide a better explanation than ideology. <b>He</b> therefore <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> view of the story—so long that {{he goes back to}} the Cretaceous to explain the formation of coal. Andrews’s account—less moral and more mineral than the standard one—runs something like this: Ancient sun-energy is stored beneath the earth.|$|R
60|$|Jonas then {{explained}} to them {{how he was going}} to burn the hornet’s nest. He said <b>he</b> should <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pole with two prongs at one end like a pitchfork, and with that fork up a bunch of hay. Then he should set the top of the hay on fire, and stand it up directly under the nest.|$|R

50|$|In his opinion, it is {{necessary}} to support those groups that are authentic movements for national self-determination or popular liberation, regardless of the ideological or cultural forms these movements take on; such differences as there may be are superficial and temporary in a historical and social perspective. While himself a leftist and atheist, he argues that it is right and just to make common cause even with conservative religious movements in so far as they are authentic representatives of popular aspirations. <b>He</b> <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> term historical view on these matters: just as one can identify progressive and democratic advances achieved by e.g. religion-driven farmers rebellions in the European Middle Ages, such as the Jan Huss or Engelbrekt uprisings, so one should attempt to support authentic popular forces and anti-Imperialist movements today, without attempting to impose ones own time-and-place-specific political agenda on their struggles.|$|R
5000|$|The Shepherd is {{suffering}} a mental breakdown {{of his own}} over the presumed death of his son. Though The Shepherd is a pastor, he realizes {{that he has no}} true belief in the Good Shepherd he preaches to others; this crisis of faith pushes him over the edge. His doctor recommends <b>he</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> vacation, so <b>he</b> spends some time wandering around the country, rediscovering and strengthening his faith. Eventually, he changes his name and moves to the hills to connect with what his son loved most. Here he finally learns of his son's secret, the subsequent death of the Matthews girl, and the identity of young Pete as his grandson. He keeps this and his true identity from everyone, knowing that Old Matt has sworn vengenance. The Shepherd also hopes to do what he can to atone for his son's actions and intends {{to spend the rest of}} his life helping these people and teaching them about the [...] "true Shepherd".|$|R

60|$|Lord Dawlish, though {{ignorant of}} this fact, pursued almost identically the same policy.

50|$|Wallace {{said that}} two-thirds of the film was quite accurate, but he {{disagreed}} with the film's portrayal of his role in the events; in particular, he objected to the impression that <b>he</b> would have <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to protest CBS's corporate policies.|$|R
60|$|He was too bitterly disappointed, on his side, {{to attempt}} to prolong the interview. A deadly sense of {{weakness}} was beginning to overpower him.

Physically and mentally he had no energy left.|$|R
