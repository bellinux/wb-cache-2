6000|$|... 'Hm!' said King drily. 'I {{was going}} to say--Flagito additis damnum, but <b>I</b> think--I <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> the process. Beetle, the {{translation}} of delubris, please.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Now, isn't he too bad?" [...] said Marianne. [...] "As if we'd {{ever been}} asked to make these sacrifices and refused! <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> women {{ready to give up}} dress and fashion and {{everything}} else for a good cause." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, dear boys," [...] he said, {{while the}} guard held {{open the door}} of the car as if to suggest haste; [...] "good-bye. It won't be very long <b>I</b> <b>think</b> before <b>I</b> <b>see</b> you again. Farewell." ...|$|R
