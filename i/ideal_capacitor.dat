25|$|Discrete {{capacitors}} {{deviate from}} the <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor.</b> An <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor</b> only stores and releases electrical energy, with no dissipation. Capacitor components have losses and parasitic inductive parts. These imperfections in material and construction can have positive implications such as linear frequency and temperature behavior in class 1 ceramic capacitors. Conversely, negative implications include the non-linear, voltage-dependent capacitance in class 2 ceramic capacitors or the insufficient dielectric insulation of capacitors leading to leakage currents.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors {{deviate from}} the <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{equation}} {{in a number}} of ways. Some of these, such as leakage current and parasitic effects are linear, or can be analyzed as nearly linear, and can be dealt with by adding virtual components to the equivalent circuit of an <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The usual methods of network analysis can then be applied. In other cases, such as with breakdown voltage, the effect is non-linear and ordinary (normal, e.g., linear) network analysis cannot be used, the effect must be dealt with separately. There is yet another group, which may be linear but invalidate the assumption in the analysis that capacitance is a constant. Such an example is temperature dependence. Finally, combined parasitic effects such as inherent inductance, resistance, or dielectric losses can exhibit non-uniform behavior at variable frequencies of operation.|$|E
25|$|The above effects often {{combine to}} cause {{non-linear}} effects within capacitors. For example, dielectric absorption {{refers to the}} inability of a capacitor that has been charged {{for a long time}} to completely discharge when briefly discharged. Although an <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor</b> would remain at zero volts after being discharged, real capacitors will develop a small voltage, a phenomenon that is also called soakage or battery action. For some dielectrics, such as many polymer films, the resulting voltage may be less than 1–2% of the original voltage. However, it can be as much as 15–25% in the case of electrolytic capacitors or supercapacitors.|$|E

50|$|Practical {{capacitors}} and inductors {{as used in}} electric circuits are {{not ideal}} components with only capacitance or inductance. However they can be treated, to a very good degree of approximation, as being <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitors</b> and inductors in series with a resistance; this resistance {{is defined as the}} equivalent series resistance (ESR).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{transient}} behaviour of RC circuits with supercapacitors, varying R between 1 and 100 'ômega'. We demonstrate that supercapacitors behave as <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{in series with}} an internal resistance (r 'DA ORDEM DE' 8 'ômega' for C = 0. 2 F, 5. 5 V). This result is important to optimize the demonstration of RC circuits using a supercapacitor in series with a light bulb, because the r value is comparable with the effective resistance of the bulb. This means that the bulb brightness is significantly decreased by r...|$|R
25|$|The {{physical}} form {{and construction of}} practical capacitors vary widely and many capacitor types are in common use. Most capacitors contain at least two electrical conductors often {{in the form of}} metallic plates or surfaces separated by a dielectric medium. A conductor may be a foil, thin film, sintered bead of metal, or an electrolyte. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor</b> does not dissipate energy.|$|E
25|$|This {{equation}} {{suggests that}} a graph of threshold stimulus strength versus stimulus duration should show a decay toward zero as stimulus duration is increased, so the stimulus strength required to reach threshold is predicted to increase during more protracted stimulation. The strength-duration curve for a typical nerve membrane is slightly skewed from the predicted graph, in that the curve flattens out in response to repetitive stimulation reaching an asymptote representing rheobase. When the duration of a stimulus is prolonged, charge transfer and membrane potential rise exponentially to a plateau (instead of increasing linearly with time). When rheobase exceeds {{the strength of the}} stimulus, stimulation fails to generate action potentials (even with large values of t); thus if the stimulus is too small, the membrane potential never reaches threshold. The disparity between the shape of the strength-duration curve predicted by Weiss's equation and the one actually observed in neural membranes can be attributed to leakage of charge that occurs under physiological conditions, a feature of the electrical resistance of the membrane. Weiss' equation predicts the relationship between stimulus strength and duration for an <b>ideal</b> <b>capacitor</b> with no leakage resistance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} RF {{as well as}} low-frequency capacitance–voltage (C–V) {{characterization of}} vertical wrap-gated InAs/high-κ nanowire MOS capacitors. A full equivalent circuit model for traps is used to fit the low-frequency C–V characteristics, from which the interface trap density (Dit) and border trap density (Nbt) are evaluated separately. The results show comparable Nbt but far lower Dit (< 10 E 12 eV− 1 cm− 2 near the conduction band edge) for a nanowire MOS gate-stack compared with planar references. In the RF domain, the influence of nanowire series resistances become significant, and by introducing a distributed RC-model, the nanowire resistivity (ρnw) is evaluated from the capacitance data {{as a function of}} the gate bias. An ON/OFF ρnw ratio of 10 E− 2 is obtained for the best device.

Secondly, the almost limitless slew–rate provided by the class AB input stage that makes it superior to the VOA counterpart. Additionally; this paper also concerns the definitions and measurements of the terminal parameters of the CFOA, regarded as a ‘black box’. It does not deal with the way that these parameters {{are related to the}} properties of the active passive and active components of a particular circuit configuration. Simulation is used in terminal parameter determination: this brings with it the facility of using test conditions that would not normally prevail in a laboratory test on silicon implementations of the CFOAs. Thus, we can apply 1 mA and 1 mV test signals from, respectively, infinite and zero source impedances that range in frequency from d. c to some tens of GHz.

These designed, fabricated and tested devices include radio frequency (RF) micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) switches, single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) RF MEMS switches, nano fabricated capacitors and switching devices, and micromachined microstrip patch antennas. Coplanar waveguide (CPW) RF capacitive switches in shunt and series configuration {{were designed for}} high isolation, low insertion loss, and fast switching speed. Switches with 3 ̆e 35 dB isolation, 3 ̆c 0. 3 dB insertion loss and switching speeds in the 102 ̆ 7 s of microseconds were fabricated and measured. These switches were packaged using photo-imagable resists and flip-chip bonding techniques. The MEMS shunt switch topology was also implemented into a single-pole-double-throw (SPDT) design by utilizing two such switches in a series and a shunt configuration, offset by a quarter wavelength section to provide a RF shor t at the input of the shunt switch in the off state. This type of design {{has the advantage of}} requiring a simple on-off (0 V and 35 V) bias supply to select the switch state. Also, the use of a focused ion beam (FIB) tool to mill sub-micron gaps in CPW transmission line structures was investigated.
