5|$|The {{breeding}} season is {{during the summer}} rainy season (mainly June to August in India) but can vary. Laboratory {{studies have found that}} long day illumination and high humidity trigger <b>gonadal</b> growth. The song of the male is very soft but complex and variable, audible only at close range. This song described as a jingle consists of a series of high notes followed by a croaky rattle and ending in a slurred whistle. When singing the male sits in what is called the slope posture—erect with the head feathers raised.|$|E
5|$|Because it is {{a common}} estuarine fish, it has been used in studies of heavy metal {{contamination}} in coastal waters. Fish tested around Sydney showed uptake was highest in the gonads, then muscle, gills and liver. It is unclear why metal concentrations were lower in toadfish livers (compared with studies of contamination in other fish) but their liver cells may be more effective at removing these elements. Lead, cadmium and nickel levels corresponded with those in the sediment from which the fish were taken, suggesting dietary intake. The gonads of male fish had twenty times as much arsenic as those of females, while the gills of female fish contained thirty times as much lead as those of males. Raised levels of arsenic, cobalt, cadmium and lead in gills suggested the fish absorbed these from the surrounding water. An experiment exposing smooth toadfish to radioactive cadmium and selenium in either food or water found that cadmium in food was taken up in and excreted by the liver, while cadmium in water was taken up in the gut lining and excreted in liver, gills and kidney, indicating the fish were consuming a lot of water. Selenium was taken up in the gills, kidneys and liver regardless of whether it was in food or water.Cd and 75Se from Water and Food by an Estuarine Fish (Tetractenos glaber) | journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity| doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.012| pmid=17884259}} Fieldwork in Sydney waterways showed that higher arsenic, lead, cadmium and cobalt corresponded with decreased lipid levels in liver and <b>gonadal</b> tissue, and raised cobalt and nickel correspond to increased protein levels in muscle, liver and <b>gonadal</b> tissue. Raised lead levels were consistent with smaller egg size. A study of asymmetry of fish bones in smooth toadfish in various parts of Sydney and Hawkesbury River estuaries showed a relationship between exposure to organochlorine pesticides but not heavy metals, indicating the finding may correlate to stress from organic toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. <b>Gonadal</b> growth and hormone production in males begin a few months before the breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E
5|$|Only Phoronis ovalis {{naturally}} builds colonies by budding or by splitting into top {{and bottom}} sections which then grow into full bodies. In experiments, other species have split successfully, but only when both parts have enough <b>gonadal</b> (reproductive) tissue. All phoronids breed sexually from spring to autumn. Some species are hermaphroditic (have {{both male and female}} reproductive organs) but cross-fertilize (fertilize the eggs of other members), while others are dioecious (have separate sexes). The gametes (sperms and ova) are produced in the swollen gonads, around the stomach. The gametes swim through the metacoelom to the metanephridia. Sperm exit by the nephridiopores and some are captured by the lophophores of individuals of the same species. Species that lay small fertilized eggs release them into the water as plankton, while species with larger eggs brood them either in the body's tube or stuck {{in the center of the}} lophophore by adhesive. The brooded eggs are released to feed on plankton when they develop into larvae.|$|E
5|$|The spiny scallop anchors {{itself to}} the {{substrate}} with a few byssus threads. It is unclear what {{the purpose of these}} is but they may serve to help orient the scallop with regard to the current for optimal feeding. Another possibility is that they may angle the scallop ready for a quick getaway. They are easily broken when the scallop starts to swim. It is a filter feeder. It exposes its mantle by separating its valves and passes water through its gills by ciliary action. A large scallop can process about 4 litres of water an hour per gram of its weight. Phytoplankton are sieved from the water by the gills and moved to the mouth in ciliated grooves. Here they are sorted by a pair of labial palps (mouth appendages), before being ingested. Rejected particles are formed into mucous-wrapped blobs. These are ejected from the mantle cavity at intervals along with the faeces by a rapid clapping of the valves. When the gonads are ripening, a raised level of microalgae in the diet has been found to increase <b>gonadal</b> development. At this time, glycogen storage in the main adductor muscle is depleted as energy is transferred from there to the gonads.|$|E
25|$|Activin {{causes the}} {{transcription}} of mRNAs involved in <b>gonadal</b> growth, embryo differentiation and placenta formation.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>gonadal</b> steroids pre-dates their {{identification}} and isolation. Medical use of testicle extract {{began in the}} late 19th century while its effects on strength were still being studied. The isolation of <b>gonadal</b> steroids {{can be traced back to}} 1931, when Adolf Butenandt, a chemist in Marburg, purified 15 milligrams of the male hormone androstenone from tens of thousands of litres of urine. This steroid was subsequently synthesized in 1934 by Leopold Ružička, a chemist in Zurich.|$|E
25|$|In {{a general}} sense, the {{conclusion}} of puberty is reproductive maturity. Criteria for defining the conclusion may differ for different purposes: attainment {{of the ability to}} reproduce, achievement of maximal adult height, maximal <b>gonadal</b> size, or adult sex hormone levels. Maximal adult height is achieved at an average age of 15 years for an average girl and 18 years for an average boy. Potential fertility (sometimes termed nubility) usually precedes completion of growth by 1–2 years in girls and 3–4 years in boys. Stage 5 typically represents maximal <b>gonadal</b> growth and adult hormone levels.|$|E
25|$|Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} circulating androgen hormone and can be rapidly metabolized within target tissues into potent androgens and estrogens. <b>Gonadal</b> steroids generally regulate aggression during the breeding season, but non-gonadal steroids may regulate aggression during the non-breeding season. Castration of various species in the non-breeding season {{has no effect on}} territorial aggression. In several avian studies, circulating DHEA {{has been found to be}} elevated in birds during the non-breeding season. These data support the idea that non-breeding birds combine adrenal and/or <b>gonadal</b> DHEA synthesis with neural DHEA metabolism to maintain territorial behavior when <b>gonadal</b> testosterone secretion is low. Similar results have been found in studies involving different strains of rats, mice, and hamsters. DHEA levels also have been studied in humans and may play a role in human aggression. Circulating DHEAS (its sulfated ester) levels rise during adrenarche (~7 years of age) while plasma testosterone levels are relatively low. This implies that aggression in pre-pubertal children with aggressive conduct disorder might be correlated with plasma DHEAS rather than plasma testosterone, suggesting an important link between DHEAS and human aggressive behavior.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} achieved, progesterone by intramuscular injection at the usual clinical dose range is able to suppress gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, demonstrating antigonadotropic efficacy (and therefore suppression of <b>gonadal</b> sex steroid production).|$|E
25|$|In {{neonatal}} life, <b>gonadal</b> steroids {{influence the}} development of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. For instance, they determine the ability of females to exhibit a normal reproductive cycle, and of males and females to display appropriate reproductive behaviors in adult life.|$|E
25|$|There {{are three}} activins: Activin A, Activin B and Activin AB. Activins are {{involved}} in embryogenesis and osteogenesis. They also regulate many hormones including pituitary, <b>gonadal</b> and hypothalamic hormones as well as insulin. They are also nerve cell survival factors.|$|E
25|$|Hypogonadism, a {{decrease}} in male sex hormones may manifest as impotence, infertility, loss of sexual drive, and testicular atrophy, and can result from primary <b>gonadal</b> injury or suppression of hypothalamic/pituitary function. Hypogonadism is associated with cirrhosis due to alcoholism or hemochromatosis.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{observed}} in adult males with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) {{has been associated}} with testicular adrenal rest tumors (TART) that may originate during childhood. TART in prepubertal males with classic CAH could be found during childhood (20%). Martinez-Aguayo et al. reported differences in markers of <b>gonadal</b> function in a subgroup of patients, especially in those with inadequate control.|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of the onset of puberty may depend on perspective (e.g., hormonal versus physical) and purpose (establishing population normal standards, clinical care of early or late pubescent individuals, etc.). A common definition for the onset of puberty is physical changes to a person's body. These physical changes are the first visible signs of neural, hormonal, and <b>gonadal</b> function changes.|$|E
25|$|The {{testicle}} or testis is {{the male}} reproductive gland in all animals, including humans. It is homologous {{to the female}} ovary. The functions of the testes are to produce both sperm and androgens, primarily testosterone. Testosterone release {{is controlled by the}} anterior pituitary luteinizing hormone; whereas sperm production is controlled both by the anterior pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone and <b>gonadal</b> testosterone.|$|E
25|$|Sex steroids are not {{the only}} {{important}} influences upon hypothalamic development; in particular, pre-pubertal stress in early life (of rats) determines the capacity of the adult hypothalamus to respond to an acute stressor. Unlike <b>gonadal</b> steroid receptors, glucocorticoid receptors are very widespread throughout the brain; in the paraventricular nucleus, they mediate negative feedback control of CRF synthesis and secretion, but elsewhere their role is not well understood.|$|E
25|$|In the {{minority}} of cases with bilaterally non-palpable testes, further testing {{to locate the}} testes, assess their function, and exclude additional problems is often useful. Pelvic ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging performed and interpreted by a radiologist can often, but not invariably, locate the testes while confirming absence of a uterus. A karyotype can confirm or exclude forms of dysgenetic primary hypogonadism, such as Klinefelter syndrome or mixed <b>gonadal</b> dysgenesis.|$|E
25|$|However, feminizing {{reconstructive}} surgery {{continued to be}} recommended and performed throughout the 1990s on most virilized infant girls with CAH, as well as infants with ambiguity due to androgen insensitivity syndrome, <b>gonadal</b> dysgenesis, and some XY infants with severe genital birth defects such as cloacal exstrophy. Masculinizing {{reconstructive surgery}} continued on boys with severe hypospadias and the other conditions outlined above, with continued modifications and refinements intended to reduce unsatisfactory outcomes.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{control of}} {{spermatogenesis}} varies among species. In humans the mechanism {{is not completely}} understood; however {{it is known that}} initiation of spermatogenesis occurs at puberty due to the interaction of the hypothalamus, pituitary gland and Leydig cells. If the pituitary gland is removed, spermatogenesis can still be initiated by follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and testosterone. In contrast to FSH, LH appears to have little role in spermatogenesis outside of inducing <b>gonadal</b> testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|Hypopituitarism {{commonly}} develops after {{radiation therapy}} for sellar and parasellar neoplasms, extrasellar brain tumours, {{head and neck}} tumours, and following whole body irradiation for systemic malignancies. Radiation-induced hypopituitarism mainly affects growth hormone and <b>gonadal</b> hormones. In contrast, adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) deficiencies are the least common among people with radiation-induced hypopituitarism. Changes in prolactin-secretion is usually mild, and vasopressin deficiency appears to be very rare {{as a consequence of}} radiation.|$|E
25|$|Long term {{glucocorticoid}} replacement {{issues are}} similar to those of 21-hydroxylase CAH, and involve careful balance between doses sufficient to suppress androgens while avoiding suppression of growth. Because the enzyme defect does not affect sex steroid synthesis, <b>gonadal</b> function at puberty and long-term fertility should be normal if adrenal androgen production is controlled. See congenital adrenal hyperplasia for a more detailed discussion of androgen suppression and fertility potential in adolescent and adult women.|$|E
25|$|Infertility {{is often}} {{described}} as a characteristic of A-T. Whereas this is certainly the case for the mouse model of A-T, in humans it may be more accurate to characterize the reproductive abnormality as <b>gonadal</b> atrophy or dysgenesis characterized by delayed pubertal development. Because programmed DSBs are generated to initiate genetic recombinations involved in the production of sperm and eggs in reproductive organs (a process known as meiosis), meiotic defects and arrest can occur when ATM is not present.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosing {{germ cell}} tumors may be {{difficult}} because the normal menstrual cycle and puberty can cause pain and pelvic symptoms, and a young woman may even believe these symptoms to be those of pregnancy, and not seek treatment due to the stigma of teen pregnancy. Blood tests for alpha-fetoprotein, karyotype, human chorionic gonadotropin, and liver function are used to diagnose germ cell tumor and potential co-occurring <b>gonadal</b> dysgenesis. A germ cell tumor may be initially mistaken for a benign ovarian cyst.|$|E
25|$|<b>Gonadal</b> steroidgenesis {{in girls}} starts with {{production}} of testosterone which is typically quickly converted to estradiol inside the ovaries. However {{the rate of}} conversion from testosterone to estradiol (driven by FSH/LH balance) during early puberty is highly individual, resulting in very diverse development patterns of secondary sexual characteristics. Production of progesterone in the ovaries begins {{with the development of}} ovulatory cycles in girls (during the lutheal phase of the cycle), before puberty low levels of progesterone are produced in the adrenal glands of both boys and girls.|$|E
25|$|During {{mammalian}} development, the gonads are {{at first}} capable of becoming either ovaries or testes. In humans, starting at about week 4, the <b>gonadal</b> rudiments are present within the intermediate mesoderm {{adjacent to the}} developing kidneys. At about week 6, epithelial sex cords develop within the forming testes and incorporate the germ cells as they migrate into the gonads. In males, certain Y chromosome genes, particularly SRY, control development of the male phenotype, including conversion of the early bipotential gonad into testes. In males, the sex cords fully invade the developing gonads.|$|E
25|$|Hormone {{replacement}} therapy {{is an integral}} component in the medical treatment of transgender individuals, as the hormones can lead to decreasing the dichotomy between an individual's body and their gender identity. Managing long-term hormonal regimens have not been studied and are difficult to estimate because research on the long-term use of hormonal therapy has not been noted. However, {{it is possible to}} speculate the outcomes of these therapies on transgender people based on the knowledge of the current effects of <b>gonadal</b> hormones on sexual functioning in cisgender men and women.|$|E
25|$|The major {{effect of}} estrogenicity is {{gynecomastia}} (woman-like breasts). AAS {{that have a}} high potential for aromatization like testosterone and particularly methyltestosterone show {{a high risk of}} gynecomastia, while AAS that have a reduced potential for aromatization like nandrolone show a much lower risk (though still significant at high dosages). In contrast, AAS that are 4,5α-reduced, and some other AAS (e.g., 11β-methylated 19-nortestosterone derivatives), have no risk of gynecomastia. In addition to gynecomastia, AAS with high estrogenicity have increased antigonadotropic activity, which results in increased potency in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and <b>gonadal</b> testosterone production.|$|E
25|$|The testes {{begin as}} an {{immigration}} of primordial germ cells into testicular cords along the <b>gonadal</b> ridge in the abdomen {{of the early}} embryo. The interaction of several male genes organizes this developing gonad into a testis rather than an ovary by the second month of gestation. During the 3rd to 5th months, the cells in the testes differentiate into testosterone-producing Leydig cells, and anti-Müllerian hormone-producing Sertoli cells. The germ cells in this environment become fetal spermatogonia. Male external genitalia develop during the 3rd and 4th months of gestation and the fetus continues to grow, develop, and differentiate.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{oxytocin}} differentially affects males and females. Females who are administered oxytocin are overall faster in responding to socially relevant stimuli than males who received oxytocin. Additionally, after the administration of oxytocin, females show increased amygdala activity in response to threatening scenes; however, males do not show increased amygdala activation. This phenomenon can be explained by looking at the role of <b>gonadal</b> hormones, specifically estrogen, which modulate the enhanced threat processing seen in females. Estrogen {{has been shown}} to stimulate the release of oxytocin from the hypothalamus and promote receptor binding in the amygdala.|$|E
25|$|Pure AR antagonists like {{flutamide}} and bicalutamide are potent progonadotropins with indirect estrogenic {{activity in}} males. This {{is because they}} block the AR in the pituitary gland and hypothalamus and thereby inhibit the negative feedback of androgens on the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. This, in turn, results in increased gonadotropin secretion, activation of <b>gonadal</b> steroidogenesis, and an up to 2-fold increase in testosterone levels and 2.5-fold increase in estradiol levels. Conversely, AR antagonists that are also progestogens, like cyproterone acetate, are not progonadotropic, as activation of the PR is antigonadotropic, and, indeed, cyproterone acetate is potently antigonadotropic in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|Changes in {{endogenous}} {{testosterone levels}} may {{also contribute to}} differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio between testosterone and synthetic AAS. AR agonists are antigonadotropic – that is, they dose-dependently suppress <b>gonadal</b> testosterone production and hence reduce systemic testosterone concentrations. By suppressing endogenous testosterone levels and effectively replacing AR signaling in the body {{with that of the}} exogenous AAS, the myotrophic-androgenic ratio would be expected to be further increased, and this hence may be yet an additional mechanism contributing to the differences in myotrophic-androgenic ratio. In addition, some AAS, such as nandrolone, are also potent progestogens, and activation of the progesterone receptor is antigonadotropic similarly to activation of the AR. As such, combined progestogenic activity might further increase the myotrophic-androgenic ratio for a given AAS.|$|E
25|$|In both sexes, the {{hypothalamus}} produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{to stimulate}} the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This in turn cause the gonads to produce sex steroids such as androgens and estrogens. In adolescents of either sex with relevant indicators, GnRH analogues such as goserelin acetate {{can be used to}} stop undesired pubertal changes for a period without inducing any changes toward the sex with which the patient currently identifies. GnRH agonists work by initially overstimulating the pituitary gland, then rapidly desensitizing it to the effects of GnRH. After an initial surge, over a period of weeks, <b>gonadal</b> androgen production is greatly reduced. Conversely, GnRH antagonists act by blocking the action of GnRH in the pituitary gland.|$|E
25|$|The ovary is {{differentiated}} into {{a central}} part, the medulla of ovary, {{covered by a}} surface layer, the germinal epithelium. The immature ova originate from cells from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac. Once they have reached the <b>gonadal</b> ridge they are called oogonia. Development proceeds and the oogonia become fully surrounded by a layer of connective tissue cells (pre-granulosa cells) In this way, the rudiments of the ovarian follicles are formed. The embryological origin of granulosa cells, on the other hand, remains controversial. Just as in the male, there is a gubernaculum in the female, which pulls it downward, albeit {{not as much as}} in males. The gubernaculum later becomes the proper ovarian ligament and the round ligament of the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Dysgerminoma {{accounts}} for 35% {{of ovarian cancer}} in young women and {{is the most likely}} germ cell tumor to metastasize to the lymph nodes; nodal metastases occur in 25–30% of cases. These tumors may have mutations in the KIT gene, a mutation known for its role in gastrointestinal stromal tumor. People with an XY karyotype and ovaries (<b>gonadal</b> dysgenesis) or an X,0 karyotype and ovaries (Turner syndrome) who develop a unilateral dysgerminoma are at risk for a gonadoblastoma in the other ovary, and in this case, both ovaries are usually removed when a unilateral dysgerminoma is discovered to avoid the risk of another malignant tumor. Gonadoblastomas in people with Swyer or Turner syndrome become malignant in approximately 40% of cases. However, in general, dysgerminomas are bilateral 10–20% of the time.|$|E
25|$|High {{doses of}} progestogens exert {{negative}} {{feedback on the}} hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis by activating the progesterone receptor. As a result, they have antigonadotropic effects – that is, they suppress the <b>gonadal</b> production of sex hormones such as androgens. As such, sufficient dosages of progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, gestonorone caproate, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, megestrol acetate, and MPA, can considerably lower androgen levels. In addition, certain other progestogens, such as cyproterone acetate, megestrol acetate, drospirenone, and nomegestrol acetate, bind to and block the activation of the androgen receptor. On the other hand, certain other progestogens, including 19-nortestosterone derivatives like levonorgestrel, norgestrel, norethisterone, and norethisterone acetate, as well as, to a lesser extent, the 17α-hydroxyprogesterone derivative MPA, have weak androgenic activity because they bind to and activate the androgen receptor similarly to testosterone, and may produce androgenic effects such as acne, hirsutism, and increased sex drive.|$|E
