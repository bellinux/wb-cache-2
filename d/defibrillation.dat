5|$|Syracuse University Ambulance, {{commonly}} referred to as SUA, is a SU Health Services-based student organization that responds to over 1,500 medical emergencies each year. Providing intermediate life support (ILS), rapid cardiac <b>defibrillation,</b> emergency and nonemergency transportation, and special event standby services, SUA operates two full-time transporting ambulances, a supervisor's fly car, and a MCI trailer for mass-casualty incidents. Additionally, SUA operates four transport vans for non-emergency transports. Advanced life support (ALS) mutual aid is provided by the City of Syracuse's private EMS provider, Rural/Metro Medical Services. SUA was formed in 1973 by a group of students out of a need for emergency medical services on campus. Starting with only a few members and meager equipment, the Syracuse University Medical Crisis Unit was formed. The organization has evolved greatly over time but, with 70+ volunteer students, remains a student-run organization to this day. SUA provides emergency and non-emergency services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week during the academic school year and is funded by a portion of the student health fee.|$|E

25|$|<b>Defibrillation</b> is the {{definitive}} treatment of ventricular fibrillation, whereby an electrical current {{is applied to}} the ventricular mass either directly or externally through pads or paddles, with the aim of depolarising enough of the myocardium for co-ordinated contractions to occur again. The use of this is often dictated around the world by Advanced Cardiac Life Support or Advanced Life Support algorithms, which is taught to medical practitioners including doctors, nurses and paramedics and also advocates the use of drugs, predominantly epinephrine, after every second unsuccessful attempt at <b>defibrillation,</b> as well as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in between <b>defibrillation</b> attempts. Though ALS/ACLS algorithms encourage the use of drugs, they state first and foremost that <b>defibrillation</b> should not be delayed for any other intervention and that adequate cardiopulmonary resuscitation be delivered with minimal interruption.|$|E

40|$|Catecholaminergic {{polymorphic}} {{ventricular tachycardia}} (CPVT) is a familial cardiac arrhythmia that {{is related to}} RYR 2 or CASQ 2 gene mutation. It occurs in patients with structurally normal heart and causes exercise-emotiontriggered syncope and sudden cardiac death. We experienced a case of CPVT in an 11 year-old female patient who was admitted for sudden cardiovascular collapse.

25|$|Biventricular pacing {{alone is}} {{referred}} to as CRT-P (for pacing).

30|$|We {{identified}} 47 (4 %) {{patients with}} cirrhosis in our cohort. This finding {{is comparable to}} publications of critical illness, where prevalence of cirrhosis was about 4 – 7 % in the general intensive care setting [31, 32]. These patients had significantly higher SOFA, SAPS II and CCI on hospital admission. Time to ROSC was comparable between patients with and without cirrhosis. However, we observed several significant differences in CA in patients with and without cirrhosis. First, a cardiac aetiology was less frequent and patients with cirrhosis {{were more likely to}} have a non-shockable initial ECG rhythm. Second, cumulative epinephrine dosage was higher during CPR and third <b>defibrillations</b> were less frequently performed in patients with cirrhosis. These differences seem to be mainly a consequence of the fact that patients with cirrhosis frequently developed CA following complications of cirrhosis like variceal haemorrhage, severe infection or severe electrolyte disturbances.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) {{overdose}} is {{rare and}} potentially deadly when consumed in large doses. Management of severe HCQ toxicity is limited and infrequently reported. This report presents {{the case of}} a massive ingestion of HCQ. Case Report. A 23 -year-old female presents following an intentional ingestion of approximately 40 [*]g of HCQ. Within six hours after ingestion, she developed severe hemodynamic instability resulting from myocardial irritability with frequent ventricular ectopic activity leading to runs of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PMVT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF) requiring multiple <b>defibrillations.</b> Additional treatments included intravenous diazepam, epinephrine, norepinephrine, sodium bicarbonate, and magnesium sulfate. Despite the ongoing hemodynamic instability, the patient was also treated with Intralipid (ILE) and received hemodialysis. Improvements in her hemodynamics were observed after 18 hours. She survived her massive overdose of HCQ. Conclusion. HCQ poisoning is rare but serious because of its rapid progression to life-threatening symptoms. Hemodynamic support, gastric decontamination, electrolyte monitoring and replacement, and management of arrhythmias are the mainstays of treatment.

40|$|Both histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) {{solution}} and Braile miniplegia are commercially available and used with high success. The {{objective of this}} work was to compare the effects of both strategies in an animal model. Twelve pigs were divided into control, HTK, or Braile groups using a model of controlled global cardiac ischemia/reperfusion under cardiopulmonary bypass with 1 hour heart ischemia followed by 2 hour reperfusion. No {{significant differences were found}} over time or between groups for heart rate, arrhythmia, number of <b>defibrillations</b> required, blood gases, myocardial lactate production, myocardial oxygen consumption, nor coronary flow index. The Braile strategy was associated with a lower 120 minute postreperfusion coronary vascular resistance with higher water content, leukocyte infiltration, and oxidative damage compared with controls. Drainage of HTK solution to the venous return was followed by higher potassium and lower sodium blood concentrations. One-hour heart preservation with HTK or Braile systems followed by 2 hour reperfusion both allow for acceptable preservation of the healthy pig myocardium.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: A {{prospective}} {{assessment of}} neuropsychological impairment {{in the early}} postoperative stage after coronary bypass surgery. METHODS: Seventy patients undergoing elective coronary bypass surgery (CABG) were investigated preoperatively, two to three and five to nine days postoperatively with a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment including orientation, word fluency, naming, arithmetic, memory, and visuoconstructive tasks. RESULTS: Patients exhibited significant early postoperative impairment affecting all tasks but naming. Except for the orientation measurement, most patients recovered by the fifth to ninth postoperative day. Only six patients had delirium according to DSM III-R criteria on {{the second or third}} postoperative day. Cluster analysis of neuropsychological data obtained on the second to third postoperative day identified 10 patients who were cognitively compromised. As a group, these patients had required a greater number of <b>defibrillations</b> and exhibited lower cardiac indices postoperatively. Preoperatively, patients at risk for postoperative dysfunction were characterised by lower verbal memory, word fluency, and clock orientation scores.

25|$|Spontaneous {{conversion}} of ventricular fibrillation {{to a more}} benign rhythm is rare in all but small animals. <b>Defibrillation</b> is the process that converts ventricular fibrillation to a more benign rhythm.

25|$|The {{idea for}} an {{automated}} defibrillator was first conceived by Dr. Arch Diack, a surgeon in Portland, Oregon. His prototype, literally assembled in a basement, utilized a unique defibrillatory pathway – tongue to chest. There was a breath detector {{that was a}} safeguard to prevent shocking breathing persons. The electrode was essentially a rate counter, far cruder than today’s sophisticated VF detectors. The production model weighed 35pounds and gave verbal instructions. It was an idea ahead of its time. Most people viewed it as a curiosity. By the late 1980s, however, other manufacturers entered the field leading to the automated external defibrillators (AEDs) we have today. Current AEDs, like regular defibrillators, use electrode pads attached to the chest. AEDs are programmed to guide the operator (with a series of voice prompts) through the procedure. The pads once attached automatically detect the type of heart rhythm and if VF is present the AED instructs the operator to press a button (usually flashing red) to shock the patient. From EMT <b>defibrillation</b> with AEDs, there was a natural and logical progression to first responder <b>defibrillation</b> (AEDs used by police or security personnel), next widespread Public Access <b>Defibrillation</b> (AEDs used by lay persons in public locations such as airports, schools, exercise facilities, etc.) and finally home AED including the opportunity to purchase AEDs over the counter without a prescription.|$|E
25|$|The {{precordial}} thump is a manoeuver {{promoted as}} a mechanical alternative to <b>defibrillation.</b> Some advanced life support algorithms advocate its use once {{and only in}} the case of witnessed and monitored V-fib arrests as the likelihood of it successfully cardioverting a patient are small and this diminishes quickly in the first minute of onset.|$|E
40|$|In {{the case}} of acute {{myocardial}} infarction (AMI), prompt and appropriate initial treatment is essential for increasing the rate of survival and early reperfusion is a main determinant factor for long-term prognosis. The survival of a patient with refractory ventricular fibrillation {{was made possible by}} cooperative emergency medical care including air medical transport, despite long distance to the hospital. The patient was a 60 -year-old man. Under a diagnosis of AMI, a helicopter emergency medical service (HEMS) with medical staff on board was requested. Although ventricular fibrillation (VF) occurred at the scene, quick and appropriate advanced cardiovascular life support (ACLS) was provided by the attending doctor, leading to the return of heartbeat. Since the patient still exhibited serious bradycardia and cardiac failure, he was airlifted while undergoing transcutaneous pacing. Upon arrival at the hospital, the patient underwent emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). During the PCI, VF recurred and chest compressions and a total of 17 <b>defibrillations</b> were performed. The PCI was continued with percutaneous cardiopulmonary support (PCPS). The patient survived without sequelae. Smoother cooperation between pre-hospital medical procedures and post-hospital emergency care is considered to be essential for the survival of patients such as this case...|$|R
40|$|Background. During {{resuscitation}} {{of cardiac}} arrest victims {{a variety of}} information in electronic format is recorded {{as part of the}} documentation of the patient care contact and in order to be provided for case review for quality improvement.

A minimal set of variables is defined which describe therapeutic events (compression sequences and <b>defibrillations)</b> and corresponding patient response events (annotated rhythm transitions). From this a state sequence representation of the resuscitation episode is constructed and an algorithm is developed for reasoning with this representation and extract review variables automatically. As a case study, the method is applied to the data abstraction process used in the King County EMS. The automatically generated variables are compared to the original ones with accuracies ≥ 90 % for 18 variables and ≥ 85 % for the remaining four variables. Conclusions.

40|$|AbstractObjective: Controlled reperfusion and {{secondary}} cardioplegia {{are used to}} minimize reperfusion injury. The mechanisms for their benefit are incompletely defined and may include attenuation of myocyte sodium uptake. Methods: Pigs had 1 hour of cardioplegic arrest followed by reperfusion with blood (control) or warm cardioplegic solution followed by blood (test). Reperfusion injury in the control and test groups was quantified by measuring changes of intramyocyte ion content with atomic absorption spectrometry and by analyzing electrophysiologic recovery from recordings of reperfusion arrhythmias. Results: Control animals had an increase in intramyocyte sodium content at 5 minutes after initiating reperfusion (+ 20. 2 μmol/g dry weight, P <. 04), whereas the test group had an insignificant decrease (– 14. 0 μmol/g dry weight, P =. 33). The first rhythm after initiating reperfusion was more often ventricular fibrillation {{in the control group}} (100 % vs 50 %, P <. 02), and the control group required more <b>defibrillations</b> to establish a nonfibrillating rhythm (4. 5 ± 1. 2 vs 1. 1 ± 0. 3, P <. 03). Conclusions: Controlled reperfusion eliminated the increase in intramyocyte sodium that was observed in the control group at 5 minutes after cardioplegic arrest. This improvement in myocyte ion homeostasis during postcardioplegia reperfusion was associated with fewer reperfusion arrhythmias. These data support the hypothesis that attenuation of myocyte sodium gain during postischemic reperfusion is a mechanism by which controlled reperfusion {{and secondary}} cardioplegia are beneficial.
