Dyngus Day is widely celebrated on the Monday after Easter and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city elections campaign season. Fat Tuesday is also celebrated in South Bend, with paczkis being a staple food product {{in the city for}} the day. The city and surrounding county have 23 Catholic churches, 11 Catholic schools and three Catholic universities (the University of Notre Dame, Holy Cross College, and Saint Mary's College, all located in the adjacent city of Notre Dame).|$|E
5|$|The {{delineation}} of the Riverina {{region by}} {{government agencies and}} other bodies varies, but in common usage it generally comprises the agricultural and pastoral areas of New South Wales, west of the Great Dividing Range and in the drainage basin of the snow-fed Murray and Murrumbidgee Rivers. The northern boundary beyond the Riverina {{is determined by the}} Lachlan River catchment area and {{is referred to as the}} Central West. Along the Murray to the south, the Riverina borders the state of Victoria.

25|$|Western astrology {{is based}} mainly upon the {{construction}} of a horoscope, which is a map or chart of the heavens at a particular moment. The moment chosen <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> existence of the subject of the horoscope, as it is believed that the subject will carry with it the pattern of the heavens from that moment throughout its life. The most common form of horoscope is the natal chart based on the moment of a person's birth; though in theory a horoscope can be drawn up for the beginning of anything, from a business enterprise to the foundation of a nation state.|$|E
25|$|In The Book of the Heavenly Cow, {{the results}} of the {{destruction}} of mankind seem to mark the end of the direct reign of the gods and of the linear time of myth. The beginning of Ra's journey <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cyclical time of the present. Yet in other sources, mythic time continues after this change. Egyptian accounts give sequences of divine rulers who take the place of the sun god as king on earth, each reigning for many thousands of years. Although accounts differ as to which gods reigned and in what order, the succession from Ra-Atum to his descendants Shu and Geb—in which the kingship passes to the male in each generation of the Ennead—is common. Both of them face revolts that parallel those in the reign of the sun god, but the revolt that receives the most attention in Egyptian sources is the one in the reign of Geb's heir Osiris.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} father-figures {{is one that}} is {{explored}} throughout The X-Files, in relation to both Mulder and Scully.

Both of the protagonists have deep-rooted family issues and this episode <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exploration of that story arc.

500|$|In the May 2014 {{elections}} for the European Parliament, the Party for Freedom received 17.0% of the vote and four seats, a slight gain compared to the 13.3% of the vote the party had received in the previous parliamentary elections. In the run-up to and aftermath of those European elections, Wilders worked with the French Front National's Marine Le Pen to try {{to form a new}} parliamentary group in the European Parliament. They first announced their collaboration during a joint press conference in November 2013, where Wilders vowed that [...] "today <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> liberation from the European elite, the monster in Brussels". Wilders visited the Sweden Democrats party and spoke with the Austrian Freedom party's leader Heinz-Christian Strache to help bring about the alliance, even while rejecting Hungary's Jobbik and Germany's NPD because he wanted to exclude [...] "right-wing extremist and racist" [...] parties. Three days after the elections finished, Le Pen and Wilders presented another press conference, this time with Matteo Salvini of Italy's Northern League, Harald Vilimsky of Austria's Freedom Party and Gerolf Annemans of Belgium's Flemish Interest party, to promise that the parliamentary group would be formed. Eventually, however, the effort failed because it could only unite parties from six EU member states, one fewer than is required by parliamentary rules. This was in part due to a refusal to include the Greek Golden Dawn or Poland's Congress of the New Right, and in part because parties like the Danish People's party and the True Finns refused to join.|$|E

For {{northbound}} thru-hikers, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main challenges {{that go beyond}} enduring distance and time: in New Hampshire and Maine, rough or steep ground are more frequent and alpine conditions are found near summits and along ridges. The trail reaches 17 of the 48 four-thousand footers of New Hampshire, including [...] Mount Washington, the highest point of the AT north of Tennessee and most topographically prominent peak in eastern North America. The trail passes within half a mile of 7 additional 4000-footer peaks in the Whites. Entering the alpine zone on the summit of Mount Pierce, from the south, the trail continues in alpine or near-alpine scrub continuously along the high Presidential ridge until descending the southeast flank of Mount Madison into the Great Gulf Wilderness over 12 miles northward. This region is subject to extremes of weather with little natural shelter and only occasional man-made shelter from the elements. Though greatest from November to May, the threat of severe and cold conditions in the Presidentials and across the New Hampshire Section is present year-round and requires hikers' careful attention to weather forecasts and planning, provisions and gear. [...] The Dartmouth Outing Club maintains the AT from the Vermont border past Mount Moosilauke to Kinsman Notch, northwest of Woodstock, New Hampshire, Randolph Mountain Club maintains 2.2 miles from Osgood Trail near Madison Hut to Edmands Col, with the AMC maintaining the remaining miles through the state.|$|E
