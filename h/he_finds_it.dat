Disillusioned {{with the world}} as <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it,</b> he recruits a team of mutants to cleanse mankind and create a new world order, over which he will reign.

5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him so much that <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get {{a place in the}} dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the good things he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E
5|$|In the Mediterranean Sea, Italian {{fishermen}} rescue {{an unconscious}} American (Matt Damon) floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. They tend to his wounds, {{and when the}} man wakes, they find he suffers from dissociative amnesia. He has no memory of his own identity, while he retains his speech and finds himself capable of advanced combat skills and fluency in several languages. The skipper finds a tiny laser projector under the man's hip that, when activated, gives a number of a safe deposit box in Zürich. Upon landing in Imperia (Italy), the man heads to the bank in Switzerland to investigate the deposit box. <b>He</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> contains a large sum of money in various currencies, numerous passports and identity cards with his picture on all of them, and a handgun.

5|$|The Deimon Devil Bats {{enter the}} spring tournament; they lose to the Ojo White Knights, but Sena decides {{to stay on}} the team because <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> fun. They train for the autumn tournament, hoping to be the best team in Tokyo and advance to the Kanto tournament and the Christmas Bowl (between the best high-school American {{football}} teams in Japan). Despite Hiruma's desire to keep the identity of Eyeshield 21 a secret, Sena reveals his identity to his teammates when they are training in the United States. He later reveals his identity to Mamori and everyone against Bando Spiders, when Hayato Akaba claims to be Eyeshield 21. Sena eventually beats Akaba, claiming the title of Eyeshield 21. At the Kanto tournament, after defeating Shinryuji Naga, his rival Ojo White Knights' Seijuro Shin, and the Hakushu Dinosaurs, Sena is the tournament's MVP and the Devil Bats win the chance to play in the Christmas Bowl.|$|E

After Superman announces a {{worldwide}} ceasefire, he talks to the Kents as <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> nearly impossible to forgive Superman. Conner then tries to find the Phantom Zone projector to stop Superman, but Superman knew of his plans and single-handedly defeats him and the Titans, mortally wounding Conner in the process. In order to save him, he sends Conner and the Titans to the Phantom Zone.|$|E
25|$|Although fantasy {{comes from}} an imaginative realm, Martin sees an honest {{necessity}} to reflect the real world where people die sometimes ugly deaths, even beloved people. The deaths of supernumerary extras or orcs have no major effect on readers, whereas a friend's death has much more emotional impact. Martin kills off main characters because <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> very irritating to know early in the story who as the hero will come through unscathed. Martin dislikes this lack of realism, comparing the situation to a soldier scared the night before a battle. Martin wants his readers to feel {{that no one is}} safe as they turn the page. Martin prefers a hero's sacrifice to say something profound about human nature, and points readers not wanting to get upset or disturbed to the plenty of books for comfort reading.|$|E
25|$|During a {{party at}} the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is {{pregnant}} with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.|$|E

25|$|Two years pass. Moagim {{makes no}} attempt to attack Llancarfan, but {{continues}} to conquer lands outside the city. When news arrives that the Twelve Duns, home of the Myrmidon, has fallen, Ravanna, who {{is in love with}} Damas, heads there, saving thousands of refugees, and forging an alliance between the Duns and the city. Meanwhile, Connacht receives word from the Smiths that a device he commissioned from them is ready; the SunHammer. However, when he reaches the forge, <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> under attack by the Spider Cult, a group who worship Skyrosh, a giant spider from another dimension. Finding the Cult has stolen the Tain and the SunHammer, Connacht readies his forces to attack, but before he can do so, the Smiths infiltrate the cultists' temple. They wipe out the Cult, retrieve the artifacts and imprison Skyrosh within the Tain. When Connacht attacks, he finds a note from Traval explaining Skyrosh came into the world by way of an accident during the construction of the Tain, so the Smiths felt honor-bound to defeat her, following her inside the Tain to kill her.|$|E
25|$|Ciri and Geralt {{travel to}} Novigrad and help Triss and Yennefer reform the Lodge of Sorceresses to aid their fight. They {{learn about the}} Sunstone, a relic which can lure Eredin out and bind him to a location. On the Skelligan island of Undvik, Avallac'h uses the Sunstone to draw out the Hunt and their fleet. Geralt, Ciri, their allies and the Nilfgaardian fleet battle the Hunt, and Geralt defeats Eredin in combat. As the White Frost descends on Skellige, Ciri insists that she must confront it with her Elder Blood before it consumes all life on every world. She enters a portal and defeats the White Frost, ending the threat. The game ending varies, {{depending}} on previous choices. If Ciri is alive, Geralt can retire with Yennefer or Triss or remain a lone witcher. If Geralt helps Nilfgaard win the war and brings Ciri to meet the emperor, she will become empress; if Ciri {{does not meet the}} emperor, Geralt fakes her death and she becomes a witcher. If Ciri dies fighting the White Frost, Geralt hunts down her stolen medallion as a keepsake; surrounded by monsters when <b>he</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it,</b> his fate is unknown.|$|E

Akin asks Mary to go to his mother's house in Abuja, Akin also finds himself in Mary's Father's house which is a very ancient house. Mary's sister, Cynthia (Ada Ameh) introduces Akin to their father (Chika Okpala) as Mary's boyfriend. Mary is also received happily by Akin's mother, Kike (Joke Silva) and she believed Mary is Akin's girlfriend. Mary tries to explain to her what happened, but she is too overjoyed to listen. Akin finds it hard to adapt to the life in the Village: He asks the family for a cutlery to eat 'swallow' food and he is laughed at, He is also unable to sleep with the others on bed and goes to sleep on the veranda. <b>He</b> <b>finds</b> <b>it</b> hard to sleep on the Veranda again due to mosquitoes. He gets up and calls Mary instead and they get to discuss many things like the fact that her sister's sin is that she beats her husband and she's accused of pulling her husband's penis this time around. Mary asks Akin to speak to Cynthia on her behalf because she thinks Cynthia will listen to him as Cynthia seems to like him. Akin also asks Mary to go to the company's retreat on his behalf. He tells her that all she needs to do is give the chairman the information on the memory card of his phone. Akin talks to Cynthia and she accepts to behave responsibly at the family meeting and to start behaving responsibly at home in order to preserve the future of her kids. At the meeting she kneels down for the Elders and apologizes to everyone in a sober state and eventually bursts into tears.|$|E

Fox concludes that [...] "quite simply, the contention is nonsense. A few troopers undoubtedly took their own lives, {{but it is hard to}} know what factors fostered the idea of wholesale suicide".

500|$|Moreover, {{symmetrical}} positions may be disadvantageous to White {{in that he}} has {{to commit}} himself first. Watson notes that it is even difficult for White to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position, since almost every move has certain drawbacks.

Tom Perrotta, the author of Little Children, has said that Winslet “gravitates toward troubling roles in smaller films”, typically those of [...] "thorny, potentially unsympathetic" [...] women. The journalist Mark Harris writes that she specialises in [...] "unsentimentalized, restless, troubled, discontented, disconcerted, difficult women" [...] and John Hiscock of The Daily Telegraph has identified a theme of characters who are free-spirited with a sexual edge to them.
