In this paper, the {{numerical}} simulation was adopted to explore indoor air distribution affected by three typical <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> distribution models, included spatially homogeneous <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> in the room, the <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> distributed evenly {{at the bottom}} and the local <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> {{at the bottom of the}} room. The characteristics of air distribution effected by three typical <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> models were studied in the air conditioning room with the pattern of lateral supply and return, the scope of rational arrangement in relatively comfortable environment of indoor personnel occupied zone was obtained. The result indicated that, the air distribution with the setting of the spatially homogeneous <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> pattern and the <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> distributed evenly at the bottom pattern were more satisfying than the setting of the local <b>heated</b> <b>source</b> at the bottom pattern...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{radiant heating}} through {{distinct}} <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> {{is of interest}} for the thermal loading of thin objects as it is used in residential applications, furnaces, and insulator designs. In this paper, an optimal design for a thermal radiant system by discrete suspended <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> is analyzed in a side open cavity used for heating the top plate, while the bottom plate is kept at a constant temperature, using the entropy generation minimization method. To avoid pressure fluctuations, the semi-implicit method for pressure linked equations method is used, which solves the continuity, Navier-Stokes, fluid energy, and surface energy equations simultaneously. The system is optimized based on the characteristic length of discrete <b>heat</b> <b>sources,</b> height of discrete <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> from the bottom plate, the distance between discrete <b>heat</b> <b>sources,</b> the number of discrete <b>heat</b> <b>sources,</b> and the aspect ratio of the cavity that finds the optimal location of heating elements. In addition to the geometrical parameters, {{the effects of the}} thermal loading parameters on the optimal position are investigated...|$|R

The concentrated heat is then used as a <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> for a conventional power plant. A wide range of concentrating technologies exists; the most developed are the parabolic trough, the concentrating linear fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the Sun and focus light.

40|$|A {{new study}} area of {{constructal}} theory is presented by applying constructal design on multiple <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> which connected to and cooled in a square-shaped fin. Analyzing the optimal {{location of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> in the fin for several configurations is {{the primary goal of}} this study. According to the constructal theory, favorable distribution of the <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> is achieved by minimizing the global thermal resistance of the fin body. Since the <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> might be contemplated as heat-generating electronic bodies or hot-water pipes, two boundary conditions of uniform heat flux and uniform temperature are considered for the <b>heat</b> <b>sources.</b> The minimization of the thermal resistance in the uniform heat flux and uniform temperature cases leads to the minimization of the hot spot temperature and the maximization of the total heat removal, respectively. Temperature fields in the square-shaped fin are calculated using a finite element approach of MATLAB PDE Toolbox. The optimized configurations are numerically compared with each other. It is shown that the most commonly used configurations of the <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> in a cooling industry are unfavorable and must be avoided. Favorable configurations such as triangular arrangement of <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> are proposed to replace the unfavorable configurations...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{bilateral}} agreement between the Federal Minister for Research and Technology of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) and the DOE, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) developed processes for the treatment and immobilization of high-level radioactive waste. One element of this bilateral agreement was the production of sealed isotopic <b>heat</b> <b>sources.</b> During the mid- 1980 s, 30 sealed isotopic <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> were manufactured. The sources contain a total of approximately 8. 3 million curies consisting predominantly of cesium- 137 and strontium- 90 with trace amounts of transuranic contamination. Currently, the sources are stored in A-Cell of the 324 Building. Intense radiation fields from the sources are causing the cell windows and equipment to deteriorate.

40|$|In this study, {{geometrical}} optimization of two infinitive plates for {{the enhancement}} of heat transfer between the plates is investigated by considering free convection and thermal radiation as heat transfer mechanisms. It is assumed that <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> with specified length are placed in a linear array with infinitive length on the lower plate. These <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> are placed at a specified distance between them. Heat flux of the <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> and {{the temperature of the}} upper cold plate are the given data, and the mean temperature of the <b>heat</b> <b>sources,</b> the temperature difference between the upper cold plate and the mean temperature of the <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> and the Nusselt number are the major parameters for optimizing the geometry of the plates. First, the problem is solved for two familiar geometries: when there exists an upper plate and when it is omitted. Eventually, a situation in which there are vents in the lower and the upper plate is investigated, and the optimum position of these vents as well as their sizes are obtained. The results show that placing vents on the plates can be very effective for enhancing heat transfer from the <b>heat</b> <b>sources.</b> For a particular array of <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> and vents on the plates, the Nusselt number has the highest magnitude in comparison with other geometries, and consequently, the maximum heat transfer is available...|$|R
40|$|Depth {{distribution}} of radiogenic <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> in continental crust {{is an important}} parameter that controls its thermal structure {{as well as the}} mantle heat flow at the base of continental lithosphere.

Starting from constant and exponential models based on linear heat flow–heat generation relationship the present-day layered models integrate crustal structure and laboratory measurements of radiogenic <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> in various exposed rocks representing crustal composition. In the present work, an extended entropy theory formalism is used for estimation of radiogenic <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> distribution in continental crust based on principle of maximum entropy (POME). The extended entropy principle yields a constant heat generation model if only a constraint given by total radiogenic heat in the crust is used and an exponential form of radiogenic <b>heat</b> <b>sources</b> distribution if an additional constraint {{in the form of a}} second moment is used in the minimization of entropy...|$|R

The presence of plutonium-240 limits a plutonium sample's usability for weapons or its quality as reactor fuel, and the percentage of plutonium-240 determines its grade (weapons-grade, fuel-grade, or reactor-grade). Plutonium-238 has a half-life of 88 years and emits alpha particles. It is a <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, which are used to power some spacecraft.

5|$|Currently Umbriel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, it may have been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the <b>heat</b> <b>source.</b>|$|E
5|$|First {{predicted}} {{shortly before}} the Voyager 1 flyby, the <b>heat</b> <b>source</b> for Io's volcanism comes from tidal heating produced by its forced orbital eccentricity. This differs from Earth's internal heating, which is derived primarily from radioactive isotope decay and primordial heat of accretion. Io's eccentric orbit leads to a slight difference in Jupiter's gravitational pull on the satellite between its closest and farthest points on its orbit, causing a varying tidal bulge. This variation {{in the shape of}} Io causes frictional heating in its interior. Without this tidal heating, Io might have been similar to the Moon, a world of similar size and mass, geologically dead and covered with numerous impact craters.|$|E

In late 2008, it was suggested Jupiter may keep Europa's oceans warm by generating large planetary tidal waves on Europa because of its small but non-zero obliquity. This generates so-called Rossby waves that travel quite slowly, at just a few kilometers per day, but can generate significant kinetic energy. For the current axial tilt estimate of 0.1 degree, the resonance from Rossby waves would contain 7.3 J of kinetic energy, which is two thousand times larger {{than that of the}} flow excited by the dominant tidal forces.
