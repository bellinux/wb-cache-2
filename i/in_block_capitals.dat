500|$|The scroll in the eagle's beak {{originally}} read [...] "Look out below", {{but this}} was soon changed to [...] "Hey ho let's go" [...] after the opening lyrics of the band's first single, [...] "Blitzkrieg Bop". The arrowheads on the shield came from a design on a polyester shirt Vega had bought. [...] "Ramones" [...] was spelled out <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capitals</b> above the logo using plastic stick-on letters. Where the presidential emblem read [...] "Seal of the President of the United States" [...] clockwise in the border around the eagle, Vega placed the pseudonyms of the band members: Johnny, Joey, Dee Dee, and Tommy. Over the years the names in the border would change as the band's line-up fluctuated.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} United States entered World War II in December 1941, the police {{received}} a letter <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters: I WILL MAKE NO MORE BOMB UNITS FOR THE DURATION OF THE WAR - MY PATRIOTIC FEELINGS HAVE MADE ME DECIDE THIS - LATER I WILL BRING THE CON EDISON TO JUSTICE - THEY WILL PAY FOR THEIR DASTARDLY DEEDS...

50|$|The medals {{were named}} <b>in</b> bold <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters with stars used {{to fill in}} the spaces as on the Waterloo Medal. However, since new punches were used for this medal the naming appears {{somewhat}} sharper than on Waterloo Medal examples.|$|R
500|$|In 1934, Birkett {{acted as}} {{counsel for the}} second of the two Brighton trunk murders, a case which was {{described}} as [...] "his greatest triumph in a capital case". In June 1934, a woman's torso was found in a suitcase in Brighton railway station. The legs were discovered at King's Cross station the next day, but her head and arms were never found, and the case is still unsolved. A woman by the name of Violette Kaye had disappeared, and the appearance of the first woman's body prompted greater scrutiny on Kaye's case. On 14 July, they interviewed Toni Mancini, Kaye's boyfriend, who convinced them that the dead woman could not possibly be Kaye; the dead woman had been identified as around thirty five years old and five months pregnant, while Kaye was ten years older. Kaye was last seen alive on 10 May looking distressed in the doorway to her house and had been scheduled to visit her sister in London who received a telegram on 11 May reading [...] "Going abroad. Good job. Sail Sunday. Will write. Vi." [...] <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capitals.</b> The post office clerks could not remember who sent it, but experts testified that the handwriting on the telegram had similarities to that on a menu written by Mancini. On 14 May, with the help of another man, Mancini moved his belongings from the house he shared with Kaye, which included a large trunk which was too heavy to move by hand. Mancini had told people that he had broken up with Kaye and she had moved to Paris, and that before she left he had beaten her. He later said to a friend, [...] "What is the good of knocking a woman about with your fists? You only hurt yourself. You should hit her with a hammer same as I did and [...] her up." [...] A hammerhead was later found in the rubbish at his old house.|$|E
2500|$|The medal {{was struck}} in silver {{and is a}} disk, [...] in {{diameter}} and [...] thick at the raised rim.

2500|$|Austen made {{significant}} {{revisions to the}} manuscript for First Impressions between 1811 and 1812. As nothing remains of the original manuscript, we are reduced to conjecture. From {{the large number of}} letters in the final novel, it is assumed that First Impressions was an epistolary novel. She later renamed the story Pride and Prejudice around about 1811/1812, which she sold the rights to publish the manuscript to Thomas Egerton for Â£110 (...) [...] In renaming the novel, Austen probably had in mind the [...] "sufferings and oppositions" [...] summarised in the final chapter of Fanny Burney's Cecilia, called [...] "Pride and Prejudice", where the phrase appears three times <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capitals.</b> It is possible that the novel's original title was altered to avoid confusion with other works. In the years between the completion of First Impressions and its revision into Pride and Prejudice, two other works had been published under that name: a novel by Margaret Holford and a comedy by Horace Smith.|$|E
2500|$|Police {{discovered}} a handwritten letter near {{the bodies of}} Esau and Suriani, written mostly <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters with some lower-case letters, and addressed to NYPD Captain Joseph Borrelli. With this letter, Berkowitz revealed the name [...] "Son of Sam" [...] for the first time. The press had previously dubbed the killer [...] "the [...]44 Caliber Killer" [...] because of his weapon of choice. The letter was initially withheld from the public, but some of its contents were revealed to the press, and the name [...] "Son of Sam" [...] quickly replaced the old name.|$|R
5000|$|The UTA roundel, 14 in in diameter, with [...] "Ulster Transport" [...] <b>in</b> orange <b>block</b> <b>capitals,</b> lined <b>in</b> red, {{surrounding}} a white shield bearing the red hand of Ulster, {{all on a}} mid-green background, {{was placed in the}} middle of the tender sides.|$|R
50|$|The shield is {{designed}} {{in a similar}} fashion to the Crimea Shield and was struck in sheet metal or zinc and treated with a bronzed wash. It features a German eagle with outstretched wings clutching a laurel wreath with a swastika. On each side the wreath are the numbers 19 and 43. Directly below the eagle is written KUBAN <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters. Below this name is a stylized map of the Kuban region, with a line representing the defensive line that the men fought to preserve with the location of the bridgeheads - KRYMSKAJA, LAGUNEN, and NOWOROSSIJSK.|$|R

5000|$|The Home Run Apple {{came out}} of a magic hat after every Mets home run at Shea Stadium. It was first {{installed}} in May 1980 {{as a symbol of the}} Mets' advertising slogan [...] "The Magic Is Back!" [...] (the hat originally said [...] "Mets Magic" [...] in script but was changed in the mid-1980s to a simple [...] "Home Run" [...] <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters). A bigger apple was placed in center field at Citi Field. The original apple was installed inside Citi Field's bullpen gate and was visible from outside, on 126th Street. In 2010, the original Shea apple was relocated outside the Citi Field, in front of the Jackie Robinson Rotunda.|$|R

5000|$|Neu! (styled as NEU! <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capitals,</b> New!, [...] ) was a German krautrock band {{formed in}} DÃ¼sseldorf in 1971 by Klaus Dinger and Michael Rother, after their split from Kraftwerk. The group's albums were {{produced}} by Conny Plank, {{who has been}} regarded as the group's [...] "hidden member". Though Neu! had minimal commercial success during its existence, the band is retrospectively {{considered one of the}} founders of krautrock and a significant influence on a variety of subsequent rock, post-punk, and electronic music artists.|$|E
5000|$|The album's cover art was {{designed}} by Gene Greif, the front of {{which was based on}} a postcard titled [...] "End of the Trail", photographed by Adrian Atwater and featuring Wallace Irving Robertson. The cover of the first US pressings showed the band's name written <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters. Subsequent U.S. pressings used a faux-oriental style font, which was then replaced with the more ornate faux-oriental style font used on the UK release. The original American issue of the album also retitled [...] "All the Young Punks" [...] as [...] "That's No Way to Spend Your Youth". This was revised on later editions. [...] "Tommy Gun" [...] and [...] "English Civil War" [...] were released as the album's singles, either side of Christmas 1978. They entered the UK charts at numbers 19 and 25, respectively.|$|R
50|$|The three Documentary stamps {{issued in}} the 1898 series (which were {{actually}} issued in 1899) feature the portraits of John Marshall, Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, each bearing the inscription Series of 1898. These three designs {{were also used}} in the , 1917 printings and much later in 1940 issues, with slight modifications in the design. i.e.The inscription Series of 1898 was removed. As an added security measure each of these high value stamps was given its own unique serial number. Produced by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing the issues of 1898 were printed on white wove paper and watermarked with the initials U.S.I.R. (i.e. United States Internal revenue) <b>in</b> <b>block</b> <b>capital</b> letters. The stamps were separated by rouletted perforations. The issues of 1917 and 1940 were also printed on double lined watermarked paper with standard gauge 12 perforations.|$|R
