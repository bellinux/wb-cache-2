2500|$|Dmitri Shostakovich, who {{was born}} and raised in Saint Petersburg, {{dedicated}} his Seventh Symphony to the city, calling it the [...] "Leningrad Symphony". He wrote the symphony while based in the city during the siege of Leningrad. It was premiered in Samara in March 1942; a few month later, it received its first performance in the besieged Leningrad at the Bolshoy Philharmonic Hall under the baton of conductor Karl Eliasberg. It was <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> and was said to have lifted the spirits of the surviving population. In 1992, the 7th Symphony was performed by the 14 surviving orchestral players of the Leningrad premiere in the same hall as half a century before. The Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra remained one of the best known symphony orchestras in the world under the leadership of conductors Yevgeny Mravinsky and Yuri Temirkanov. Mravinsky's term as artistic director of the Leningrad Philharmonic – a term that is possibly the longest of any conductor with any orchestra in modern times – led the orchestra from being a little-known provincial ensemble to it becoming one of the world's most highly regarded orchestras today, especially for the performance of Russian music.|$|E
50|$|As a novelty, Rajalakshmi {{introduced}} a sequence {{in which a}} song is <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> It was a period when radio was not yet a familiar medium of entertainment.|$|E

50|$|Meanwhile, {{the people}} at Kainantu weren't aware that Fr. Glover had {{actually}} made his destination and groups of people had set out on foot for Mt. Hagen. The mission station had {{been taken over by}} the Australian military and was being used as a hospital. Campbell was undecided whether or not to start out for Mt. Hagen with the few remaining civilians until he <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> that some American missionaries had been imprisoned by the Japanese on Bougainville. He then realised that the enemy weren't going to regard the missionaries as neutral.|$|E
5000|$|Dirty Mary, Crazy Larry is a 1974 American car chase film {{based on}} the 1963 Richard Unekis novel titled The Chase (later retitled Pursuit).

At a time when radio was not yet a familiar mass medium, the film contained a scene where a song is <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Early {{renderings of}} this song include those {{performed}} by Ted Lewis & His Band and Hal Kemp & His Orchestra. The entire song is never {{performed in the}} 1933 movie, though it introduces the film in the opening scene (wherein the performance is busted up by the police). Later in the movie, the tune is heard off stage in rehearsal as the director continues a discussion on camera about other matters.

The test warning during the actual emergency in the film could be seen as a dark-humored reference to Orson Welles's 1938 War of The Worlds Broadcast, in which real panic resulted from fictitious news reports of a supposed Martian invasion.|$|R
50|$|He {{went to live}} in Plains, North Lanarkshire in 1979 {{and spent}} the time from then till his {{retirement}} in 2005 working as a Radio DJ and doing gigs with his Disco Show.

50|$|Isaac {{hears the}} rescue {{helicopters}} coming, so he pushes {{down the wall}} and uses Matthews' rifle to try and kill Juba, or at least flush him out so the rescue chopper can see the trap. Juba fires at Issac twice and misses. Issac now has the snipers location and fires his only round. Issac stands up and waits for Juba's next shot, but it never comes. The helicopters land and the rescue team picks up Isaac and Matthews. Once the helicopters dust off, the sniper successfully shoots down both in rapid succession.

Though his voice was <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> in the strip, he was never seen in person, and remained an unseen character. The character's name came from [...] "Charmin'" [...] Jeff Harmon, a popular afternoon DJ at KRNA-FM. KRNA was an actual rock station located in Iowa City, Iowa, where Berke Breathed lived while writing the strip. The station was later bought out by Cumulus Media and moved to Cedar Rapids in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|In an anti-junta protest, on 23 May 1973, HNS Velos, {{under the}} command of Commander Nikolaos Pappas, refused to return to Greece after {{participating}} in a NATO exercise and remained anchored at Fiumicino, Italy. During a patrol with other NATO vessels between continental Italy and Sardinia, the commander and the officers <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> that a number of fellow naval officers had been arrested in Greece. Commander Pappas was involved in a group of democratic officers who remained loyal to their oath to obey the Constitution and planned to act against the junta.

50|$|At {{the middle}} of their test broadcast, DXRZ 900 AM gained a lot of {{popularity}} that the people wanted them to be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> FM <b>Radio.</b> By that time, only a few uses AM radio and most of their listeners can only hear them thru mobile with the FM band application. Though I FM 96.3 provided the FM broadcast, the company decided to formalize RMN FM Zamboanga on 105.9Mhz in order for I FM 96.3 to return on its regular programming, while RMN FM Zamboanga will serve as the relay FM Station for RMN's DXRZ 900AM following their live coverage of the Zamboanga Siege.|$|R
50|$|Nishi {{served as}} Japanese Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1941, {{at the time}} of the attack on Pearl Harbor.

(Almost 20 years later, when asked by Mega 104.3, she actually denied saying it, during her interview broadcast live on April 5, 2011.) Peniston was 21 years old when her debut single [...] "Finally" [...] was released. The song burst on to the US club scene in the fall of 1991, where it became an instant dance anthem peaking, in October, {{at the top of the}} Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play for two weeks, while achieving a respectful starting position (at No.#29) overseas.|$|E
50|$|The pogroms I {{witnessed}} in Makurdi, Nigeria (late Sept. 1966) were foreshadowed by months of intensive anti-Ibo and anti-Eastern conversations among Tiv, Idoma, Hausa and other Northerners resident in Makurdi, and, fitting a pattern replicated in city after city, the massacres {{were led by}} the Nigerian army. Before, {{during and after the}} slaughter, Col. Gowon could be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> issuing 'guarantees of safety' to all Easterners, all citizens of Nigeria, but the intent of the soldiers, the only power that counts in Nigeria now or then, was painfully clear. After counting the disemboweled bodies along the Makurdi road I was escorted back to the city by soldiers who apologised for the stench and explained politely that they were doing me and the world a great favor by eliminating Ibos.|$|E
5000|$|Dmitri Shostakovich {{was born}} and brought up in St. Petersburg, and {{dedicated}} his Seventh Symphony to the city, calling it the [...] "Leningrad Symphony."

The Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra remained one of the best known symphony orchestras in the world under the leadership of conductors Yevgeny Mravinsky and Yuri Temirkanov.|$|E
5000|$|Two of the group's three {{aircraft}} flying {{that day}} were shot down.

Their radio transmissions included statements such as [...] "We blew his balls off!" [...] In {{a reference to the}} Cuban MiG pilot's understanding that the aircraft they were attacking were the same ones that had been repeatedly and continuously flying off Cuba's coast, they also transmitted the following, [...] "He won't give us any more fucking trouble." [...] Finally, the Cuban MiG pilots also said, [...] "The other one is destroyed; the other one is destroyed. Homeland or death (patria o muerte), you bastards! The other one is also down." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1970-71, Ray Illingworth led England to a 2-0 win in Australia, mainly due to John Snow's fast bowling, and the {{prolific}} batting of Geoffrey Boycott and John Edrich. It was {{not until}} the last session of what was the 7th Test (one match having been abandoned without a ball bowled) that England's success was secured. Lawry was sacked after the Sixth Test after the selectors finally lost patience with Australia's lack of success and dour strategy. Lawry was not informed of the decision privately and <b>heard</b> his fate <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} version is the [...] "Breath" [...] off Phobia, which is 3:38 long. [...] "Breath" [...] {{also has a}} radio edit, which can be <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> public <b>radio.</b> <b>The</b> edit was mixed by Ian Van Dahl.

It is a cover song by Vitamin String Quartet and it's on the album Strung Out - The String Quartet Tribute to Hard Rock Hits, Vol.4, {{which can be found}} on iTunes.|$|R
5000|$|When Stafford Cripps {{discovered}} what Delmer {{was involved with}} (through the intervention of Richard Crossman) Cripps wrote to Anthony Eden, then Foreign Secretary: [...] "If {{this is the sort}} of thing that is needed to win the war, why, Id rather lose it." [...] Delmer was defended by Robert Bruce Lockhart, who pointed out the need to reach the sadist in the German nature. GS1 ran for 700 broadcasts before Delmer killed it off in late 1943 with gunfire <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> intimating the authorities had caught up with Der Chef. The dramatic ending may have been deliberately based on the Gleiwitz incident, when the Nazis staged the capture of a German radio station by Polish forces, an operation which Hitler used to justify the invasion of Poland and the start of WWII. Owing to an error by a non-German-speaking transmitter engineer, the programme was accidentally repeated and Der Chefs dramatic on-air murder was broadcast twice.|$|E
5000|$|Eliasberg was {{conductor}} of the Leningrad Radio Orchestra and only second {{conductor of}} the Leningrad Philharmonic but {{played a part in}} one key event in society and culture in Saint Petersburg during the siege of Leningrad when Dmitri Shostakovich dedicated his Seventh Symphony to the city as the [...] "Leningrad Symphony." [...] The symphony had already been premiered in Kuibyshev on 5 March 1942 under Samuil Samosud, then performed in Moscow (29 March 1942), London (22 June 1942) and New York City (19 July 1942). When Eliasberg was asked to conduct the Leningrad première only 15 members of the orchestra were still available; the others had either starved to death or left to fight the enemy. The concert was given on 9 August 1942 in the Leningrad Bolshoy Philharmonic Hall under the baton of Eliasberg, the second conductor with any people who could be gathered from the main orchestra, the reserve orchestra and military bands, and was <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> and lifted the spirits of the survivors.|$|E
50|$|Kenny and Sam {{attack the}} UFO with {{automatic}} rifles, but their weapons {{seem to have}} no effect. As they wait to be disintegrated, another UFO attacks and destroys that one. The sky fills with two different kinds of UFOs, which attack each other. Sam is killed in the crossfire, and the others retreat back to George's house. On his television, they see a newsreader {{in the form of}} Carrie announce that humanity has won the war and people should return to their homes. Vincent attempts to rape Dana, and Kenny savagely beats him and threatens to kill him. Before he can, an alien infiltration team led by a duplicate of the policeman breaks in and reports that there is a young girl there who can identify them. A series of flashbacks reveals there were several other copies of him who have followed the group and were presumably used as infiltrators. In the last scene, the infiltration team receives a go-ahead to kill everyone in the house, and their screams are <b>heard</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> In the depths of outer-space, the battle between the two aliens rages on, as the mothership begins to descend.|$|E
50|$|With Texaco {{leaving and}} the Wrigley Company {{not able to}} cover the full season, long-time Ganassi sponsor Target moved <b>over</b> from <b>the</b> No. 41 to the No. 42 for 2009. Upon merging with DEI, the team absorbed the team's Chevrolet {{equipment}} after running Dodges since 2003. In 2009, Montoya had a break out season, with seven top 5, eighteen top 10 and 2 poles. He qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup and finished eighth in the overall standings, the best season ending points position for Ganassi since Sterling Marlin's third-place finish in the final standings in 2001. Midway through 2010, Montoya had sported great runs, but didn't have the finishes to show for it, specifically at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway where Montoya dominated, but his crew chief Brian Pattie called for four tires late in the race, causing Montoya to fall to 8th and never recover. A similar situation happened the following week at Pocono when Montoya was running second at a late stage in the race, and Pattie again called for four tires, placing Montoya back in traffic again. Montoya and Pattie were <b>heard</b> arguing <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> <b>The</b> next weekend however, Montoya won his second career race, dominating at Watkins Glen. Montoya ended up placing 17th in the overall standings for 2010.|$|R
2500|$|Jesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver {{said that}} [...] "Since 2008, the band has {{undergone}} extensive line-up changes {{that has left}} only singer Kevin Young as the sole original member still standing. Despite these changes, Disciple has continued to release solid hard rock records. Their newest effort, O God Save Us All, is no exception, but is, however, {{a bit of a}} mixed bag. Half of the record feels like the energizing hard rock found of their self-titled album, as well as Scars Remain, while the other half feels more like the same modern rock <b>heard</b> all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio.</b> Thankfully, Disciple is able to pull that radio rock sound off better than most." [...] Weaver concluded with saying [...] "Kevin Young's current Disciple doesn't necessarily hit it out of the park, but they do manage to maintain the norm. When the norm is crafting solid rock records with great replay value, 'maintaining the norm' isn't such a bad thing; it's no wonder Disciple has been around so long...Fans of harder rock than typically played on <b>the</b> <b>radio,</b> and fans of radio rock alike, can find common ground on this record. O God Save Us All probably won't end up as the favorite album of most fans, but it still contains plenty of material to whet your hard rock appetite." ...|$|R
50|$|Yannis Markopoulos {{was born}} in 1939 in Heraklion, Crete. From {{one of the old}} {{families}} of the island—his father was an attorney and later the Prefect—he spent his childhood in the seaside town of Ierapetra. The Byzantine liturgy heard regularly from the church opposite his family home, Cretan traditional music, with its rapid dances of repeated small motifs, played by local instruments at the town’s weekly festivities, {{but at the same time}} the sound of the waves, and the detonation of land-mines in the aftermath of World War II, all these formed part of the acoustic universe of the composer as a child. He took his first lessons in music theory and the violin at the local conservatory and played the clarinet in the municipal band. Meanwhile, other musical experiences of decisive importance were classical music as well as the music of the wider Eastern Mediterranean and, most important of all, that of nearby Egypt, which he <b>heard</b> either <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>radio</b> or from musicians and travellers passing through his hometown. Thanks to his father’s extensive private library he had the opportunity to deepen his knowledge, beyond school education, in literature, philosophy, history and the arts. He began composing music during his adolescence and two melodies of this time would later become songs that have enjoyed great popularity throughout Greece.|$|R
