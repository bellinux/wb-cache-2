50|$|Pivovar Broumov is a {{traditional}} brewery in Broumov in the eastern Czech Republic. It produces a light <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> domestic consumption and a <b>dark</b> <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> the export to Germany.|$|R
50|$|In 1881 three Swiss {{entrepreneurs}} built a brewery in Plovdiv {{on a hill}} called Kamenitza {{and used}} the name as their brand. The drink of choice for most Bulgarians {{at the time was}} lager, but Kamenitza broke new ground by producing the first <b>dark</b> <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> the market. By the 1890s they won awards at international exhibitions, including Brussels and Chicago.|$|R
50|$|In England, old ale {{was strong}} <b>beer</b> {{traditionally}} kept <b>for</b> about a year, gaining sharp, acetic flavours {{as it did}} so. The term is now applied to medium-strong <b>dark</b> <b>beers,</b> {{some of which are}} treated to resemble the traditional old ales. In Australia, the term is used even less discriminately, and is a general name <b>for</b> any <b>dark</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{first known}} {{use of the}} word stout <b>for</b> <b>beer</b> was in a {{document}} dated 1677 found in the Egerton Manuscript, the sense being that a stout beer was a strong <b>beer</b> not a <b>dark</b> <b>beer.</b> [...] The name porter was first used in 1721 to describe a <b>dark</b> brown <b>beer</b> that had been made with roasted malts. Because of the huge popularity of porters, brewers made them in a variety of strengths. The stronger beers were called [...] "stout porters", so the history and development of stout and porter are intertwined, and the term stout has become firmly associated with <b>dark</b> <b>beer,</b> rather than just strong beer.|$|R
50|$|The brewery also {{produces}} {{a number of}} other <b>beers,</b> mostly <b>for</b> the local market. Those sometimes found outside China include Tsingtao <b>Dark</b> <b>Beer</b> (5.2% abv), and more rarely Tsingtao Spirulina Green Beer, also sold as Tsingtao Green Beer, a 4.5% abv green-coloured pilsner containing spirulina as an additive, and claimed to promote good health. The alcohol content of export versions may vary slightly from those for the domestic market.|$|R

5|$|<b>Dark</b> <b>beers</b> {{are usually}} brewed from a pale malt or lager malt base {{with a small}} {{proportion}} of darker malt added to achieve the desired shade. Other colourants—such as caramel—are also widely used to darken <b>beers.</b> Very <b>dark</b> <b>beers,</b> such as stout, use dark or patent malts that have been roasted longer. Some have roasted unmalted barley.|$|R

5000|$|The First World War brewery survived, {{operating}} in a restricted mode and without much innovation. It grew again in the period between the wars. Kozel became famous <b>for</b> its <b>dark</b> 14° <b>beer</b> [...] "Bock". However the Second World War brought restrictions again {{in the production of}} <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> all breweries. The protectorate brewery had problems in requiring the raw materials needed for the production of beer.|$|R
5000|$|Tmavé is Czech for [...] "dark", so is {{the term}} <b>for</b> a <b>dark</b> <b>beer</b> in the Czech Republic - beers which are so dark as to be black are termed černé pivo, [...] "black beer". [...] Dunkel is German for [...] "dark", {{so is the}} term <b>for</b> a <b>dark</b> <b>beer</b> in Germany. With alcohol {{concentrations}} of 4.5% to 6% by volume, dunkels are weaker than Doppelbocks, another traditional <b>dark</b> Bavarian <b>beer.</b> Dunkels were the original style of the Bavarian villages and countryside. [...] Schwarzbier, a much <b>darker,</b> almost black <b>beer</b> with a chocolate or liquorice-like flavour, similar to stout, is mainly brewed in Saxony and Thuringia.|$|R
