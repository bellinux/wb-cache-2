The noise models also have implications in noise reduction, retention time alignment and significance testing for biomarker discovery. Contact...|$|R

40|$|In small cells {{containing}} {{small numbers}} of <b>ion</b> channels, <b>noise</b> due to stochastic channel opening and closing can introduce a substantial level of variability into the cell’s membrane potential. Negatively cooperative interactions that couple a channel’s gating conformational change to the conformation of its neighbor(s) provide a potential mechanism for mitigating this variability, but such interactions have not previously been directly observed. Here we show that heterologously expressed ATP-sensitive potassium channels generate noise (i. e., variance {{in the number of}} open channels) below the level possible for identical and independent channels. Kinetic analysis with single-molecule resolution supports the interpretation that interchannel negative cooperativity (specifically, the presence of an open channel making a closed channel less likely to open) contributes to the decrease in noise. Functional coupling between channels may be important in modulating stochastic fluctuations in cellular signaling pathways...|$|R
40|$|Neural spike {{trains are}} {{commonly}} {{characterized as a}} Poisson point process. However, the Poisson assumption is a poor model for spiking in auditory nerve fibres because {{it is known that}} interspike intervals display positive correlation over long time scales and negative correlation over shorter time scales.

We achieve this by introducing biophysically realistic <b>ion</b> channel <b>noise</b> to an inner hair cell membrane potential model that includes fractal fast potassium channels and deterministic slow potassium channels. We succeed in producing simulated spike train statistics that match empirically observed firing correlations.

40|$|We {{consider}} a stochastic {{version of an}} excitable system based on the Morris-Lecar model of a neuron, in which the noise originates from stochastic Sodium and Potassium ion channels opening and closing.

In the stochastic setting, spontaneous excitation is initiated by <b>ion</b> channel <b>noise.</b> If the recovery variable is constant during initiation, the spontaneous activity rate can be calculated using Kramer's rate theory. The validity of this assumption in the stochastic model is examined using a systematic perturbation analysis.

40|$|On short timescales, {{the brain}} represents, transmits, and {{processes}} information through the electrical activity of its neurons. On long timescales, the brain stores {{information in the}} strength of the synaptic connections between its neurons. This thesis examines the surprising implications of two separate, well documented microscopic processes — the stochastic gating of ion channels and the plasticity of dendritic spines — for neural information processing and storage. Electrical activity in neurons is mediated by many small membrane proteins called ion channels. Although single ion channels are known to open and close stochastically, the macroscopic behaviour of populations of ion channels are often approximated as deterministic. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the intrinsic noise introduced by stochastic ion channel gating is so weak as to be negligible. In this study we take advantage of newly developed efficient computer simulation methods to examine cases where this assumption breaks down. We find that <b>ion</b> channel <b>noise</b> can mediate spontaneous action potential firing in small nerve fibres, and explore its possible implications for neuropathic pain disorders of peripheral nerves. We then characterise the magnitude of <b>ion</b> channel <b>noise</b> for single neurons in the central nervous system, and demonstrate through simulation that channel noise is sufficient to corrupt synaptic integration, spike timing and spike reliability in dendritic neurons. The second topic concerns neural information storage. Learning and memory in the brain has long been believed to be mediated by changes in the strengths of synaptic connections between neurons — a phenomenon termed synaptic plasticity. Most excitatory synapses in the brain are hosted on small membrane structures called dendritic spines, and plasticity of these synapses is dependent on calcium concentration changes within the dendritic spine. In the last decade, it has become clear that spines are highly dynamic structures that appear and disappear, and can shrink and enlarge on rapid timescales. It is also clear that this spine structural plasticity is intimately linked to synaptic plasticity. Small spines host weak synapses, and large spines host strong synapses. Because spine size is one factor which determines synaptic calcium concentration, it is likely that spine structural plasticity influences the rules of synaptic plasticity. We theoretically study the consequences of this observation, and find that different spine-size to synaptic-strength relationships can lead to qualitative differences in long-term synaptic strength dynamics and information storage. This novel theory unifies much existing disparate data, including the unimodal distribution of synaptic strength, the saturation of synaptic plasticity, and the stability of strong synapses.

To gain further insight into the determinants of solute specificity, LamB mutants were designed to allow translocation of sucrose, which hardly translocates through wild-type LamB. Three LamB mutants were studied. (a) Based on sequence and structure alignment of LamB with ScrY, two LamB triple mutants were generated (R 109 D, Y 118 D,D 121 F; R 109 N,Y 118 D,D 121 F) to mimic the ScrY constriction.

The models of both Linaro et al. and Güler, however,were found toproducehighly accurate statistics.

For that purpose, the usual rate functions are accompanied additively by Ornstein-Uhlenbeck–type stochastic angular variables. Moreover, we argue that the existence of such noise in the rate functions is a plausible physiological phenomenon for finite-size membranes. It is observed that the presence of noise in the rates is not effective on the degree of inac-curacies within the Fox and Lu model. Güler model’s accuracy is found to remain high {{as in the case of}} noise free rates. But the performance of Linaro et al. ’s model is seen to degrade seriously with the increasing strength of the introduced rate function noise.

40|$|Neurones are noisy elements. Noise {{arises from}} both {{intrinsic}} and extrinsic sources, and manifests itself as {{fluctuations in the}} membrane potential. These fluctuations limit the accuracy of a neurone’s output but have also been suggested to play a computational role. We present a detailed study of the amplitude and spectrum of voltage noise recorded at the soma of layer IV–V pyramidal neurones in slices taken from rat neocortex. The dependence of the noise on holding potential, synaptic activity and Na + conductance is systematically analysed. We demonstrate that voltage noise increases non-linearly as the cell depolarizes (from a standard deviation (S. D.) of 0. 19 mV at − 75 mV to an S. D. of 0. 54 mV at − 55 mV). The increase in voltage noise is accompanied {{by an increase in}} the cell impedance, due to voltage dependence of Na + conductance. The impedance increase accounts for the majority (70 %) of the voltage noise increase. The increase in voltage noise and impedance is restricted to the low-frequency range (0. 2 – 2 Hz). At the high frequency range (5 – 100 Hz) the voltage noise is dominated by synaptic activity. In our slice preparation, synaptic noise has little effect on the cell impedance. A minimal model reproduces qualitatively these data. Our results imply that <b>ion</b> channel <b>noise</b> contributes significantly to membrane voltage fluctuations at the subthreshold voltage range, and that Na + conductance {{plays a key role in}} determining the amplitude of this noise by acting as a voltage-dependent amplifier of low-frequency transients...|$|R

The observation and the quantification of the electrical events associated with the operation of the ionic channels has been, and still is, one of the best tools to analyse the various aspects of their contribution to nerve function. For this reason, we have chosen to use electrophysiological recordings to illustrate some of the main functions of these channels.
