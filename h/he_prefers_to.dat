5|$|Saturday is McEwan's ninth novel, {{published}} between Atonement and On Chesil Beach, {{two novels}} of historical fiction. McEwan has discussed that <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> alternate between {{writing about the}} past and the present.|$|E
5|$|Khan's non-controversial {{lifestyle}} {{has generated}} speculation {{in the mass}} media. During an interview, {{he said he does}} not rely on controversy and rumours to stay in the news. The actor also asserted that <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> stay away from the limelight when not promoting his films.|$|E
5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He {{is not afraid to}} harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E

25|$|Stranraer striker Craig Malcolm {{rejected}} a contract offer as <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> stay part-time.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{advice to}} follow {{scientific}} disciplines at the University, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> pursue legal studies.|$|R
5|$|Regarding A Song of Ice and Fire as his magnum opus, Martin {{is certain}} never to write {{anything}} {{on this scale}} again and would only return to this fictional universe {{in the context of}} stand-alone novels. <b>He</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> write stories about characters from other Ice and Fire periods of history such as his Tales of Dunk and Egg project, instead of continuing the series directly. A possible future side project is a prequel set during Aegon's conquest of Westeros. Martin said he would love to return to writing short stories, novellas, novelettes, and stand-alone novels from diverse genres such as science fiction, horror, fantasy, or even a murder mystery. However, he will see if his audience follows him after publishing his next project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Morrissey {{developed}} a filmmaking craft at the Rathbone Theatre Workshop, a Youth Opportunities Programme that taught school-leavers skills for a year. With the workshop, Morrissey shot short silent films on Super 8, {{where he was}} taught by Bert Byron, who introduced him to US Independent and foreign films for the first time. Although the scheme paid £23.50 a week and took young people off unemployment benefits, Morrissey reflected in 2009 {{that many of the}} participants were just used as lackeys. After his acting career escalated, he started directing because he was aware that, as an actor, he was coming into a project quite late into development and then leaving before post-production, and he wanted to see a film through to the end. Morrissey has said that <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> keep acting and directing separate, and would not direct anything he is acting in.|$|E
25|$|Gerald McRaney as Raymond Tusk, {{a billionaire}} {{businessman}} {{with a wide}} network of influence, although <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> live modestly.|$|E
60|$|Horlock smiled indulgently. <b>He</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> {{assume a}} {{confidence}} {{which he could}} not wholly feel.|$|R
50|$|Brooks died at Glen Tana (as <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> {{spell the}} name) {{at the age}} of 80.|$|R
60|$|Hal {{said nothing}} <b>to</b> this. <b>He</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> {{discover}} {{more than he}} had before making any revelation.|$|R
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that unlike depictions in black and white movies of the 1930s after {{learning}} to speak a language in the novels, Tarzan/John Clayton is very articulate, reserved (<b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> listen and carefully observe before speaking) and does not speak in broken English as the classic movies depict him.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to using his home-made guitar <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), {{instead of a}} more traditional plastic plectrum, {{on the basis that}} their rigidity gives him more control in playing. He is known to carry coins in his pockets specifically for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|He hits many sixes {{long and}} high, favouring {{straight}} down the ground or over midwicket. His trademark shot is a cross-batted flick to the leg-side to a ball outside off stump. However, his aggressive style increases his risk of getting out and {{he is one of}} the most inconsistent batsmen in cricket. This is reflected by the fact that he is the only player to score more than 7,000 ODI runs at an average under 25. Afridi is the only player in the world who has scored 1,000 runs and 50 wickets in the T20 format of the game. Afridi has moved about the batting order, and this lack of consistency has made it difficult for him to settle. In the Indian subcontinent, where the ball quickly loses its shine, <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> open the batting; however, elsewhere <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> bat at number six.|$|E
50|$|Atkins {{considered}} {{entering the}} 2008 U.S. Senate race. He opted out, saying <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> remain in Minnesota.|$|R

50|$|He was a vidwan in Trivandrum palace. Though he {{performed}} some solo concerts, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be an accompanist.|$|R
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> {{spend his}} summer {{vacations}} at his family's cottage on the idyllic Hvaler Islands in the Oslofjord. An avid outdoorsman, he rides his bike often {{and during the}} winter season he is an active cross-country skier. In December 2011, in order to mark 100 years since Roald Amundsen reached the south pole on skis, Stoltenberg journeyed to Antarctica.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, {{he changed}} his first name to Christopher at the {{suggestion}} of Monique van Vooren, who had a nightclub act in which Walken was a dancer and who believed the name suited him better than Ronnie (a pet form of his given name, Ronald), which he was credited as until then. <b>He</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> be known informally as Chris instead of Christopher.|$|E
25|$|Burroughs clearly {{indicates}} {{here that}} <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> be evaluated against such criteria over being reviewed {{based on the}} reviewer's personal reactions to a certain book. Always a contradictory figure, Burroughs nevertheless criticized Anatole Broyard for reading authorial intent into his works where there is none, which sets him at odds both with New Criticism and the old school as represented by Mathew Arnold.|$|E
50|$|Gary was {{actually}} Jasgur's middle name, and {{in high school}} <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be called Mel. Jasgur married in 1956.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{his fortune}} {{had been built}} around {{cosmetics}} and beauty products, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> {{be known as a}} [...] "perfumer".|$|R
50|$|McAuley climbed many {{peaks in}} Australia, New Zealand, Pakistan and Patagonia. <b>He</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> find new routes and make {{exploratory}} climbs.|$|R
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the New Wafd Party and other {{opposition}} political forces have {{announced that they}} are ready to support ElBaradei if he decided to run for the election. However, Mohamed ElBaradei stated that if he decides to run for the 2011 elections, <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> run as an independent candidate, rather than running as a candidate of any of the existing political parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} Quatermain is an English-born professional {{big game}} hunter and occasional trader in southern Africa, who supports colonial efforts to 'spread civilization' in the 'dark continent', though he also favours native Africans having {{a say in}} their affairs. An outdoorsman who finds English cities and climate unbearable, <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> spend {{most of his life}} in Africa, where he grew up under the care of his widower father, a Christian missionary.|$|E
25|$|Boyd is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} goal poacher, whose key attribute is his strike rate. He scored {{an average of two}} goals for every three games when he arrived at Rangers; many of which came from the substitute bench, making his goals-to-games ratio even more impressive. <b>He</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> play in the penalty box, where he can play-off the shoulder of defenders who are close to their goals. Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish compared him to rival Ally McCoist in goalscoring ability.|$|E
60|$|Like {{my uncle}} David, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> walk the path he had chosen, no matter to what depth it might descend.|$|R
50|$|In 1367 {{he helped}} Pope Urban V {{to return to}} Rome, but the {{following}} year, having been unable to quench a revolt in Siena against Emperor Charles IV, <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> return to Rimini.|$|R
25|$|Prior to his death, Despot had curtailed much of {{his local}} {{activity}} because <b>he</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on national and state politics.|$|R
25|$|At {{backward}} point, he {{was considered}} {{by some to be}} the next Jonty Rhodes in his ability to hit the stumps, with a report prepared by Cricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the eighth highest number of run-outs in ODI cricket of any fieldsman, with the tenth highest success rate. Gibbs is said to rarely practice in the nets before a match. It is said <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> play on instinct in this case.|$|E
25|$|During a 2015 {{interview}} with Howard Stern, O’Brien explained that <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> avoid {{talking about the}} “craziness,” stating that people in show business shouldn’t complain, that “no one cares,” and that he noticed addressing the topic even in joking response to an earnest question by a guest on his show invariably resulted in admonishments from the media to “let it go.” He claimed that even in hindsight he does not regret doing five more years of Late Night instead of moving to FOX, nor does he regret his incarnation of The Tonight Show.|$|E
25|$|Soichiro {{seems to}} be a sword expert: <b>he</b> <b>prefers</b> <b>to</b> use the sword instead of his wife's Luger P08 pistol and has trained with Saeko Busujima's father. Later he entrusts Saeko with a katana made with {{military-grade}} steel at an industrial weapons factory. When the zombies breach the estate, he and his troops fight them off. He tells Takashi Komuro to go save Rei's parents, and entrusts Kouta Hirano with protecting Saya. While the Takagis {{and the rest of the}} estate survivors fight against the horde, Soichiro comments that they are proud of their daughter and the friends she has made.|$|E
