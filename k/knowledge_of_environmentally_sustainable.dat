40|$|Problem statement: Research that investigates how {{interior}} designers use <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> {{interior design}} criteria in their design solutions {{has not been}} done. To provide a base to develop education strategies for sustainable interior design, {{this study examined the}} state <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice. Approach: A national, Internet-based survey of interior design practitioners was conducted. To collect data, the random sample of US interior design practitioners was drawn from the American Society of Interior Designers membership list. <b>Environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice was defined by three factors: Global sustainable interior design, indoor environmental quality and interior materials. For each statement about <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice, respondents were asked to rate three dimensions: frequency of application, importance to the designers firm and importance to the designer. Descriptive statistical analysis focused on the state <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice. Results: Every statement to measure <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice showed the highest mean score in the category of importance to the designer and the lowest mean score in the category of frequency of application. Important to designers firm ratings were always between these two extremes. Use of sustainable interior materials was identified as a less frequently applied component <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design than indoor environmental quality. Conclusion/Recommendations: The application <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice did not reach the same level as its perceived importance. Teaching methods that improve <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> interior design practice and an understanding of the life cycle impact of interior materials are needed...|$|R

40|$|This {{study reveals}} {{substantial}} variation in {{estimates of the}} proportion of tourists behaving in an <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> manner. Results indicate that the variation is explained by (1) definitions <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourist behaviour including—or not including—intent {{to protect the environment}} and (2) the use of either unprompted open-ended or prompted closed questions. The latter are associated with respondent’s tendencies to respond in a socially desirable way, thus artificially inflating the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourist behaviour by as much as 74 per cent. Unprompted open-ended questions are not susceptible to social desirability bias. Future studies into <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> tourist behaviour should measure actual observed behaviour.

The findings demonstrate that, while many operators are aware <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> <b>sustainable</b> practice and have a positive personal philosophy towards implementing them, they remain constrained by business needs such as customer demands and limited acceptance of certification and accreditation programs. The study concludes with a number of recommendations to assist the industry bodies supporting operators in the take up <b>of</b> <b>environmentally</b> focused practices.
