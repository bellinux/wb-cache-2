500|$|McCarthy {{experienced}} a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, {{when he gave}} a Lincoln Day speech to the Republican Women's Club of Wheeling, West Virginia. His words in the speech are {{a matter of some}} debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the State Department. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: [...] "The State Department is infested with communists. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> in my hand a list of 205—a list of names that were made known to the Secretary of State as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department." ...|$|E

2500|$|Michigan {{students}} {{were reported to}} be [...] "more indignant at the attack on Hammond than at anything else in Jordan's article," [...] noting that [...] "Tom comes {{from one of the}} best families in Chicago, {{is a member of the}} D.K.E. fraternity here, and is considered one of the team's most upright men." [...] The Michigan Alumnus also defended Hammond:"Mr. Hammond, it is said, was enticed away from school and admitted into the University because he was an athlete. [...] I have the word of as truthful a man as walks, who knew the circumstances of his coming here, that Mr. Hammond was not enticed away from school, and I know of my own knowledge that the fact of his being an athlete did not facilitate his admission to college. [...] It is impossible here to substantiate with proofs the statement that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> made about Mr. Hammond's case.

In the lengthy oath, the Queen swore to govern each of her countries according to their respective laws and customs, to mete out law and justice with mercy, to uphold Protestantism in the United Kingdom and protect the Church of England and preserve its bishops and clergy. She proceeded to the altar where she stated, [...] "The things which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>here</b> promised, I will perform, and keep. So help me God", before kissing the Bible and putting the royal sign-manual to the oath as the Bible was returned to the Dean of Westminster. From him the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, James Pitt-Watson, took the Bible and presented it to the Queen again, saying, [...] "Our gracious Queen: to keep your Majesty ever mindful {{of the law and}} the Gospel of God as the Rule for the whole life and government of Christian Princes, we present you with this Book, the most valuable thing that this world affords. Here is Wisdom; This is the royal Law; These are the lively Oracles of God." [...] Elizabeth returned the book to Pitt-Watson, who placed it back with the Dean of Westminster.|$|E
