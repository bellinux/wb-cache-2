One comment to The Guardian read: [...] "To suggest that people who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> deserve to die is incredibly stupid.

To illustrate the point, he unveiled a mock motto for the rally: [...] "Take it down a notch for America." [...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you,</b> but I'm pretty sure you're not Hitler." [...] Colbert responded to Stewart's proposal by challenging the theme of Stewart's rally and justifying his own [...] "March to Keep Fear Alive."

2500|$|Fairuz's son, Ziad Rahbani, sparked {{controversy}} in December 2013 {{during an interview}} with the Al-Ahed website when asked whether his mother shared his supportive stance on the political vision of Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, a dominant but highly controversial political and military force in Lebanon. Ziad replied: [...] "Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan , although she will be displeased with me, as she was after my last television interview, when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me". There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media, and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words. Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: [...] "Fairuz is too great to be criticized, {{and at the same time}} too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp". [...] "Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with," [...] Jumblatt added. Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf [...] "because she prefers to remain silent", responded to his critics by saying: [...] "Apparently it isn’t allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance". Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: [...] "An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who maybe espoused different ideologies, might <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>you</b> on political matters, but personally have [...] fondness for you, because of your character, conduct, sacrifices and so on. If such a person were to say that he or she liked someone, then all hell would break loose".|$|E
