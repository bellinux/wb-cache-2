2500|$|A typical {{trench coat}} is a ten-buttoned, {{double-breasted}} long coat made with tan, black, khaki, or beige fabric. Trench coats often have cuff straps, raglan sleeves, shoulder straps and a belt. The trench coat was typically worn as a windbreaker or as a rain jacket, {{and not for}} protection from the cold in winter or snowy conditions (although many come with removable wool liners for additional warmth, they are usually not as warm as an overcoat). [...] Period advertisements from World War I reveal that the trench coat was sized to wear over the British Warm, to offer water protection when the temperature was cold enough to require the heavier coat, which explains the traditionally <b>generous</b> <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> trench coats; however, makers {{in recent years have}} resized trench coats downwards to conform more closely to overcoat sizing, as the two coats, trench and overcoat, would rarely if at all be worn together today.|$|R
30|$|A {{possible}} explanation for the negative correlation between potential log yield gain and site index is that a slow growing tree results in a shorter distance between whorls and a shorter sound knot length [28 – 30], also resulting in lower yield when the sawing is uncontrolled, and therefore a higher potential for optimization. The impact <b>of</b> knot <b>size</b> was probably small in this study, since dead knots were not allowed at all, while sound knots had a rather <b>generous</b> <b>size</b> limit <b>of</b> 50  mm.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{aspects of}} space consumption in {{two very different}} housing types, the communist mid-rise estates and post-communist suburban self-built housing. Examining residents ’ perceptions in order to categorize space as overcrowded or under-occupied, the paper engages critically {{with the issue of}} the inefficient distribution of Romanian housing, that is a considerable mismatch between dwelling and household size. The analysis documents the continued salience of overcrowding in the communist estates and conversely, self-builders ’ satisfaction with the <b>generous</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> their new homes. Market forces permit various modes of residential mobility but their likely outcome is growing housing inequality while any redistributive impact will remain insignificant unless policy incentives could facilitate conversion of under-occupied space into (social) renting housing. However, only a sustained delivery of larger and affordable new dwellings could alleviate overcrowding...|$|E
40|$|There is {{evidence}} that many heating, ventilating & air conditioning (HVAC) systems, installed in larger buildings, have more capacity than is ever required to keep the occupants comfortable. This paper explores the reasons why this can occur, by examining a typical brief/design/documentation process. Over-sized HVAC systems cost more to install and operate {{and may not be}} able to control thermal comfort as well as a “right-sized” system. These impacts are evaluated, where data exists. Finally, some suggestions are developed to minimise both the extent of, and the negative impacts of, HVAC system over-sizing, for example: • Challenge “rules of thumb” and/or brief requirements which may be out of date. • Conduct an accurate load estimate, using AIRAH design data, specific to project location, and then resist the temptation to apply “safety factors • Use a load estimation program that accounts for thermal storage and diversification of peak loads for each zone and air handling system. • Select chiller sizes and staged or variable speed pumps and fans to ensure good part load performance. • Allow for unknown future tenancies by designing flexibility into the system, not by over-sizing. For example, <b>generous</b> <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> distribution pipework and ductwork will allow available capacity to be redistributed. • Provide an auxiliary tenant condenser water loop to handle high load areas. • Consider using an Integrated Design Process, build an integrated load and energy use simulation model and test different operational scenarios • Use comprehensive Life Cycle Cost analysis for selection of the most optimal design solutions. This paper is an interim report on the findings of CRC-CI project 2002 - 051 -B, Right-Sizing HVAC Systems, which is due for completion in January 2006...|$|R

Eastern’s prime years of business were brief, 1915 - 1917.

5000|$|In 1914 volume II (Salicaceae to Chenopodiaceae) was {{the first}} to be published. In the {{introduction}} Moss explained the nomenclature and classification he had used. Despite having turned to botany only six years earlier, Moss displayed a remarkable grasp of the literature of the period, particularly when taking into account that a considerable portion had been written in German. He ignored the 1905 recommendation of the Vienna International Botanical Congress by using lower case initial letters for all specific names (e.g. Hieracium leyi, not Hieracium Leyi) - Moss' way eventually becoming standard practice since it simplified a complex morass of conventions. The text was widely praised, whereas the drawings came in for a lot of criticism.

The lower one contains the children's quarters, the intermediate level houses the common areas — living room and kitchen — and the master bedroom occupies the upper floor. Additionally an in — between level, connected to the Iiving room, is used for a library and a semi-basement, connected with the kitchen is used for supplies storage. &# 13; The large sloping planes of the roof determine the external personality of the house which, with sober and pleasing shapes try to integrate the building into the surrounding rustic architecture. &# 13; Internally, the <b>generous</b> <b>sizing</b> <b>of</b> spaces stands out, with integrated traffic patterns, {{as well as the}} liberal use of timber for structural members and finishing details.

The work is partially reaction to certain modem tendencies in architecture that reduce the built landscape to closed, object-like, discrete physical elements. The disparity in the range <b>of</b> <b>sizes</b> from large to small intensifies the discontinuity in contemporary, mid-to-high density urban environments.

The rear bogie cylinders were placed under the cab, at the front of the rear unit. A float-controlled automatic device reduced the cut-off of the rear cylinders to prevent slipping when the water tank was running low.

40|$|It is {{probably}} true {{that the culture}} of vegetables is neglected {{to a greater extent}} than any other legitimate farm crop. This is due to a lack of appreciation of their good qualities, lack of knowledge of varieties, and methods of culture; and possibly to lack of opportunity by the farmer. It is scarcely necessary to say that a sincere desire, backed by energy, will surmount many of these difficulties. As a rule the area chosen by the farmer for the kitchen garden, is too circumscribed. This greatly increases the labor of caring for it, owing to the impracticability of using horse power. Make the garden <b>of</b> good <b>size.</b> More satisfaction will be derived from a garden <b>of</b> <b>generous</b> <b>size,</b> attached to a corn field, than the usual small square, too restricted for horse power, and dependent for cultivation on the well meant, though often sporadic efforts of the farm boy or housewife...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of isolated liver perfusion has several unique features as an investigative {{tool for the}} study of hepatic physiology and biochemistry. These include the exclusion of non-hepatic tissues, the maintenance of intact cellular membranes, and the ability to control and reproduce more precisely the experimental hepatic environment than is possible in an entire animal. This investigative team has developed an isolated bovine liver peffusion preparation that is reproducible, bacterially sterile, and capable of continuous functional performance for extended periods of time. The use of a large mammal, such as the bovine calf, as the experimental animal has other useful characteristics; the large liver permits serial tissue sampling, yielding specimens <b>of</b> <b>generous</b> <b>size.</b> The large volume of perfusate, with little intrahepatic accumulation, allows frequent generous sampling of this medium. The use of autogenous blood as the perfusate avoids interaction between foreign proteins which could occur if blood were pooled from several homologous donors...|$|R
