40|$|This diploma thesis {{describes}} practical {{realization of}} <b>entrance</b> <b>terminal,</b> which enables {{transmission of data}} thanks to radio module ZigBee PAN 4551 and Ethernet module Rabbit RCM 3200. This entrance system uses Mifare RFID cards, with whose user will identify at the <b>entrance</b> <b>terminal</b> of the guarded object. Data are sent to server station by radio module ZigBee or Ethernet module Rabbit during demand of entrance. The database of all entrance rights of all users is stored on this server. Data system works up received data and sends {{them back to the}} terminal. One part of these data is the information about enabling of user entrance. The database system makes a list of passing through users. In {{the first part of this}} work whole conception of <b>entrance</b> <b>terminal</b> is suggested. Then basic demands of each block are described in details as well as their placement in guarded object. Next chapters describe basic function of terminal, electrical scheme, and system of power supplies for the access system. Also individual hardware components are chosen and described. In the on of the last chapter there is flow-process diagram of main loops for individual variants of terminal and interrupts functions from timer, serial link and external input from radio network MC 13193 drawn. In the last chapter there is a show of server data application “AccessServer” and his basic description...|$|E

40|$|Intersections are {{hazardous}} {{locations and}} {{many studies have}} been conducted to identify the factors contributing to the frequency and severity of intersection crashes. However, little attention has been devoted to investigating the differences between crashes at urban and rural intersections, which have different road, traffic and environmental characteristics. By applying a random parameters probit model to the data from the Canadian Province of Alberta between 2008 and 2012, we find that urban intersection crashes {{are more likely to be}} associated with hit and run behaviours, roads with higher traffic volume, wet surfaces, four lanes and skewed intersections, and crashes on weekdays and off-peak hours, whereas rural crashes are likely to be associated with increases in fatalities and injuries, roads with higher speed limits, special road features, exit and <b>entrance</b> <b>terminals,</b> gravel, curvature and two lanes, crashes during weekends, peak hours and night-time, run-off-road crashes, and police visit to crash scene. Hence, road safety professionals in urban and rural areas should consider these differences when designing and implementing counter-measures to improve intersection safety, especially their safety audits and reviews, enforcement activities and education campaigns, to target the more vulnerable times and locations in the different areas...|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} modernise Kötzschenbroda station, which was opened by the Royal Saxon State Railways in 1840, work began on 11 March 1895 on the {{building}} of a new station building in Kötzschenbroda in the district of Lößnitz. The new station, consisting of an <b>entrance</b> and <b>terminal</b> building, a waiting hall, platform roofs and a railway workers' residence, was completed on 15 February 1896 and inaugurated on 16 June 1896. The former station building, which dated back to 1872 and is now located in the yard of 281 Meissner Straße, has been used since 1896 as a residential building.|$|R

40|$|Merging lane is a {{path for}} drivers to {{accelerate}} their vehicle at a desired speed from the ramp terminal prior into entering the highway main stream. Conversely, diverging lanes allow the drivers to slow down their vehicle enabling them to enter the ramp terminal conveniently. The length of the speed-change lane should be in optimum design {{to ensure that the}} drivers are allowed to make appropriate lane changes. AASHTO (2004) provides a minimum merging lane length for <b>entrance</b> <b>terminals</b> and also a minimum diverging lane length by considering the design speed of ramp terminal and design speed of highway main stream without considering flow rates of influenced area. This research proposed a novel merging and diverging model using statistical platform called Minitab to predict merging and diverging lane lengths, respectively based on macroscopic parameters for Malaysia road traffic conditions. A video recorded traffic empirical data was collected and the post processing analysis was conducted by means of Semi-Automatic Video Analyser (SAVA). The validation of the proposed model is performed by comparing the predicted length data of the model with the empirical length data using paired t-test. The effect of merging and diverging lane lengths were further analysed by using the collected empirical speed data of merging and diverging speed on the ramp and the effective length used for the traffic operation on ramps. The research observed macroscopic and microscopic parameters have significant findings towards the traffic operatio...|$|R
