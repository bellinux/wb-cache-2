40|$|Abstract—The correct {{interpretation}} of many molecular biology experiments depends in an essential {{way on the}} accuracy and consistency of the existing annotation databases. Such databases are meant to act as repositories for our biological knowledge as we acquire and refine it. Hence, by definition, they are incomplete at any given time. In this paper, we describe a technique that improves our previous method for predicting novel GO annotations by extracting implicit semantic relationships between genes and functions. In this work, we use a vector space model {{and a number of}} weighting schemes in addition to our previous latent semantic indexing approach. The technique described here is able to take into consideration the hierarchical structure of the Gene Ontology (GO) and can weight differently GO terms situated at different depths. The prediction abilities of 15 different weighting schemes are compared and evaluated. Nine such schemes were previously used in other problem domains, while six of them are introduced in this paper. The best weighting scheme was a novel scheme, n 2 tn. Out of the top 50 functional annotations predicted using this weighting scheme, we found support in the literature for 84 percent of them, while 6 percent of the predictions were contradicted by the existing literature. For the remaining 10 percent, we did not find any relevant publications to confirm or contradict the predictions. The n 2 tn weighting scheme also outperformed the simple binary scheme used in our previous approach. Index Terms—Gene function prediction, gene annotation, Gene Ontology, vector space model, latent semantic <b>indexing,</b> <b>weighting</b> schemes. ...|$|E

30|$|Determining {{the weight}} of risk {{evaluation}} of channel navigation is an important process for evaluating the research object. At the same time, whether the weight determined is reasonable has {{a direct impact on}} the accuracy of the final evaluation results. Many scholars have studied calculation methods of <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> from both subjective and objective perspectives. After referring to related literature and comparatively analyzing weight calculation methods, two commonly used methods at present are AHP and entropy weight. Of which, AHP mainly calculates the <b>index</b> <b>weight</b> of evaluation with human’s subjective experience, while the entropy <b>weight</b> calculates the <b>index</b> <b>weight</b> of evaluation through correlation analysis of data. It is difficult to obtain accurate <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> via using traditional weight calculation methods due to the complexity of channel navigation environment. Hence, a method of set-valued statistics is adopted in this paper to determine <b>index</b> <b>weights.</b> The method of set-valued statistics is a fuzzy interval instead of a definite value in the classical statistics, which can accurately reflect experts’ scoring criteria and increase the credibility of evaluation results. Therefore, the set-valued statistics is adopted in this paper to determine the <b>weight</b> of each <b>index</b> of evaluation.|$|R

40|$|Many {{conservation}} programs, {{such as the}} Conservation Reserve Program (CRP), use indices {{to select}} offers. When modeling how changes in the <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> effect program outcomes, one must account for the attributes of available land, and which landowners chose to participate. This paper introduces a methodology to account for changes in participation as <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> change. Data on the actual CRP (all offers received) are combined with an artificial population of available lands (based on National Resources Inventory data). Bootstrapping methods are used to calibrate estimates of participation probability, and to account for errors-in-variables when estimating how index scores effect this probability. Preliminary analysis suggests that accounting for participation effects will effect estimated impacts of changing the CRP's <b>index</b> <b>weights.</b> Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
30|$|Smart {{electricity}} utilization (SEU) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important components in a smart grid. It is crucial to evaluate efficiency, safety, and demand response capability of electricity users to achieve the smart use of electricity. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) uses subjective criteria to determine <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> in multi-criteria decision-making problems, while the entropy method provides objectivity in determining <b>index</b> <b>weights.</b> Taking into account the uncertainty of expert scoring and user data, a hybrid interval analytic hierarchy process (IAHP) and interval entropy (IE) method is proposed for electricity user evaluation (EUE). Specifically, in the proposed method, electricity users are evaluated in terms of energy efficiency, safety monitoring, and demand response. The <b>weights</b> of EUE <b>indices</b> are calculated under uncertainty. The proposed approach derives subjective <b>weights</b> of EUE <b>indices</b> by the IAHP with expert scoring as input data, and determines objective <b>weights</b> of EUE <b>indices</b> by the IE method with user data as inputs. In order to obtain the optimal combined <b>index</b> <b>weights,</b> the two weights are normalized by a selected weight factor. Numerical case studies illustrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach, which combines subjective and objective information to derive the optimal combined <b>index</b> <b>weights.</b>|$|R
40|$|Many of the Nation’s {{conservation}} programs seek to achieve multiple environmental objectives. Implementing a multi-objective program efficiently requires program managers to balance different environmental and cost objectives. A number of {{conservation programs}} use an index approach to prioritize objectives and rank program applications. This approach keeps program objectives distinct and enables program managers to use weights {{to determine the}} relative importance of each objective. This report provides empirical evidence on the environmental and cost tradeoffs of different <b>index</b> <b>weighting</b> schemes in USDA’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The analyses take into account both land characteristics and how changes to an index affect producer decisions to voluntarily apply. While small changes in <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> do not markedly affect the outcomes of the CRP, larger changes can have a moderate effect. Opportunities for obtaining multiple environmental benefits simultaneously by increasing the <b>index</b> <b>weight</b> on one objective appear limited, and increasing an objective’s <b>index</b> <b>weight</b> by at least 20 percent can trigger losses of benefits related to other objectives. Weight changes in smaller incremental program enrollments also result in more tradeoffs than in very large program enrollments.

40|$|Current dog {{breeding}} programmes must be changed if genetic improvement {{in health and}} behaviour traits is to be achieved. A computer simulation programme {{was used to assess}} the possible genetic improvement in hip dysplasia (HD), elbow dysplasia (ED) and behaviour (BE) traits in a dog population whilst simultaneously selecting for appearance (AP). The structure of the Finnish Rottweiler population was used in the simulation. Over a ten-year period (1989 - 1998), the realised genetic response to selection in the Finnish Rottweiler population was 0. 03 genetic standard deviations (SD) for both HD and ED. The relative selection <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> were iterated in the simulation, accordingly, as 0. 4 for both traits. In the current breeding strategies, AP dominates other traits. Present <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> for BE and AP were therefore assumed to be 0. 5 and 2. 0, respectively. With these assumed current <b>index</b> <b>weights,</b> using best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) breeding values, neither {{an increase in the number}} of breeding candidates nor an increase in the number of screened relatives of the candidates resulted in further genetic response for HD, ED or BE. The desired genetic responses for HD, ED and BE over a period of 10 years could only be attained by changing the relative selection <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> dramatically in favour of these traits. As long as the <b>index</b> <b>weights</b> clearly favoured HD, ED and BE, the increase in the number of breeding candidates, ie in the number of screened dogs, resulted in a further response in these traits. To preserve desired behaviour and to improve health in dog breeds, systematic {{breeding programmes}} favouring these traits should be developed, and a greater number of dogs should be screened for health and behaviour. Breeders should stop breeding exhaustively for appearance and place more emphasis on health and behaviour traits...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Overweight {{and obesity}} {{have become a}} global epidemic. The {{prevalence}} of overweight and obesity among U. S. adolescents has almost tripled in the last 30 years. Results from recent systematic reviews demonstrate that no single, particular intervention or strategy successfully assists overweight or obese adolescents in losing weight. An understanding of factors that influence healthy weight-loss behaviors among overweight and obese female adolescents promotes effective, multi-component weight-loss interventions. There is limited evidence demonstrating associations between demographic variables, body-mass <b>index,</b> and <b>weight</b> perception among female adolescents {{trying to lose weight}}. There is also a lack of previous studies examining the association of the accuracy of female adolescents' weight perception with their efforts to lose weight. This study, therefore, examined the associations of body-mass <b>index,</b> <b>weight</b> perception, and weight-perception accuracy with trying to lose weight and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method among a representative sample of U. S. female adolescents. Methods A nonexperimental, descriptive, comparative secondary analysis design was conducted using data from Wave II (1996) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). Data representative of U. S. female adolescents (N = 2216) were analyzed using STATA statistical software. Descriptive statistics and survey weight logistic regression were performed to determine if demographic and independent (body-mass <b>index,</b> <b>weight</b> perception, and weight perception accuracy) variables were associated with trying to lose weight and engaging in exercise as a weight-loss method. Results Age, Black or African American race, body-mass <b>index,</b> <b>weight</b> perception, and weight perceptions accuracy were consistently associated with the likeliness of trying to lose weight among U. S. female adolescents. Age, body-mass <b>index,</b> <b>weight</b> perception, and weight-perception accuracy were positively associated (p Conclusions Findings suggest that factors influencing weight-loss efforts, including age, race, body-mass <b>index,</b> <b>weight</b> perception, and weight-perception accuracy, should be incorporated into existing or new multi-component weight-loss interventions for U. S. adolescent females in order to help reduce the national epidemic of overweight and obesity among U. S. female adolescents. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- in {{this article}} three {{retrieval}} models for probabilistic indexing are described along with evaluation results for each. First is the binary independence indexing @II) model, which is a generalized version of the Maron and Kuhns indexing model. In this model, the <b>indexing</b> <b>weight</b> of a descriptor in a document is {{an estimate of the}} proba-bility of relevance of this document with respect to queries using this descriptor. Sec-ond is the retrieval-with-probabilistic-indexing (RPI) model, which is suited to different kinds of probabilistic indexing. For that we assume that each indexing scheme has its own concept of “correctness ” to which the probabilities relate. In addition to the prob-abilistic <b>indexing</b> <b>weights,</b> the RPI model provides the possibility of reIevance weight-ing of search terms. A third mode 1 that is similar was proposed by Croft some years ago {{as an extension of the}} binary independence retrieval model but it can be shown that this model is not based on the probabilistic ranking principle. The probabilistic <b>indexing</b> <b>weights</b> required for any of these models can be provided by an application of the Darm-stadt indexing approach (DIA) for indexing with descriptors from a controlled vocabu-Iary. The experimental results show signi~cant improvements over retrieval with binary indexing.

Snippets generated by web search engines for each query result is an application of text summarization. Existing text summarization techniques shows that the indexing is done {{on the basis of the}} words in the document and consists of an array of the posting lists. Document features like term frequency, text length are used to assign <b>indexing</b> <b>weight</b> to words. Hence <b>indexing</b> <b>weights</b> of the document words are used to calculate the sentence similarity value between document words which remains independent on context. The word based index seems to be less efficient due to information retrieval problems like polysemy and Synonymy. Thus the significance of term for building the index is reduced and the emphasis is laid on the context of the document. This paper proposes an indexing structure in which index is built on the basis of context of the document rather than on the terms basis. While doing so we have also used novel concept of Lexical association (semantic association) between document words to calculate the similarity between sentences using computed <b>indexing</b> <b>Weights.</b> The proposed concept of sentence similarity measure has been used with the graph-based ranking method to create document graph and get summary of document...|$|R
