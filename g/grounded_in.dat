5|$|Agnes Fay Morgan (May 4, 1884 – July 20, 1968) was an American chemist and academic. She was the {{longtime}} {{chair of the}} home economics program at the University of California.

5|$|Aristotle's {{biology is}} {{the theory of}} biology, <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> {{systematic}} observation and collection of data, mainly zoological, embodied in Aristotle's books on the science.

His theory is based on his concept of form, which derives from but is markedly unlike Plato's theory of Forms.|$|E

5|$|During the Great Depression Flanders {{began to}} write about social policy. His major concern was human {{development}} in a technological era.

5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death.

5|$|The second {{school of}} Vedanta is the Vishishtadvaita, {{which was founded}} by Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE). Ramanuja {{disagreed}} with Adi Shankara and the Advaita school.

Ramanuja frequently cited the Upanishads, and stated that Vishishtadvaita is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> the Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|The third {{school of}} Vedanta called the Dvaita school {{was founded by}} Madhvacharya (1199–1278 CE). It is {{regarded}} as a strongly theistic philosophic exposition of Upanishads.

5|$|According to Eliot {{the poetic}} {{aspects of the}} poem are <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> the {{tradition}} of John Cleveland, Edward Benlowes, William Blake, and William Butler Yeats's early work. Additionally, many of the images {{are connected to the}} poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on the writings of St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by the writings of Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step to a better society.|$|E
5|$|Because Missouri had {{run aground}} during {{an unusually high}} tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E

5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} Keynesian models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. Keynesian economists responded by building models with microfoundations <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections {{are more likely}} to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> the attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|In early 1949, {{physicist}} Robert Bacher {{stepped down}} from the Atomic Energy Commission. He and AEC Chairman David Lilienthal wanted a physicist to replace Bacher, and they ultimately recommended Smyth for the position. President Harry Truman nominated Smyth to the AEC later that year, prompting Smyth resign as Physics Department chairman. (His old colleague Allen Shenstone took up the post.) Smyth was the commission's only scientist. He spent his first weeks in the position attending hearings of the U.S. Congress's Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Led by Senator Bourke Hickenlooper, the hearings inquired into a small amount of uranium that was alleged to be unaccounted for in AEC labs. Smyth later condemned the hearings as <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> misconceptions about the work of nuclear scientists.|$|E

5|$|In {{terms of}} politics, Southey {{believed}} that {{war with the}} post-revolution France was inappropriate when he first started composing Madoc. By the time the poem was finished, Southey was an advocate for a war against Napoleon's government. Instead of supporting his own government in return, he was opposed {{to the government of}} Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger. The poem is also heavily <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> Southey's ideas on Pantisocracy, and it includes an earlier version of his democratic ideal within a mythic form. The connection between Wales and America within the poem alludes to Southey's own plans to travel from Wales to settle in America to start a new societal system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decade}} {{between the end}} of the Star Trek {{television}} series and the film, many of the futuristic technologies that appeared on the show—electronic doors that open automatically, hypodermic injections, talking computers, weapons that stun rather than kill, and personal communication devices—had become a reality. Roddenberry had insisted that the technology aboard the Enterprise be <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> established science and scientific theories. The Motion Picture likewise received technical consultation from NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at California Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as individuals such as a former astronaut and the science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.|$|E
5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} Keynesian {{economic}} theory completely while monetarists had built on Keynesian ideas.

New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas. Other leaders {{in the development of}} new classical economics include Edward Prescott at University of Minnesota and Robert Barro at University of Rochester.|$|E
