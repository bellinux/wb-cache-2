5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives.

Athenian women could also acquire property by inheritance <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|At the start, {{there were}} {{one or two}} daily round trips with steam locomotive-hauled trains. In {{the first year of}} operation, the line transported 18,500 passengers. The initial ticket price from Sandnes to Ålgård was NOK1.50, {{compared}} to NOK1 for a bus ticket. This was in part because NSB operated with a standard price based on the length of the line, and the line was longer than the corresponding roads. After a while NSB's board accepted that tickets be priced as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> length of the road, and the price was reduced to NOK1.10. Because of competition from truck drivers picking up random passengers for NOK0.75, the price was then reduced to NOK0.80 in 1927. The line made a profit during until the late 1940s, after which it started to operate with a deficit. In the financial year 1948–49, the line transported 79,700 passengers.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Class I, II and III RPDs {{that have}} {{multiple}} edentulous {{areas in which}} replacement teeth are being placed are further classified with modification states that were defined by Oliver C.

Thus if, for example, a maxillary arch is missing teeth #1, 3, 7-10 and 16, the RPD would be Kennedy Class III mod 1. It would not be Class I, because missing third molars are generally not restored in an RPD (although <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>the</b> classification would indeed be Class I), {{and it would not}} be Class IV, because modification spaces are not allowed for Kennedy Class IV.|$|E

25|$|A {{poll by the}} London Evening Standard in December 2007, which {{surveyed}} a {{range of}} the capital's communities, including Muslims, found that 49% of those surveyed considered Islam as generally intolerant, while 44% saw it as generally tolerant. A total of 51% felt that Muslims were isolated from other communities to a degree, with 12% believing {{that the majority of}} them were. A large majority (81% to 7%), believed that the most holy day in Islam, Eid, should not be celebrated by the British state, and 88% opposed Muslim teachers covering their faces at work. A majority (55%) wanted immigration of Muslims to be cut, with 33% wanting it cut greatly. Islam was seen as the cause of the 7 July attacks on the city in 2005 by 52% of the population, with 35% seeing it as a major factor. Views from the survey which were not in line with the largely negative views included that 71% would vote for a Muslim Mayor of London <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> best candidate (with 16% against such a vote).|$|E
25|$|The {{reactions}} {{by modern}} readers to his poetry have varied widely. The papyrologists and historians that first examined them were not impressed. Influenced by their backgrounds in Classical poetry, they compared the Dioscorian verses primarily to Classical standards. The most frequent objection {{was that his}} verses were obscure: the editors thought that the lines did not make sense – or at least, were not saying what the editors expected them to say. A more positive assessment was offered by Leslie MacCoull, who insisted that a reader must take Dioscorus’s Coptic background into consideration when reading the poetry. Many of the poems seemed to be praising unknown dignitaries – including an Emperor and several Dukes – and some papyrologists concluded that Dioscorus wrote the poems to get favors from government administrators (whom the papyrologists vaguely and inconsistently identified). Clement Kuehn, however, proposed that the poems be viewed not from a Classical, Hellenistic, or even a strictly Egyptian perspective, but through a lens of Byzantine culture and spirituality, in which Dioscorus and the Thebaid were so deeply immersed. Kuehn demonstrated that the poems fit neatly and masterfully into the allegorical style that was pervasive in the pictoral art and literature of the Early Byzantine Era. That is: Dioscorus, influenced by allegorical commentaries on the Homeric epics and Bible, and by the allegorical icons and church art of the 6th century, was praising Christ, Old Testament patriarchs, and the saints in heaven as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Emperor, kings, and dignitaries in a Byzantine court.|$|E
25|$|Other pilots at {{the charter}} company told NTSB that pilot Richard Conry and first officer (co-pilot) Michael Guess had both {{displayed}} below-average flying skills. Conry had a well-known tendency to allow copilots {{to take over}} all aircraft functions as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> sole pilot during flights. After the crash, three copilots told of occasions on which they had had {{to take control of}} the aircraft away from Conry. After one of those incidents, only three days before the crash, the copilot (not Guess) had urged Conry to retire. In a post-accident interview, Conry's longtime friend and fellow aviator Timothy Cooney said that he had last spoken to Conry in June 2001 and had expressed concerns about difficulties he had flying King Airs as late as April of that year, 18 months before the accident. Significant discrepancies were also found in the captain's flight logs in the course of the post-accident investigation, indicating he had probably greatly exaggerated his flying experience, most of which had been accrued before a 9–10 year hiatus from flying due to a fraud conviction and poor eyesight. He had had Lasik surgery but it had improved his vision to only 20/50 or 20/30 and he was required by FAA regulations to wear corrective lenses, but the pilot's wife and Cooney said Conry did not wear lenses after the surgery. The coroner who examined his badly burned body was unable to determine whether Conry was wearing contact lenses at the time of the crash.|$|E
