5|$|Agent Doggett {{returns home}} after work and finds Absalom {{waiting for him}} with a gun. Absalom demands Doggett show the back of <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> confirm that Doggett is still himself. He tells Doggett that the man killed at the White House, Howard Salt, died for what he knew about an alien invasion. Absalom duct tapes his gun to Doggett's back in a plan to get Salt's {{information}} with Doggett used as a hostage. The two attempt to sneak into the census bureau's database; Absalom claims that the census bureau had data which showed the aliens were already here. Unfortunately, the plan fails because of an X-ray scanner detecting the gun. Security shoots Absalom through the head despite his use of Doggett as a body shield.|$|E
5|$|Ms. Hartman and Jackie {{are taken}} by the Cybermen for conversion, but the Cyber Leader orders the Doctor held aside because he has {{valuable}} information about the Daleks. The Cyber Leader is destroyed by a strike team led by Jake Simmonds, who have travelled from their universe {{in pursuit of the}} Cybermen. Ms. Hartman is converted, but Jackie escapes into a stairwell. Jake uses a device around <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> take the Doctor to the parallel universe and their version of Torchwood. The Doctor meets with the alternate universe Pete Tyler, who tells him that after he left the Cybermen were sealed in their factories while humanity decided what to do with them. In the meantime, the Cybermen vanished and the breach began causing unprecedented global warming on the parallel Earth, which the Doctor theorises is the start of the process that will lead to both planets falling into the Void. Pete demands the Doctor seal the breach before his Earth is destroyed.|$|E

25|$|On May 22, 2006, a 39-year-old {{man from}} Lakeville, Minnesota {{suffered}} a bruised spinal cord {{while attempting to}} ride the FlowRider wave ride on a boogie board. As a result, the victim had two titanium screws and a plate inserted into <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> stabilize vertebrae and relieve pressure on his spinal cord. Doctor reports stated that the victim was almost paralyzed, but regained some movement in his limbs shortly after surgery.|$|E
25|$|Daoxin {{eventually}} {{settled at}} East Mountain Temple on Shuangfeng ("Twin Peaks") where he taught Chan Buddhism {{for thirty years}} and attracted large numbers of practitioners, some records say five hundred laypeople and monks. In 643 the emperor Tai Zong invited Daoxin to the capital city but Daoxin refused to appear. Three times the emperor sent emissaries and three times Daoxin refused the invitation. The third time the emperor instructed to either bring back Daoxin or his head. When the emissary related this instruction to Daoxin, Daoxin exposed and stretched out <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> allow the emissary to chop off his head. The envoy was so shocked he reported this event to the emperor, who then honored Daoxin as an exemplary Buddhist monk.|$|E

25|$|On October 21, 1835, the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society {{announced}} that George Thompson would be speaking. Pro-slavery forces posted nearly 500 notices of a $100 reward for the citizen that would first lay violent hands on him. Thompson canceled {{at the last}} minute, and William Lloyd Garrison, a newspaper writer who spoke openly against the wrongs of slavery, was quickly scheduled to speak in his place. A lynch mob formed, forcing Garrison to escape {{through the back of}} the hall and hide in a carpenter's shop. The mob soon found him, putting a noose around <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> drag him away. Several strong men intervened and took him to the Leverett Street Jail. Phillips, watching from nearby Court Street, was a witness to the attempted lynching.|$|E
500|$|Blue throat: The epithet [...] (Sanskrit nīla = [...] "blue", [...] = [...] "throat").

Shocked by his act, Parvati squeezed his neck and stopped it in <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> prevent it from spreading all over the universe, {{supposed to be in}} Shiva's stomach. However the poison was so potent that it changed the color of <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> blue.|$|E

500|$|On July 30, Richard {{went to see}} a {{chiropractor}} who rotated <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in {{the left side of his}} body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by neurologist William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A CAT scan of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive arterial thoracic outlet syndrome. While pitching, his clavicle and first rib pinched his subclavian artery. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel [...] "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, [...] "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him." ...|$|E
500|$|Earlier, Håkan {{stops and}} kills a passerby {{on a busy}} {{footpath}} near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making {{his way home from}} a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens the window for Eli and offers <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to [...] "go steady". While Eli states, [...] "I'm not a girl", Oskar (ambiguously) either ignores this or accepts the unclear nature of the relationship.|$|E

60|$|As Tom Poppins {{finished}} these instructions, {{given in}} the card-player's rapid don't-ask-me-any-more-fool-questions manner, Mr. Wrenn {{felt that he was}} choking. He craned up <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> trying <b>to</b> ease <b>his</b> stiff collar. So, then, he was a failure, a social outcast already.|$|R
6000|$|... "There," [...] she said, [...] "I {{knew that}} he would be a good boy at last!" [...] And she sprang up, threw her arms round <b>his</b> <b>neck,</b> and, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> great astonishment, burst into the most violent fit of crying.|$|R
50|$|Jeremiah and {{his friend}} Kurdy travel the country, taking odd jobs and getting mixed up in various affairs. Jeremiah, being the more noble of the two, often sticks <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> out <b>to</b> help others, while Kurdy is a more wily, {{opportunistic}} scoundrel.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] "approach" [...] is {{the final}} canter stride before the jump, during which the horse places all four legs for the optimal take-off. The horse reaches forward and down with <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> lower the {{forehand}} and his center of mass. The forelegs are propped or strutted {{out in front of}} the body. This relatively sudden braking action allows momentum to carry the hindlegs further under the body of the horse than would be otherwise possible. While the action is more fluid, it is mechanically similar to the act of crouching down before jumping.|$|E
2500|$|Muncie {{was born}} and raised in the Pittsburgh area town of Uniontown, Pennsylvania, as one of six {{children}} in a football-playing family. His three brothers called him [...] "Chuck" [...] because they did not like [...] "Harry". When he was six, Muncie was hit by a truck, breaking his thigh, leg, hip, and arm. He was in a cast from <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> his toes for six months, and doctors warned that he might never be able to walk properly again. Muncie recovered to become a multi-sport athlete, but the accident left his left leg shorter than his right. He compensated by playing with a shoe with an extra-thick sole.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{images of}} Durga are seen {{represented}} in the temple, notably on the sanctum and also on the exterior surface of the east facing wall. The shalabhanjikas or two female dwarapalakas guard the doorway, which {{are also in the}} form of the Goddess. The temple is stated to generate [...] "primal energy" [...] in consonance with the characteristics of deity of Durga; the dwarapalika on the left has a bow in her hand and that on the right has a sword. The sanctum depicts Durga on the back wall standing on a lotus, in what is termed as [...] "sambhaga" [...] (standing) posture with four hands, with the upper hands carrying a shankha and a chakra and one lower hand is in an abhaya mudra (posture of a blessing) and the other hand is on hip. The ornament worn is a breast-band without any halter straps. She is surrounded by devotees with a devotee on her left about to decapitate himself as an offering (in another version it is inferred as a flower offering by the devotee), and another devotee (with tied tresses exposing <b>his</b> <b>neck</b> <b>to</b> be cut} on her right mutilating his body parts, also in offering; this was a Hindu rite associated with the Kapalikas. This type of offering to a goddess, though ghastly, is seen in many Durga temples; it is related to the myth of her role as Mahisasuramardini (slayer of demon Mahishasura). Durga images in niches have depictions of the goddess standing on a buffalo head representing the Mahishasura.|$|E
