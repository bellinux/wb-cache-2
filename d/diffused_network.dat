40|$|In this paper, {{a stylized}} model of inter-firm {{collaboration}} is developed {{and used to}} cast long-term, post-learning collaborative relationships in three broad types: competing, piggy-back and mutualistic relationships. In a competing relationship, the total revenue for the collaboration is fixed, and profit-motivated partner firms are inclined to increase their revenue share {{at the expense of}} one another. In a piggy-back relationship, at least one partner {{is more likely to be}} able to increase the total revenue for the collaboration, and hence other partners are willing to be content with their fixed share of revenue. In a mutualistic relationship, all partners are capable of increasing and likely to increase the total revenue for the collaboration than to merely increase their respective shares of the collaboration. As the advent of the information and communication technologies dramatically lower the cost of some internet platforms such as Facebook to host novel (or new variations of) products or services for distribution, the phenomenon of mutualistic entrepreneurship emerges. This paper uses the case of Facebook to examine several propositions on the phenomenon of mutualistic entrepreneurship, namely the tendency for entrepreneurs in mutualistic entrepreneurship to be involved in multiple projects (or products), for projects to involve more than one entrepreneur in collaboration, and for the projects to be linked in a <b>diffused</b> <b>network...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to analyse the {{researches}} performed so far on vehicle choice according to the fuel type. There are different reasons {{to be interested in}} this theme. Among the most relevant we recall the following: a. increasing costs of conventional fuel; b. development of new fuel types; c. different fuel efficiency; d. higher productivity standards, due to crisis of car corporations; e. Italy’s car fleet has a 30 % of vehicles that are ten years or older and also by a strong preference towards buying gasoline and diesel fuelled vehicles. The paper proposes a critical analysis of vehicle choice analysis based on fuel type (e. g. gasoline/diesel, CNG and hybrid). A significant number of studies are centred on the consumer. As noted by Achtnicht (2008) the choice depends on the person’s age, gender and level of schooling. Other authors have inquired the actual gap between the performance of conventional fuels (diesel/gasoline) and that of alternative fuel (hybrid). The lack of a <b>diffused</b> <b>network</b> of refuelling stations, particularly with reference to the CNG (compressed natural gas), has also been highlighted by Achtnicht, Buhler e Hermeling (2009). Several electrical car market development researches, such as the Salerno’s and Zito’s ones (2004), have stressed its high purchasing price and its maintenance costs. We will consider, for the different studies, the methodologies used by the authors, their specific area of research, the results obtained, the criticalities, and eventually the trends and developments. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} spectralist {{approaches to}} composition in acousmatic music. As Murail (2005) asserts, electroacoustic music in general has widened the composer’s range of sound materials and stimulated {{new ways of}} thinking about textural constructs in music, while Grisey’s imperative of (1987) ‘No longer composing with notes but with sounds’ resonates strongly with the spirit of acousmatic music. Digital signal processing permits the investigation of sound’s intrinsic structures as well as the imposition of morphological and spectral shaping from outside the sound. Acousmatic music also turns the microphone toward the natural sound world, thus trading in the affordances of both recognisable sounds and sound objects of very obscure of remote physical provenance. In applying a spectralist perspective to acousmatics, my focus here will be on the notion of the ‘partial object’: that is to say sound progressively stripped of spectral components in order to reveal new objects that become shadows of the holistic object. Several artistic consequences of this approach are discussed: 1. 	As defining features of sound are extracted or hybridised the boundaries of source recognition are explored. 2. 	Interpolation of objects and transitions between textures are feasible as individual sinusoidal components are exposed and potentially blended with other objects. 3. 	The filtering of complex inharmonic and harmonic sounds affords changes in perceived pitch whilst retaining morphological idiosyncrasies of a given sound. 4. 	A means of immersive sound spatialisation is offered by splitting a spectrum across a <b>diffused</b> <b>network</b> of loudspeakers. A key strength of acousmatic music in this regard is that subtle morphological traits of sound and precise frequency values can be retained in processes of spectral disassembly/reassembly, giving insight into the value of pitch in acousmatic forms, but without resort to the approximations necessitated in instrumentally realised spectral works...|$|E

40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen a gradual {{evolution}} {{in the field of}} alternative online news sites. Generally spurred on by mainstream news operators’ lack of understanding of, or interest in, the possibilities of online news publishing, many independent sites have sprung up: these include, for example, the edited collaborative news Website Slashdot in the technology field as well as the more open-access sites Kuro 5 hin and Plastic (which were inspired in good part by the Slashdot model); further, we have also witnessed the rapid growth of the Independent Media Center network from its beginnings on the sidelines of the World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle in 1999, as well as similar ‘citizen journalist’ efforts such as the South Korean OhmyNews phenomenon (which is credited with tipping the balance in that country’s recent presidential election). In addition to these inherently collaborative, multi-authored sites which employ a variety of strategies for editorial oversight, ranging from the almost complete openness of Indymedia to Slashdot’s continuing editorial supervision, a more <b>diffused</b> <b>network</b> of individual news commentators and pundits has also emerged throughout the blogosphere. Here, a great many Weblogs now regularly engage in the discussion and analysis of news events and news reports which they have found elsewhere – a practice I have called ‘gatewatching’ elsewhere (Bruns, 2005). Gatewatching also extends to the mutual monitoring and commentary of bloggers by bloggers, so that, while largely they do remain single-authored, these news-related blogs nonetheless form a loose network through their RSS and TrackBack mechanisms and news aggregation services. This continuous intercast of blog entries therefore leads to the emergence of a kind of peer-to-peer newssharing system, extending throughout the blogosphere (Bruns, 2004). Collaborative news Websites and the intercast of news-related blogs are no longer the only models for multi-user alternative news coverage, however. During the second half of 2004, these projects were joined by a new site, which aims to translate the successful formula of the openly edited Wikipedia online encyclopedia to the realm of news publishing: Wikinews. This project, too, aims at encouraging participation by citizen journalists with the aim of providing quality, reliable, multiperspectival reports on the news, but does so not through traditional content management systems of blogging tools, but by utilising wiki technology. Already, in addition to its original English-language version, it has spawned localised versions in German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Swedish and Bulgarian. With the date of the AoIR conference coinciding roughly with the first public announcements about the Wikinews project in October 2004, this paper will examine {{the first year of the}} project, therefore. It will evaluate the successes and failures experienced in this first year, and draw parallels and point out distinctions from the news coverage and collaborative publishing philosophies in other alternative news Websites. Common to many other sites is the focus on a specific audience (as in Indymedia) or field (as in Slashdot) of news – can the generalist approach of Wikinews be successful? In an environment when many other news Websites have given up any pretensions of objectivity, instead providing partisan reports that cater to their own constituencies, can the Wikipedia doctrine of maintaining a ‘neutral point of view’ (NPOV) work? And how does the unresourced Wikinews compete with the coverage of commercial news organisations...|$|E

40|$|Research {{based on}} {{functional}} imaging and neuronal recordings in the barrel cortex subdivision of primary somatosensory cortex (SI) {{of the adult}} rat has revealed novel aspects of structure-function relationships in this cortex. Specifically, it has demonstrated that single whisker stimulation evokes subthreshold neuronal activity that spreads symmetrically within gray matter from the appropriate barrel area, crosses cytoarchitectural borders of SI and reaches deeply into other unimodal primary cortices such as primary auditory (AI) and primary visual (VI). It was further demonstrated that this spread {{is supported by a}} spatially matching underlying <b>diffuse</b> <b>network</b> of border-crossing, long-range projections that could also reach deeply into AI and VI. Here we seek to determine whether such a network of border-crossing, long-range projections is unique to barrel cortex or characterizes also other primary, unimodal sensory cortices and therefore could directly connect them.

40|$|Rehabilitation is {{a concept}} that embodies all of the key {{elements}} of the social construction and constitution of disability.

40|$|The kidney medulla is physiologically {{exposed to}} {{variations}} in extracellular osmolality. In response to hypertonic cell shrinkage, {{cells of the}} rat kidney medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop undergo p 38 kinase-dependent regulatory volume increase (RVI). In the present study, we investigated the role of actin cytoskeleton reorganization in this process. Addition of hyperosmotic NaCl or sucrose, which activates MAP kinases and reduces cellular volume, induced a sustained actin polymerization occurring after 10 min and concurrently with RVI. In contrast, hyperosmotic urea, which does not modify MAP kinase activity and cellular volume, did not induce sustained actin polymerization. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that hyperosmotic NaCl and sucrose, but not urea, induced the redistribution of F-actin from a dense cortical ring to a <b>diffuse</b> <b>network</b> of actin bundles. Stabilization of actin filaments by jasplakinolide and inhibition of the generation of new actin filaments by swinholide A prevented RVI, whereas depolymerization of actin filaments by latrunculin B attenuated cell shrinkage and enhanced RVI. These actin-interfering drugs did not alter extracellular regulated kinase and p 38 kinase activation under hypertonic conditions. Similar to swinholide A, inhibiting p 38 kinase with SB- 203580 abolished sustained actin polymerization, actin redistribution, and decreased RVI efficacy. We therefore propose that in rat kidney the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop exposed to extracellular hypertonicity, p 38 kinase activation induces depolymerization of the F-actin cortical ring and polymerization of a dense <b>diffuse</b> F-actin <b>network</b> that both contribute to increase RVI efficacy...|$|R

The paper broadens the literature on private security and global security governance by focusing on transnational responses to transnational threats in previously neglected maritime and financial realms. The rise of such corporate crime-fighters is explained by the recent evolution of environments structured by overlapping sovereignty claims which limit state enforcement while simultaneously creating new markets for security services.

Indeed, Bitcoin’s security claims rely on no single entity wielding a sufficiently {{large portion of}} the net-work’s overall computational power. Unfortunately, rather than participating independently, most Bitcoin miners join coalitions called mining pools in which a central pool administrator largely directs the pool’s activity, leading to a consolidation of power.

Relatedly, “hosted mining” service providers offer their clients the benefit of economies-of-scale, tempting them away from independent participation.

Membership increases total external financing by 16. 6 percent, reduces the propensity to enter financial distress by 9. 5 percent, and better insures firms against industry and location shocks. Firms that join improve financial access by borrowing more from new lenders, particularly those already lending to their (new) giant-network neighbors.

This study examines the neural basis of this deficit. Methods: We used a paradigm that incorporates a para-metric manipulation within a go/nogo task, so that the number of go trials preceding a nogo trial is varied to tax the neural systems underlying cognitive control with increasing levels of interference. Results: Using this paradigm in combination with event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we show that children without ADHD have increased suscep-tibility to interference with increasing numbers of go trials preceding a nogo trial, but children with ADHD have difficulty even with a single go trial preceding a nogo trial. In addition, children with ADHD do not activate frontos-triatal regions {{in the same manner as}} normally developing children, but rather rely on a more <b>diffuse</b> <b>network</b> of regions, including more posterior and dorsolateral pre-frontal regions.
