500|$|... 20th Century Fox saw X-Men: First Class as {{the first}} film of a new X-Men trilogy. Donner {{compared}} the franchise plans to the darker, more mature content of the Harry Potter film series. Early reports said Matthew Vaughn and Singer were returning to direct and produce the sequel, respectively. While still attached to the project as a director, Vaughn said, [...] "First Class is similar to Batman Begins, {{where you have the}} fun of introducing the characters and getting to know them, but that takes time. But with the second one, you can just get on with it and have a rollicking good time. That's the main difference between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight". Describing the possible beginning of the film, Vaughn said, [...] "I {{thought it would be fun}} to open with the Kennedy assassination, and we reveal that the magic bullet was controlled by Magneto". Singer said the film could be set around the civil rights movement or the Vietnam War, and that Wolverine could once again be featured. Singer also talked about [...] "changing history" [...] in an interview with Empire magazine. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not want people to panic about events in the past [...] "erasing" [...] the storylines of the previous X-Men films, as he believes in multiverses, explaining the possibility of certain events can exist equally in the histories of alternate universes.|$|E
500|$|Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} episode, {{which he said}} [...] "has wandered {{into the heart of}} Dostoyevsky {{territory}} with its storylines". He particularly praised the episode for going outside its normal conventions by portraying lead characters like Pembleton and Gee as being so reluctant to do the right thing. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News gave the episode four out of five stars; he particularly praised the performances of Thorne and Gerety, and said the show did an impressive job of introducing the new cast members. Michael Storey of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] lived up to the high standards he said the show had set for itself. Ron Miller of Fort Worth Star-Telegram praised [...] "Blood Ties", although <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not always enjoy Homicide: Life on the Street. He said the episode [...] "starts fast and gets better and more intense by the minute", and described the climactic argument in the second episode as [...] "the most turbulent internal dispute we've ever seen among the detectives". Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders praised the main story-line and said the subplots were well juxtaposed into the episode. He also said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] could serve as a good introduction to the series for new viewers. Alan Sepinwall, television critic for The Star-Ledger, criticized the addition of [...] "silly" [...] action-oriented scenes the traditionally more intelligent show, but praised [...] "Blood Ties" [...] and the addition of the new cast members. Sepinwall particularly praised the acting of Andre Braugher: [...] "Pitted against a powerhouse like James Earl Jones, he not only holds his own, but at times is so dramatically forceful that the former voice of Darth Vader sounds intimidated." [...] Not all reviews of [...] "Blood Ties" [...] were positive. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post said the series benefited from the new characters, but that the episode [...] "asks viewers to believe rather too strongly in the inherent racism of certain characters we've come to know as heroes in seasons past". Ostrow also thought Pembleton's clashes with the new detectives was predictable.|$|E

60|$|Being asked, What notice did the {{government}} of Madras take of the king of Tanjore's representations {{of the state of}} his affairs, and his inability to pay? <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not recollect, that, in their correspondence with him, there was any reasoning upon the subject; and in his correspondence with Sir Thomas Rumbold, upon the amount of the jaghire, he seemed very desirous of adapting the demand of government to the Rajah's circumstances; but, whilst he stayed at Tanjore, the Rajah was not exonerated from any part of his burdens.--Being asked, Whether they ever desired the Rajah to make up a statement of his accounts, disbursements, debts, and payments to the Company, in order to ascertain whether the country was able to pay the increasing demands upon it? he said, Through him he is certain they never did.--Being then asked, If he ever heard whether they did through any one else? he said, He never did.|$|E
60|$|Being asked, What {{he thinks}} the real clear receipt of the {{revenues}} of Tanjore were worth when he left it? he said, He cannot say what was the net amount, as {{he does not know}} the expense of the Rajah's collection; but while he was at Tanjore, he understood from the Rajah himself, and from his ministers, that the gross collection did not exceed nine lacs of pagodas (360,000l.).--Being asked, Whether {{he thinks the}} country could pay the eight lacs of pagodas which had been demanded to be paid in the course of one year? he said, Clearly not.--Being asked, Whether there was not an attempt made to remove the Rajah's minister, upon some delay in payment of the deposit? he said, The Governor of Madras wrote to that effect, which he represented to the Rajah.--Being asked, Who was mentioned to succeed to the minister that then was, in case he should be removed? he said, When Sir Hector Munro came afterwards to Tanjore, the old daubiere was mentioned, and recommended to the Rajah as successor to his then dewan.--Being asked, Of what age was the daubiere at that time? he said, Of a very great age: upwards of fourscore.--Being asked, Whether a person called Kanonga Saba Pilla was not likewise named? he said, Yes, he was: he was recommended by Sir Thomas Rumbold; and one recommendation, as well as I can recollect, went through me.--Being asked, What was the reason of his being recommended? he said, He undertook to pay off the Rajah's debts, and to give security for the regular payment of the Rajah's instalments to the Company.--Being asked, Whether he offered to give any security for preserving the country from oppression, and for supporting the dignity of the Rajah and his people? <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not know that he did, or that it was asked of him.--Being asked, Whether he was a person agreeable to the Rajah? he said, He was not.--Being asked, Whether he was not a person who had fled out of the country to avoid the resentment of the Rajah? he said, He was.--Being asked, Whether he was not charged by the Rajah with malpractices, and breach of trust relative to his effects? he said, He was; but he told the Governor that he would account for his conduct, and explain everything to the satisfaction of the Rajah.--Being asked, Whether the Rajah did not consider this man as in the interest of his enemies, and particularly of the Nabob of Arcot and Mr. Benfield? <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not recollect that he did mention that to him: he remembers to have heard him complain of a transaction between Kanonga Saba Pilla and Mr. Benfield; but he told him he had been guilty of a variety of malpractices in his administration, that he had oppressed the people, and defrauded him.--Being asked, In what branch of business the Rajah had formerly employed him? he said, He was at one time, he believes, renter of the whole country, was supposed to have great influence with the Rajah, and was in fact dewan some time.--Being asked, Whether the nomination of that man was not particularly odious to the Rajah? he said, He found the Rajah's mind so exceedingly averse to that man, that he believes he would almost as soon have submitted to his being deposed as to submit to the nomination of that man to be his prime-minister.|$|E
60|$|Mr. George Smith being asked, Whether {{the debts}} of the Nabob of Arcot have {{increased}} since he knew Madras? he said, Yes, they have. He distinguishes his debts into two sorts: those contracted {{before the year}} 1766, and those contracted from that year to {{the year in which}} he left Madras.--Being asked, What he thinks is the original amount of the old debts? he said, Between twenty-three and twenty-four lacs of pagodas, as well as he can recollect.--Being asked, What was the amount of that debt when he left Madras? he said, Between four and five lacs of pagodas, as he understood.--Being asked, What was the amount of the new debt when he left Madras? he said, In November, 1777, that debt amounted, according to the Nabob's own account, and published at Chepauk, his place of residence, to sixty lacs of pagodas, independent of the old debt, on which debt of sixty lacs of pagodas the Nabob did agree to pay an interest of twelve per cent per annum.--Being asked, Whether this debt was approved of by the Court of Directors? <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not know it was.--Being asked, Whether the old debt was recognized by the Court of Directors? he said, Yes, it has been; and the Court of Directors have sent out repeated orders to the President and Council of Madras to enforce its recovery and payment.--Being asked, If the interest upon the new debt is punctually paid? he said, It was not during his residence at Madras, from 1777 to 1779, in which period he thinks no more than five per cent interest was paid, in different dividends of two and one per cent.--Being asked, What is the usual course taken by the Nabob concerning the arrears of interest? he said, Not having ever lent him moneys himself, he cannot fully answer as to the mode of settling the interest with him.|$|E
60|$|He smiled, {{and gave}} a little cough. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like {{to appear to be}} boasting, but that, {{counting}} trombones, there were seven.|$|R

60|$|Being asked, Whether he {{has reason}} to believe the sixty lacs of pagodas was all {{principal}} money really and truly advanced to the Nabob of Arcot, or a fictitious capital, made up of obligations given by him, where no money or goods were received, or which was increased by the uniting into it a greater interest than the twelve per cent expressed to be due on the capital? he said, He {{has no reason to}} believe that the sum of sixty lacs of pagodas was lent in money or goods to the Nabob, because that sum he thinks is of more value than all the money, goods, and chattels in the settlement; but he does not know in what mode or manner this debt of the Nabob's was incurred or accumulated.--Being asked, Whether it was not a general and well-grounded opinion at Madras, that a great part of this sum was accumulated by obligations, and was for services performed or to be performed for the Nabob? he said, He has heard that a part of this debt was given for the purposes mentioned in the above question, but he does not know that it was so.--Being asked, Whether it was the general opinion of the settlement? he said, He cannot say that it was the general opinion, but it was the opinion of a considerable part of the settlement.--Being asked, Whether it was the declared opinion of those that were concerned in the debt, or those that were not? he said, It was the opinion of both parties, at least such of them as he conversed with.--Being asked, Whether he {{has reason to}} believe that the interest really paid by the Nabob, upon obligations given, or money lent, did not frequently exceed twelve per cent? he said, Prior to the 1st of August, 1774, he had had reason to believe that a higher interest than twelve per cent was paid by the Nabob on moneys lent to him; but from and after that period, when the last act of Parliament took place in India, he does not know that more than twelve per cent had been paid by the Nabob, or received from him.--Being asked, Whether it is not his opinion that the Nabob has paid more than twelve per cent for money due since the 1st of August, 1774? he said, He has heard that he has, but he does not know it.--Being asked, Whether he has been told so by any considerable and weighty authority, that was like to know? he said, He has been so informed by persons who he believes had a very good opportunity of knowing it.--Being asked, Whether he was ever told so by the Nabob of Arcot himself? <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> not recollect that the Nabob of Arcot directly told him so, but from what he said he did infer that he paid a higher interest than twelve per cent.|$|E

On Dwarf Fortress wound-based system rather than regular hitpoints, he said, [...] "Hit points are depressing to me.
