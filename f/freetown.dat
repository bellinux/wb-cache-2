5|$|In May 2000, several Chinook {{helicopters}} airlifted British and European Union citizens out of <b>Freetown</b> in Sierra Leone in {{an evacuation}} due to regional instability. In September 2000 Chinooks {{were being used}} to evacuate casualties from fighting in <b>Freetown</b> to RFA Sir Percivale, a support ship docked there.|$|E
5|$|Maid Honor, a 65-ton Brixham yacht trawler, left Poole harbour on 9 August 1941, {{bound for}} West Africa. The five man crew {{were under the}} command of March-Phillipps. The {{remainder}} of the SSRF {{under the command of}} Captain Geoffrey Appleyard had departed earlier aboard a troop transport ship. On 20 September 1941 after six weeks under sail Maid Honor arrived at <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone. <b>Freetown</b> was the agreed rendezvous for both groups, Appleyard's party having arrived at the end of August. After Maid Honors arrival in <b>Freetown</b> the search for the German submarine bases started. Sailing into the many rivers and deltas in the area, they failed to locate any submarines or evidence of a submarine base.|$|E
5|$|A {{day after}} {{the arrival of the}} paras, Director Special Forces (DSF), Brigadier John Holmes, arrived in <b>Freetown</b> with a {{headquarters}} staff which included the commanding officer of 22 SAS and the officer commanding D Squadron, as well as three personnel from the Royal Air Force's Tactical Communications Wing. Holmes based himself at Seaview House, the British military headquarters in <b>Freetown,</b> near the British High Commission. From there, his staff established contact with the SAS observation teams on either side of Rokel Creek and with COBRA, the British government's emergency committee in London. The DSF, who usually attends COBRA meetings during crises which may require the use of special forces, was represented by his chief of staff and by Lieutenant Colonel Tim Collins, operations officer at Headquarters Special Forces.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1941, Empire Simba, with a {{completely}} new crew, had been repaired enough to set out in a Liverpool – <b>Freetown</b> convoy, but evidently returned to Liverpool the same day. After making her way to Oban on 9 September, she began the first of seven roundtrips to <b>Freetown</b> over the next 18 months, including convoy SL 125. Twice, when setting out with convoys, Empire Simba {{had to return to}} port with unspecified problems. In a third convoy sailing, a problem with her steering gear caused her to collide with another convoy ship, Empire Scott, and on 1 August Empire Simba straggled and dropped out of the convoy.|$|E
5|$|In January 1999, the RUF {{attacked}} <b>Freetown.</b> They {{were pushed}} {{back to the}} eastern edges of the city by ECOMOG, after which HMS Norfolk was sent to offer assistance. On arrival, a team from the Department for International Development (DfID) was based on board the ship to assist the crew's efforts. Peter Penfold, the British High Commissioner—who had been evacuated to Guinea—temporarily lived on the ship before it was deemed safe for {{him to return to}} his residence in <b>Freetown.</b> He flew ashore on the Norfolks helicopter for daily meetings, with a detachment of Royal Marines ensuring security. HMS Norfolk was replaced by HMS Westminster, shortly after which Penfold moved back to his residence and the Royal Marines took over security of the compound temporarily.|$|E
5|$|On 12 May, Baroness Symons, {{a junior}} {{minister}} in the MoD, told the House of Lords that British forces would remain in Sierra Leone, mainly to ensure the security of Lungi airport while UNAMSIL brought in reinforcements. Soldiers also remained at the evacuation point in <b>Freetown</b> to ensure its security, while others patrolled the streets of <b>Freetown</b> {{in an attempt to}} reassure residents. HMS Illustrious, with her air group, and the ARG both arrived on 14 May, bringing the number of British personnel in the operational area to approximately 4,500. Harriers from Illustrious began flying reassurance patrols over <b>Freetown</b> and the ARG supplemented British firepower, particularly at Lungi, with the provision of artillery. In the field, the British forces divided their efforts between three lines of operation: support to UNAMSIL, support to the SLA, and preparation to provide humanitarian assistance, should it be necessary, though the expanded mandate only became formal government policy several days later. During the following week, the RUF began to remobilise in the north of the country. The UN and the Sierra Leonean government feared that UNAMSIL troops between the RUF and <b>Freetown</b> {{might not be able to}} stand up to an assault by the RUF, and so the RAF Chinooks—in the country to conduct the evacuation—were used to ferry reinforcements from Lungi as they arrived. Meanwhile, President Ahmad Kabbah formed an alliance of militia groups (including the self-styled Civil Defence Force and the West Side Boys) and the remnants of the SLA, totalling around 6,000 personnel, to assist UNAMSIL forces in blocking the RUF advance. The British also provided reconnaissance for UNAMSIL using ground-based signals and intelligence personnel and special forces as well as flights by Harriers and a Nimrod R1.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski sailed on {{her third}} and final French voyage on 6 June. The liner arrived at Dakar on 15 June, and sailed the next day for <b>Freetown,</b> where she arrived on 18 June. Likely because of the {{confusion}} surrounding the French surrender on 22 June, Pułaskis movements over the next days are unrecorded, but she was detained at Konakry on 8 July by Vichy authorities. That evening, Pułaskis crew raised steam and sailed the ship out of the harbor {{in defiance of the}} detainment. After taking fire from shore batteries at Konakry, the ship arrived back at <b>Freetown</b> on 9 July.|$|E
5|$|With the {{evacuation}} largely complete, the British government turned {{its attention to}} the four British United Nations Military Observers (UNMOs) being held by the RUF. British forces in <b>Freetown</b> helped facilitate the escape of four UNMOs (three British and one from New Zealand) from a UNAMSIL camp at Makeni, which had been besieged by the RUF since ten RUF fighters had been accepted into the disarmament process. After consulting with the British command in <b>Freetown,</b> the four officers left the camp and covertly passed the RUF line before trekking west. They arrived at the UN base at Mile 91 almost 24 hours later, and an RAF Chinook picked them up and flew them to <b>Freetown.</b> No longer having the unarmed observers to protect, the Kenyan UNAMSIL detachment at Makeni fought {{their way out of}} the siege and proceeded west to join other UNAMSIL forces. With the three British officers from Makeni freed, only one British UNMO—Major Andy Harrison—remained a prisoner of the RUF, and the British government began discreetly attempting to establish his location. Harrison and ten other UNMOs had initially been held by the RUF at the latter's base until Harrison convinced the RUF to allow the observers to join the Indian UNAMSIL contingent at Kailahun.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942, the Maritime Commission {{took control}} of SS Agwileon under a bareboat charter and used her to {{transport}} civilian technicians and advisors to <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone, for the U.S. Army. After having boiler difficulties there, the ship then proceeded back to New York via Cape Town, Brazil, Trinidad, and Cuba. The voyage was completed in October.|$|E
5|$|In February and March 1944, Empire Simba made an {{extended}} round trip from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar. During this time, she called in neutral Spain at Valencia on 15 March and Burriana on 18 March. Between April 1944 and June 1945 she made four transatlantic crossings, interrupted by another trip to <b>Freetown</b> in December 1944.|$|E
5|$|On 6 May, the RUF {{blocked the}} road {{connecting}} <b>Freetown</b> to Lungi Airport, prompting UNAMSIL staff to evacuate to the Mamy Yoko Hotel {{in preparation for}} a total withdrawal from Sierra Leone if the RUF advance continued towards <b>Freetown.</b> In response to the deterioration Richards requested that British troops be sent to Dakar, Senegal, to decrease the time required to launch an operation in Sierra Leone. Richards also spoke to the 1 PARA command to update them on the situation. Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment. At the same time, the authority to launch an evacuation operation was delegated to Richards and the British High Commissioner, Alan Jones.|$|E
5|$|The 5th (West Africa) Brigade was {{the second}} of the 81st Division's brigades to be shipped from West Africa. The brigade {{comprised}} 12,000 personnel and was scheduled to depart with Convoy WS32 on 31 July. The liners Britannic, Largs Bay and Tamaroa were available in <b>Freetown</b> to carry 8,528 of these men, and it was decided to sail the troopship SS California directly from the Clyde to provide the remaining berths.|$|E
5|$|The loss of California and Duchess of York {{represented}} a heavy {{blow to the}} Allies' already heavily committed fleet of large troopships. Duchess of Yorks intended role was filled by Nea Hellas after she disembarked Convoy Faith's survivors at <b>Freetown.</b> Nea Hellas embarked the Gold Coast elements of the 5th(West Africa) Brigade at Takoradi from 2August while Britannic, Tamaroa and Largs Bay loaded {{the remainder of the}} unit at other West African ports. Convoy WS32 sailed from <b>Freetown</b> on 5August, and Nea Hellas joined it at sea two days later. The liner was left behind at Durban owing to a mechanical fault, but eventually disembarked its soldiers at Bombay in late September after sailing there as part of Convoy CM45. The West African personnel which were to be transported to the Middle East on board California were embarked on Convoy WS33 in September and arrived at their destination in early November.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1998, the RUF {{began to}} re-mobilise in {{northern}} Sierra Leone. As tensions escalated, the FCO ordered an evacuation of British citizens just before Christmas. Penfold believed the evacuation—the eighth of his career—was unnecessary and argued against it; his objections were over-ruled and {{he was ordered to}} evacuate his staff, though he was allowed to remain in <b>Freetown</b> with his military protection detail. The Royal Air Force evacuated approximately 35 people, but many British people chose to stay. Penfold travelled to Abidjan after Christmas for an international summit on Sierra Leone, but the FCO refused to allow him to return to Sierra Leone, so he again based himself in a hotel in Conakry. The RUF attacked <b>Freetown</b> on 6 January 1999. After 10 days of fighting, the rebels were pushed back and Penfold was transported back to Sierra Leone by a British warship. He flew to <b>Freetown</b> for daily meetings with Kabbah, but was not allowed to move back into his residence and so temporarily lived on the ship. Later in 1999, the Sierra Leone government entered into negotiations which resulted in the Lomé Peace Agreement. Penfold opposed power-sharing with the RUF, and believed he was excluded from the talks in Lomé because of his views. The agreement did not hold, and violence again broke out in early 2000.|$|E
5|$|After a {{few weeks}} {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command, the 1st DF {{was assigned to the}} Nore Command at Harwich, although some of the ships were transferred to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla, where they were tasked for escort and patrol duty. Gipsy was sunk on 21 November after she struck a mine, as did Grenville on 19 January 1940. Unlike the 1st DF, the Second was transferred to Force K in <b>Freetown</b> in West Africa, to help search for German commerce raiders. Some ships were later transferred to Bermuda and the West Indies for escort work and patrolling. They returned to the UK in January and spent several months refitting.|$|E
5|$|After working up, {{the ship}} was briefly {{assigned}} to Western Approaches Command on escort duties before she {{was transferred to the}} 18th Destroyer Flotilla at <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone, where she arrived on 28 April. Boreas remained there until she joined Convoy HG 70 on 10 August at Gibraltar. The ship rescued survivors from four ships and returned them to Gibraltar on 25 August. She received a lengthy refit at South Shields from 19 September to 4 January 1942, after which rejoined the 18th Destroyer Flotilla on 25 January.|$|E
5|$|CAM sailings were {{initially}} limited to North American convoys with aircraft maintenance {{performed by the}} Royal Canadian Air Force at Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. CAM ships sailed on Gibraltar and <b>Freetown</b> convoys beginning in September, 1941, after an aircraft maintenance unit was established at the RAF base at North Front, Gibraltar. No CAM aircraft were provided during January and February 1942 after it proved impossible to maintain the catapult-mounted aircraft in flying order during the North Atlantic winter. CAM sailings resumed on 6 March 1942 on North Atlantic convoys and in April on the Arctic Russian convoys with an RAF aircraft maintenance unit in Archangelsk.|$|E
5|$|Dainty was {{assigned}} to search for contraband being shipped across the Mediterranean throughout October and November, before undergoing a refit at Malta from 8–30 December. On its completion she {{was transferred to the}} 2nd Destroyer Division, based in <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone to search for German commerce raiders operating in the South Atlantic. The ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet in April and was given another refit at Malta from 21 April to 2 June 1940. On its completion, Dainty {{was assigned}} to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla.|$|E
5|$|Fort Stikine joined Convoy OS69KM, which {{departed}} from Liverpool on 23 February 1944. The convoy, consisting of 49 merchant ships escorted by twelve warships, split at sea on 5 March. The two convoys thus formed were OS69, which arrived at <b>Freetown</b> on 15 March; and Convoy KMS43G, which arrived at Gibraltar on 6 March. During the voyage to Gibraltar, a stowaway was discovered. He {{was put to}} work under the charge of the ship's Chief Engineer.|$|E
5|$|In August 1918, a more {{virulent strain}} {{appeared}} simultaneously in Brest, France; in <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone; {{and in the}} U.S. in Boston, Massachusetts. The Spanish flu also spread through Ireland, carried there by returning Irish soldiers. The Allies of World War I came {{to call it the}} Spanish flu, primarily because the pandemic received greater press attention after it moved from France to Spain in November 1918. Spain was not involved in the war and had not imposed wartime censorship.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943 the British Government {{decided to}} {{transfer}} the recently raised 81st (West Africa) Division from West Africa to India {{to take part in}} the Burma Campaign. This unit required much more shipping space than other British divisions, as its fighting units were supported by thousands of porters. To facilitate the division's movement, additional troopships were assigned to the regular WS convoys. The 81stDivision's advance parties departed <b>Freetown</b> with Convoys WS29 and WS30 in April and May, and the 6th (West Africa) Brigade embarked on ships of Convoy WS31 at Lagos between 2 and 10July. It was planned to transport the division's two remaining brigades in convoys WS32 and WS33.|$|E
5|$|Kabbah was {{evacuated}} to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea {{almost as}} soon as fighting broke out, and the coup-makers established the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) with Johnny Paul Koroma as its chairman. The following day, Penfold invited Koroma and several of his associates, along with representatives of Nigeria, the United States, and the UN, to a meeting at the British high commissioner's residence. He found it remarkable that they all attended, but believed it epitomised the esteem in which the office of British high commissioner was held in Sierra Leone. At the meeting, Koroma agreed to open the country's main airport temporarily the next day, which allowed Penfold to organise the evacuation of several planeloads of foreign nationals. The men agreed to reconvene the following day and the meetings continued throughout the week, though almost all diplomatic missions—including those of the UN and US—closed {{over the course of the}} week, leaving just the British and Nigerians in <b>Freetown.</b> In that time, Penfold believed he had persuaded the coup-makers to stand down and allow Kabbah to return but, unbeknownst to the diplomats, the AFRC had invited the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)—the main rebel group in the civil war—to form a joint government in <b>Freetown.</b>|$|E
5|$|On 10 March, Pułaski {{departed}} Marseille on {{the first}} of three voyages from that port. She sailed to Algiers and from there to Dakar on 13 March. Pułaski left Dakar for <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone, and Konakry, French Guinea, returning to Dakar in early April. Sailing for Marseille on 5 April, the ship returned on 13 April as a part of convoy DF 29. Leaving again about two weeks later, she repeated the trip and returned to Marseille on 29 May as a part of convoy DF 41. By the time of her return, the German invasion of France had been underway for nearly three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of a week, British forces {{evacuated}} approximately 500 entitled persons from Sierra Leone—almost 300 of whom left in the first two days of the operation. The arrival of British soldiers boosted morale in the country, and many foreign citizens opted to stay. The operation took on a slower pace after the first two days, but personnel and aircraft remained ready to evacuate any entitled persons who had been unable to reach <b>Freetown</b> earlier and to evacuate the British High Commission if the security situation deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski next {{made her}} way to the Clyde in late October. Between 10 May and 12 June 1941, she sailed on three {{roundtrip}} trooping runs between Clyde and Iceland. In late June, Pułaski, loaded with 2,047 troops, sailed from Clyde to join convoy WS 9B headed for <b>Freetown.</b> The convoy arrived at its destination on 13 July. After three days, Pułaski and four other ships sailed on to Cape Town, arriving on 27 July. Leaving behind one ship at Cape Town, Pułaski and the others sailed on 30 July to their final destination of Aden, where they arrived in mid August.|$|E
5|$|Shenandoah Valley and Newtown's central {{location}} attracted heavy traffic through the region, and wagon-making {{emerged as an}} important industry for the town; Newtown artisans supplied wagons throughout the state. By 1830, the town's population had reached 800. In the late 1850s, free blacks began a settlement about a mile east of town which became known as Crossroads or <b>Freetown,</b> which lasted until {{the time of the}} American Civil War. After the January 1, 1863, Emancipation Proclamation, most of the newly freed slaves and many of the already free blacks left the area.|$|E
5|$|Sierra Leone is {{a country}} in West Africa, close to the equator, with an area of 71,740 square {{kilometres}} (27,700 square miles)—similar in size to South Carolina or Scotland. It shares land borders with Guinea and Liberia and is bordered to the west by the Atlantic Ocean. The country became a British colony in 1808, though British influence {{began in the late}} 18th century when former slaves were settled in the area that became known as <b>Freetown,</b> now the capital city. <b>Freetown</b> lies on a peninsula, and is separated from the country's main airport, Lungi, by the estuary of the Sierra Leone River, which is several miles wide. The colony was granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1961 and Sir Milton Margai was appointed its first prime minister. He was replaced in 1962 by his brother, Albert, who was defeated by Siaka Stevens in the 1967 general election. Stevens was overthrown within hours by the commander of the army, but was later reinstated after the commander was himself overthrown. Sierra Leone became a republic in 1971, and Stevens was installed as its first president.|$|E
5|$|The Stanley Matthews Collection {{is held by}} the National Football Museum. In February 2010, {{the boots}} worn by Matthews in the 1953 FA Cup Final were {{auctioned}} at Bonhams in Chester for £38,400, to an undisclosed buyer. Sierra Leonean football club Mighty Blackpool F.C., based {{in the capital city}} of <b>Freetown,</b> changed their name from Socro United in 1954 because of their admiration for Matthews. Ormiston Sir Stanley Matthews Academy is a secondary school in Blurton, Staffordshire named after him.|$|E
5|$|The ship began a refit at Singapore on 7 August 1939 {{and she was}} {{transferred}} to the Mediterranean Fleet after it was completed in November. Diamond arrived at Malta on 19 December, but she {{was transferred}} to the South Atlantic Station the following month. She departed Malta on 8 January 1940, bound for <b>Freetown</b> where she joined the 20th Destroyer Division for escort duties. In April the ship returned to the Mediterranean where Diamond was assigned to the newly formed 10th Destroyer Flotilla after a short refit at Malta.|$|E
5|$|West Cheswalds next sailing {{began on}} 6 June, {{when she left}} Boston for Halifax, sailing from the latter port on 16 June in Convoy SC-134 bound for Liverpool. Breaking off from the convoy for Loch Ewe, West Cheswald also visited Methil, Southend, and Oban, before {{returning}} to New York on 11 August. Sailing from there on 6 September, she began her final trip to Africa, in which she visited the West African ports of Bathurst, <b>Freetown,</b> Monrovia, and Takoradi before returning to Philadelphia via Trinidad on 27 January 1944. She sailed from Philadelphia ten days later, ending up in Boston.|$|E
5|$|When {{the last}} besieged {{garrison}} (aside from Kailahun) was evacuated on 30 May, preparations {{for a military}} extraction—should Jetley's negotiations fail—began to increase. The operation (codenamed Operation Khukri) was eventually launched on 10 July. Two RAF Chinooks transported Indian special forces {{to the outskirts of}} Kailahun. The helicopters returned to <b>Freetown</b> with Harrison, his fellow UNMOs, and several Gurkhas who had been wounded during the siege. Harrison was safely extracted and the 600 Gurkhas successfully fought their way out of Kailahun, suffering one casualty in the process.|$|E
5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of war, Decoy {{was assigned to the}} Mediterranean Fleet and assigned to contraband control duties. In December the ship began an extensive refit to repair corrosion problems, fix her boiler feedwater pumps, and replace her funnels. After completing her repairs in January 1940, she was transferred to <b>Freetown,</b> joining the 20th Destroyer Flotilla, to escort convoys off the West African coast. Decoy returned to the Mediterranean Fleet in May and was assigned to the 10th Destroyer Flotilla. Together with her sister , she escorted Convoy US-2 carrying Australian and New Zealand troops to the Middle East through the Red Sea from 12 to 17 May.|$|E
5|$|After {{a three-week}} {{crossing}} of the South Atlantic, Kentuckian arrived at Paramaribo on 22 August, where she took on a load of bauxite {{and made her way}} to New York, where she docked on 20 September. The cargo ship slowly made her way south, calling at Charleston, Key West, and Guantánamo Bay along her way to Trinidad, where she arrived on 5 November. Sailing 11 November, Kentuckian began her third and final trip to Africa. She arrived at <b>Freetown</b> on 25 November and called at Bathurst and Takoradi over the next two months before returning to Trinidad on 31 January 1943. Sailing from Trinidad on 4 February, she called at Guantánamo Bay and Baltimore on her way to New York, where, arriving in late March, she prepared to begin transatlantic convoy sailings to the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to New York on 31 May {{by way of}} Reykjavík and Halifax, West Cheswald made a brief trip to Philadelphia and back before she worked {{her way down the}} East Coast to Norfolk, Virginia, where she arrived on 17 June. Sailing the next day, the cargo ship began the first of two African trips, during which she made many of the same ports as in her two 1941 voyages. On the homeward leg of her second voyage, she called at Takoradi and <b>Freetown</b> on the western coast of Africa in March 1943. After {{returning to}} the Americas, West Cheswald visited Saint Thomas, San Juan, and Mayagüez in the Caribbean before returning to Philadelphia on 28 April.|$|E
5|$|Aniru Sahib Sahib Conteh {{was born}} on 6 August 1942, {{in the town of}} Jawi Folu, Eastern Province, Sierra Leone, the son of a farmer and chief of the village. He moved to <b>Freetown,</b> the capital of Sierra Leone, after his mother died while he was in his teens. Conteh studied {{chemistry}} and biology at Fourah Bay College and began teaching after receiving his BSc. In 1968, he began studying medicine in Nigeria at the modern University of Ibadan, graduating in 1974. Conteh spent the next four years employed by the Ibadan Teaching Hospital. He returned home to Sierra Leone in 1979. Conteh married and raised a family with his wife Sarah, producing several sons and daughters.|$|E
5|$|Bridgewater {{remained}} on the China Station until 1935, when she joined the Africa Station (later known as the South Atlantic Station). The ship returned to Devonport Dockyard on 1 September 1936 for a month's refit {{and then returned to}} Simonstown. Bridgewater had her second high-angle four-inch gun installed during a refit there. It was interrupted by the Munich Crisis of September 1938 when she was ordered to <b>Freetown,</b> Sierra Leone. The ship later resumed her refit and remained in South Africa until she returned to Devonport for another refit on 13 April 1939. It was completed on 17 May when Bridgewater began a leisurely cruise back to South Africa and arrived there in August.|$|E
