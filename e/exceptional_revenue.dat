40|$|Usually {{regarded}} as a financial advantage enjoyed by the issuers of the currency, seigniorage {{is the difference between}} the nominal value of the currency sign and the cost of its production and distribution.

Sometimes <b>exceptional,</b> <b>revenues</b> from this operation allow the government to finance its spending without raising new taxes.

500|$|Royal {{builders}} in Scotland {{led the way}} {{in adopting}} further European Renaissance styles in castle design. James IV and James V used <b>exceptional</b> one-off <b>revenues,</b> such as the forfeiture of key lands, to establish their power across their kingdom in various ways including constructing grander castles such as Linlithgow, almost invariably by extending and modifying existing fortifications. These Scottish castle palaces drew on Italian Renaissance designs, in particular the fashionable design of a quadrangular court with stair-turrets on each corner, using harling to giving them a clean, Italian appearance. Later the castles drew on Renaissance designs in France, such as the work at Falkland and Stirling Castle. The shift in architectural focus reflected changing political alliances, as James V had formed a close alliance with France during his reign. In the words of architectural historian John Dunbar the results were the [...] "earliest examples of coherent Renaissance design in Britain".|$|R
500|$|An {{extensive}} {{building and}} rebuilding of royal palaces probably began under James III (r. 1460–88) and accelerated under James IV, reaching its peak under James V (r. 1513–42). They used <b>exceptional</b> one-off <b>revenues,</b> {{such as the}} forfeiture of key lands, to establish their power across their kingdom in various ways including constructing grander castles by extending and modifying existing fortifications. These works {{have been seen as}} directly reflecting the influence of Renaissance styles. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace of a palatium ad moden castri (a castle-style palace), combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery and using harling to give them a clean, Italian appearance. There is evidence of Italian masons working for James IV, in whose reign Linlithgow was completed and other palaces were rebuilt with Italianate proportions. According to architectural historian John Dunbar, the results were the [...] "earliest examples of coherent Renaissance design in Britain".|$|R
