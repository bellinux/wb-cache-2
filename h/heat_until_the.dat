60|$|All {{that night}} {{and for the first}} hours of the day that followed, they went forward swiftly, camping at last to eat and sleep {{in the shadow of a}} mass of rock that looked like a {{gigantic}} castle with walls and towers. Here they remained in the burning <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> sun began to sink once more, and then went on again, leaving some of the bearers behind them, because there was no longer water for so many. There the great men sat in patient resignation and watched them go, they who knew that having little or no water, few of them could hope to see their homes again. Still, so great was their dread of the Ghost-priests, that they never dared to murmur, or to ask that any of the store of water should be given to them, they who were but cattle to be used until they died.|$|E
60|$|The {{same order}} reappears. From the 13th to the 19th the {{temperature}} of the air steadily falls, while {{the temperature of}} the tree continues apparently to follow the course of previous variations, and does not really begin to fall, is not really affected by the ebb of <b>heat,</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> 17th, three days at least after it had been operating in the air.[49] Hence we may conclude that all variations of {{the temperature of the}} air, whatever be their period, from twenty-four hours up to twelve months, are followed in the same manner by variations in the temperature of the tree; and that those in the tree are always less in amount and considerably slower of occurrence than those in the air. This thermal sluggishness, so to speak, seems capable of explaining all the phenomena of the case without any hypothetical vital power of resisting temperatures below the freezing point, such as is hinted at even by Becquerel.|$|E

50|$|Immersion {{chillers}} work by circulating {{a cooling}} fluid (usually tap {{water from a}} garden hose or faucet) through a copper/stainless steel coil that is placed directly in the hot wort.

50|$|Most {{experimental}} {{data can be}} explained by the model which considers cool flame just as a slow chemical reaction where the rate of heat generation is higher than the heat loss.

50|$|The {{manufacture}} of true ormolu employs {{a process known}} as mercury-gilding or fire-gilding, in which a solution of mercuric nitrate is applied to a piece of copper, brass, or bronze; followed by the application of an amalgam of gold and mercury.

50|$|Tocino is {{traditionally}} {{boiled in water}} (just {{enough to cover the}} meat) or fried in oil, or is cooked over medium <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> fat is rendered. The original tocino is marinated only with salt, sugar, and salitre (saltpetre), although pineapple juice may be added for a slightly tart flavor. The Kapampangans who make tocino mix it for four to six hours in order to achieve thickness and softness in the meat, then leave it overnight at room temperature before serving it as burong babi (fermented pork).|$|E

50|$|After the ore is crushed into a fine powder, it's lightly panned {{to leave}} only the {{heaviest}} minerals in the pan.

5000|$|Meanwhile, the {{locomotives}} were uncoupled {{from the}} train {{and sent to the}} engine terminal to be serviced for their next assignment. Then, the head-end cars were uncoupled {{from the rest of the}} train and pulled by a station switcher to a parcel facility where express packages were unloaded. The departing train was reassembled, freshly cleaned and serviced for the next journey. A steam pipe from the station's steam generator was attached to the train's steam line from the rear to supply <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> locomotives were coupled up front to supply steam.|$|E
50|$|Sautéed {{mushrooms}} is {{a common}} dish prepared by the sautéing of sliced or whole edible mushrooms. Butter is typically used when sautéing the dish, and margarine and cooking oils such as olive oil and canola oil are also used. Clarified butter can be used, as can a mixture of oil and butter. The dish is typically cooked for over a high <b>heat</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mushrooms are browned, with the oil or butter being very hot in a pan before the mushrooms are added. Overcooking may create an inferior dish by the causing the mushrooms to lose moisture and becoming shriveled.|$|E
5000|$|According to Mobile Roadmaps from 2005, Intel's Yonah project {{originally}} {{focused more}} on reducing the power consumption of its P6-based Pentium M processor and aimed to reduce it by 50% for Intel Core (Yonah). Intel continued [...] recommending the NetBurst-based Mobile Pentium 4 processors for high performance applications (although these were less power efficient and gave off significantly more <b>heat)</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> Yonah project succeeded in extracting higher performance from its lower-power-consumption design. The Intel Core Duo's inclusion of two highly efficient cores on one chip can provide better performance than a Mobile Pentium 4 core, and with much better power-efficiency. Intel no longer recommends its Mobile Pentium 4 processors for mobile devices as they are outdated.|$|E

Pro-monument protestors, many from out of state, bearing Confederate flags and open-carrying firearms, surrounded the monument for weeks. They were confronted by locals who supported removal, and confrontations grew more <b>heated</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> City cordoned the area.|$|R
5|$|Mrs Smith's Cottage is a {{mid-19th century}} Grade II listed {{building}} made from early Victorian red bricks. The range, {{the heart of}} the house, was in daily use for cooking and <b>heating</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> mid-1990s. The only access to the bedrooms is by a ladder. Electricity was installed in the 1930s, and the only other visible modern innovations are the coldwater tap – installed to prevent the local council condemning the cottage in the late 1970s – and an inside toilet. The original outside privy and washhouse can still be viewed.|$|R
50|$|Aluminium becomes work {{hardened}} {{during the cold}} rolling process and is annealed for most purposes. The rolls of foil are <b>heated</b> <b>until</b> <b>the</b> degree of softness is reached, which may be up to 340 C for 12 hours. During this heating, the lubricating oils are burned off, leaving a dry surface. Lubricant oils may not be completely burnt off for hard temper rolls, which can make subsequent coating or printing more difficult.|$|R
