Keywords: error analysis, {{grammatical}} errors, {{sources of}} error Writing {{is one of}} the language skills which is important <b>in</b> humans’ life. <b>Writing</b> involves more than just producing words and sentences. To be able to produce a piece of writing, the writers should be able to write a connected series of words and sentences which are grammatically and logically linked, so that the purpose they have in their mind will suit the intended readers. <b>Writing</b> <b>in</b> different language is difficult. So, the writer tends to make errors. Analyzing students’ errors is important to improve students’ writing ability. Error analysis is the study of the learners’ error which can be observed, analyzed, and classified to reveal something of the system operating within the learner. So, it is significant to study on what types of error and the sources of the <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> made by the first students of English department of IAIN Tulungagung. The formulation of research problems were; 1) What are the most types of grammatical <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> made by the first semester students of English Depatment of IAIN Tulungagung? 2) What are the possible sources of errors made by students? The objectives of this research were then to; 1) To find out the most types of common grammatical <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> made by the first semester students of English Department of IAIN Tulungagung 2) To find out the possible sources of the <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> made by the first semester students of English Department of IAIN Tulungagung. The design of this research was qualitative research with descriptive approach. The data source was the first semester students’ writing of English department of IAIN Tulungagung. The data were any <b>errors</b> found <b>in</b> the students’ <b>writing</b> which were identified based on surface strategy taxonomy. The technique of data collection was document analysis. The technique of data verification was triangulation. Then, the data were analyzed by error analysis.

The data of this research are collected through written test to know the types of error, and interview to know the possible cause of the errors. After collecting the data, the writer analyzes the data, finds the students’ errors on the use of grammar, classifies the students’ errors into types i. e.; omission, addition, misformation, transitional signal, punctuation, and capitalization and describes the possible causes of students’ errors. The causes of the students’ errors were analyzed from the point of intralingual causes of errors recommended by Richard, i. e.; over generalization, ignorance of rules restrictions, incomplete application of rules, and false concepts hypothesized. Based on the result of this research, the students made six types of <b>errors</b> <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> composition, i. e.; transitional signal, punctuation, capitalization, omission, addition, and misformation.
