Unlike profit oriented businesses, which use a single set of self-balancing accounts (or <b>general</b> <b>ledger),</b> nonprofits can {{have more than one}} <b>general</b> <b>ledger</b> (or fund), depending on their financial reporting requirements. An accountant for such an entity must be able to produce reports detailing the expenditures and revenues for each of the organization's individual funds, and reports that summarize the organization's financial activities across all of its funds.|$|E

The vulnerability of the system is also apparent if the computer system breaks down. The activity of an entire department may be halted if the system is out of operation. Keeping a computer system secure from break-in and break-down should be very important to a corporation that heavily depends on computers.

40|$|In recent years, {{there have}} been several large {{accounting}} frauds where a company's financial results have been intentionally misrepresented by billions of dollars. In response, regulatory bodies have mandated that auditors perform analytics on detailed financial data with the intent of discovering such misstatements. For a large auditing firm, this may mean analyzing millions of records from thousands of clients. This paper proposes techniques for automatic analysis of company <b>general</b> <b>ledgers</b> on such a large scale, identifying irregularities � which may indicate fraud or just honest errors � for additional review by auditors. These techniques have been implemented in a prototype system, called Sherlock, which combines aspects of both outlier detection and classification. In developing Sherlock, we faced three major challenges: developing an efficient process for obtaining data from many heterogeneous sources, training classifiers with only positive and unlabeled examples, and presenting information to auditors in an easily interpretable manner. In this paper, we describe how we addressed these challenges {{over the past two years}} and report on experiments evaluating Sherlock. 1...|$|R

These daybooks are not part of the double-entry bookkeeping system. The information recorded in these daybooks is then transferred to the general ledgers. Modern computer software now allows for the instant update of each ledger account – for example, when recording a cash receipt in a cash receipts journal a debit is posted to a cash ledger account with a corresponding credit in the ledger account for which the cash was received. Not every single transaction need be entered into a T-account. Usually only the sum of the book transactions (a batch total) for the day is entered in the <b>general</b> <b>ledger.</b>|$|E

40|$|Using a {{case study}} approach, this {{investigation}} focused {{on the nature of}} the relationship between computer related expenditures and student achievement in mathematics, with consideration given to the mediating factors influencing the relationship. Some of these factors included the types of computers and software being used, the objectives of computer instruction, teacher preparation in the use of the computer as an instructional tool, the amount of time individual students had access to a computer during the school year, and the socioeconomic status of pupils. Two of the twenty-five largest school districts in Texas were selected as the subjects for this study. Numerical data were collected from existing documents including <b>general</b> <b>ledgers,</b> bid tabulations, test score tables, and records showing the numbers of students participating in the free and reduced price lunch programs. Specific information regarding the implementations of the instructional programs was gathered through observations and 2 interviews with principals/ teachers, and students in four— teen junior high schools in each of the two school district. The districts exhibited more differences than similarities in the approaches to using computers for instruction in mathematics. One district, for about two hundred dollars per student, purchased a prepared, copyrighted, and patented program consisting of mini-computers and sixteen terminal remote labs used exclusively for the remediation of students two or more years behind in achievement in mathematics. The other district purchased microcomputers at a cost of about ten dollars per student and introduced a three to six weeks unit on computer programming into the eighth grade mathematics curriculum. Although neither district demonstrated clear patterns of increased achievement, tendencies did emerge which would suggest some linkage between concentration of the program and achievement. Other factors emerging from the fortythree taped interviews indicated that achievement test scores of students should not be the only measure of the worth of the computer-assisted instructional programs used in these school districts...|$|R

Burgoyne expected Sir Henry Clinton, under the orders of General Howe, to aid him in the invasion by sailing up the Hudson River from the south. However, Howe's attack on Philadelphia diverted troops needed up in Saratoga. In addition, Washington prevented reinforcements from Howe's army from reaching Burgoyne. Meanwhile, Clinton's army was busy battling in the Hudson Highlands, as well as raiding villages in the Hudson Valley. As a result, Henry Clinton's fleet never reached Saratoga in time.|$|R
