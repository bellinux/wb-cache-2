40|$|The {{original}} intent {{of this research}} was to verify that a new method - called the Little Joe method in this report - could be used to verify that CMY offset inks conform to ISO 2846. This method would use less time to generate multiple ink film thicknesses (IFTs) than the traditionally used ISO 2834 method. With a graduated gage, a Little Joe proofer can be used to produce multiple IFTs on a single sample. However, the absolute thickness values for those IFTs are unknown. Therefore, to calibrate these unknown IFTs, a calibration curve that relates IFT and optical density should be used. Such a curve would have to be built based on samples produced by the method described in ISO 2834 using an IGT printability tester. The question is: will both methods (the traditional ISO 2834 method and the Little Joe method), either accept or reject a given sample? This research found that the same IFTs on both samples {{do not have the same}} colorimetric values. The ink film was not as smooth on the Little Joe prints as it was on the IGT prints. The presence of tiny white spots throughout the Little Joe sample add a gray component to the color. The difference in smoothness of the ink layer on the Little Joe proofer comes from the ink not being 2 ̆ 2 worked 2 ̆ 2 as much as it is on the distribution rollers of the IGT printer. Therefore, the ink is less liquid and not able to completely spread out and cover the paper. The answer to the research question is that the two methods do not both either accept or reject a given sample. Towards the conclusion of this research, Professor Franz Sigg and the researcher made some improvement to the traditional ISO 2834 method and eventually invented a more efficient method: the modified ISO 2834 method. A high input volume of ink (0. 1 cc) was applied to the IGT <b>inking</b> <b>unit.</b> Then, while the <b>inking</b> <b>unit</b> was kept running without adding new ink, the disc was weighed before and after each print and was then re-inked to made another print. As samples were printed, the ink on the <b>inking</b> <b>unit</b> was reduced, producing prints with progressively thinner ink film thicknesses in rapid progression since no cleaning was needed between prints. This allowed the prints to be produced in a much shorter time than with the original ISO 2834 method. The result of the modified ISO 2834 method agreed with that of the original method within a tolerance of 1 DeltaE. Therefore, both methods can accept or reject a given sample at the same time...|$|E

40|$|The {{thesis is}} devoted to complex {{research}} of mutual impact of contact pairs in the anilox roller printing systems and methods of their stabilization to regulate characteristics of prints. The main characteristics, parameters and modes that affect the qualitative and quantitative indicators of anilox roller ink transfer are analyzed. The mathematical description of physical processes required to build a simulation model of ink transfer between rotating cylinders of short inking system, {{that takes into account}} the system components characteristics and basic physical processes is proposed. The simulation method of anilox roller ink transfer process that considers various cells geometry, wettability of the printing plate, printing modes and rheological properties of ink is developed. The impact of anilox roller characteristics, printing plate wettability, ink rheology and printing modes on the ink transfer process is established. The developed simulation method is used to predict dosage of fountain solution in offset printing. Using regression analysis the impact of technological environment components on the ink transfer ratio is determined. The recommendations of technical characteristics stabilization of printing technological environment process with short <b>inking</b> <b>unit</b> and its main components are developed. These recommendations ensure normalization of print parameters reproduction by carrying out the preliminary simulation to refine the technological environment parameters. ??????????? ????????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??? ? ???????? ????????? ? ???????????? ?????? ? ??????? ?? ???????????? ??? ???????????? ?????????? ????????????? ????????. ?? ????????? ?????????? ??????? ???????????? ?????????, ??????? ? ?????????? ????????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ???, ???????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????? ? ??????????? ?? ?????????????. ???????????????? ??????? ??????? ? ????????????? ? ??????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ???????? ??????. ?? ????????? ????????? ?????-?????? ??? ?????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????, ??????????? ??? ?????????? ???????????? ?????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ????? ???????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ? ?????? ??????????? ??????????? ???? ??????? ? ???????? ?????????? ?????????. ??????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????-???????????????? ???????????? ? ???????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????????????? ???????????? ?????? ? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ??????. ????? ????????????? ????????????? ?????????? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ?????????????? ??????????? ????? ?? ??????? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ????, ???? ??????? ?????, ???????????? ????? ?? ???????? ? ??????? ??? ?????????????? ? ?????????? ????? ??????. ???????????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ? ?????????? ????, ? ?????????? ???? ???????????, ??? ? ????????????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ??? ????????? ??????, ?????? ? ?????????? ???????? ????????? ?????? ?????? ????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????, ??? ?????????????. ??????????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????, ???????? ?????? ? ???????????????? ?????? ????? ????????????? ? ???? ????????, ?? ?????????????. ???????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ? ???????? ??????. ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ? ???????? ????? ?? ?????????????? ????????, ?????????? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?? ????????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????. ????????????? ???????? ????????????? ????????????? ???????????? ??? ??????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ? ???????? ?????? ? ???????? ? ???????????????? ??????? ?? ???????????, ??? ????????? ????????? ????? ?? ???????? ???????? ??????, ? ?????????????? ? ????????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ???????? ?????????????????? ????????? ????????. ? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ??????? ???????? ? ???? ???????????? ??? ? ???????? ?????? ? ???????????????? ???????? ???????????, ??? ??????????? ?????????????? ??????? ?? ???????? ? ???? ????????? ????????, ? ????? ??????? ??????????? ???????????? ????, ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????. ??????????? ? ???????????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ?????? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????????? ?? ????????? ???????????? ????, ???????? ??????, ??????????? ????? ???????? ?????? ? ?? ??????? ? ???????? ???????? ??????. ?????????? ?????? ??? ?????????????? ? ?????????? ????? ?????? ????????? ?????????????? ? ???????????? ???????????? ?????????? ?????- ??? ????? ??????????? ???????????? ???????? ???????????? ??????????????. ??????????? ??????????????? ???????????? ?? ???????????? ???????- ??????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ????????? ????????? ? ?? ??????? ????????????, ??????? ????????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???? ?????????? ???????????????? ????????????? ??? ????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????...|$|E

40|$|The {{partially}} acetylated acidic mucilage {{isolated from}} the cactus Opuntia ficus-indica consists of a highly branched molecule containing D-galactose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-galacturonic acid and L-rhamnose in the ratio 2. 9 : 6. 6 : 3. 8 : 1. 3 : 1. 0. A partial hydrolysis study led to the isolation of fourteen oligosaccharides and a degraded polysaccharide. Periodate oxidation of the degraded polysaccharide and methylation analysis of the degraded and reduced degraded polysaccharides led to the proposal of a structure for the degraded polysaccharide consisting of a chain of alternating α-l, 4 -D-galactopyranosyluronic acid and β- 1, 2 -Lrhamnopyranosyl units with branches consisting of short chains of β- 1, 6 -D-galactopyranosyl units Iinked to C- 3 of the rhamnose residues. An insight {{into the nature of}} the peripheral side-chains was obtained by methylation studies of the oligosaccharides and the native polysaccharide. The majority of the side-chains are terminated by D-xylopyranosyl and L-arabinofuranosyl units while there is a small proportion of D-galactopyranosyl end-groups. The remaining units of the peripheral chains consists of mainly 1, 3 - and 1, 5 - 1 <b>inked</b> L-arabinofuranosyl <b>units.</b> The acidic polysaccharide {{isolated from the}} jointed cactus Opuntia aurantiaca contains D-galactose, L-arabinose, D-xylose, D-galacturonic acid and L-rhamnose in the ratio 5. 9 : 5. 5 : 3. 4 : 1. 2 : 1. 0.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{comprises}} two complementary studiesdealing {{with the}} sheet-fed offset printing of paper. The firststudy addresses the {{further development of}} a practical methodto acoustically monitor and analyse the film splitting ofoffset inks. This method was tested on laboratory printingequipment, specifically monitoring the continuous ink splittingin the nip of an IGT <b>ink</b> distribution <b>unit</b> and the short-timeink splitting in the inked print disc-paper nip of the printingunit of an ISIT instrument. The study verified that the inksplitting component of the acoustic signal contributes to thehigher frequency range (10 - 20 kHz) of the audible spectrum, andcan thus {{be separated from the}} lower frequency machine noise. Furthermore, the film splitting component is sensitive tochanges in the ink and printing conditions, thus enabling itsuse in probing the fundamental mechanisms occurring during inktransfer and also suggesting its applicability fornon-intrusive monitoring of industrial printing presses. Anincrease in film thickness during ink distribution correspondsto an increased acoustic power, with the exception of very lowink amounts, which give reduced acoustic emission due to alubricating effect. The effect of the presence of fountainsolution was simulated by adding emulsion-forming, butnon-evaporative, ethylene glycol. This produces an increase inacoustic power at low amounts, due to resistance to glycol dropdeformation, followed by a decrease at higher amounts owing toexcess glycol lining the rolls. During test printing on paper,increasing ink amounts also display an increased acousticresponse. The second study further developed a theoretical model toexplain and predict the evolution of ink tack in terms of inksetting directly after offset printing on coated paper. Asmeasured by the ISIT, the tack of the printed ink rises duringshorter time periods, attains a maximum, and then falls atlonger times. The proposed model described how the ink tack,characterised by the impulse during disc pull-off, dependsdynamically on the viscoelastic properties of the ink, thecontact with paper and disc, and the flow geometry. The inksetting was modelled as a diffusion-limited transport of theoil vehicle through the ink film and into the pores of thecoated paper. The coupling of the tack and setting models,compared to the ISIT experimental measurements, then provided adiffusion coeffcient for ink setting during the tack riseperiod. This coeffcient decreases with time, and increasinglyrapidly with decreasing ink amounts due to theconcentration-dependent diffusion. For an accurate descriptionthe elasticity and adhesion effects also have to be considered,at least for explaining the tack fall period...|$|R
40|$|A color {{separation}} technique known as Gray Component Replacement, or GCR {{has been an}} option available to high-end drum scanner operators {{for the past eight}} years. Recently, GCR has been made available by lower-end color system vendors as well. GCR consists of removing the least predominant process color <b>ink</b> in a <b>unit</b> area, reducing the remaining colored inks by the same amount and replacing the 2 ̆ 2 gray component 2 ̆ 2 of the color with black ink. One of the reported benefits of the GCR technique is that more consistency can be realized during a pressrun. If this is in fact true, the first publication printers who would surely utilize the technique would be newspapers. The problem of consistency is particularly acute for newspapers. There are a number of reasons for this, but the primary ones relate to the types of materials used. Newspapers use the cheapest paper and ink and in many cases, they print with old or poorly maintained presses. They would surely welcome any process that offered better reproductive quality and more consistency, provided the investment was justifiable. Since their present {{color separation}} systems allow for the use of GCR in the majority of cases, its potential in the area of newspaper printing was investigated in this study. One factor determining consistency during a pressrun is the control of ink film thickness. As ink film thickness fluctuates, color variation takes place. This study compared the amount of color variation realized for a conventional separation and GCR separations as ink film thickness was varied on press. A separation was made conventionally and with five levels of GCR (however only 40...|$|R
