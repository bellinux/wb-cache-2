5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} containing hydrogen ions (H+) {{are classified}} as acids, and those containing electropositive cations and basic anions ions hydroxide (OH−) or oxide (O2−) {{are classified as}} bases. Other ionic compounds are known as salts and can be formed by acid–base reactions. If the compound <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction between a strong acid and a weak base, {{the result is an}} acidic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction between a strong base and a weak acid, the result is a basic salt. If it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reaction between a strong acid and a strong base, the result is a neutral salt. Weak acids reacted with weak bases can produce ionic compounds with both the conjugate base ion and conjugate acid ion, such as ammonium acetate.|$|E

5|$|AMiBA was {{originally}} configured as a 7-element interferometer atop a hexapod mount. Observations at a wavelength of 3mm (86–102GHz) started in October 2006, and the detections of six clusters by the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect were announced in 2008. In 2009 the telescope was upgraded to 13 elements, {{and it is}} capable of further expansion to 19 elements. AMiBA <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> collaboration between the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the National Taiwan University and the Australia Telescope National Facility, and also involves researchers from other universities.|$|E
5|$|Brane {{cosmology}} models, {{in which}} inflation {{is due to}} the movement of branes in string theory; the pre-Big Bang model; the ekpyrotic model, in which the Big Bang <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> collision between branes; and the cyclic model, a variant of the ekpyrotic model in which collisions occur periodically. In the latter model the Big Bang was preceded by a Big Crunch and the universe cycles from one process to the other.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This is the natural cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name refers {{to the fact that}} it is a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E

5|$|The vocal {{production}} system {{is controlled by}} the cranial nerve nucleus in the brain, and supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the superior laryngeal nerve, branches of the vagus nerve. The vocal tract is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve and facial nerves. Electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PEG) region of the mammalian midbrain elicit vocalizations. The ability to learn new vocalizations is only exemplified in humans, seals, cetaceans, and possibly bats; in humans, this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> direct connection between the motor cortex, which controls movement, and the motor neurons in the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Adaptation occurs {{through the}} gradual {{modification}} of existing structures. Consequently, structures with similar internal organisation {{may have different}} functions in related organisms. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single ancestral structure being adapted to function in different ways. The bones within bat wings, for example, {{are very similar to}} those in mice feet and primate hands, due to the descent of all these structures from a common mammalian ancestor. However, since all living organisms are related to some extent, even organs that appear to have little or no structural similarity, such as arthropod, squid and vertebrate eyes, or the limbs and wings of arthropods and vertebrates, can depend on a common set of homologous genes that control their assembly and function; this is called deep homology.|$|E

5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> higher growth rate {{around the outside}} edges than on the inside edges. The variations in {{the thickness of the}} oxide layer that forms {{on the surface of the}} crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Modern English grammar <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gradual {{change from}} a typical Indo-European {{dependent}} marking pattern with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order, to a mostly analytic pattern with little inflection, a fairly fixed SVO word order and a complex syntax. Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs and word order {{for the expression of}} complex tenses, aspect and mood, as well as passive constructions, interrogatives and some negation. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and dialects of English used in different countries and regions – in terms of phonetics and phonology, and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling – English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.|$|E
