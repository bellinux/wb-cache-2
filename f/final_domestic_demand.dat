For instance, at eight quarters ahead, the gain in terms of forecast accuracy is as much as 22 per cent.

The main {{purpose of this article is}} to analyze the economic growth during the period 2000 - 2010, with focus on the dot-com bubble in the beginning of the period 2000 - 2005, and the financial crisis at the end of the period 2005 - 2010.

In the period 2005 - 2010, financial crisis weakened the effect of export. The output of the primary sector went from a negative change into a positive, explained mainly by strong export expansion. In the secondary sector, export had most effect in the period 2000 - 2005. Nevertheless, domestic demand and import ratio had more effect during the financial crisis period.

This report provides an assessment of the overall plausibility of the macroeconomic forecast prepared by the Ministry for Finance (MFIN) for the years 2015 - 2016 within the Draft Budgetary Plan (DBP) 2016, together with an assessment of the main assumptions which underpin the forecast estimates. This assessment recognizes that {{on the basis of the}} latest available information for 2015, the projected increase in the headline real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figure of 4. 2 % for the current year may indeed be feasible. Like other institutions, primarily the Central Bank of Malta (CBM) and the European Commission (COM), the MFIN is expecting growth for 2015 to be higher than the rate registered for 2014 and to be mainly driven by the <b>final</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> component of the economy. Of significant importance to the current short term forecasts for 2015 is the projected growth rate for gross fixed capital formation which is expected by the MFIN to remain a major driver of growth, supported by a number of public and private investment projects. However, the historical volatility of this component and the significant revisions noted in the investment expectations from one forecasting round to another introduce a certain element of risk which could impinge onto the attainment of the GDP growth rates in the DBP for 2016. Moreover, given the small size and openness of the local economy, developments within a single component of GDP will have a considerable impact on other areas of the local economy. In particular, the projected trajectory of the external sector for 2015 is expected to very much depend on the realization of the gross fixed capital formation component for the year. N/...|$|E

40|$|Japan was {{hit hard}} by the global {{financial}} crisis even though its relatively resilient financial system initially limited the direct impact. The severe collapse of industrial production that followed was no doubt attributable to a confluence of factors, but the paper highlights the impact {{that came from the}} contractionary effect of global deleveraging on the real economy. In this environment, Japan was particularly vulnerable because of the structural changes that had taken place over the past decade in its trade and industrial structures. Vector autoregression analysis confirms that, {{as a result of these}} structural changes, Japanese output became much more responsive to output shocks in the advanced markets of the United States and Western Europe. The structural changes had two components. First, over 90 % of Japan's exports consisted of highly income-elastic industrial supplies, capital goods, and consumer durables. Though emerging Asia is Japan's largest export market, its imports from Japan largely consist of intermediate goods used in the production of final goods destined for the US and Western Europe. Second, Japan's trade dependence had increased since the early 2000 s, as evidenced by a rising export to gross domestic product ratio and a declining share for the non-tradable sector. Though increasing trade openness is a natural part of economic globalization and regional integration, the manner in which this process had played out made Japan particularly vulnerable to a negative demand shock coming from outside. To make Japan more resilient to external shocks, policymakers could promote the export of finished goods to emerging Asia by establishing a region-wide free trade arrangement. To promote domestic demand, the social protection system needs to be strengthened so as to reduce households' uncertainty for the future; a more liberal immigration policy should help invigorate private investment in an aging society. To facilitate a better allocation of resources, further deregulatory measures in the more regulated non-tradable goods sector are called for; a substantial lifting of restrictions in agriculture, especially regarding the corporatization of production, would be especially helpful. With little available fiscal space, these measures will help create a climate in which private investment can flourish, driven by <b>final</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand.</b> japan; trade; global financial crisis; gfc japan...|$|E

It puts Dutch BS industry in an international comparative perspective, identifying its particular strengths and weaknesses. Lees ook het bijbehorende persbericht. The study sketches policy options for fostering the growth and welfare contribution of the Dutch business services industry. Chapter 2 chapter untangles factors behind the extraordinary growth of the BS industry during last decade, comparing it with other market industries. It analyses how the growth pattern is affected by product differentiation and the structure of competition. Particular attention is given to the role of foreign competition. Chapter 3 deals with the impact of BS industry on the growth capacity of other industries. It shows how intermediary BS inputs can put other industries on a higher growth path that is associated with a higher specialisation level in labour and human capital (increased roundaboutedness). Knowledge-intensive BS branches not only generate their own innovations (e. g. software industry) but also contribute to the dissemination of best-practice knowledge and innovations throughout the economy. Remarkably, the BS industry has itself a very poor record of productivity growth. Over time, with a growing BS industry, this may become a drag on macro-economic growth if current trends will continue. Chapter 4 pinpoints the main aspects in which the Dutch BS industry differed from its foreign counterparts, showing its comparative strengths and weaknesses. The strengths appear to be associated with its very fast growth and its relative openness to foreign competition. The main weaknesses relate to meagre innovation efforts and a stagnating labour productivity growth. Chapter 5 provides a scenario analysis of the future growth of Dutch BS industry, covering the period till 2010. Apart from general GDP growth, six driving forces determine the growth outcomes for BS industry: technological change; outsourcing tendencies; <b>final</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> structure; internationalisation tendencies; institutional developments; and structural changes in factor markets. Two coherent scenarios, an optimistic and a pessimistic one, sketch the possible courses of events. The chapter concludes with a quantitative projection of BS growth until 2010. Chapter 6 identifies future-oriented policy issues, after identifying the dominant market failure problems with regard to the BS industry. The main policy options relate to: strengthening the BS industry's own productivity development; achieving more market transparency; getting more exposure of markets to foreign competition; and strengthening the innovation contribution of the BS industry. ...|$|E
40|$|Highlights Despite some {{lingering}} uncertainties on {{the global}} scene, developments since the May 1999 Monetary Policy Report {{have resulted in a}} firmer tone in the outlook for the world economy and for Canada. The Canadian economy now appears poised to attain growth in 1999 towards {{the upper end of the}} 2 3 / 4 to 3 3 / 4 per cent range set out in the May Report. Trend inflation is still expected to edge up but to remain in the lower half of the Bank's inflation-control target range of 1 to 3 per cent. Information received since early July, when the update to the Monetary Policy Report was completed, continues to point to a generally firmer tone in the outlook for the world economy and for Canada. Nonetheless, lingering uncertainties {{on the global}} scene bear watching. In Japan, there are signs that the protracted economic recession may be coming to an end. In Europe, expectations of a pickup in the pace of expansion as the year progresses are becoming more widely held. Economic and financial conditions remain generally positive in those emerging-market economies in Southeast Asia and Latin America that are vigorously pursuing sound domestic policies. In the United States, real GDP rose by an estimated 2. 3 per cent in the second quarter-below most expectations. A significant part of the slowdown, however, was attributable to a major inventory adjustment. Growth of real <b>final</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> also decelerated, but remained strong at just under 4 per cent, following growth of over 6 per cent in the twoprevious quarters. Overall, the U. S. economy continues to operate at high levels, thereby heightening concerns about potential inflationary pressures. While inflation at both the retail and producer-price levels appears to be contained, with tight labour markets (employment was up strongly in July) signs of cost pressures have emerged recently, reflecting rising rates of labour compensation and slowing productivity growth. Here in Canada, indicators of domestic demand such as retail and wholesale trade, motor vehicle sales, housing activity, imports, and business investment plans all support a picture of solid expansion through the spring and summer months. Exports, after several quarters of very strong growth, remain at high levels, and economy-wide production data (e. g., monthly GDP at factor cost) through May also indicate a steady, solid pace of expansion. Moreover, world commodity prices have risen somewhat further recently, providing support to Canadaís resource sector. The prices of some key primary commodities produced in Canada (especially energy and base metals) have been among the fastest rising. And as anticipated, there was renewed employment growth in July, notably in full-time, paid jobs. On balance, recent data suggest that real GDP increased by about 3 1 / 2 per cent (annual rate) in the second quarter-broadly in line with expectations at the time of the July update. The 12 -month rate of increase in the core CPI edged up to 1. 7 per cent in June. As in the previous twomonths, the June increase was slightly higher than expected. This is partly because of the more rapid pass-through of the earlier exchange rate depreciation into retail prices. However, with slack still present in the economy, core inflation is expected to remain close to current levels, below the midpoint of the Bank's 1 to 3 per cent target range, through the balance of 1999. Uncertainty about inflationary pressures in the United States and the possible implications for the stance of U. S. monetary policy, as well as shifts in international investment portfolios (encouraged by improving economic conditions overseas), have resulted in significant movements in financial markets in recent weeks. In July, the U. S. dollar weakened markedly against both the yen and the euro. While the Canadian dollar was softer against its U. S. counterpart for much of the last month, it has strengthened recently, supported by Canadaís low inflation and solid economic expansion and by firmer world commodity prices. Interest rates in Canada remain below those in the United States across all maturities, although the differentials have narrowed since early July. ...|$|E

The sources {{of the changes in}} CO 2 emissions for the years 1990 - 2003 are investigated, in terms of a total of eight factors, through input-output structural decomposition analysis: changes in emission coefficient (caused by shifts in energy intensity and carbon intensity); changes in economic growth; and structural changes (in terms of shifts in <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand,</b> exports, imports of final and intermediate goods, and production technology).

40|$|Confiscated Growth Département des {{diagnostics}} de l'OFCE In 1986 {{both the}} price of oil and the exchange rate of the dollar have come back to levels more in line with market equilibrium. But these have not had the expected stimulating effects. The improvements in the terms of trade — particularly large in Europe and Japan [...] have slowed down the growth of general government and corporate net debt {{at a time when many}} developing countries have been forced to adopt severe financial measures. The flow of capital to the OECD countries has been balanced by a sharp reduction of the demand from the rest of the world, while important losses of market shares were conceded to the newly-industrialising countries. The recovery of private consumption has been significant, but not enough to stimulate investment. An important portion of corporate resources has continued to flow to the financial markets, contributing to keeping real interest rates high. In 1987 and early 1988 the slackening of demand in the United States and then its contraction, will dominate the international environment. In such a context the persistence of the American external deficit will aggravate monetary, trade and financial tensions. Faced with increased external competition and weak world demand, Japan and above all Europe will suffer seriously from any additional drop of the dollar. In France the likelihood of significant growth appears limited. Household consumption growth will slow down because of low wage increases, not fully compensated by a strong growth in non-wage income. The recovery of private investment will accelerate but its pace will remain slower than the improvement in profits. The growth of <b>final</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>demand</b> will tend to benefit foreign more than French suppliers, who are facing hightened competition in domestic and world markets from the South-East Asian countries. The trade balance could turn negative. A 1. 7 per cent GDP growth in 1987 will not be enough to stop unemployment from rising. A more expansionist economic policy could curb this upward trend, but there is a continuing risk of any surge in demand being captured largely by foreign competitors. expected slowdown of household consumption, the near-stagnation of investment, and the weakness of exports. Destocking following involuntary stockbuilding in the second quarter of 1986 is expected to depress activity in the first part of this year, notwithstanding some strengthening of final demand. A modest pick-up is therefore not likely until the second quarter, led by investment and exports. Household consumption is likely to recover only moderately, given the weak growth of real incomes. The slowdown in the growth of world demand, projected for around the end of this year, will again limit growth in 1988. Overall, GNP seems likely to grow by 1. 7 per cent in 1987 and 1. 3 per cent in 1988. As a result only part of the considerable increase in profits in 1985 - 86 seems likely to be used for productive investment. The risk of an upturn in inflation in France in the coming quarters seems small. The policy of strict control of public sector salaries, combined with rising unemployment, seems likely to lead to moderation in the overall growth of incomes : hourly wage rates are likely to increase by a modest 2. 8 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Output prices seem likely to stop growing faster than unit costs, except in the tertiary sector, which has not yet restored its margins to the levels of the 1970 s. On the assumption that {{the price of}} oil will stabilize around $ 16 per barrel at the end of the second quarter, the growth of the consumer price index will be around 2. 7 per cent in 1987 and 2. 4 per cent in 1988. Under the assumption of a progressive increase in the oil price to $ 20 by the end of 1988, inflation could be around 3 per cent both this year and next. In either case disinflation, as measured by the GNP deflator, will continue, with inflation falling from 5 per cent in 1986 to 3 per cent in 1987 and 2. 5 per cent in 1988. Despite the modest growth of domestic demand and inflation, the external surplus of goods and services recorded in 1986 (around FF 21 billion) seems likely to be smaller this year because of a reduction in the manufactures balance of FF 15 billion. The decline in international competitiveness, due to the fall of the dollar since 1985, could be expected to result in some loss of market share. Nevertheless this is likely to be limited to 1. 5 points in 1987 and 1 point in 1988, compared with 3 points over the course of the last two years. The slow growth of employment in the market sector seen in 1986 risks being interrupted because of modest growth of production and the perverse effect of the youth employment scheme "Emploi des Jeunes". It seems that a number of people were taken into employment in 1986 in anticipation of an exemption from social charges. Despite the recent new measures in respect of long-term unemployed, unemployment will continue to grow significantly. The number of unemployed could reach 2. 8 million in the spring of 1988. The pick-up of investment in industry in 1984 - 1985 seems likely to continue in the next two years (6. 5 per cent in 1987 and 5. 4 per cent in 1988 in 1970 prices for the total of non-financial enterprises). Is this likely to be sufficient ? It would seem to be so if compared with the likely growth of internal and external demand, but not if considered in relation to the now considerable capacity to finance productive investment out of retained earnings. The study reported in the last part of this article suggests that the reduction of corporation tax would probably not be effective in sparking off a significant increase in investment. For given budgetary cost a direct subsidy to productive investment in the form of a tax credit would be ten times as effective. But the benefits would be realised only over the medium term.

40|$|In {{light of}} the {{importance}} of the relationship between trade and employment in Japan, this paper examines the effects of exports on employment (i. e. the number of workers), working-hours, and total worker-hours (i. e. employment times working-hours). This paper utilized the Japanese input-output table for the period from 1975 to 2006, which enables us to estimate the effects of exports on the industry's employment (i. e. direct effect) but also on other industries' employment (i. e. indirect effect). The major findings are threefold. First, the demand for worker-hours from exports increased but this is not large enough to offset the decreases in demand for worker hours from <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand.</b> As a result, total worker-hours in Japan have declined since 1990. Second, the demand for employment from exports has increased since 1985 both in manufacturing and non-manufacturing. This result implies that the manufacturing exports affected indirectly non-manufacturing employment through inter-industry linkages. Finally, the overall demand for working-hours from exports and <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> declined between 1980 and 2006 although it increased slightly in manufacturing after 1995. There are two possible policy influences behind these adjustment processes. One is the change in Japanese labour standard law. The other is the change in the Japanese worker dispatch law. Although these two policies have different implications, policy makers need to recognize the importance of the flexibility of the adjustment in either case. trade, employment, inclusive growth, wages...|$|R
40|$|Food {{consumption}} by U. S. households provides the primary demand for {{output of the}} U. S. food and kindred product industry. The share of sector production needed to meet <b>domestic</b> household food <b>demand</b> ranges from 65 percent in fats and oil mills to nearly 200 percent in the supply-enhanced-by-imports beverages and flavorings sector. The common dominance of <b>domestic</b> household food <b>demand</b> {{as a source of}} demand for food and kindred product output masks a diversity of economic forces that affect individual food and kindred product sectors and firms differently and influence the economic environment in which food processors produce food for domestic households. These common and diverse economic forces affect the growth of and structural change in the U. S. food and kindred product industry. To assess this changing environment, this paper examines the changing U. S. food and kindred product industry from 1972 - 1992, using an input-output-based economic model. The model uses data from the 1972 and 1992 national I/O tables. We explore the demand sources of food and kindred product output change during this period. We analyze five broad demand sources- (1) direct <b>domestic</b> household <b>demand,</b> (2) other <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demands</b> (indirect <b>domestic</b> household and government demand), (3) export demand, (4) changes in processed food products used as inputs for other sectors, and (5) import penetration, the import share o...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the {{reaction}} of U.

The demand and supply shocks driving the global crude oil market jointly account for 22 % of the long-run variation in U. S. real stock returns. The responses of industry-specific U. S. stock returns to demand and supply shocks in the crude oil market are consistent with accounts of the transmission of oil price shocks that emphasize the reduction in <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand.</b> Copyright � (2009) by the Economics Department of the University of Pennsylvania and the Osaka University Institute of Social and Economic Research Association. ...|$|R
40|$|The Water Framework Directive defines common {{objectives}} for water resources throughout the European Union (EU). Given this general approach to water preservation and water policy, {{the objective of}} this paper is to analyse whether common patterns of water consumption exist within Europe. In particular, our study uses two methods to reveal the reasons behind sectoral water use in all EU countries. The first method is based on an accounting indicator that calculates the water intensity of an economy as the sum of sectoral water intensities. The second method is a subsystem input-output model that divides total water use into different income channels within the production system. The application uses data from the year 2005 on water consumption in the production system of the 27 countries of the EU. From our analysis it emerges that EU countries are characterized by very different patterns of water consumption. Mediterranean and central/eastern European countries use water mainly for agriculture whereas northern European countries use it mainly for electricity, gas and water supply. In most countries, the water used by the fuel, power and water sector is consumed to satisfy <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand.</b> However, our analysis shows that for some countries exports from this sector are an important driver of water consumption. Focusing on the agricultural sector, the decomposition analysis suggests that water usage in Mediterranean countries is mainly driven by final demand for, and exports of, agricultural products, whereas <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> is the main driver of water consumption in central/eastern European countries. Given these heterogeneous water consumption patterns, our analysis suggests that Mediterranean and central/eastern European countries should adopt specific water policies if water consumption in the European Union is to be efficient. ...|$|R
40|$|Taiwan {{currently}} emits approximately 1 % of the world's CO 2 [...] ranking it 22 nd among nations. Herein, {{we use the}} input-output (I-O) structural decomposition {{method to}} examine the changes in CO 2 emission over a 15 -year period. By decomposing the CO 2 emission changes into nine factors for the periods of 1989 - 1994, 1994 - 1999, and 1999 - 2004, we have identified the key factors causing the emission changes, {{as well as the}} most important trends regarding the industrial development process in Taiwan. The 5 -year increment with the largest increase of CO 2 emission was that of 1999 - 2004, due to the rapid increase of electricity consumption. From the decomposition, the industrial energy coefficient and the CO 2 emission factors were identified as the most important parameters for the determination of the highway, petrochemical materials, iron and steel, the commercial sector, and electric machinery as the major sources of increased CO 2 emission during the past 15 years. From 1989 to 2004, the level of exports and the level of <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> were the largest contributors to the increase in the total increment of CO 2 change. During 1989 - 2004, the industrial energy coefficient and CO 2 emission factors, being minimally significant during 1989 - 1994, became extremely important, joining the <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> and the level of exports factors as the major causes of the increase increment of CO 2. This indicates a heavy reliance upon high-energy (and CO 2) intensity for Taiwanese industries; therefore, continuous efforts to improve energy intensity and fuel mix toward lower carbon are important for CO 2 reduction, especially for the electricity and power generation sectors. Relevant strategies for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from major industries are also highlighted. ...|$|R
40|$|The North Cyprus {{economy has}} been under {{economic}} embargoes for many years, and has been struggling to eradicate the income difference with {{the south of the}} island with extremely limited facilities. Successive governments have accordingly developed distinctive responses to cope with these difficulties. The paper examines these features of the North Cyprus economy with a particular emphasis on its response to economic embargoes. The paper also examines how important economic embargoes would be (or have been) in the North Cypriot economy. For this purpose total economic growth is decomposed with respect to different components of demand. The results show that despite the presence of embargoes, external demand and the availability of import flows are detrimental factors for economic growth. Also <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand</b> is an equally important source of growth in the North Cyprus economy. ...|$|R

40|$|Our {{objective}} is to assess personal income under perfect competition, when factors are rewarded according to their productivities, and to contrast the ensuing distribution with the status quo. Competition will yield winners and losers, {{both in terms of}} factor claims and in terms of regions or provinces. Income differences will press people to migrate. To analyze this, we divide China into 30 input-output sectors and 27 provinces; we maximize <b>domestic</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand,</b> while preserving its proportions in each province, subject to material balances and factor constraints. The shadow prices to the constraints represent competitive commodity prices and factor rewards. Unskilled labor would stand to lose and, therefore, inequality would mount. The pressure on interprovincial migration would be enormous with 10 to 20 % {{of the people on the}} road. The flipside is the great potential for improvement of the average standard of living. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} fresh {{empirical evidence}} on the relative con-tribution of final and intermediate demand {{to changes in the}} sectoral structure of advanced economies. These latter have led, over the last three decades, to the massive growth of service sectors, most especially the business services. The paper draws upon the recently released OECD Input–Output (I–O) tables. The empirical analysis is based on an I–O Structural Decomposition Analysis (SDA) carried out on 13 manufacturing and service sectors, from the end of 1960 s to the end of 1990 s. Although heterogeneous sectoral patterns emerge, we find that the largest contribution to the the structural changes leading to the growth of services stems from (<b>domestic)</b> <b>final</b> <b>demand,</b> whereas the role of foreign trade remains marginal even in the last decade. Changes in the sectoral intermediate linkages have instead been the main responsible for the growth of KIBS (Knowledge Intensive Busi-ness Services), along with a sustained contribution of final consump-tion. We suggest that the role of (<b>domestic)</b> <b>demand</b> constraints might affect the degree of exploitation of technological opportunities and the patterns of growth, even {{in the case of the}} most technologically ad-vanced service sectors, and we indicate future steps of research. ∗The authors are grateful to Claude Diebolt and Lionel Nesta for comments on an earlier draft of this paper.
