40|$|The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{conducted}} an assessment {{on the use}} of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant and follow-on formula and in foods for special medical purposes intended for infants and young children. In the opinion of the BfR, <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> are neither required to improve acceptance of such products nor to support development of taste sensation. […] Since infant formula is a standardised product, even the addition of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> does not provide the spectrum of flavours that breast milk offers infants. Based on the current state of knowledge, flavoured infant foods cannot, therefore, support the development of a baby’s sense of taste and smell in the way that breast milk can. Babies are especially vulnerable during {{the first few months of}} life: the body’s detoxification systems […]. Therefore, international expert committees emphasise that the ADI values derived for food additives are not to be applied to babies up to the age of 12 weeks. […] The BfR is of the opinion that the rationale behind the use of food additives in baby food should also apply to the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in baby foods. […] <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> should be used neither in the production of infant formula nor in balanced diets intended for babies aged less than three months. If, under exceptional circumstances, their use is however deemed necessary, the <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> intended to be used require, like any food additives, special case-by-case assessment. In addition, there are indications that sensory experience during infancy influence the development of the sense of taste and thus may have implications on subsequent dietary preferences. However, the currently available data are not sufficient to assess the consequences of the use of <b>flavouring</b> <b>substances</b> in infant formula for later dietary behaviour and related health risks...|$|R

The substance {{is intended to}} be used as a flavour modifier and the current evaluation is only applicable to this use. Information on the ratios of diastereoisomers of the substance has been provided (cis 20 - 40 % and trans 60 - 80 %). Information on the ratio of enantiomers is lacking. The available data on genotoxicity do not preclude the evaluation of the candidate substance [FL-no: 16. 119] through the Procedure. The substance was evaluated through the B-side of the Procedure. A 'No Observed Adverse Effect Level' (NOAEL) of 55 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day could be derived for [FL-no: 16. 119] from a 90 -day subchronic toxicity study in rats.

For a few years cinnamon-containing food supplements have also been on sale which are said to reduce the blood sugar level and the blood lipid concentrations of diabetics. Because of the harmful effect of larger amounts – coumarin can cause hepatic damage – coumarin may only be used as an ingredient of flavourings and other food additives with flavouring properties in the food sector. What's more, it has long been known that in animal experiments coumarin can trigger the formation of tumours. More recent scientific findings indicate that there is no genotoxic mechanism of action, something which had been suspected for a long time. The European Commission thereupon submitted a draft amendment to the Flavourings Directive which envisages removing the existing constraints on coumarin. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) took another look at coumarin from the angle of consumer health protection.

Consequent to the 2015 scientific opinion from the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) on the safety of caffeine from all dietary sources, the CEF Panel considered it inappropriate to evaluate the two substances through the Procedure. For caffeine, the Panel based its assessment on the safety threshold of 5. 7 mg/kg body weight (bw) per day for adults, except pregnant/lactating women, and 3 mg/kg bw per day for children, adolescents, pregnant and lactating women, as established by the NDA Panel. The safety evaluation of theobromine takes into account that approximately 11 % of an oral dose of caffeine is metabolised to theobromine and that both substances have a similar pharmacological profile. For the exposure assessment, a brand loyalty model was chosen.

In particular, the Panel {{is asked to}} advise the Commission on the implications for human health of furfural and furfural diethylacetal in the diet. The Panel noted that the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had expressed an opinion on furfural and furfural diethylacetal in December 2002 and took cognizance of the documentation used in arriving at that opinion. The Panel also considered additional data on the potential genotoxicity of furfural not {{available at the time}} of the SCF opinion. The new toxicological data on the genotoxic potential of furfural addressed the reservation of the SCF concerning the mechanism by which furfural induced tumours (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas) and whether this was a thresholded process. The Panel concluded that, the new study in a transgenic mouse strain demonstrated that furfural did not induce gene mutations in vivo. Based on this, together with earlier studies reviewed by the SCF, the Panel concluded that the tumour induction was secondary to chronic toxic liver injury and was probably thresholded. Since furfural diethylacetal is rapidly converted to furfural at physiological pH, the Panel established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for furfural and the furfural component of furfural diethylacetal of 0. 5 mg/kg bw based on a NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) for hepatotoxicity in a 90 -day study in rats of 54 mg/kg bw/day to which a safety factor of 100 was applied.

40|$|The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids was {{requested}} {{to evaluate the}} genotoxic potential of one <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> from subgroup 1. 1. 1 (b) of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 226 (FGE. 226). The flavour industry provided genotoxicity studies for the substance 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal [FL-no: 16. 071]. Based on these data, the Panel concluded in FGE. 226 that 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal did not induce gene mutations in bacterial cells but was positive in an in vitro micronucleus assay, so, 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal is considered an in vitro genotoxic agent. The negative results obtained in an in vivo micronucleus assay cannot overrule the positive results of the in vitro micronucleus assay with and without S 9 -mix {{due to the lack}} of demonstration of bone marrow exposure. Following this, the flavour industry has provided plasma analysis of a satellite group of rats treated with 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal in order to investigate the systemic exposure of animals in the in vivo micronucleus assay. However, the plasma analysis did not provide enough evidence of target tissue exposure. An in vivo Comet assay in rodents was recommended in FGE. 226, in order to investigate possible genotoxic effects at the first site of contact (e. g. stomach/duodenum cells) and in the liver. An in vivo Comet assay in liver and duodenum was provided that suggests that 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal [FL-no: 16. 071] did not induce DNA damage in the duodenum of rats. However, the genotoxic effect observed in vitro was confirmed in the in vivo Comet assay in the liver of rats. The Panel concluded that 4, 5 -epoxydec- 2 (trans) -enal [FL-no: 16. 071] does raise a safety concern with respect to genotoxicity and, therefore, it cannot be evaluated according to the Procedure...|$|E
40|$|The EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) was {{requested}} {{to evaluate the}} genotoxic potential of flavouring substances from subgroup 2. 2 of FGE. 19 in the Flavouring Group Evaluation 208 Revision 2 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). In FGE. 208 Rev 1, the CEF Panel evaluated genotoxicity studies on p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117], the representative substance for FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2. The Comet assay performed in liver showed a positive result, and therefore, the Panel concluded that p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is genotoxic in vivo and that, accordingly, there is a safety concern for its use as <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance.</b> Since p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] is representative for the nine remaining substances of subgroup 2. 2 (p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], 2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09. 272], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278], myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]), the Panel concluded in the previous revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 1) {{that there is a}} potential safety concern for these substances. Subsequently, the industry has submitted genotoxicity studies on five substances of FGE. 19 subgroup 2. 2 : p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FL-no: 09. 278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], which are evaluated in the present revision of FGE. 208 (FGE. 208 Rev 2). The Panel concluded that the concern for genotoxicity could be ruled out for p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -ol [FL-no: 02. 060], myrtenol [FL-no: 02. 091], p-mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -yl acetate [FLno: 09. 278] and myrtenyl acetate [FL-no: 09. 302], which will be evaluated through the Procedure. Genotoxicity data on myrtenal [FL-no: 05. 106] were considered equivocal, therefore, it cannot be evaluated through the Procedure, presently. p-Mentha- 1, 8 -dien- 7 -al [FL-no: 05. 117] and four substances not supported by industry (2, 6, 6 -trimethyl- 1 -cyclohexen- 1 -carboxaldehyde [FL-no: 05. 121], myrtenyl formate [FL-no: 09. 272], myrtenyl- 2 -methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 899] and myrtenyl- 3 methylbutyrate [FL-no: 09. 900]) have been deleted from the Union List...|$|E
40|$|Plans for {{labelling}} the calorie {{content and}} the ingredients of alcoholic beverages should be tabled by the European Commission at the latest in 2016, said Health Committee MEPs in a resolution, voted on Tuesday, calling for a new EU Alcohol Strategy. The text calls for a specific focus on alcohol consumption by minors, and EU-wide labelling warnings against drink driving, and drinking while pregnant. MEPs call on the European Commission to “immediately begin work on the new EU Alcohol Strategy (2016 - 2022) ” in order to assist national governments in dealing with alcohol related harm. The strategy’s aims should include collecting reliable data, improving prevention and treatment, reducing accidents caused by drink driving and differentiating more clearly within drinking patterns, they say. Ingredients and calories should be labelled MEPs suggest that the European Commission should evaluate whether alcoholic beverages should in future be covered by a requirement to provide consumers with information on the ingredients and nutritional content. The calorie content of alcoholic beverages should be clearly labelled as soon as possible, and the Commission should table a legislative proposal to this end in 2016 at the latest, say MEPs. They also call for EU-wide labelling alerting drinkers {{to the dangers of}} drink driving, and warning pregnant women not to consume alcohol. They also urge the Commission to ask the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) immediately to re-evaluate the use of acetaldehyde as a <b>flavouring</b> <b>substance</b> in alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Minors MEPs urge EU member states to step up efforts to protect young people from alcohol related harm by raising existing age limits to at least 18 years. They recommend that member states monitor the effects of alcohol advertising on young people and to take appropriate action to limit their exposure. Public money should never be used to promote the consumption of alcohol, they add. They also call on member states to enforce existing national age limit laws strictly, and to consider further legally binding requirements to protect minors. MEPs also invite national authorities to consider measures to prevent the sale of very cheap alcohol. The European Commission should also properly address the cross-border sale of alcohol on the internet, and member states should conduct campaigns to raise awareness on the dangers of binge drinking, especially for under-age people, and make further efforts to reduce traffic accidents related to drink driving, says the text. Cultural values and subsidiarity MEPs call on member states to inform citizens better “about the cultural values of responsible alcohol consumption, the positive impact on health of moderate alcohol consumption and its compatibility with a healthy and balanced lifestyle”. While providing guidance and support to the competent authorities in the member states where there is added value, the subsidiarity and proportionality principles should however be respected, they add. Next steps The resolution, drafted by Alberto Cirio (EPP, IT), Glenis Willmott (S&D, UK), Marcus Pretzell (ECR, DE), José Inácio Faria (ALDE, PT), Younous Omarjee (GUE/NGL, FR) and Piernicola Pedicini (EFDD, IT) was passed by 63 votes to 4, with 1 abstention. It will be put to a vote by the full House at the 27 - 30 April plenary session in Strasbourg. Background Misuse of alcohol is the second largest lifestyle-related cause of disease in some member states and alcohol addiction is a risk factor in over 60 chronic diseases, including alcoholic liver disease (ALD), alcoholic chronic pancreatitis and almost all other digestive diseases, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) and neuropsychiatric disorders such as alcohol dependence.
