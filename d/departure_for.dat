5|$|Conceived in {{the wake}} of a series of {{distressing}} personal events, 808s & Heartbreak marked a major musical <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> West from his previous rap records, instead featuring a sparse, electronic sound and West singing through an Auto-Tune vocal processor. His lyrics explored themes of loss, alienated fame, and heartache, while the album's production abandoned conventional hip hop sounds in favor of a minimalist sonic palette, which included prominent use of the titular Roland TR-808 drum machine.|$|E
5|$|On Simpson's {{return to}} Harworth for Christmas, the RAF were {{notified}} {{and the press}} ran stories on his apparent draft avoidance. He passed a medical in Sheffield, but history repeated itself and the papers arrived {{the day after his}} <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> his team's training camp in Narbonne in southern France. The French press, unlike the British, found the situation amusing.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{set sail}} from London on his ship Endurance, {{bound for the}} Weddell Sea in August 1914. Meanwhile, the Ross Sea party {{personnel}} gathered in Australia, prior to <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> the Ross Sea in the second expedition ship, SY Aurora. Organisational and financial problems delayed their start until December 1914, which shortened their first depot-laying season. After their arrival the inexperienced party struggled to master the art of Antarctic travel, in the process losing most of their sled dogs.|$|E

It also served as the first point of <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> hajj participants from Central Sumatra, who left Sumatra via Emma Haven after the port was opened in 1895. Before the end of the Padri War, in 1818 the Minang Ulamas held a meeting at Ganting to discuss the steps they would take to eliminate mysticism and superstition from Islam on the island.|$|E
5|$|Sunny {{reveals that}} he is Arun, Sameer's {{childhood}} friend who came to Goa to cure Sameer's anger-management issues. He went to visit Sameer after returning from America after 19 years and met Sameer's grandmother, who told him about Sameer's heartbreak and <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Goa. Arun decided to help Sameer by posing as his enemy, telling Rani and her parents earlier. Sameer is reunited with Arun, who conducts his and Rani's wedding.|$|E
5|$|The Spanish {{name for}} the archipelago, Islas Malvinas, derives from the French Îles Malouines— the name given to the islands by French {{explorer}} Louis-Antoine de Bougainville in 1764. Bougainville, who founded the islands' first settlement, named the area after the port of Saint-Malo (the point of <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> his ships and colonists). The port, located in the Brittany region of western France, was in turn named after St. Malo (or Maclou), the Christian evangelist who founded the city.|$|E

5|$|The second {{agreement}} was again {{regarded as a}} provisional compromise by both parties. The charter prescribed that a joint delegation of the rebels and the noblemen {{should be sent to}} the king, who was staying in Prague, to seek his arbitration. There is no evidence of the appointment of the delegates or their <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Prague. Sigismund of Luxemburg died on 9 December 1437.|$|E
5|$|Thomas succeeded Ealdred as Archbishop of York in 1070; he was {{nominated}} on 23May and was probably consecrated on 25December. The appointment of Thomas was a <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> the King, who had usually promoted Norman nobles or monks {{when he was still}} Duke of Normandy. The appointment was more consistent with English norms, as most of those appointed to the English episcopate before the Conquest had previously been royal clerks.|$|E
5|$|After 170 {{minutes of}} slow batting, Edrich gloved a rising Lindwall {{delivery}} and was caught behind by wicket-keeper Don Tallon. At 119/5, Compton {{returned to the}} field, his head wound having been stitched to stop the bleeding. He and Yardley played carefully until the tea break, and only the England captain offered a chance; Barnes was unable to complete the reflex catch at short leg from the bowling of Toshack. After the resumption of play, Yardley on-drove Lindwall for a four, but lofted Ernie Toshack, who had been bowling leg theory, into the packed on-side where he was caught by Johnson at forward square leg. Toshack's defensive bowling had caused the English skipper to lose patience and his <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> 22 left the score on 141/6.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 3rd {{millennium}} BC, Erbil {{is mentioned}} in historical records of the Ur III period as Urbilum. King Shulgi destroyed Urbilum in his 43rd regnal year, and during the reign of his successor Amar-Sin, Urbilum was incorporated into the Ur III state. In the 18th century BC, Erbil appears in a list of cities that were conquered by Shamshi-Adad of Upper Mesopotamia and Dadusha of Eshnunna during their campaign against the land of Qabra. Shamshi-Adad installed garrisons in all the cities of the land of Urbil. During the 2nd millennium BC, Erbil was incorporated into Assyria. Erbil served as a point of <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> military campaigns toward the east.|$|E
5|$|At this point, Thomas {{suffered}} {{his first}} reversal of fortune: before his <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Abydos, {{he had sent}} an army under his adoptive son Constantius against the Armeniacs. Constantius was ambushed by strategos Olbianos and killed, although the army was able to withdraw with relatively few casualties. Constantius's severed head was sent to Michael, who dispatched it to Thomas at Abydos. Thomas was undaunted by this relatively minor setback, and crossed over into Europe some time in late October or early November. There, Constantius was soon replaced as co-emperor by another obscure individual, a former monk whom Thomas also adopted and named Anastasius.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{police were}} unclear {{how the two}} groups from Sydney and Brisbane were linked, but did {{establish}} the movements {{of members of the}} group before their <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Indonesia. Several of the Bali Nine were employed by Eurest Australia, a multinational catering company with more than 9000 employees. Norman, Lawrence, Martin, Stephens and Chan, a supervisor with the company, all worked for Eurest, which provided hospitality services to the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the group was employed. Rush and Czugaj alleged they were recruited by Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, their co-defendant and the alleged financier of the smuggling plan, while socialising at a karaoke bar in Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|Before his <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> the Holy Land, Henry of Champagne had bequeathed the Counties of Champagne and Brie to his brother, Theobald, {{should he}} die without issue. Although Alice {{and her younger}} sister, Philippa, survived their father, Philip II of France {{invested}} their uncle, Theobald III, with Champagne and Brie in January 1198. Theobald III died on 24 May 1201, leaving Champagne and Brie to his posthumous son, Theobald IV, under the regency of his mother, Blanche of Navarre. However, Theobald IV's position was not secure as Alice and Philippa, both born while their father was count, could challenge a posthumous son's right to rule the counties.|$|E
5|$|Coggins {{was called}} up for Army service, and enlisted on April 8, 1943. He was pulled from basic {{training}} at Fort Eustis, Virginia {{before he could}} complete it to work as an illustrator for YANK magazine. He was originally introduced to the Commanding Officer and Editor of YANK, Colonel Franklin Forsberg, by Fletcher Pratt. On May 20, 1943, Coggins commenced work at the head office of YANK in New York, where he worked until his <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Britain. Jack Coggins became a naturalized citizen of the United States on August 19, 1943.|$|E
5|$|During 1935, her Code Letters {{were changed}} to LKAO. In February 1935, Helen Whittier was {{returned}} to the Hawaiian sugar service full-time. During her time on this service, Helen Whittier often called at New York. One typical voyage, as tracked in The New York Times, began when she departed New York on 23 November for Honolulu, passed through the Panama Canal on 4 December, and arrived at Honolulu. Helen Whittier departed there on 11 January 1936 and arrived at New York again on 16 February. Occasionally, Helen Whittier would make side trips to Baltimore for voyage repairs between her arrival at New York and her next <b>departure</b> <b>for</b> Hawaii. The cargo ship continued her Honolulu – New York service through September 1936.|$|E
