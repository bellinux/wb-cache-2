Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there is much to suggest that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E

James Burnham's {{theory has been}} much discussed, but few people have yet considered its ideological implications – this <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> world-view, the kind of beliefs, and the social structure that would probably prevail in a State which was at once unconquerable and in a permanent state of 'cold war' with its neighbours.|$|E
25|$|In Roman Catholic {{tradition}} a {{wide range}} of practices have developed, from devotions to the Holy Trinity to specific saints ranging from Saint Joseph to Saint Francis Xavier. The three level hierarchy of latria, hyperdulia and dulia determines the appropriate type of worship and veneration for different situations. The term latria (from the Greek , latreia) is used for worship, adoration and reverence directed only to the Holy Trinity. Dulia (from the Greek , douleia) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> honor given to the communion of saints, {{with the exception of the}} Blessed Virgin Mary, who is honored with hyperdulia. Thus hyperdulia is below latria and above dulia.|$|E

The concept of helical symmetry can be visualized as the tracing in three-dimensional space {{that results from}} rotating an object at a constant angular speed while simultaneously translating at a constant linear speed along its axis of rotation. At any one point in time, these two motions combine to give a coiling angle that helps define {{the properties of the}} traced helix. When the tracing object rotates quickly and translates slowly, the coiling angle will be close to 0°. Conversely, if the rotation is slow and the translation is speedy, the coiling angle will approach 90°.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted that someone could mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She {{wrote a letter to the}} author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E
