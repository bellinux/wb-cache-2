40|$|Jet {{engines are}} {{nonlinear}} dynamical systemsf or which an exact mathematical model cannot be usedf or estimator design, {{because it is}} either not available or so complex {{that it does not}} fit the necessary assumptions. Thus, classical analytical toolsf or studying standard system properties like observability, which is very important in estimator design, cannot be directly applied. Generally, f r practical jet engine applications, the designer f ces two closely related problems: first, given a nonmeasurable parameter, find the minimal set of estimator inputs thatf acilitates achieving a satisf ctory estimation perf ormance (input selection); second, given a predetermined set of inputs, derive an "observability " measure that characterizes the estimation feasib ility of a specific non-measurable parameter. In this paper, techniquesf. solving these two problems are developed and applied to estimator design fC jet engine thrust, stall margins, and an unmeasurable state. 1 Introducti on Thrust regulation is of ten the primary objective in jet engine control; this quantity, however, cannot be measured, so the designer isf orced to regulate closely related measurable variables such as the rotor speeds or pressure ratios. The resulting control designs must be conservative to ensure delivery of <b>guaranteed</b> <b>thrust</b> levels in the presence of engine-to-engine manuf acturing di#erences and engine deterioration. The conservative nature of the control design results in operating the engine in a less e#cient manner (e. g., at higher temperatures using moref uel) that shortens its lif e. A high quality thrust estimator can serve as a "virtual sensor"f or thrust, allowing f r more direct control over its value and resulting in less conservative designs that could lengthen engine lif e and [...] ...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{certified}} with 20000 lbf kN thrust JT8D-217s, a -217A-powered MD-82 was {{certified in}} mid-1982 and became available that year. The new version featured a higher MTOW (149500 lb), while the JT8D-217As had a <b>guaranteed</b> take-off <b>thrust</b> at temperature {{of up to}} 29 degrees C or 5000 ft altitude. The JT8D-217C engines were also offered on the MD-82, giving improved Thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC). Several operators took delivery of the -219-powered MD-82s, while Balair ordered its MD-82s powered by the lower-thrust -209 engine.|$|R
40|$|STRUCTURING HOST COMMUNICATION SOFTWARE FOR QUALITY OF SERVICE GUARANTEES by Ashish Mehra Chair: Kang G. Shin This {{dissertation}} addresses {{several issues}} involved in structuring communication software at end hosts to provide per-connection quality of service (QoS) <b>guarantees.</b> Our primary <b>thrust</b> is on realizing deterministic QoS guarantees in an experimental setting. We design a novel QoS-sensitive communication subsystem architecture that provides components and mechanisms to manage communication resources in a QoS-sensitive fashion. This architecture is based on three key design principles: maintenance of QoS guarantees, overload protection via per-connection traffic enforcement, and fairness to best-effort traffic. We demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} architecture via experiments using our x-kernel-based prototype implementation. We develop admission control extensions to capture important implementation-related aspects not considered by theoretical resource management policies p [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{parameters}} {{that affect}} {{the design of a}} hybrid rocket for small satellites are highlighted, and the benefit of the oxidizer flow rate control is analyzed. A single-port circular-section polyethylene grain is considered; the oxidizer is 85 % hydrogen peroxide. The engine design is optimized to search for the minimum engine mass when the initial satellite mass and the required velocity increment are assigned. First, the simplest blowdown feed system is considered. The analysis shows that the optimal design depends on a lower limit for the regression rate and sometimes on a further constraint, which is related to the occurrence of thermal choking. The initial values of the mixture ratio, the thrust level and the initial port area to the throat area ratio seem {{to be the most important}} parameters for an optimal design. As far as the oxidizer flow rate control is concerned, several control strategies, namely, constant mixture ratio, repressurization, constant combustion chamber pressure, and constant propellant tank pressure, are compared to the simplest blowdown system. The constant mixture ratio control is the worst case, as the mass and volume are similar to the blowdown case, while a large thrust variation occurs. Repressurization reduces the thrust variation. Constant pressure controls (both combustion chamber and tank pressures) <b>guarantee</b> a quasi-constant <b>thrust</b> and reduce engine dimensions, with a limited mass penalty...|$|R
