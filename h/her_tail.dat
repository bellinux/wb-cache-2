5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only an apron that exposes <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ring-tailed lemur}} is polygynandrous, {{although}} the dominant male in the troop typically breeds with more females than other males. Fighting is most common during the breeding season. A receptive female may initiate mating by presenting her backside, lifting <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> {{and looking at}} the desired male over her shoulder. Males may inspect the female's genitals to determine receptiveness. Females typically mate within their troop, but may seek outside males.|$|E
5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with her several times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E

5|$|In {{the mating}} season, rutting males move about {{in search of}} females in oestrus. Males become {{aggressive}} and fight among themselves for dominance. These fights are characterised by displays of the enlarged chest, the throat patch and the beard while holding the head upright; and threatening the opponent by running with the horns pointed toward him and circling him. The victorious bull would protect {{the vicinity of the}} targeted female from other males. The courtship typically lasts for 45 minutes. The male, stiff and composed, approaches the receptive female, who keeps her head low to the ground and may slowly walk forward. The male licks her genitalia, upon which the female holds <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> to a side and the male gives out a flehmen response. Finally, the male pushes his chest against her rump, and mounts her.|$|E
5|$|Mating in {{hartebeest}} {{takes place}} throughout the year, {{with one or}} two peaks that can be influenced by the availability of food. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Reproduction varies by the subspecies and local factors. Mating takes place in the territories defended by a single male, mostly in open areas. The males may fight fiercely for dominance, following which the dominant male smells the female's genitalia, and follows her if she is in oestrus. Sometimes a female in oestrus holds out <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> slightly to signal her receptivity, and the male tries to block the female's way. She may eventually stand still and allow the male to mount her. Copulation is brief and is often repeated, sometimes twice or more in a minute. Any intruder at this time is chased away. In large herds, females often mate with several males.|$|E
5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing her head on his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E

5|$|Females become {{sexually mature}} at eight months, but mate no earlier than two years. Males mature later, at one-and-a-half years. Mating takes place {{throughout}} the year; peaks occur during {{spring and fall}} in Texas. Two peaks have been observed in India: from August to October and from March to April. Rutting males aggressively establish and defend their territories from other males, giving out loud grunts and engaging in serious head-to-head fights, pushing each other using horns. Aggressive display consists of thrusting the neck forward and raising it, folding the ears and raising the tail. The dominant male pursues the female with his nose pointing upward, smells her urine and shows a flehmen response. The female shows her receptivity by waving <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> and thumping the hindlegs on the ground. This is followed by several mounting attempts, and copulation. The whole process may {{last as long as}} six hours. The female will remain still for some time after copulation, following which she may start grazing. The male may then move on to mate with another female.|$|E
5|$|Adults {{aggregate}} {{in large}} numbers (>20 individuals) under rocks and logs along the immediate edge of the breeding sites and breed explosively over a few days. Suitable breeding sites include small fish-free ponds, marshes, shallow lakes and other still-water wetlands. Like other ambystomatid salamanders, they have evolved a characteristic courtship dance where they rub bodies and release pheromones from their chin gland prior to assuming a copulatory mating position. Once in position, the male deposits a spermatophore, which is a gooey stalk tipped with a packet of sperm, and walks the female forward to be inseminated. Males may mate more than once and may deposit as many as 15 spermatophores {{over the course of}} a five-hour period. The courtship dance for the long-toed salamander is similar to other species of Ambystoma and very similar to A.jeffersonianum. In the long-toed salamander, there is no rubbing or head-butting; the males directly approach females and grab on, while the females try to rapidly swim away. The males clasp the female from behind the forelimbs and shake, a behavior called amplexus. Males sometimes clasp other amphibian species during breeding and shake them as well. The male only grabs with the front limbs and never uses his hind limbs during the courtship dance as he rubs his chin side to side pressing down on the female's head. The female struggles but later becomes subdued. Males increase the tempo and motions, rubbing over the female's nostrils, sides, and sometimes the vent. When the female becomes quite docile the male moves forward with his tail positioned over her head, raised, and waving at the tip. If the female accepts the males courtship, the male directs her snout toward his vent region while both move forward stiffly with pelvic undulations. As the female follows, the male stops and deposits a spermatophore, and the female will move forward with the male to raise <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> and receive the sperm packet. The full courtship dance is rarely accomplished in the first attempt. Females deposit their eggs a few days after mating.|$|E

25|$|When in estrus, {{the female}} points her {{posterior}} towards {{a male and}} raises it, moving <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> to one side.

Breeding and reproduction can occur {{at any time of}} the year, although some areas have birth peaks.|$|E
25|$|Most male {{birds have}} no phallus. In the males of species without a phallus, sperm {{is stored in}} the seminal glomera within the cloacal {{protuberance}} prior to copulation. During copulation, the female moves <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> {{to the side and}} the male either mounts the female from behind or in front (as in the stitchbird), or moves very close to her. The cloacae then touch, so that the sperm can enter the female's reproductive tract. This can happen very fast, sometimes in less than half a second.|$|E

25|$|Sidewinders mature at two {{to three}} years of age, are capable of {{reproducing}} annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female's back, rubbing her with his chin to stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around <b>her</b> <b>tail,</b> and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she will lift <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> and allow him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born six to eight inches long. The birth takes only {{two to three}} hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the baby sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for seven to ten days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their litter mates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.|$|E
25|$|After a pre-game {{performance}} of the Texas ATCU game in December, Reveille's nervous, high-pitched barks could be heard above the band. It was decided by administrators and the Corps of Cadets that she be sent to obedience school. She worked closely with her professional trainer, Dr. Kay Stephens, and her newly appointed mascot corporal throughout the summer for her return for football season. Despite several stints in obedience school, Reveille's manners at times needed work. Though other incidents have been suspected, in 2007, {{it was reported that}} Reveille VII bit her handler after having <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> stepped on during a morning run. On February 13, 2008, her impending retirement {{at the end of the}} school year was announced at a news conference at the Corps Center. In the summer of 2008, she began her retirement at the age of 7 living with two other dogs under the care of Paul and Tina Gardner in Wellborn, Texas.|$|E
25|$|Grant’s gazelles {{sexually mature}} at 18 months. Territory-holding bucks mate more than ones in {{bachelor}} groups. The courting ritual {{begins with a}} buck following a doe, {{waiting for her to}} urinate. When she does, the male does the Flehmen response to determine if she is in estrus. If she is, he will continue to follow her. The female will lift <b>her</b> <b>tail,</b> signaling she is ready to mate, and the male will mount her. The gestation period for the gazelle lasts for 198 days. Births peak in January and February. A doe will leave her herd and find a well-hidden place to give birth. Afterwards, the female eats the afterbirth and other fluids to keep the fawn clean and scentless. Females that have recently given birth will stay together for protection. The does nurse their fawns four times a day. Fawns are immobile for the first few days, so the mother stays close by. When the fawn can walk, it leaves with its mother to find a herd. Around this time, fawns will associate with one another in peer groups. A gazelle is weaned at six months, but will continue to associate with its mother until adolescence.|$|E

Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the Daily Planet under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs. Perry understands and though he must protect the paper he is first and foremost a good journalist and nudges Lois in the right direction; he won't run the story but noted it must get out to the people somehow. Enlightened, she quits the Daily Planet, as Lois gets her edge back. It was later revealed she never really quit the Daily Planet.|$|E
25|$|The African wolf's {{courtship}} rituals {{are remarkably}} long, {{during which the}} breeding pair remains almost constantly together. Prior to mating, the pair patrols and scent marks its territory. Copulation is preceded by the female holding <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> out and angled {{in such a way}} that her genitalia are exposed. The two approach each other, whimpering, lifting their tails and bristling their fur, displaying varying intensities of offensive and defensive behaviour. The female sniffs and licks the male's genitals, whilst the male nuzzles the female's fur. They may circle each other and fight briefly. The copulatory tie lasts roughly four minutes. Towards the end of estrus, the pair drifts apart, with the female often approaching the male in a comparatively more submissive manner. In anticipation of the role he will take in raising pups, the male regurgitates or surrenders any food he has to the female. In the Serengeti, pups are born in December–January, and begin eating solid food after a month. Weaning starts at the age of two months, and ends at four months. At this stage, the pups are semi-independent, venturing up to 50 metres from the den, even sleeping in the open. Their playing behaviour becomes increasingly more aggressive, with the pups competing for rank, which is established after six months. The female feeds the pups more frequently than the male or helpers do, though the presence of the latter allows the breeding pair to leave the den and hunt without leaving the litter unprotected.|$|E
500|$|The {{second story}} recounts {{the tale of}} the [...] "girl-bird" [...] Gertrude McFuzz, who has one small, plain tail feather and envies Lolla Lee Lou, who has two feathers.

Now wanting to surpass Lolla Lee Lou, she eats the entire vine, causing <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> to grow to an enormous size. However, the added weight of too many feathers does not allow her to fly, run or even walk. She panics by yelping repeatedly, while being stuck on the hill. Her uncle, who hears her painful yelps, sends for the rescue, and many other birds are forced to carry her home and pluck out <b>her</b> <b>tail</b> feathers, which takes a few weeks, causing her to be sore.
