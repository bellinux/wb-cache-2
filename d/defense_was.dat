5|$|Clemson's <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> strongest {{against the}} rush. During the regular season, the Tigers allowed {{an average of}} 101.8 yards per game on the ground, good enough for No. 18 nationally. Their passing <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> not nearly as successful. On average, the Tigers allowed 238.6 yards per game through the air, making their pass defense the 97th best in {{division}} I-A football during the regular season. With both categories combined, the <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked No. 37. In terms of points allowed, rather than yardage, the Tigers were ranked No. 23 after giving up an average of 19.3 yards per game.|$|E
5|$|Florida State's <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked No. 43 in {{the country}} at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season. The Seminoles allowed 356.36 yards per game, on average. State's rushing <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked No. 32 (126 ypg), while its passing <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked No. 76 (230.36 ypg). The Seminoles' defensive squad was led by middle linebacker Bradley Jennings, who had 121 tackles during the regular season—the most on the team. Defensive tackle Darnell Dockett also was a standout performer statistically for the Seminoles, leading the team in tackles for loss and setting the single-season and single-game Florida State records in that category.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> led by {{coordinator}} Bud Foster, who {{was named}} a candidate in several teams' searches for a new head coach, but decided to remain at Virginia Tech as the buildup to the Orange Bowl continued. Heading into the game, Tech's defense ranked 38th nationally in total yards allowed, its second-worst performance since 1993. Tech's run <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> 58th, permitting an average 148.9rushingyards per game. On {{the positive side of}} things, Tech's defense had the third-most interceptions (22) in the country, and its scoring <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> 16th (19.1 points per game).|$|E
50|$|Strategic <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> {{not always}} passive in nature.

5|$|Coming {{into the}} Gator Bowl, the Virginia Tech <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked first in total defense, second in pass defense, fourth in rushing defense, {{and third in}} scoring defense, {{allowing}} an average of just over 12points per game. The Virginia Tech <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> led by defensive end Darryl Tapp, a first-team All-ACC pick, an American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American, {{a finalist for the}} Lott Trophy, and a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award. Tapp was considered a natural leader {{both on and off the}} field and led the Hokies' defensive workouts during practice. Tapp finished the regular season with 45tackles (including 12.5 for a loss) and ten sacks. He was also named a second-team Associated Press All-American, and he won the Dudley Award, given annually to the best college football player in the state of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Flanders {{felt that}} {{spending}} 62% of federal income on <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> irrational, when the Soviet government claimed it wished to avoid nuclear conflict. He advocated {{that the development}} of “A- and H-bombs be paralleled with equally intense negotiations towards disarmament.” For him, “gaining the co-operation of the Soviet government on an effective armament control,” was most important.|$|E
5|$|Heading {{into the}} ACC Championship game, the Virginia Tech <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> ranked {{first in the}} nation for total defense and scoring defense. In pass defense, the Hokies were second in the nation, {{allowing}} an average of just 88.38yards a game. ACC rival Miami was first, allowing just 84.57yards per game on average.|$|E

25|$|A {{successful}} {{prima facie}} <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> rare. Not {{only does the}} burden of proof rest upon the accused, a successful defense may involve expenses well in excess of the cost of a ticket, such as an expert witness. Furthermore, because prima facie <b>defenses</b> must <b>be</b> presented in a court, such a <b>defense</b> <b>is</b> difficult for out-of-town motorists.|$|R

5|$|In the 1956 NBA draft, Boston Celtics coach Red Auerbach had set {{his sights}} on Russell, {{thinking}} his defensive toughness and rebounding prowess were the missing pieces the Celtics needed. In retrospect, Auerbach's thoughts were unorthodox. In that period, centers and forwards were defined by their offensive output, and their ability to play <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> secondary.|$|E

5|$|Once the Alien and Sedition Acts were passed, the Federalists {{pushed for}} this letter to be {{printed in the}} Vermont Journal, which Spooner did, thus adding {{additional}} charges against Lyon. One other charge included publishing letters written by the poet Joel Barlow, which Lyon had read at political rallies. These also were published prior to the Acts. Lyon's <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> to be the unconstitutionality of the Acts, as Jeffersonians saw them as violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. In Lyon's particular case, there was the aforementioned letter to Alden Spooner {{as well as that}} of Barlow, which meant Lyon felt entitled to bring up the Constitution's safeguards against ex post facto laws. This <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> not allowed.|$|E

5|$|Plant <b>defenses</b> can <b>be</b> {{classified}} generally as constitutive or induced. Constitutive <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> {{always present}} in the plant, while induced <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> produced or mobilized to the site where a plant is injured. There is wide variation in the composition and concentration of constitutive defenses and these range from mechanical defenses to digestibility reducers and toxins. Many external mechanical defenses and large quantitative <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> constitutive, as they require large amounts of resources to produce and are difficult to mobilize. A variety of molecular and biochemical approaches are {{used to determine the}} mechanism of constitutive and induced plant defenses responses against herbivory.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the stars}} of that IU <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> {{defensive}} tackle Hurvin McCormack, who led the Hoosiers in sacks with seven. Another important defensive player was linebacker Alfonzo Thurman, whose 108tackles during the regular season were the most of any Indiana player.|$|E
5|$|The California <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> led by {{defensive}} back Donnie McCleskey, an All-Pac-10 selection who accumulated 99tackles—the most on the team—and 2interceptions {{during the regular}} season.

5|$|A fierce <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts {{to negotiate with the}} Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either as part of the amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E

40|$|Predation {{is a major}} {{selective}} force structuring biological {{communities and}} causing the evolution of defenses in many prey organisms. While permanent defenses evolve under constant predation pressure, inducible <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> adaptations to heterogeneity in predation risk [1] and likely evolved under divergent selection regimes. Costs for the production or maintenance of <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> saved during times when these <b>defenses</b> <b>are</b> not required. A fascinating aspect {{of the study of}} inducible <b>defenses</b> <b>is</b> that organisms with the same genotype can display drama ti cally different phenotypes in response to par ticular environmental factors that are required for activat ing genes that control the formation of these defenses.

5|$|A second {{overhaul}} of AA <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> made between 1944 and 1945, as the Navy had found 20mm shells too light to stop Japanese kamikaze planes; this plus the higher approach speeds of these planes made these manually controlled guns obsolete. In their place, more quad 40mm Bofors mounts were fitted. Maryland eventually carried forty quad 40mm and eighteen 20mm guns. Colorados quad 40s were increased to forty {{but she kept}} all her 20mm guns. West Virginia carried forty quad 40mm and fifty 20mm. guns.|$|E
5|$|Although the 1915 {{season was}} a success, the next year's team {{was one of}} the {{greatest}} of Warner's career. The Panthers were again undefeated and, like the previous year, six of the eight games were shutouts. Thirty-two of their 35 players were from Western Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. The team scored 255 points, conceding 25. Warner considered the team an improvement because its <b>defense</b> <b>was</b> more dominant than the previous year's. The Panthers were the consensus national champions, and Warner became recognized as one of football's greatest coaches.|$|E
5|$|Buenos Aires {{and other}} nearby cities faced the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 and 1807. In {{the absence of}} {{reinforcements}} from Spain, viceroy Santiago de Liniers arranged that everyone in Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms should join the resistance against the second invasion. Larrea established the Legion of Catalan Volunteers with Jaime Nadal y Guarda, Jaime Lavallol and José Olaguer Reynals. Larrea was appointed captain of this military unit.
