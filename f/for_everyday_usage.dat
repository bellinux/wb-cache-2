An intranet-based solution compares favorably to paperwork, but a standard web based on plain HTML does not support very well features such as document structuring and text retrieval.

40|$|The {{languages}} which adopted Greek {{words and}} names {{directly or indirectly}} through Latin tend to place the word stress according to Latin rules. While this principle {{has a number of}} exceptions even in Italian, it has been established as a norm (lex Perrottae) for doublets, at least in academic circles. In literary translations, by contrast, Greek names often display the Greek stress, not just for metrical reasons but rather as a deliberate choice, aiming at an evocative, commemorative reproduction of the name with its original sound. Examples are found as early as the Roman epic poet Ennius. The dilemma thus transcends mere orthography. In terms of the speech act theory, the – unmarked – Latin stress may be linked to denotative use, and the Greek one to performative, ‘ritual’ use. The paper argues that <b>for</b> <b>everyday,</b> ‘vernacular’ <b>usage,</b> the Latin stress is the only sensible and historically established choice, while literary translation requires more freedom...|$|R

40|$|The {{thesis of}} my {{bachelor}} {{work is the}} design of a new control system of through-flow area in the existing storm water overflow channel, which is used in current constructed wetland, located in Drážovice village and which does not fulfill flow conditions. The target of the work is to design and verify the function of the controller which ensures decreasing of the flows, or reduction of the water level height in case of overflow during raining. Prior to the design, there had been made mathematical and graphic descriptions with using of the Excel and AutoCad and the results are applied for the laboratory model. The thesis consists of the theoretical analysis of the current status and the new solution design. The main point is based on the control of the water level in overflow channel with flexible diameter from 0. 3 m till 0. 2 m. The construction of the existing storm water overflow channel was done in laboratory conditions, as well as the new designed controlled device. After built-up of the model, there have been made measurings and following corrections to reach the ideal status. For using of this controller in constructed wetland in Dražovice, there will be also needed very precise set up of this device <b>for</b> its <b>everyday</b> <b>usage...</b>|$|R

The array is a 67. 5 m long cable with 16 4 m-spaced hydrophones and 17 digital thermistor sensors, distributed along its length. Each module has a dedicated preamplifier to increase signal strength at the hydrophone output and drive a balanced line to transmit the signal to the surface buoy's electronics. The thermistor sensors are digital devices that transmit the temperatures values through a 1 -wire digital serial bus. This report presents the system user guide and the system reference guide. The user guide has instructions <b>for</b> system deployment, <b>everyday</b> <b>usage</b> and maintenance.

50|$|As {{with its}} Lotus Seven precursors, Caterhams are {{constructed}} of aluminium sheet {{attached to a}} tubular steel chassis. Nosecone and wings are either GRP or carbon fibre depending on specification. All Sevens are front engined with rear-wheel drive and two seats. Their extremely high performance is achieved through light weight (less than 500 kg on some versions) rather than particularly powerful engines. As well as a lightweight chassis and bodywork, Caterham Sevens achieve their very low mass through their lack of comfort and safety oriented features such as a fixed roof, doors, radio, air-conditioning, airbags, traction/stability control, ABS, satellite navigation or cruise control. As a result, the Seven is somewhat limited in its practicality <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage</b> and is instead recognised by driving enthusiasts for its focus on driving enjoyment, making it an ideal track/race car or 'Sunday' car.|$|E

Pragmatic functions of name sign use are highlighted and questions like the existence of a dominant type raised. The paper considers the formation and use of proper names in British Sign Language (BSL). References to ‘neighbouring’ languages like English and American Sign Language (ASL) are made.

40|$|Terminal Server {{technology}} is a field that promises to solve {{a lot of problems}} by moving the desktop into the cloud. As most users are still using pc:s we want to examine what it is that hold thin clients back. To answer that we study what the current technology provides, and attempt to point out what it lacks. To provide background information I have evaluated several terminal servers, which use different protocols. The study shows that this {{technology is}} still immature. Multimedia, which is essential to modern desktop use, needs a lot more work. So does 3 D graphics which may not be essential but still important to many users. These problems may require solutions that breaks compatibility with legacy applications, by requiring multimedia and 3 D applications to use a network- transparent API, rather than accessing hardware directly like they currently do. I present a possible solution to the problems with multimedia, by using an API where codecs can be moved to the client. When it comes to 3 D the solution may become more complex. The current API:s are to close too hardware and a more abstract scene graph may be needed to provide a sufficient level of abstraction. As a result of these limitations terminal server technology is only fit for office usage, and not <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage.</b> However, video presentations that may be needed in some offices are becoming more common on the Internet. I conclude that while the terminal server approach is promising, the existing technology is not mature enough <b>for</b> <b>everyday</b> <b>usage.</b> Most users require multimedia and optionally 3 D graphics for a complete desktop experience. Those are the areas that need more attention in order to satisfy the end users. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
