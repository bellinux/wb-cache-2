40|$|Under {{laboratory}} conditions, the scallop Chlamys nobilis and the mussel Perna viridis {{were exposed}} to N-sulfocarbamoyl toxins (C 2 toxin), a paralytic shellfish toxin (PST), by feeding a local toxic strain of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (ATDP) that produced C 2 toxin exclusively. The bivalves were subsequently depurated in the field, and their depuration kinetics, biotransformation and toxin distribution were quantified. Depuration was characterized by a rapid loss within the first day, followed by a secondary slower loss of toxins. In the fast <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> scallops detoxified PSTs more quickly than the mussels (depuration rate constants for scallops and mussels were 1. 16 day(- 1) and 0. 87 day(- 1), respectively). In contrast, the mussels detoxified PSTs more quickly than the scallops in the slow <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> and the calculated depuration rate constants (mean+SE) from day 2 to day 13 were 0. 063 + 0. 009 day(- 1) and 0. 040 + 0. 019 day(- 1) for mussels and scallops, respectively. The differences in the appearances of gonyautoxins, GTX 2 and GTX 3, and their decarbamoyl derivatives, dcGTX 2, dcGTX 3 and GTX 5, which are all derivatives of C 2 toxin, indicated active and species-specific biotransformation of the algal toxins in the two bivalves. In both species of bivalves, the non-viscera tissue contained fewer toxins and lower concentrations than the viscera-containing tissue compartment. In scallops, very little toxin was distributed in the adductor muscle. In mussels, most of the PSTs {{were found in the}} digestive gland with significant transport of toxins into the digestive gland from other tissues during the course of depuration. The toxin profiles of scallops and mussels differed from each other and from that of the toxic algae fed. A significant fraction of GTX 5 was detected in the mussels but not in the scallops. Our study demonstrates a species specificity in the depuration kinetics, biotransformation and tissue distribution of PSTs among different bivalves...|$|E

Adult isopods were fed on alder leaf powder (Alnus glutinosa) spiked with [14 C]hexachlorobenzene (HCB). Test animals, sampled regularly during the uptake (16 d) and <b>depuration</b> <b>phases</b> (16 d), were analysed and the kinetic of tissue concentrations determined. Uptake (k 1) and depuration rates (k 2) were calculated to estimate kinetic biomagnification factors (BMFs). Additionally, the effect of coprophagy on the uptake and accumulation of HCB {{as well as the}} tissue distribution of HCB in P. scaber was investigated. The test system showed to be suitable for investigations on the terrestrial bioaccumulation of chemicals. Coprophagy had no effect on the bioaccumulation of HCB in P. scaber. The hepatopancreas was identified as the main target tissue for HCB accumulation. The low biomagnification factor of 0. 057 resulted from a low assimilation efficiency (a) of 31. 42 %, a low uptake rate k 1 (0. 009 d- 1) as well as a high depuration rate k 2 (0. 164 d- 1). The results indicate that the terrestrial bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in P. scaber might not represent a worst case scenario for biomagnification limiting the value of the test system for the regulatory assessment of organic chemicals...|$|R

The cuttlefish readily concentrated 203 Hg when exposed via seawater, with whole body CF > 260 after only 10 d of exposure. The total Hg accumulated from seawater was depurated relatively fast with a Tb½ of 17 d. During both exposure and depuration periods, accumulated Hg was mainly (> 70 %) associated with the muscular parts of the cuttlefish. However, {{the proportion of the}} whole body Hg content associated with the digestive gland increased during exposure and <b>depuration</b> <b>phases,</b> suggesting that the metal was transferred from the muscles towards this organ for detoxification. When fed with radiolabelled food, cuttlefish displayed high assimilation efficiency (AE > 90 %) and the metal was found to be mainly located in the digestive gland (60 % of the whole Hg content). Nevertheless, high depuration rates resulted in short Tb½ (i. e., 4 d), suggesting that this organ has a major role in Hg detoxification and depuration. Whatever the exposure pathway was, low proportion of Hg (< 2 %) was found in the cuttlebone. Assessment of the relative contribution of the dietary and dissolved exposure pathways to inorganic Hg bioaccumulation in juvenile cuttlefish revealed that Hg was mainly accumulated from food that contributed for 77 ± 16 % of the global metal bioaccumulation...|$|R
40|$|Despite being {{essential}} for animal health and fitness, Se has a relatively narrow range between deficiency and toxicity, and excess Se {{can cause a}} variety of adverse effects in aquatic organisms. Amphibians are particularly vulnerable to contaminants during larval aquatic life stage, because they can accumulate toxic ions through various routes including skin, gills, lungs and digestive tract. Few {{attempts have been made}} to understand the tissue-specific accumulation of trace elements, including the impacts of chemical speciation in developing amphibian larvae. We used radiolabelled 75 Se to explore the biokinetics and tissue distributions of the two dominant forms occurring in surface waters, selenite (SeIV) and selenate (SeVI). Tadpoles of the native Australian frog Limnodynastes peronii were exposed to Se in both forms, and live-animal gamma spectroscopy was used to track accumulation and retention over time. Tissue biodistributions were also quantified at the end of the uptake and <b>depuration</b> <b>phases.</b> Results showed the bioconcentration of SeIV to be 3 times greater compared to SeVI, but rates of elimination were similar for both forms. This suggests a change of Se speciation within the organism prior to excretion. Depuration kinetics were best described by a one-phase exponential decay model, and tadpoles retained approximately 19 % of the accumulated Se after 12 [*]days of depuration in clean water. Selenium bioaccumulation was greatest in digestive and excretory organs, as well as the eye, which may directly relate to previously reported Se-induced impairments. Results demonstrate how the use of radiotracing techniques can significantly improve our understanding of trace element toxicokinetics and tissue distributions in developing amphibians. From an environmental monitoring perspective, the findings highlight the importance of considering chemical speciation as this could influence the accuracy of risk assessment.

40|$|Due to {{the wide}} spread {{occurrence}} of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), a pharmaceutical compound, in wastewater effluent and surface waters, the objectives of this work were to determine the tissue specific uptake and bioconcentration factor (BCF) for MPA in common carp.

MPA concentrations in muscle, brain, liver and plasma were determined by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). The results from the experiment indicate that MPA can accumulate in fish, however, MPA is {{not considered to be}} bioaccumulative based on regulatory standards (BCF ≥ 1000).

30|$|OECD TG 305 {{describes}} a procedure for characterizing the bioconcentration potential of substances in fish. The test {{consists of two}} phases: the exposure (uptake) and post-exposure (depuration) phases. During the uptake phase, separate groups of fish of one species are exposed to at least two concentrations of the test substance. They are then transferred to a medium free of the test substance for the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase.</b> The concentration of the test substance in the fish is followed through both phases of the test. Where possible, the BCF is calculated preferably both as {{the ratio of the}} concentration in the fish and in the water at apparent steady state (BCFss) and as the kinetic bioconcentration factor BCFK, which is the ratio of the rate constants of uptake (k 1) and depuration (k 2) assuming first-order kinetics [2]. OECD TG 305 does not define specific analytical techniques to determine analyte concentrations in the water phase.

In this way, this work aims to model the snail accumulation and excretion kinetics of uranium(U), cesium (Cs) and thorium (Th).

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} tissue-specific bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of the selected pharmaceuticals: norethindrone (NET), ibuprofen (IBU), verapamil (VER), clozapine (CLZ) and fenofibrate (FFB) in two freshwater fishes: fathead minnow and channel catfish. BCF tests on fathead followed the standard OECD 42 -day test while a 14 -day abridged test design was used in catfish exposures. Additional objectives included a) comparing the measured BCFs to the US EPA's BCFWIN model predicted values, b) comparing the BCF results from the standard and reduced tests, and c) prediction of chronic risk of the pharmaceuticals in fish using the human therapeutic plasma concentrations. Each test included uptake and <b>depuration</b> <b>phases</b> to measure tissue-specific kinetic BCFs. The results indicated that all the pharmaceuticals, except IBU, have the potential for accumulation in fish. Estimated BCFs for NET, VER and FFB may not be significant in view of the current regulatory trigger level (BCF &# 8805; 2000); however, CLZ's BCF in the liver had approached the criterion level. Significant differences were noticed in the tissue-specific uptake levels of the pharmaceuticals with the following general trend: (liver/kidney) > (gill/brain) > (heart/muscle) > plasma. IBU uptake was highest in the plasma. When compared to the measured BCFs, predicted values for NET, IBU, VER and FFB were slightly overestimated but did not differ largely. However, the measured BCF of CLZ in the liver was approximately two-orders of magnitude higher than the predicted level. The tissue-BCFs for the two species were not widely different indicating the potential usefulness of the reduced BCF test. Comparison of fish and human plasma levels indicated that NET, CLZ and VER have the potential to cause chronic effects in fish...|$|R
40|$|Understanding uptake and {{depuration}} of radionuclides in organisms {{is necessary}} to relate exposure to radiation dose and ultimately to biological effects. We investigated uptake and depuration of a mixture of radionuclides to link bioaccumulation with radiation dose in zebrafish, Danio rerio. Adult zebrafish were exposed to radionuclides (54 Mn, 60 Co, 65 Zn, 75 Se, 109 Cd, 110 mAg, 134 Cs and 241 Am) at tracer levels (greater than 200 Bq g− 1) for 14 d, either via water or diet. Radioactivity concentrations were measured in whole body and excised gonads of exposed fish during uptake (14 d) and <b>depuration</b> <b>phases</b> (47 d and 42 d for aqueous and dietary exposures respectively), and dose rates were modelled from activity concentrations in whole body and exposure medium (water or diet). After 14 -day aqueous exposure, radionuclides were detected in decreasing activity concentrations: 75 Se greater than 65 Zn greater than 109 Cd greater than 110 mAg greater than 54 Mn greater than 60 Co greater than 241 Am greater than 134 Cs (range: 175 – 8 Bq g 1). After dietary exposure the order of radionuclide activity concentration in tissues (Bq g− 1) was: 65 Zn greater than 60 Co greater than 75 Se greater than 109 Cd greater than 110 mAg greater than 241 Am greater than 54 Mn greater than 134 Cs (range: 91 – 1 Bq g− 1). Aqueous exposure resulted in higher whole body activity concentrations for all radionuclides except 60 Co. Route of exposure {{did not appear to}} influence activity concentrations in gonads, except for 54 Mn, 65 Zn, and 75 Se, which had higher activity concentrations in gonads following aqueous exposure. Highest gonad activity concentrations (Bq g− 1) were for 75 Se (211), 109 Cd (142), and 65 Zn (117), and highest dose rates (μGy h− 1) were from 241 Am (aqueous, 1050; diet 242).

40|$|The {{depuration}} of gas-phase {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} (PCBs) from a slow-growing evergreen shrub, Skimmia japonica Thunb., was studied {{to investigate the}} reversibility of uptake and the compartmentalization of PCB congeners within leaves with respect to air-plant exchange processes. Depuration of PCBs was monitored over periods of hours, days, and weeks. Equilibrium had not been attained between air and leaves during the uptake phase after many weeks. Depuration followed two-phase clearance kinetics, with phase 1 occurring over the order of hours and phase 2 continuing slowly over weeks. In phase 1, a substantial part (ca. 40 %) of the PCB burden that the plants had accumulated over weeks was lost in 2 - 3 h. This observation is further evidence for the close dynamic coupling of air and vegetation compartments. In the second phase,very slow depuration over 28 d only removed a further similar to 25 % of the accumulated PCB burden. <b>Depuration</b> rates in <b>phase</b> 2 varied between compounds and were not influenced by growth dilution. Depuration rates for both phases {{were not correlated with}} K- 0 A, indicating that plant-air mass transfer coefficients were proportional to plant-air partition coefficients and, therefore, probably dominated by the plant-side resistance to diffusion. Photolysis and metabolism are unlikely to have influenced the rates of congener disappearance. Pathways into the leaf and possible storage locations within the plant are discussed with respect to the observed differences between uptake and clearance rates. Uptake and depuration are not mirror image processes, with a fraction of accumulated PCBs effectively stored in the leaves. This has important implications for terrestrial food chain transfer and global cycling with leaf concentrations remaining elevated long after a contamination event...|$|R

Toxin composition and the relative ratio of toxic components in shellfish is in correlation with the occurrence of DSP producing organisms from the Dinophysis species along with Prorocentrum micans and Lingulodinium polyedrum. The occurrence of D. sacculus shortly before the appearance of OA in shellfish implicates its possible involvement as the source of toxicity. In the central Adriatic, the infestation period generally ranges from June to August. Augmented toxin production may shift the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase</b> to September; however, the length of decontamination period is not in correlation with increased initial toxicity.

The results of CAT increased significantly in tissues of treatment mussels after 72 [*]h exposure when compared to control.

Macrophytes bioaccumulate Hg and {{play a role in}} Hg transfer to food webs in shallow aquatic ecosystems. Nevertheless, the compartmentalization of Hg within macrophytes, notably major accumulation in the cell wall and its impact on trophic transfer to primary consumers are overlooked. The present work focusses on the trophic transfer of inorganic Hg (IHg) and monomethyl-Hg (MMHg) from the intracellular and cell wall compartments of the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii – considered a good candidate for phytoremediation – to the crustacean Gammarus fossarum. The results demonstrated that Hg accumulated in both compartments was trophically bioavailable to gammarids. Besides IHg from both compartments were similarly transferred to G. fossarum, while for MMHg, uptake rates were ∼ 2. 5 -fold higher in G. fossarum fed with the cell wall vs the intracellular compartment. During the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> Hg concentrations in G. fossarum varied insignificantly suggesting that both IHg and MMHg were strongly bound to biological ligands in the crustacean.

This study was conducted at two different concentrations (1 and 10 μg/L) of 14 C-labeled pirimiphos-methyl for 28 days uptake and 14 days depuration according to the OECD 305 test guideline. The BCFss for total radioactive residues in whole fish were 1, 251 and 1, 277 for low and high concentrations, respectively. The BCFk based on the uptake and depuration rate constants were 1, 200 for both low and high concentrations. During the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> the accumulated test substance was rapidly depurated from fish. Greater than 95 % of the residue at steady-state was depurated after 2 days. Although the measured BCF values were high, pirimiphos-methyl could be evaluated as a low risk from bioaccumulation by aquatic organisms due to the short depuration period and low amount of bound residue (1. 5 %). We suggest that in evaluating bioaccumulation, not only the BCF should be considered, but also depuration time and bound residue in aquatic organisms give {{an indication of the}} potential environmental risks.

Although the production in Europe has been relatively constant in the last 10 years, world plastic production continues to increase, affecting soil biota and their functions. Objectives Thus, in order to evaluate the effects of MP in soil-dwelling organisms, earthworms (Eisenia andrei Bouché), were exposed to standard artificial soil mixed with MPs and the authors documented, using microscopic figures, the pathological lesions found in this biological model.

40|$|International audienceTo {{understand}} bioaccumulation kinetics {{of metals}} within biota inhabiting industrially contaminated soils, toxicokinetic dynamics and subcellular fractionation {{were carried out}} with the terrestrial snail Helix aspersa in a long-term (six-month) laboratory experiment. Accumulation and elimination kinetics were determined for Cd, Pb, and Zn in both viscera and foot of snails and were described accurately by one-compartment models. The subcellular fractions were obtained by sequential centrifugations and were analyzed by isolating metal-rich granules, tissue fragments, and cytosolic fractions. Different fractions showed metal-specific binding capacities that might be useful in identifying the biological significance of accumulated metal levels in snails. Cadmium was retrieved mainly from the cytosolic fraction, where it was stored {{in the long term}} and not excreted, thus explaining the linear accumulation patterns. Most of the accumulated Pb was found in the granular fraction, and snails appeared able to excrete these concretions, leading to achievement of a steady state in internal Pb body burdens. Significant levels of Pb, however, were retrieved {{at the end of the}} <b>depuration</b> <b>phase</b> and retained in the cell debris fraction.

On days 0, 7, 14, 28, 31, 35, 42, and 56 of the present study, fish were sampled from the test basin for PFAS analysis. Biomagnification factors (BMFs) for all test compounds were determined based on a kinetic approach. Distribution factors were calculated for each test compound to illustrate the disposition of PFASs in rainbow trout after 28 d of exposure. Dietary exposure of market-siz e rainbow trout to PFASs did not result in biomagnification; BMF values were calculated as 0. 42 for PFOS, > 0. 23 for PFNA, > 0. 18 for PFHxS, > 0. 04 for PFOA, and > 0. 02 for PFBS, which are below the biomagnification threshold of 1.

Over the 15 -day exposure period, shrimp under different exposure concentrations exhibited a significant increase in PCB 153 concentration compared with control organisms. Distinct bioaccumulation patterns and uptake rates were observed depending on the exposure concentrations. For low PCB- 153 exposure levels (0. 25 μg L 1), accumulation followed a saturation model, reaching an apparent steady state after fifteen days exposure. For intermediate (2. 5 μg L 1) and high PCB- 153 levels (25 μg L 1), accumulation was faster and linear. In addition, the bioaccumulation rate was not proportional to PCB- 153 concentration, and the bioaccumulation was higher at intermediate exposure concentrations. Regarding the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> P. varians lost up to 30 % of PCB- 153 after 72 h and levels continued slowly to decrease {{until the end of the}} 30 -d experimental period.

The prawns were exposed to two scenarios: cadmium in water only; and exposure to metal-rich mine tailings in the same water. The cadmium accumulation from the dissolved exposure during 7 days, followed by depuration in cadmium-free water for 7 days, was compared with predictions from a biokinetic model {{that had previously been}} developed for M. australiense. M. australiense and M. latidactylus accumulated significant tissue cadmium during the exposure phase, albeit with different uptake rates. All three species retained > 95 % of the bioaccumulated cadmium during the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> indicating very slow efflux rates. Following exposure to tailings, there were significant (p< 0. 05) differences in tissue arsenic, cadmium, lead and zinc concentrations among species. Cadmium and zinc concentrations were increased relative to controls for all three species but were not different between treatments (direct/indirect contact with tailings), suggesting these metals were primarily accumulated via the dissolved phase. All species bioaccumulated significantly greater arsenic and lead when in direct contact with mine tailings, demonstrating the importance of an ingestion pathway for these metals. Copper was not bioaccumulated above control concentrations for any species. The differences between the metal accumulation of the three prawns indicated that a biokinetic model of cadmium bioaccumulation for M. australiense could potentially be used to describe the metal bioaccumulation of the other two prawn species, albeit with an over-prediction of 3 - 9 times.

First-order linear differential equations {{were set up}} for five tissue compartments: Viscera, gill, hepatopancreas, adductor muscle, and foot. The solutions to these equations were used to fit the experimental data. We then estimated the parameters governing the model, which depend on the elimination rate from each compartment and the transfer coefficient between compartments. An assumption of the model is that the gills transport the dinoflagellates directly to the mouth {{and then to the}} viscera, where the ingested cells are broken down, releasing the toxins. The toxins absorbed are transferred to other tissues. During the uptake phase, the transfer coefficients from viscera to gill, hepatopancreas, adductor muscle, and foot were 0. 03, 0. 24, 0. 01, and 0. 004 per day, respectively. During the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase,</b> the transfer coefficients were 0. 01, 0, 0. 01, and 0. 003 per day, respectively. In terms of the anatomical distribution of N-sulfocarbamoyl- 11 -hydroxysulfate (C 2) toxins in various tissues, viscera and hepatopancreas contained the highest percentages (47 – 74 % and 8 – 41 %, respectively). Together, these two tissue compartments accounted for 71 to 96 % of all C 2 toxins present.

Liquid chromatography ultra-high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry was explored as a tool to identify and quantify phase II pharmaceutical metabolites in reclaimed water. The resulting data confirmed the presence of acetyl-sulfamethoxazole and sulfamethoxazole glucuronide in reclaimed water. To my knowledge, this is the first known report of sulfamethoxazole glucuronide surviving intact through wastewater treatment plants and occurring in environmental water samples. ^ Finally, five bioaccumulative pharmaceuticals including caffeine, carbamazepine, diltiazem, diphenhydramine and ibuprofen detected in reclaimed water were investigated regarding the acute and chronic risks to aquatic organisms. The results indicated a low potential risk of carbamazepine even under the worst case exposure scenario. Given the dilution factors that affect environmental releases, the risk of exposure to carbamazepine will be even more reduced. ...|$|E

During the exposure phase (3 months), juvenile snails were subjected to three different concentrations of Cd spiked in artificial ISO soil (ISO 0, 20 and 100 mg Cd kg(- 1)) and to a field soil (ME 4) industrially contaminated by 20 mg Cd kg (- 1). For both soils, internal steady-state Cd concentrations were reached in the viscera of the snails, the main storage organ for Cd, after 2 weeks of exposure whatever the Cd concentration in soil. The equilibrium concentrations in the viscera were 0. 7 (+/- 0. 1), 11. 3 (+/- 2. 4), 73. 3 (+/- 4. 8) and 6. 3 (+/- 1. 3) mg Cd kg(- 1) dry mass for ISO 0, ISO 20, ISO 100 and ME 4, respectively. During the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase</b> (3 months), from 0 to 52 % of the accumulated Cd in the viscera were removed by excretion or relocation in the foot. However, the snails {{were not able to}} depurate down to initial concentrations. Data were modelled by integrating a specific growth rate constant into one-compartment toxicokinetic models. This allowed the calculation of Cd uptake rates that can be used as indicators of metal bioavailability. Since this parameter was found to be lower for snails exposed to the field soil ME 4, we concluded that lower Cd bioavailability in this field soil was responsible of the lower transfer to the snails compared to the ISO 20 soil, even though they were polluted to similar extents. Internal validation showed that the toxicokinetic models could be applied for predictive purposes, promising {{for the development of a}} bioaccumulation directive for terrestrial environment...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Interpreting proteomic and {{genomic data}} {{is a major}} {{challenge}} in predictive ecotoxicology that can be addressed by a systems biology approach. Mathematical modeling provides an organizational platform to consolidate protein dynamics with possible genomic regulation. Here, a model of ovarian steroidogenesis in the fathead minnow, Pimephales promelas, (FHM) is developed to evaluate possible transcriptional regulation of steroid production observed in microarray studies. Results The model was developed from literature sources, integrating key signaling components (G-protein and PKA activation) with their ensuing effect on steroid production. The model properly predicted trajectory behavior of estradiol and testosterone when fish were exposed to fadrozole, a specific aromatase inhibitor, but failed to predict the steroid hormone behavior occurring one week post-exposure {{as well as the}} increase in steroid levels when the stressor was removed. In vivo microarray data implicated three modes of regulation which may account for over-production of steroids during a <b>depuration</b> <b>phase</b> (when the stressor is removed) : P 450 enzyme up-regulation, inhibin down-regulation, and luteinizing hormone receptor up-regulation. Simulation studies and sensitivity analysis were used to evaluate each case as possible source of compensation to endocrine stress. Conclusions Simulation studies of the testosterone and estradiol response to regulation observed in microarray data supported the hypothesis that the FHM steroidogenesis network compensated for endocrine stress by modulating the sensitivity of the ovarian network to global cues coming from the hypothalamus and pituitary. Model predictions of luteinizing hormone receptor regulation were consistent with depuration and in vitro data. These results challenge the traditional approach to network elucidation in systems biology. Generally, the most sensitive interactions in a network are targeted for further elucidation but microarray evidence shows that homeostatic regulation of the steroidogenic network is likely maintained by a mildly sensitive interaction. We hypothesize that effective network elucidation must consider both the sensitivity of the target as well as the target's robustness to biological noise (in this case, to cross-talk) when identifying possible points of regulation. </p...|$|E
40|$|A {{local strain}} of the dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense (ATC 101), which {{predominantly}} produces C 2 toxin, was fed to the clams (Ruditapes philippinarum) under laboratory conditions. Concentrations of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in the dosed clams were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analyses, and the clams were homogenized and then fed to the gastropods (Nassarius festivus). In the toxin accumulation phase, which lasted for 42 days, concentrations of PSTs increased in the snails gradually, reaching a maximum of 1. 10 nmole g(- 1) {{at the end of}} the exposure period. The toxin content of the homogenized clams (food) was 13. 18 nmole g(- 1), which was about 12 -fold higher than the PST content in the snails. Between day 43 and day 82, the snails were fed with non-toxic clams, and this period represented the <b>depuration</b> <b>phase.</b> Accumulation and depuration rates of PSTs in the snails, N. festivus, were determined by fitting the experimental data to user-defined parameters program using a one-compartment model. Two different modeling approaches were used to derive the accumulation and depuration rates. The first approach is to derive both values from the data for the toxin uptake. The second approach is to derive deputation rate from the depuration data and then to derive uptake rate, allowing for toxin depuration, from the data for toxin uptake. The first approach yielded more consistent results for the toxin concentration {{at the end of the}} uptake period, when compared with the experimental data. The toxin uptake and depuration rates were 1. 64 (pmole of toxin into snail per day) per (nmole g(- 1) of toxin in food) and 0. 06 +/- 0. 02 day(- 1) (mean +/- SE), respectively. The toxin profiles of snails were similar to the clams, but different from the algae. Besides C toxins (C 1 and C 2), dcGTX 2 and dcGTX 3 were also detected in both clams and snails. The beta:alpha epimer ratio gradually decreased during trophic transfer and approached a ratio of 1 : 3 (26. 4 mol%: 73. 6 mol% at day 42) in the snails, near the end of the accumulation period.

40|$|A {{variety of}} human enteropathogens, {{including}} viruses, bacteria, and parasites, {{have been shown}} to bioaccumulate in suspension-feeding bivalve shellfish. Cryptosporidium parvum is a zoonotic protozoan parasite that has been detected in many shellfish species within both fecally contaminated and clean oyster growing areas across the globe. For this study, C. parvum oocysts (1000 and 10, 000) were spiked into 10 L of water in static tank systems housing Crassostrea virginica. Oysters were either held in the contaminated aquaria for 7 days of exposure or were exposed for 24 h and subsequently placed in a clean static tank system {{for the remainder of the}} trial. Individual oysters, fecal material, and tank water were analyzed for oocysts up to 7 days post-exposure via direct immunofluorescence. Oysters held under chronic exposure conditions gradually accumulated oocysts (1. 5 or 34. 4 oocysts/oyster/day for low or high dose exposure groups, respectively) between days 1 and 7, with an exponential uptake in oocysts observed within the first 24 h post-exposure (mean uptake of 29. 6 or 241. 9 oocysts/oyster, respectively). Oysters that were transferred to clean water after 24 h were capable of slowly depurating oocysts, following a linear trend. During chronic exposure trials 48 – 49 % of the total spiked inoculum was recovered from oyster tissue, whereas 4. 8 – 5. 9 % and 38 – 40 % was recovered from tank water and from fecal material at day 7, respectively. In acute exposure trials, 30 – 31 % of the total tank inoculum was found in oysters, suggesting that chronically exposed oysters were likely re-filtering some oocysts. Examinations of oyster fecal material from acute exposures revealed that 72 – 82 % of oocysts recovered were already excreted at the time of oyster transfer (day 1), with only 18 – 28 % being excreted during the static <b>depuration</b> <b>phase.</b> These data support that although most C. parvum oocysts are removed by C. virginica oysters within 24 h, elimination after this point occurs slowly. Additionally, chronic exposures demonstrate that wild or cultured oysters in saline environments that are frequently exposed to sources of Cryptosporidium may be unable to eliminate the parasites at a rate that balances initial uptake...|$|E
40|$|Estrogen hormones, or {{compounds}} that mimic them (xenoestrogens), {{are found in}} surface waters worldwide mainly due to discharges to the environment from anthropogenic sources, such as sewage treatment plant (STP) effluents. Fish are adversely affected by these xenoestrogens {{in the areas of}} reproduction, growth, immune function and offspring fitness. To identify and explore the effects of xenoestrogens on salmonids, a series of toxicological studies were performed using comprehensive panels of assays evaluating immune, osmoregulatory, hematological, metabolic, reproductive and endocrine-related parameters in response to xenoestrogen- and STP effluent-exposures. Most studies included a post-treatment <b>depuration</b> <b>phase</b> to determine recovery timeframes of altered parameters. In male or juvenile fish, xenoestrogens are known to induce vitellogenesis, the mature female-related process of making eggs under estrogen receptor (ER) control that is initiated by the hepatic production of egg proteins, vitellogenin (VTG) and vitelline envelope proteins (VEPs). In three studies, induction of liver somatic index (LSI), plasma VTG protein or hepatic gene transcripts (ERs, VTG and VEPs) were found due to exposure to a tertiary-treated STP effluent, a synthetic wastewater, and estrogen hormones. In Rainbow trout exposed to xenoestrogens, LSI and transcripts recovered to baseline values after treatments ceased, while VTG protein concentrations remained elevated through recovery phases. Thus, gene expression alterations were only useful as indicators of existing exposure, while VTG protein levels were indicative of both present and prior exposure. Xenoestrogens affected several immune system functions, including reduced leukocyte counts, potentially increasing susceptibility to pathogens. Isolated leukocytes from head kidney and peripheral blood contained ERα and ERβ transcripts, although only ERα 1 and ERα 2 were altered by xenoestrogen exposure, providing a direct mechanistic pathway for xenoestrogen modulation of the immune system. Reductions in burst swimming performance were found in Rainbow trout exposed to xenoestrogens, with potential mechanisms suggested involving altered osmoregulation (evidenced by reduced chloride ions) and decreased blood oxygen carrying capacity via a reduction in red blood cell counts. Overall, most but not all altered parameters recovered from exposure to xenoestrogens, and the adverse effects of environmentally-relevant concentrations of xenoestrogens on many biological functions showed that xenoestrogens pose a hazard to wild juvenile fish...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} microalgae to develop stable, long-term resistance to herbicides, the marine microalga Tetraselmis suecica was exposed to the herbicide diuron (5 µg/L) for a 43 -generation exposure period followed by a 12 -generation <b>depuration</b> <b>phase.</b> During the first 25 generations, diuron-exposed cultures showed doubling times ranging from 1. 95 to 2. 6 days, which was 2 to 2. 5 -fold longer than control cultures. Between generations 25 and 38, during diuron exposure, two out of the three exposed cultures exhibited a spontaneous drop in doubling time. These results provided evidence of culture adaptation to diuron. To assess persistence of the diuron adaptation observed on growth performance, one of the adapted cultures (D 3) was maintained for 12 months in unexposed conditions and then tested by a second, short-term exposure to diuron 5 µg/L, in parallel with a control culture (C 1) for six generations. Flow cytometry analyses were used to monitor cell density, viability, morphology, relative chlorophyll content and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level. Under these conditions, diuron induced a strong increase of doubling time in exposed-C 1 cultures (2. 5 -fold longer than unexposed-C 1 cultures), but no significant increase occurred in exposed D 3 -cultures compared with unexposed D 3 - and unexposed C 1 -cultures, showing the persistence of adaptation in the previously-exposed strain D 3. Intracellular ROS level showed the same trend. Significant differences were observed between these strains, with weaker effects of diuron on strain D 3 compared with strain C 1 : forward scatter (FSC), representing relative cell size, decreased in exposed cultures (67. 8 % and 95 % of the controls for C 1 and D 3, respectively), whereas FL 3 as relative chlorophyll content increased in exposed cultures (115. 6 % and 108. 6 % of the controls for C 1 and D 3, respectively). Results of second exposure to diuron revealed that the adaptation of strain D 3 had persisted after 12 months of depuration, as no growth impairment was observed. This study demonstrates the possible appearance of stable diuron resistance in microalgae in cases of strong, multigenerational chronic exposure to this herbicide in polluted environments...|$|E
40|$|Among the {{diversity}} of contaminants, trace elements (TEs) remain of concern because of their persistence, their ability to accumulate in biota and their toxicity. The direct measurement of their dissolved concentrations only gives punctual and fluctuating information, and often remains below detection limits of analytical methods. The more appropriate use of sentinel organisms, or bioindicators, to monitor TEs has thus often been preferred in environmental surveys. The introduction of the diffusive gradients in thin films (DGTs) technique has however participated to progressively change this binary view - bioindicator vs water - of the coastal monitoring of TEs, and DGTs rapidly became a relevant complementary tool to bioindicators, has illustrated below. In {{the framework of the}} STARECAPMED project, the ecology and the ecotoxicology of TEs were studied in the seagrass Posidonia oceanica (L.) Delile and the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis Lamarck, 1819. DGTs (free- and pore-water probes) were deployed before sampling of organisms. TEs were also analyzed in suspended matter (dissolved and suspended-particulate TE speciation). Studies were performed in the Calvi Bay (Corsica, France), northwestern Mediterranean. TE concentrations in organisms and suspended matter or in DGT resins were measured by DRC-ICP-MS after HNO 3 /H 202 mineralization or after a 24 h elution in HNO 3 1 M, respectively. (1) TE bioaccumulation was first seasonally studied in P. oceanica over 3 years. Dissolved TE concentrations monitored with DGTs were low to very low. TE bioaccumulation dynamics in P. oceanica could thus be linked to the natural physiological cycle of the plant, in clean environmental conditions. (2) To complement that field survey, isolated seagrasses were in situ contaminated with TEs at environmental relevant concentrations. Through the use of DGTs, TE uptake kinetics were modelled for seagrasses exposed to know bioavailable concentrations of contaminants, as were loss kinetics during the following <b>depuration</b> <b>phase.</b> The TE sequestration ability of a healthy P. oceanica meadow facing sudden trace metal contamination events could also be quantified. (3) The deployment of pore-water DGT probes in bare-sand or seagrass colonized sediments further showed that, through its stabilizing function of the seabed, P. oceanica maintained higher TE levels in the pore-water. P. oceanica meadows thus offer a significant “depuration-filtering” ecological service along highly anthropized Mediterranean coasts. M. galloprovincialis are widely used in large spatial scale coastal monitoring surveys. (4) The deployment of caged mussels together with DGTs showed that the little contaminated water body of the Calvi Bay was relatively homogenous. It also allowed to calculate TE bioaccumulation towards mussels in reference conditions, and to compare it to native mussel populations. (5) Finally, during a 5 months mussel caging survey, mussels and suspended matter were collected weekly to monthly, such as were deployed DGTs. The physiological status of mussels, the speciation of TEs between their dissolved and suspended-particulate phases, and their relative influence on TE bioaccumulation dynamics in mussels were investigated. In conclusion, these case studies properly demonstrate how DGT probes {{can be used as a}} relevant and complementary tool to bioindicators. Their concomitant use should therefore be privileged in monitoring surveys. Peer reviewe...|$|E
