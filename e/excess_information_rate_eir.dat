50|$|Services in {{the data}} network are {{typically}} classified into 2 major categories: Committed Information Rate (CIR) and <b>Excess</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Rate</b> (<b>EIR).</b> A CIR service guarantees its user a fixed amount of bandwidth, whereas an EIR service offers best-effort only transport.

Various studies have sought to provide network providers the necessary formulas for adequately pricing such a tiered service for their customer base. But while network neutrality is primarily focused on protocol based provisioning, most of the pricing models are based on bandwidth restrictions.|$|R

The provider guarantees that the connection will always support the CIR rate, and sometimes the EIR rate provided that there is adequate bandwidth. The PIR, i.e. the CIR plus EIR, is either equal to or less than the speed of the access port into the network. Frame relay carriers define and package CIRs differently, and CIRs are adjusted with experience.|$|E

Its simplicity, scalability, and inexpensiveness {{have made it}} an {{attractive}} technology for enterprises to interconnect their metro area networks (MANs). Today, Carrier Ethernet can span over 10, 000 km. Ethernet Services were created to enable companies to distribute their own services through the carrier-grade network. All the data that enters the Carrier Ethernet network (CEN) is policed by the CEN provider based on the service level agreement (SLA). Among the QoS attributes that are agreed upon is the packet loss rate (PLR) guarantee, committed information rate (CIR) and <b>excess</b> <b>information</b> <b>rate</b> (<b>EIR).</b> In this work we study the relation between PLR and throughput performance. This relationship can then be used to increase the throughput performance of the Ethernet Services transport protocol (ESTP). It achieves this by configuring an ESTP parameter that allows the CEN provider to increase the user’s throughput {{at the cost of}} PLR or vice versa. This increase is done while main maintaining the throughput above the CIR and below the EIR using only transport-layer algorithms...|$|E

40|$|Identifying the {{determinants}} of neuronal energy consumption {{and their relationship to}} information coding is critical to understanding neuronal function and evolution. Three of the main determinants are cell size, ion channel density, and stimulus statistics. Here we investigate their impact on neuronal energy consumption and information coding by comparing single-compartment spiking neuron models of different sizes with different densities of stochastic voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels and different statistics of synaptic inputs. The largest compartments have the highest <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> but the lowest energy efficiency for a given voltage-gated ion channel density, and the highest signaling efficiency (bits spike(- 1)) for a given firing rate. For a given cell size, our models revealed that the ion channel density that maximizes energy efficiency is lower than that maximizing <b>information</b> <b>rate.</b> Low rates of small synaptic inputs improve energy efficiency but the highest <b>information</b> <b>rates</b> occur with higher rates and larger inputs. These relationships produce a Law of Diminishing Returns that penalizes costly <b>excess</b> <b>information</b> coding capacity, promoting the reduction of cell size, channel density, and input stimuli to the minimum possible, suggesting that the trade-off between energy and information has influenced all aspects of neuronal anatomy and physiology...|$|R

The EIR is then calculated as the product of 1) the potential of individual vectors to transmit malaria during their lifetime, 2) vector emergence rate relative to human population size, and 3) the infectiousness of the human population to vectors. Thus, impacts on more than one of these parameters will amplify each other’s effects. The EIRs transmitted by the dominant vector species at fou...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Past {{experience}} and modelling suggest that, in most cases, mass treatment strategies {{are not likely}} to succeed in interrupting Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission. However, this does not preclude their use to reduce disease burden. Mass screening and treatment (MSAT) is preferred to mass drug administration (MDA), as the latter involves massive over-use of drugs. This paper reports simulations of the incremental cost-effectiveness of well-conducted MSAT campaigns as a strategy for P. falciparum malaria disease-burden reduction in settings with varying receptivity (ability of the combined vector population in a setting to transmit disease) and access to case management. Methods MSAT incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were estimated in different sub-Saharan African settings using simulation models of the dynamics of malaria and a literature-based MSAT cost estimate. Imported infections were simulated at a rate of two per 1, 000 population per annum. These estimates were compared to the ICERs of scaling up case management or insecticide-treated net (ITN) coverage in each baseline health system, in the absence of MSAT. Results MSAT averted most episodes, and resulted in the lowest ICERs, in settings with a moderate level of disease burden. At a low pre-intervention entomological inoculation <b>rate</b> (<b>EIR)</b> of two infectious bites per adult per annum (IBPAPA) MSAT was never more cost-effective than scaling up ITNs or case management coverage. However, at pre-intervention entomological inoculation <b>rates</b> (<b>EIRs)</b> of 20 and 50 IBPAPA and ITN coverage levels of 40 or 60 %, respectively, the ICER of MSAT was similar to that of scaling up ITN coverage further. Conclusions In all the transmission settings considered, achieving a minimal level of ITN coverage is a “best buy”. At low transmission, MSAT probably is not worth considering. Instead, MSAT may be suitable at medium to high levels of transmission and at moderate ITN coverage. If undertaken as a burden-reducing intervention, MSAT should be continued indefinitely and should complement, not replace, case management and vector control interventions. </p...|$|R

In {{areas of}} intense malaria {{parasite}} transmission, preliminary {{studies of the}} rate of reinfection after curative therapy suggest that small sample size studies of vaccine efficacy are feasible. However, the effect of transmis-sion rate, which may vary considerably between transmission seasons, on reinfection rate has not been assessed in areas of mesoendemicity with seasonal transmission. To address this question, the Plasmodium falciparum reinfection rate after curative therapy was measured in Sotuba, a Malian village with historically low transmission rates, as estimated by the entomological inoculation <b>rate</b> (<b>EIR).</b> The reinfection <b>rate</b> after curative Fansidar (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) treatment was 80. 7 % (88 / 109). The EIR during the 13 -week study period (seasonal transmission) varied between 1 and 4. 5 infected bites/person/month. The finding that reinfection rates were high despite low EIRs suggests that a low EIR may be sufficient to support small sample size vaccine efficacy trials in mesoendemic areas...|$|R
