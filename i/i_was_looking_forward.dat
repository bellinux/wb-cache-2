500|$|... "Not Pictured" [...] {{would mark}} the final {{appearance}} by series regular Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start to think that I was responsible for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E
500|$|Vergne {{argued that}} he could have won the race had he not been {{observed}} speeding in the pit lane which he attributed to a defective speed limit button. Describing the situation as [...] "extremely frustrating" [...] he said: [...] "I was quicker than Rosenqvist and Buemi was quite far behind. Then the energy he would have spent to catch me, he would have had no extra energy to pass." [...] Mahindra team principal Dilbagh Gill agreed that Buemi's presence would have delayed Vergne, or caused him to use more additional electrical energy, and felt Rosenqvist {{would have been able to}} fend off a challenge from Vergne. Engel was disappointed not to finish the event; he claimed he would have secured a top-ten finishing position had problems not affected his car. He revealed his team had changed his vehicle's battery in the morning: [...] "Our race pace was strong and the energy management was good so <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to the second stint but it never really came." [...] e.Dams-Renault team principal Jean-Paul Driot revealed that Buemi's five-place grid penalty had been a sporting regulation safety violation, which they had no control over, and believed two wires became detached after Buemi ran over a kerb in qualifying.|$|E

2500|$|However, Frank Rizzo of courant.com {{reported}} on March 12, 2011 {{that the film}} with Streisand [...] "is not going to happen, according to playwright-director Arthur Laurents, one of the rights holders to the work." [...] But that was contradicted by an August 2011 report by USA TODAY that the plans for a film adaptation of Gypsy were still intact. [...] "Before writer and director Arthur Laurents died at age 93 last May, there had been much talk about a movie version of Gypsy starring Streisand as Rose. 'We just have to find our team and a writer,' said Streisand. 'It's too bad, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to working with Arthur,' who directed Streisand in her Broadway debut. 'I had seen him {{a few months before}} that, and he seemed so strong and healthy.|$|E
2500|$|In July, Feige {{discussed}} specific {{moments in}} the film, including an homage to The Amazing Spider-Man issue 33 where Parker is trapped underneath rubble, something Feige [...] "wanted {{to see in a}} movie for a long, long time". Daley said that they added the scene to the script because of how much Feige wanted it, and explained, [...] "We have [...] starting the scene with such self-doubt and helplessness, in a way that you really see the kid. You feel for him. He's screaming for help, because he doesn't think he can do it, and then ... he kind of realizes that that's been his biggest problem." [...] Feige compared the film's final scene, where Parker accidentally reveals that he is Spider-Man to his Aunt May, to the ending of Iron Man when Stark reveals that he is Iron Man to the world, saying, [...] "what does that mean for the next movie? I don't know, but it will force us to do something unique." [...] Goldstein added that it [...] "diminishes what is often the most trivial part of superhero worlds, which is finding your secret. It takes the emphasis off that [...] lets her become part of what's really his life". Feige also talked about the film's revelation that the Vulture is the father of Parker's love interest, saying, [...] "If that didn't work, the movie didn't work. We worked backwards and forwards from that moment. It was like two movies—it was the movie up until then and the movie after that moment. Because it had to surprise you, but it had to be true, also. You had to believe that we had set it up so that you would buy it [...] doesn't seem like something out of left field. That's a pretty great moment and we didn't know until we showed it to audiences" [...] that it would work. Watts said the revelation scene and the following interactions between the Vulture and Parker were, [...] "more than anything else, [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to, and I got {{to have a lot of}} fun shooting that stuff." [...] Goldstein said the scene after the reveal, where Vulture realizes that Parker is Spider-Man while driving him to the school dance, was the moment he was most proud of in the film, and Daley said that scene's effect on audiences was the dramatic equivalent of an audience laughing at a joke they had written. He added that the writers were [...] "giddy when we first came up with , because it's taking the obvious tension of meeting the father of the girl that you have a crush on, and multiplying it by 1,000, when you also realize he's the guy you've been trying to stop the whole time." ...|$|E

60|$|Pettigrew smokes {{more quickly}} than I do, and he had {{reached the end of}} his second cigar when there was still five minutes of mine left. It distresses me to have to say what followed. He hastily lighted a third cigar, and then, {{unlocking}} a cupboard, produced about two ounces of his garden tobacco. His object was only too plain. Having just begun a third cigar he could not be expected to try the tobacco at present, but there was nothing to prevent my trying it. I regarded Pettigrew rather contemptuously, and then I looked with much interest at the tobacco. It was of an inky color. When I looked up I caught Pettigrew's eye on me. He withdrew it hurriedly, but soon afterward I saw him looking in the same sly way again. There was a rather painful silence for a time, and then he asked me if I had anything to say. I replied firmly that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to trying the tobacco with very great interest. By this time my cigar was reduced to a stump, but, for reasons that Pettigrew misunderstood, I continued to smoke it. Somehow our chairs had got out of position now, and we were sitting with our backs to each other. I felt that Pettigrew was looking at me covertly over his shoulder, and took a side glance to make sure of this. Our eyes met, and I bit my lip. If there is one thing I loathe, it is to be looked at in this shame-faced manner.|$|E
60|$|LADY UTTERWORD [sitting {{down with}} a flounce on the sofa]. I know what you must feel. Oh, this house, this house! I come back to it after twenty-three years; {{and it is just}} the same: the luggage lying on the steps, the {{servants}} spoilt and impossible, nobody at home to receive anybody, no regular meals, nobody ever hungry because they are always gnawing bread and butter or munching apples, and, what is worse, the same disorder in ideas, in talk, in feeling. When I was a child I was used to it: I had never known anything better, though I was unhappy, and longed all the time--oh, how I longed!--to be respectable, to be a lady, to live as others did, not to have to think of everything for myself. I married at nineteen to escape from it. My husband is Sir Hastings Utterword, who has been governor of all the crown colonies in succession. I have always been the mistress of Government House. I have been so happy: I had forgotten that people could live like this. I wanted to see my father, my sister, my nephews and nieces (one ought to, you know), and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>looking</b> <b>forward</b> to it. And now the state of the house! the way I'm received! the casual impudence of that woman Guinness, our old nurse! really Hesione might at least have been here: some preparation might have been made for me. You must excuse my going on in this way; but I am really very much hurt and annoyed and disillusioned: and if I had realized it was to be like this, I wouldn't have come. I have a great mind to go away without another word [she is on the point of weeping].|$|E
