50|$|In 1902, {{during the}} Second Boer War, the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) of the invading British forces {{experienced}} {{a shortage of}} locomotives {{as a result of}} <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> hostilities and the transportation demands which were placed on the Railways by the British Military.|$|R
50|$|Recently, other {{researchers}} (Marchese-Ragona et al.) {{have argued that}} tracheal compression caused by a goitre put an early end to Galli-Curci's career as a coloratura soprano, but it was nerve <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> surgery that prevented her from prolonging her career as lyric or dramatic soprano.|$|R
50|$|Because of the <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> {{hostilities}} and {{the transportation}} {{demands of the}} British armed forces, a shortage of locomotives developed. In 1900, the IMR placed an order with Neilson, Reid and Company for 25 Cape 7th Class locomotives which were numbered {{in the range from}} 106 to 130 upon delivery.|$|R
50|$|Wafers are cleaned {{with weak}} acids to remove {{unwanted}} particles, or repair <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> the sawing process. When used for solar cells, the wafers are textured {{to create a}} rough surface to increase their efficiency.

The Agency of Cultural Affairs conducted a survey of the building, and on June 21, 1962, Nikolai-do became a, Nationally Designated Important Culltural Property (Kokutei jyuyou bunkazai).|$|R
50|$|World War I {{had caused}} a {{complete}} and utter suspension of telecommunications in Belgium. One {{of the reasons for}} this was the financial dependency of the public company. The <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> the war and the dismantling of parts of the networks meant that colossal investments were needed to manage the telegraphs and telephones.|$|R
50|$|In World War II, {{as he was}} too old {{for active}} service, Hepworth served in the Home Guard.

This committee was chaired by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was a good friend of Hepworth.|$|R
50|$|The <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> World War II was {{repaired}} concurrently {{alongside the}} archaeological excavations; the repair work was finished by 1950. The reconstruction work, led by local architect Max H.

50|$|The initial {{official}} pronouncements said 276 {{people had}} died but many estimates {{put the number}} at above 2,000. Shortages of coffins were reported and many Venezuelans had to line up at government food distribution centers since markets were destroyed by rioters. Insurance estimates of <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> the rioting were $90 million CAD ($120 million 2017 USD).|$|R
50|$|The British {{government}} demanded immediate {{compensation for}} the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company. However, the company had been founded as a Mexican company under Mexican law. Therefore, the British government couldn’t intervene directly in the company’s favor. Diplomatic relations between the countries were soon broken, but not before Mexico paid a debt claimed by the British government for <b>damages</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> the Mexican Revolution.|$|R

40|$|Although legal {{restrictions}} {{limiting the}} workers? liability {{are made to}} increase their welfare, we show that they {{may lead to a}} perverse effect when more productive workers cross subsidize less productive workers.

50|$|Built in 1631, it was {{originally}} intended as a Protestant place of worship, but became Catholic in 1654. A major construction makeover occurred a year later, in 1655. The tower of the church, located on the west side, had an upper stage in late baroque added (1754-1788). Further changes took place in 1936 and 1949, the latter being in desperate need, due to <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> World War II. At this time, the church was renovated with a more contemporary style.|$|R

25|$|A {{hall was}} built on the estate in the 16th century though the exact dates are unknown, this was {{demolished}} in 1755 and a new hall erected in the same location designed by James Denstone of Derby. In 1964 Markeaton Hall was demolished due to neglect and structural <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> the army's stay there. The only remnants of the original hall are the late 18th-century Grade II listed orangery that is used as a café, a number of walled gardens and ornamental gardens such as the formal terrace, the Rose Garden and herbaceous borders.|$|R

50|$|The first {{courthouse}} in Greenville was built {{when the new}} town became the county seat in 1847. The town was moved northward due to recurring flooding and <b>damage</b> <b>caused</b> <b>during</b> the Civial War. A new courthouse was built near the corner of Poplar and Nelson Streets. That building {{was replaced by the}} current two and a half-story building, constructed in 1891 and opened in 1892. It was modified in 1930, 1950, 1965 and 1976, tripling its original size.
