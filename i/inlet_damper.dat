40|$|A CFD {{model of}} the Line 2 Primary Cooling Fan (3 A) has been {{developed}} and demonstrated {{to be capable of}} reproducing the fan curve as supplied with the fan. The effect of air temperature and <b>inlet</b> <b>damper</b> position have been simulated and used to produce a series of flow-pressure curves for the unit as it operates in the plant. The plant fan model appears capable of reproducing the air survey velocity pressure profiles measured on July 11, 2006. The United Taconite CFD Cooler Model was then used to develop a family of system resistance curves based on cooler operating parameters. The fan and system resistance curves, when combined, allow the fan operating point to be defined, from which flow can be predicted. Several linear models were developed and then used to predict plant performance, using the July 11, 2006, operating point. The predictions fall within 8 % on a volume flow basis, within 6 % on a mass basis. Additional operating points are needed to demonstrate the model's predictive capability over a flow range. Based on the results in this report, it appears possible that an on-line flow prediction model could be developed with additional research...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 45 - 56 Induced draft (ID) fan systems {{often use}} louvers or {{variable}} {{inlet guide vanes}} to control the flow of exhaust through the fans. An ID fan system can be made more efficient by using a variable frequency drive (VFD) to control the fan speed, which controls the air flow without adding restrictions to the flow path. To reduce energy costs, many companies are using more VFDs. This paper discusses how a VFD was the source of high torsional vibration in a motor/ID fan system operating a sufficient margin away from the torsional natural frequencies. This type of system instability is not a classical torsional resonance and would be difficult to predict in the design stage. As a result of the high torsional vibration, several couplings were damaged and a motor shaft experienced a fatigue failure before the problem could be clearly identified and solved. Two different fan systems at the refinery were tested and shown to exhibit similar torsional behavior, although only one of these systems actually failed. Test data showed that the dynamic torque in the couplings was excessive when the original VFD was operated at electrical frequencies above the first torsional natural frequency of the system (21 to 28. 5 Hz depending on the fan and coupling arrangement). Within the normal operating speed range, there was continual reversing torque, which is considered unacceptable for centrifugal equipment. To demonstrate that the VFD was the source of the excitation, the VFD was reconfigured as a soft starter so that it could be bypassed and the fan could ten be operated at constant speed using <b>inlet</b> <b>damper</b> control. When operating across-the-line without the VFD, the dynamic torque was significantly reduced (approximately 10 percent of the motor rated torque). After the test results were reviewed, a new VFD was developed and installed by the manufacturer to prevent the problem from reoccurring within the normal operating speed range. Final measurements are presented that show significant reduction in dynamic torque after the drive modifications were implemented...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} a {{two and a}} {{three-dimensional}} low speed turbulent boundary layer were conducted on the side wall of a boundary layer wind tunnel. The 20 ft. long test section, with a rectangular cross section measuring 17. 5 in. x 46 in., produced a 3. 5 in. thick turbulent boundary layer at a free stream Reynolds number. The three-dimensional turbulent boundary layer was produced by a 30 deg swept wing-like model faired into the side wall of the test section. Preliminary studies in the two-dimensional boundary layer indicated that the flow was nonuniform on the 46 in. wide test wall. The nonuniform boundary layer is characterized by transverse variations in the wall shear stress and is primarily caused by nonuniformities in the <b>inlet</b> <b>damping</b> screens...|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed {{to predict the}} suppression of rotating stall in a centrifugal compressor with a vaned diffuser. This model {{is based on the}} employment of a control vortical waveform generated upstream of the impeller <b>inlet</b> to <b>damp</b> weak potential disturbances that are the early stages of rotating stall. The control system is analyzed by matching the perturbation pressure in the compressor inlet and exit flow fields with a model for the unsteady behavior of the compressor. The model was effective at predicting the stalling behavior of the Purdue Low Speed Centrifugal Compressor for two distinctly different stall patterns. Predictions made for the effect of a controlled inlet vorticity wave on the stability of the compressor show that for minimum control wave magnitudes, on the order of the total inlet disturbance magnitude, significant damping of the instability can be achieved. For control waves of sufficient amplitude, the control phase angle appears {{to be the most important}} factor in maintaining a stable condition in the compressor...|$|R
40|$|Large-eddy {{simulations}} of a spatially-evolving turbulent mixing layer have been performed. The flow conditions correspond {{to those of}} a documented experimental campaign (Delville, Appl. Sci. Res. 1994). The flow evolves downstream of a splitter plate separating two fully turbulent boundary layers, with Re_theta = 2900 on the high-speed side and Re_theta = 1200 on the low-speed side. The computational domain starts at {{the trailing edge of}} the splitter plate, where experimental mean velocity profiles are prescribed; white-noise perturbations are superimposed to mimic turbulent fluctuations. The fully compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved by means of a finite-volume method implemented into the in-house code SPARK-LES. The results are mainly checked in terms of the streamwise evolution of the vorticity thickness and averaged velocity profiles. The combined effects of inflow perturbations, numerical accuracy and subgrid-scale model are discussed. It is found that excessive levels of dissipation may <b>damp</b> <b>inlet</b> fluctuations and delay the virtual origin of the turbulent mixing layer. On the other hand, non-dissipative, high-resolution computations provide results that are in much better agreement with experimental data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the damping {{in pressure}} compensated closed centre mobile working hydraulic systems. Both rotational and linear loads are covered and the analysis applies to {{any type of}} pump controller. Only the outlet orifice in the directional valve will provide damping to a pressure compensated system. Design rules are proposed for how the system should be dimensioned {{in order to obtain}} a high damping. The volumes {{on each side of the}} load have a high impact on the damping. In case of a small volume on the <b>inlet</b> side, the <b>damping</b> becomes low. However, the most important thing is to design the outlet orifice area properly. There exists an optimal orifice dimension for maximized damping; both smaller and larger orifice areas give lower damping independently of the volumes. This paper presents a method to dimension the outlet orifice area and the load volumes in order to obtain a desired system damping. Experimental results, which confirm the theoretical expectations, are also presented. The conclusions are that it is possible to obtain a high damping contribution from the outlet orifice if the system is dimensioned correctly. However, the energy efficiency needs to be considered while improving the dampin...|$|R
40|$|Operations and {{maintenance}} continued {{this month at}} the Electric Power Research Institute`s Environmental Control Technology Center. Testing on the 4. 0 MW Pilot Wet FGD unit continued this month with the Trace Element Removal test block (TER) as the Pilot was operated under forced oxidation conditions. With this testing, the mercury measurement (Method 29) studies also continued as investigations into various activated carbons, metal amalgams, and impinger capture solutions were conducted. Following these studies, a brief test of the Pilot High Velocity FGD configuration (PHV) was conducted. This test block will be continued {{at the end of}} the month after the Fall outage is completed. The 1. 0 MW Cold-Side Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) unit remained idle this month in a cold-standby mode. During this month`s outage, the <b>inlet</b> and outlet <b>damper</b> plates were sealed to isolate the SCR system from flue gas. Also, the internals of the heat pipe heat exchanger (HPHE) and catalyst reactor tower were inspected and cleaned so that the system could be available for future test activities. Monthly inspections of all SCR system equipment placed in this cold-standby mode, as well as the fire safety systems in the SCR building, will continue to be conducted by the ECTC maintenance department and will include manual rotation of the booster fan...|$|R
