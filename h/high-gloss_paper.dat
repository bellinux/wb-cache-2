[...] In the English-speaking world, [...] "modern" [...] serif designs like Bodoni are most {{commonly}} used in headings and display uses and in upmarket magazine printing, which is often done on <b>high-gloss</b> <b>paper</b> that retains and sets off the crisp detail of the fine strokes. In Europe, they are more often used in body text.|$|E
50|$|In print, Didone fonts {{are often}} used on <b>high-gloss</b> {{magazine}} <b>paper</b> for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar, on which the paper retains the detail of their high contrast well, and for whose image a crisp, 'European' design of type may be considered appropriate. They are used more often for general-purpose body text, such as book printing, in Europe.|$|R
50|$|As digital font design allows more {{variants}} to {{be created}} faster, an increasingly common development in professional font design {{is the use of}} “grades”: slightly different weights intended for different types of paper and ink, or printing in a different region with different ambient temperature and humidity. For example, a thin design printed on book paper and a thicker design printed on <b>high-gloss</b> magazine <b>paper</b> may come out looking identical, since in the former case the ink will soak and spread out more. Grades are typically offered with characters having the same width on all grades, so that a change of printing materials does not affect copyfit. Grades are especially common on serif fonts with their finer details.|$|R

50|$|The {{magazine}} {{is the most}} specialized paid touch points. in print media. It has many advantages compare to other print media, {{but it could be}} expensive. Magazines are the paid touch points that offer very high-Quality images, <b>high-gloss,</b> heavy <b>paper,</b> elegant and beautiful photos that really attracts the attention of a reader (Ives, 2011). High- quality magazine advertisement boosts the favor-ability by consumers (Appel, 1987). Furthermore, magazines are really highly selective (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013). Each magazine targets a specific demographic (Russel, n.d.) such as sports. By advertising in a sports magazine a company can reach the targeted audience; people who love sports, and can advertise sports related products. In addition to this, magazines are kept for the longest period of time compare to other print media (Fill, et al., 2013). This is because their expiry dates in expanded by their presence in doctor's clinic, beauty salon and other many waiting area (Russel, n.d.). So, it advertises the brand continuously. Additionally, people pay to get magazines (Fill, et al., 2013). This increase the chances for them to go through all the pages increasing the chances for the brand encounter. One more advantage of magazine advertisement is that it easily can become a multi-platform advertising channel (Fill, et al., 2013). Like; consumers reading the magazine (Offline), or consumers reading the magazine online. Online would come under using phones, computers, laptops, tablets and so on to read the magazine on their web page. On the contrary, magazine advertisements do have some disadvantages. For example, magazines are not good for mass advertisement at all (Russel, n.d.), because magazines only target specific demographics. Also, there could be many other advertisements on the magazine. This could cause confusion for consumers to choose between the brands. Additionally, whatever magazine a company chooses for advertisement, it would be expensive (Russel, n.d.). Another problem with magazine advertisement {{is that there is no}} flexibility with the deadline ("The advantages and disadvantages of magazine advertising", 2012). Sometimes a company would have to get the campaign ready two to three months before the publications of the magazine (Fill, et al., 2013). Overall, magazine advertisement could be great for target demographics. Some ways to deals with the disadvantages of magazines advertisements would be to prepare the campaign in well advance so that there would be minimum problems. Secondly, the company should try to make a very creative and attractive campaign in order to break through the clutter and appeal to a reader (Fill, et al., 2013).|$|R
40|$|Manufactured products, such as furniture, {{laminate}} flooring, {{and large}} signs, are very labour intensive, time-consuming, and costly to produce as they require multiple coating and cutting operations {{on a series}} of independent machines, which can each introduce manufacturing errors between the tools and the work piece. By combining the processes of printing and milling, printing integrated manufacturing has the potential to eliminate some of these steps, significantly reduce errors, and preserve resources. Inkjet printing is an ideal method for both image transfer and coating operations due to its non-contact method of directly depositing various types of fluid onto a substrate. With improved positioning accuracy and droplet miniaturisation, inkjet printing could even be used for future applications like the mass-production of MEMS devices, which are traditionally fabricated with a highly complex process involving photolithography. 	This thesis presents the integration of a Xaar 126 inkjet printing system with an existing industrial flatbed CNC router to develop a combined printing and cutting system. This integration required modification to the overall system through mechanical, electrical, and software means to the existing 3 -axis CNC milling system. A secondary z-axis was installed onto the router gantry for positioning of the printheads relative to the substrate, which required development of a separate homing routine to consistently position the printheads to a specified location. Based on the identified frequency response of the machine, a loop-shaping controller was designed for improved y-axis positioning, {{which is one of the}} main contributions to droplet placement accuracy. This resulted in a continuous motion tracking accuracy within ± 20. 2 µm at 250 mm/sec along a print pass (measured by 1. 22 nm resolution linear encoder), which is significantly better than the industrial benchmark of ± 100 µm. 	Extensive image processing and calibration methods were utilised on various substrate preparations of paper, wood, and coatings, to demonstrate the capability of the printing system and quantify the quality of print resolution. Calibration results tested on <b>high-gloss</b> Hewlett-Packard <b>paper</b> showed that the swath angle could be aligned within ± 1 °. Also, bidirectional printing could be used to reduce print time by at least 15 % in multi-colour printing with comparable droplet placement accuracy to unidirectional printing. The inkjet system was successfully used to print custom designs on paper and, to a certain extent, on medium density fibreboard at a feed rate of 250 mm/sec. It was difficult to achieve satisfactory image results on wood, as the wood or paint grain was visible through the ink. Thus, without a white pre-coat, the printed image would appear significantly darker than the original image, even after adjusting the image in a graphics editor. For better quality results, it is recommended that greyscale printheads be implemented for greater resolution and a UV system should be investigated for more versatility in printing on different substrates such as glass, metals, plastics, and ceramics...|$|R
