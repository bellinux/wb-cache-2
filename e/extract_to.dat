5|$|Willow bark {{preparations}} {{became a}} standard {{part of the}} materia medica of Western medicine beginning at least with the Greek physician Hippocrates in the fifth century BC; he recommended chewing on willow bark to relieve pain or fever, and drinking tea made from it to relieve pain during childbirth. The Roman encyclopedist Celsus, in his De Medicina of ca. 30 AD, suggested willow leaf <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> treat the four signs of inflammation: redness, heat, swelling and pain. Willow treatments also appeared in Dioscorides's De Materia Medica, and Pliny the Elder's Natural History. By the time of Galen, willow was commonly used throughout the Roman and Arab worlds, as {{a small part of}} a large, growing botanical pharmacopoeia.|$|E
5|$|The major {{turning point}} for {{salicylate}} medicines came in 1763, when a letter from English chaplain Edward Stone was read {{at a meeting of}} the Royal Society, describing the dramatic power of willow bark <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> cure ague—an ill-defined constellation of symptoms, including intermittent fever, pain, and fatigue, that primarily referred to malaria. Inspired by the doctrine of signatures to search for a treatment for agues near the brackish waters that were known to cause it, Stone had tasted the bark of a willow tree in 1758 and noticed an astringency reminiscent of the standard—and expensive—ague cure of Peruvian bark. He collected, dried, and powdered a substantial amount of willow bark, and over the next five years tested it on a number of people sick with fever and agues. In his letter, Stone reported consistent success, describing willow extract's effects as identical to Peruvian bark, though a little less potent. (In fact, the active ingredient of Peruvian bark was quinine, which attacked the infectious cause of malaria, while the active ingredient of willow extract, salicin, relieved the symptoms of malaria but could not cure it.) Stone's letter (mistakenly attributed to Edmund rather than Edward Stone) was printed in Philosophical Transactions, and by the end of the 18th century willow was gaining popularity as an inexpensive substitute for Peruvian bark.|$|E

In C 60 incorporated into artificial lipid membranes, it was not <b>extracted</b> <b>to</b> toluene, but the extraction became possible once the vesicle was destructed by adding KCl [15]. Addition of KCl was also required <b>to</b> <b>extract</b> poly(vinylpyrrolidone)-solubilized C 60 – 70 to toluene [16].|$|R

25|$|In a {{study by}} Tellez et al., {{extracts}} from a plant Achyrocline Bogotensis was used to develop an antiviral therapy for both rotavirus and astrovirus. Achyrocline Bogotensis was commonly used for skin and urinary infections. Drug testing methodology involved application of the <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> cell for pre-treatment (blocking), direct viral activity (evidence of killing the virus), and treatment ({{a decrease in the}} viral load after an infection is established). The extract demonstrated direct viral activity by killing astroviruses directly and treatment by leading to a decrease in the viral load after an established infection. A pre-treatment effect was not evidence during the experiment.|$|E
25|$|On 5 January 1950, five policemen {{from the}} Nachole police station {{were killed by}} the Santals in Chandipur village after they opened fire to {{disperse}} the villagers who had gathered to protest the arrest of one of the villagers. The Government of Pakistan responded to this incident by sending a 2,000 strong army contingent along with the police and the East Pakistan Ansars on 7 January. They set fire to twelve villages, ransacked the huts and killed many villagers on their way to Chandipur. In Chandipur, they tortured the men, raped the women and set fire to the dwellings. Hundreds of Santals and Hindus were killed. At Rohanpur, Ila Mitra, {{one of the leaders of}} the movement was arrested with hundreds of peasants. After being taken to the Nachole police station they were tortured by the police to <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> the name of the leaders. Around 70 to 100 peasants died of police excesses. Ila Mitra was tortured and raped for four days before being transferred to Nawabganj police station.|$|E
25|$|On his return, Macleod was {{surprised}} and expressed doubt about the results. Banting took this as an attack on his integrity. They argued bitterly, but Banting finally accepted Macleod's instruction that further experiments were needed, and he even convinced Macleod to provide better working conditions and to give him and Best a salary. Further experiments were successful and the three started to present their work at meetings. Macleod was a far better orator, and Banting {{came to believe that}} he wanted to take all the credit. Their discovery was first published in the February 1922 issue of The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine. Macleod declined co-authorship because he considered it Banting's and Best's work. Despite their success, there remained the issue of how to get enough pancreas <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> continue the experiments. Together, the three researchers developed alcohol extraction, which proved to be far more efficient than other methods. This convinced Macleod to divert the whole laboratory to insulin research and to bring in the biochemist James Collip to help with purifying the extract.|$|E

500|$|Another {{specimen}}, in the American Museum of Natural History under specimen number460, {{which is}} occasionally assigned to Apatosaurus, is considered nearly complete; only the head, feet, and {{sections of the}} tail are missing, {{and it was the}} first sauropod skeleton mounted. The specimen was found north of Medicine Bow, Wyoming, in 1898 by Walter Granger, and took the entire summer to <b>extract.</b> <b>To</b> complete the mount, sauropod feet that were discovered at the same quarry and a tail fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it shouldbut which had too few vertebraewere added. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum thought the skull of this massive creature might look like was made. This was not a delicate skull like that of Diplodocuswhich was later found to be more accuratebut was based on [...] "the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries". These skulls were likely those of Camarasaurus, the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find Apatosaurus skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Osborn said in a publication that the skull was [...] "largely conjectural and based on that of Morosaurus" [...] (now Camarasaurus).|$|E

2500|$|Vanillin {{was first}} {{isolated}} {{as a relatively}} pure substance in 1858 by Nicolas-Theodore Gobley, who obtained it by evaporating a vanilla <b>extract</b> <b>to</b> dryness, and recrystallizing the resulting solids from hot water. In 1874, the German scientists Ferdinand Tiemann and Wilhelm Haarmann deduced its chemical structure, {{at the same time}} finding a synthesis for vanillin from coniferin, a glucoside of isoeugenol found in pine bark. Tiemann and Haarmann founded a company, Haarmann and Reimer (now part of Symrise) and started the first industrial production of vanillin using their process in Holzminden, Germany. In 1876, [...] synthesized vanillin (2) from guaiacol (1).|$|E

Microorganisms were obtained from Czech Collection of Microorganisms. Absorbances after and before the experiment were subtracted, converted to binary system and obtained values to Probit analysis were used.
