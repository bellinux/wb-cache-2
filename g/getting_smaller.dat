After a few seconds, the provider's automated [...] "network is no longer carried" [...] card was automatically placed on-screen, ending the TechTV and G4 legacies. Several days after G4 signed off, some cable providers replaced G4's slot entirely with sister network Chiller, which in turn had replaced Fearnet months before in some markets when the two channels merged. Some other providers replaced the channel with sister network Cloo (which, like G4, eventually declined into an all-rerun lineup before its end of operations on February 1, 2017), while others gave the space to other networks such as UP and Pivot (itself discontinued at the end of October 2016).|$|E

You're losing weight and <b>getting</b> <b>smaller,</b> and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale.

The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? I think every girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E

60|$|Jim {{imagined}} {{he meant the}} river was rising {{and did not know}} if this was a drawback or not. A flood might make poling harder, but it would cover the rocks in the channel and probably leave an eddying slack along the bank. He agreed with the Indian, because the rock to which they had moored the canoe was <b>getting</b> <b>smaller.</b> It made a kind of breakwater, but it would be covered soon and the craft would feel the force of the current. Still they ought to ride safely, and an angry wash now beat against the bank of gravel where they had landed.

By eight o'clock in the evening they had shaken out one reef, and soon afterward Frank lay down in the cabin, because Jake said that {{he had no intention of}} entrusting either him or Harry with the helm, which was on the whole a relief to both of them. To run a small craft before a breaking sea in the dark is a very severe test of nerve, and it is, perhaps, worse when the combers still come foaming after her after the wind has somewhat fallen.|$|E
