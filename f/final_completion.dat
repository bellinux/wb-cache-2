5|$|The pagoda {{was then}} {{completed}} {{by his son}} King Kyansittha (r.1084–1113). While its lower terraces were built by Anawrahta, the balance structure is credited to Kyansittha. Its <b>final</b> <b>completion</b> date is 1086 and the footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here are also believed {{to be of the}} same period. The pagoda is a replica of the pyramidal Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location of Buddha’s illuminating realisation in India.|$|E
5|$|The mounted police {{took on a}} {{range of}} tasks {{associated}} with the new project. Teams of police escorted the construction teams as they moved across the Rocky Mountains, having been given special jurisdiction over the area along the line of the route. They enforced the liquor laws, and oversaw the itinerant service workers who accompanied the main construction teams. They defused many of the tensions involving the construction workers and the company, including intervening to resolve cases where the workers had not been paid by the company as promised, but they also intervened to support the railway company. When the railway staff went on strike for higher wages in 1883, the mounted police guarded the company's trains, escorted in new drivers and, when necessary, drove the locomotives themselves; two years later the police broke up a protest over unpaid wages by over a thousand construction workers, arresting the main leaders. The head of the Canadian Pacific Railway, William Van Horne, thanked the force for its contribution to the <b>final</b> <b>completion</b> of the project.|$|E

25|$|Initial {{plans were}} on a smaller scale. The {{original}} 1929 proposal was for a petit ouvrage, six blocks armed with machine guns and 75mm guns. Blocks {{were added to the}} design until the gros ouvrage emerged. Costs in 1931 were estimated at 41.2 million francs. Construction uncovered difficulties with the foundations, resulting in the widespread use of piles under the blocks to stabilize their support, a unique solution in the Line. The major work was completed in 1935, and equipment and armament were fitted in 1936 and 1937. <b>Final</b> <b>completion</b> took place in 1938, marked by difficulties with drainage of water infiltration.|$|E
