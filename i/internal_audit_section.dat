40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} paper is to understand the bank internal audit system during the Taisho period based on the following three points; 1) Discussion in the Financial System Research Committee (FSRC) about reinforcement of bank internal audit. 2) Comparison {{of the contents of}} the technical books about bank internal audit. 3) Case study of an actual bank internal audit. Concerning the discussion in the FSRC, substantial discussions were not done because of the difference of the basic stance between Finance Ministry and commission members from various quarters. The opinions {{of the authors of the}} technical books about bank internal audit vary especially about internal audit organization. A point in controversy was whether the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>section</b> could be under the control of the company auditor. Mitsubishi Bank and Sumitomo Bank put their internal audit sections under the control of the company auditor, but Mitsui Bank didn’t in 1923. As a reality, Mitsui Bank’s organization was sound in that period. The example used for the case study was Bushu Bank Menuma branch. The report of the internal audit of the bank shows that the audit was done the normal way and covers important points. Concerning the internal audit system, the attitudes of the Finance Ministry, theoreticians, and bank internal auditors differed from each other.

Most organisations have computerized their operating systems and for auditors to effectively carry out their audits, {{it is essential that}} they incorporate Information Technology during their audit process. The research meant to identify the changes that Information Technology has brought in auditing. It has been earned out to evaluate the use of Computer Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATs) in local authorities and in particular Bulawayo City Council (BCC). The research has been carried out to measure the improvements on the audit work in terms of coverage and quality of the audit reports since the use of CAATs by BCC <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> <b>section.</b> It seeks to make comparisons between manual auditing and the use of CAATs. Theoretical and empirical literature review has been discussed outlining the use and application of CAATs acknowledging the works of other various authors on this subject matter. Information was gathered from both primary and secondary sources to give the researcher an understanding of the benefits brought by Information Technology compared to the traditional manner of carrying out audits. The findings highlighted {{that there has been a}} change in the manner in which auditors execute their duties due to use of CAATs. The research findings revealed that CAATs are necessary tools through which auditors can enhance their effectiveness and efficiency. Through use of CAATs the BCC auditors have been able to extract and analyse large volumes of data within a short time thereby reducing the time of completing the audit. CAATs improve audit coverage, quality of audit work and audit reports. There are challenges in the implementation and upgrading of the audit software due to financial constraints by Bulawayo City Council. This has affected full utilisation of information technology and the attainment of knowledge and skills that the internal auditors are to be equipped with. Despite these challenges continuous investments in the software are encouraged as the benefits obtained outweigh the costs of using manual auditing.

40|$|This {{paper has}} focused {{much on the}} {{independence}} and performance of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. The research objectives of this project are {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the management in all council operations, to assess effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> controls both existing and proposed functions, to examine challenges faced by Chitungwiza municipality in upholding independence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and accountability including managementâ€™s behaviour, to determine types of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and their subsequent efficient methods at the council, to investigate how size and resourcing of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> affect objectivity and efficiency and to recommend strategies of establishing an effective and independent <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> In the literature review methods of measuring the effectiveness of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> activity were discussed in detail. This study provides empirical evidence as to the main factors influencing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> independence. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness can be only enhanced through its independence; there are various factors that contribute to autonomy of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector organizations. These factors are namely competence of <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> the size of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department, the relationship between internal and external auditors, management support for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> and the independence of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> department. The results suggested that management should support the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and promote <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> autonomy from political interference. This would bring effectiveness of both the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function and management. In this context, literature was also reviewed whereby different views were given towards autonym of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in public sector. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> was defined, forms of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> that <b>internal</b> auditors comply with such as Financial audit, Risk management and system controls, Advisory and investigative service and Performance audit. The researcher used research methodology that was mutually blended with both qualitative and quantitative research designs. The population for this research is 497 people constituting general employees (top management, lower level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees, councillors and the workers union members. The sample population is 50 and it constitutes 25 from the general lower level employees, 7 from the top management, 10 from councillors, 4 from <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employees and 4 from the workers committee. The research tools used were interviews and questionnaires which had both open-ended and closed questions. Sampling techniques used are purposive, stratified and simple random sampling.

40|$|In recent years, {{the need}} to develop {{professional}} competence in <b>internal</b> <b>auditing</b> has increasingly come under the spotlight. The main reasons for this are a growing need for competent internal auditors who can render value-adding services to a variety of stakeholders, and the need for an effective <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> function, where <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> competence and professionalism are regarded as determinants of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> effectiveness. Prior research has focused on <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> education at a tertiary level, so research on workplace learning for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> auditors is limited. The IIA Research Foundation undertook a series of Common Body of Knowledge studies, and developed an <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> competency framework indicating competency requirements for various levels of internal auditors. However, no reference is made to <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees or new internal auditors, or to the learning paths required to achieve the set competencies. The aim of this qualitative study was therefore to propose a workplace learning framework for developing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees into entry-level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> professionals. The literature review discussed the evolution of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> profession {{and its impact on the}} competency requirements of internal auditors. The dimensions of workplace learning were explored. In addition, workplace learning in the accounting and auditing professions was examined globally, and in South Africa, with reference to different professional bodies competency frameworks, and the workplace learning component of these frameworks. Data were collected from focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews held in South Africa with 65 participants, including <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> employers, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees, presenters and assessors of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> workplace learning, and members of the IIA (SA) Education and Training Committee to determine their views on <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> workplace learning. Based on the findings, the study proposes a workplace learning framework for developing <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> trainees into entry-level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> professionals involving five dimensions: workplace learning criteria, workplace learning content, workplace learning methods, determinants of workplace learning success and challenges to workplace learning. It is recommended that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> stakeholders take cognisance of these dimensions when embarking on workplace learning to ensure that all constituencies benefit from entry-level <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> professionals acquisition of professional competence.

I am describing the process of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> on a company providing services. Particular steps of this <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> are being described in this thesis while the final report of the internal auditor is included. The report describes failures which occurred and the procedure of their resolution. I {{came to the conclusion}} that <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> helps the organization to reduce the failures and mistakes risen up by ignorance, lack of attention or lack of knowledge. Following the results of the thesis I would recommend the companies not doing any <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> to do so. Performing of the <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> on the regular basis will allow achieving higher control over the activities and processes. <b>Internal</b> <b>audit</b> helps to gain and renew the quality certifications which are helping to become more competitive at the market...|$|R

There is {{currently}} no standard or requirement guiding the approaches {{taken by the}} European Union (EU) Public Sector <b>internal</b> <b>audit.</b> Therefore, the approaches taken by each country, although having some similarities are different. The aim {{of this research is}} to compare the Latvian state administration <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> approach with approaches of the following specific European countries: United Kingdom, Malta, Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Poland and evaluate each country’s <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> approach according to <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> maturity determinants. The latter have been determined from literature, the Compendium report. Thereby, shedding light on the Latvian’s <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> approach maturity. The methodology includes a comparative study of 5 European countries’ public sector <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> methodologies, by carrying out a documents analysis and evaluation of the existing normative acts, analysing cases and other scientific findings of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> methodology and legislation. Authors recommend introducing a common <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> procedures manual, standards and guidelines for the public sectors in the EU Member States. They believe that this will improve internal controls and <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> data analysis around Europe. The main results of the study will highlight the maturity of each of these countries’ <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> approaches and their pros and cons. It will also highlight where improvements might be required or where changes are necessary. Keywords: <b>internal</b> <b>audit,</b> public sector, <b>internal</b> control JEL code: M 4...|$|R

It helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic, disciplined approach {{to evaluate and}} improve the effectiveness of risk management, control, and governance processes (IIA Definition, 2009). “…Whenever the advance of civilization brought about necessity of one man being intrusted to some extent with the property of other, the advisability {{of some kind of}} check upon the fidelity of the former would become apparent”(Richard Brown, 1961). The aim of this research is to clarify global <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> historical methodology approaches.

40|$|Master of EducationMy {{interest}} in <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> education first developed when I {{was given the}} responsibility for developing and conducting the Graduate Diploma in <b>Internal</b> <b>Auditing</b> which commenced at RMIT in 1981. Since then, I have had many opportunities to meet <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> practitioners, to seek their views and {{to reflect on the}} needs of, and developments in, <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in Australia. My observations gave me the impetus to undertake, with a colleague, a major research survey of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in Australia. This survey, recently published under the title, "A Profile of <b>Internal</b> <b>Audit</b> in Australia", has been a major influence in developing my thoughts on this thesis topic. In attempting to devise a strategy for <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> education in Australia, it is necessary to review the whole field of <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> in terms of its nature, professionalism, past experience, the various influences affecting <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> education and a possible educational framework. In this respect, this thesis aims to be a comprehensive document. However where possible, supportive detail has been incorporated into Appendices rather than {{the main body of the}} thesis. I am hopeful this thesis will provide a framework for those organisations and individuals who can provide the leadership and resources to implement effective <b>internal</b> <b>audit</b> education in Australia.
