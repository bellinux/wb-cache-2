[...] Maentz also excelled as a kicker, punting 15 times in 1955 for 602 yards and an average of 40.1 yards. Maentz was also named a second-team All-American by the United Press for 1955. [...] Detroit News sports writer Watson Spoelstra published a column in 1955 about Maentz in which he wrote:"Tom Maentz isn't quite as big as Ron Kramer. He can't run as fast, but Maentz stepped up his speed this season ... Oosterbaan marveled aloud about Maentz's spectacular catch just before the half at Minnesota. The play cleared the way to victory. Oosterbaan spoke with admiration of Maentz's catch of a 33-yard pass by Tony Branoff {{in the end zone}} against Iowa.

40|$|Hip {{fracture}} in the aged easily occurs by falls and may cause these persons to become bedridden. Hip pads {{are effective in}} protecting hip fracture as they directly deflect and absorb the impact forces by falls. It {{is necessary for the}} material and the structure of hip pads to be designed to realize both high impact absorption and compliance (comfort during wearing). In this report, an impact testing system was developed to test the impact absorbing performance of <b>hip</b> <b>pad</b> with air cushions designed by the research group. The impact absorbing performance was evaluated by the impact load, collision time, and maximum load. To confirm the effectiveness in protecting against hip fracture, an impact force was applied to the greater trochanter of the human femur and the degree of fracture was measured by X-ray examination. As a result, the <b>hip</b> <b>pad</b> with air cushions had a high impact absorbing performance and was sufficiently effective to protect against hip fracture...|$|E

50|$|Protective {{equipment}} in gridiron football ("football gear") consists of equipment worn by football players {{for the protection}} of the body during the course of a football game. Basic equipment worn by most football players include helmet, shoulder pads, gloves, shoes, and thigh and knee pads, and a jockstrap or compression shorts with or without a protective cup. Neck rolls, elbow <b>pads,</b> mouth guards, <b>hip</b> <b>pads,</b> tailbone pads, rib pads, and other equipment may be worn in addition to the aforementioned basics. Football protective equipment is made of synthetic materials: foam rubbers, elastics, and durable, shock-resistant, molded plastic. Football protective equipment has remained consistent in use for decades with some slight modifications made over the years in design and materials. The assignment and maintenance of football gear belongs to the team equipment manager.|$|R
5000|$|The kind of {{football}} the teams play today {{is similar to}} that of the Canadian Football League, a 3 [...] "down" [...] system to gain 10 yards, but the rules are official from the CDMFA (Capital District Minor Football League).

A Canadian football helmet consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a facemask made {{of one or more}} metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. An unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game which unprotected would be extremely dangerous.

An unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of force in the game which, unprotected and in current form, would now be extremely dangerous. An example of this is the trend for players tackling head first rather than leading with a shoulder, which has led to some serious neck injuries, including breaks, even with the helmets used. In previous years with less padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles in rugby union, with less severe impacts and less severe structural injuries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rules of}} play in 1893 were more like rugby than what might be {{considered}} modern football. The rules called for eleven players on a side with a scrimmage line dividing the teams. The team on offense was required to begin a play by kicking the ball either forward or backward to the quarterback. The quarterback couldn't run with the ball, but he could hand it off. In order to keep possession, the offensive team had to either gain five yards in three downs or not lose ten yards. Forward passing was not allowed. Touchdowns counted for 4 points, with 2 points for a goal after a touchdown, 4 points for a field goal, and 2 points for a safety. Players wore an assortment of [...] "football armor" [...] such as [...] "shin guards, rubber noses, head bands, ankle protectors, elbow and <b>hip</b> <b>pads,</b> ear guards, and mouth pieces.

5000|$|In 1946 Marcel Boussac, a {{successful}} entrepreneur {{known as the}} richest man in France, invited Dior to design for Philippe et Gaston, a Paris fashion house launched in 1925. Dior refused, wishing to make a fresh start under his own name rather than reviving an old brand. On 8 December 1946, with Boussac's backing, Dior founded his fashion house. The actual name of the line of his first collection, presented on 12 February 1947, was Corolle (literally the botanical term corolla or circlet of flower petals in English), but the phrase New Look was coined for it by Carmel Snow, the editor-in-chief of Harper's Bazaar. Dior's designs were more voluptuous than the boxy, fabric-conserving shapes of the recent World War II styles, influenced by the rations on fabric. He was a master at creating shapes and silhouettes; Dior is quoted as saying [...] "I have designed flower women." [...] His look employed fabrics lined predominantly with percale, boned, bustier-style bodices, <b>hip</b> <b>padding,</b> wasp-waisted corsets and petticoats that made his dresses flare out from the waist, giving his models a very curvaceous form.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reported}} {{an evaluation of}} the absorption energy and performance relevant to thermal wear comfort of existing <b>hip</b> protective <b>pad</b> and materials intended for use in <b>hip</b> protective <b>pad.</b> For energy absorption evaluation the experimental pads were compressed using Instron Tester, while dry thermal resistance and evaporative resistance of experimental pads were tested using sweating guarded hot plate. The stress-strain compression curves from the experimental results were used to analyze the absorption energy of the pads. It was determined that knitted spacer fabric had better relative energy absorption than closed cell foams, and better absolute energy absorption when treated with shear-thickening fluid. Also, the dead mass of spacer fabrics is the lower than the one of foams. Physical form and morphology of knitted spacer fabric allowed easier thermal and vapour transfer to the environment in comparison to those of closed-cell foam, where knitted spacer fabric had both lower dry thermal resistance and evaporative resistance values than closed cell foam which makes the knitted spacer fabric suitable for protective pads used in high sport activity and hot environmental environments. This study concluded that knitted spacer fabric could successfully be used as alternative material for impact protective pad...|$|R
5|$|Similarly, modern {{equipment}} {{was developed to}} reduce injuries. The football helmet, although a scapegoat for concussions, serves as effective protection against more dangerous injuries like skull fractures. The modern helmet traces its roots back to the leather helmets used by football players in the early 1900s {{to protect themselves from}} head injuries. Helmets later evolved to be made of hard plastic, and a facemask was added to protect players from sustaining facial injuries. Many players also wear mouthguards to prevent injuries to their teeth and tongues; at some levels, such as the NCAA, the use of a mouthguard is mandatory. Football players wear a number of pads to protect themselves – shoulder pads are the most important pads, protecting the shoulder and sternum, but thigh <b>pads,</b> <b>hip</b> <b>pads,</b> tail pads, and knee pads are also used. Many quarterbacks wear flak jackets to protect their ribcage. Cleats come in a number of lengths, with players choosing which cleat to use based on the playing field – on artificial turf, for example, players prefer a shorter cleat to prevent their feet from digging into the ground and risking injury, while longer cleats are generally used on fields that are wet or slippery to provide better traction. Athletic cups are not typically used at the professional level, because athletic cups tend to make it harder to move and there is an unwritten code among players not to target the groin area. Additionally, studies have shown that proper conditioning techniques, fitness routines and exercise routines, as well as high-quality equipment and coaching, can reduce the risk of injury among players.|$|R

30|$|Another goal of {{the global}} {{approach}} to osteoporotic patients {{is to reduce the}} bone injury caused by the fall impact. There are now devices, such as <b>padded</b> <b>hip</b> protectors, that offer biomechanical protection during a fall, decreasing the force of the impact on the bone and thereby reducing the incidence of fracture of the proximal femur, particularly for high-risk institutionalized elderly individuals [94, 95] (grade B recommendation).|$|R
50|$|Various {{methods are}} {{used to create a}} female waist-hip ratio, by either {{reducing}} the waist size and/or enlarging the hips and buttocks.

His feet are tied to a lower crossbar on the same side by restraining ankle cuffs made of leather, while his hands are secured to another horizontal crossbar on the other side by wrist cuffs of similar design; his hands can hold on to the crossbar. After he is secured to the trestle in a bent-over position at an angle of close to 90° at the <b>hip,</b> protective <b>padding</b> is tied around his lower back to protect the vulnerable kidney and lower spine area from any strokes that might land off-target.

5000|$|One of {{the common}} ways of {{describing}} the felt recoil of a particular gun-cartridge combination is as [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "sharp" [...] recoiling; soft recoil is recoil spread {{over a longer period}} of time, that is at a lower deceleration, and sharp recoil is spread over a shorter period of time, that is with a higher deceleration. Like pushing softer or harder on the brakes of a car, the driver feels less or more deceleration force being applied, over a longer or shorter distance to bring the car to a stop. However, for the human body to mechanically adjust recoil time, and hence length, to lessen felt recoil force is perhaps an impossible task. Other than employing less safe and less accurate practices, such as shooting from the <b>hip,</b> shoulder <b>padding</b> is a safe and effective mechanism that allows sharp recoiling to be lengthened into soft recoiling, as lower decelerating force is transmitted into the body over a slightly greater distance and time, and spread out over a slightly larger surface.|$|R

The knee-length skirts and dresses were the most oversized items of this 1950s. The introduction of new fabrics, including Terylene, Orlon, Banlon, Acrilan and Poplin, allowed for new fashion styles to be both created and introduced. Among these were the [...] "wash-and-wear" [...] sweater, the permanently pleated skirt, and the [...] "drip-dry" [...] skirt.

50|$|To {{enhance their}} {{perceived}} attractiveness, some women may artificially alter their apparent WHR. The methods {{include the use}} of a corset to reduce the waist size and <b>hip</b> and buttock <b>padding</b> to increase the apparent size of the hips and buttocks. In an earlier attempt to quantify attractiveness, corset and girdle manufacturers of the 20th century used a calculation called hip spring (or hip-spring or hipspring), calculated by subtracting the waist measurement from the hip measurement. However this calculation fell into disuse because it is a poor indicator of attractiveness; for example, a hip spring of 10 in would likely be considered quite attractive for an average-sized adult woman, but a child or petite woman with the same number would more likely be seen as malnourished.|$|R
30|$|It is now {{recognized}} {{that the number of}} reported falls is more predictive of limb fractures than a low BMD [131]. Management of the risk of falls {{is the first step in}} the detection of patients at a high risk of fracture. The use of <b>padded</b> <b>hip</b> protectors may reduce the risk of fragility fracture in subjects at a high risk of falls. A recent review underlined that hip protectors, when correctly worn, can decrease hip fracture risk and both morbidity and mortality in the elderly, especially in institutionalized individuals [132]. However, a Cochrane systematic review demonstrated that there was little evidence that the use of hip protectors reduces the incidence of hip fracture in older people in institutional settings; it had little or no effect on falls and adverse events (skin irritation). Nevertheless, the current best evidence suggests that the use of hip protectors may slightly increase the risk of pelvic fracture [133] (grade B recommendation).|$|R
5000|$|After five years, Morton {{set up his}} {{own label}} and he was succeeded at Lachasse by Hardy Amies, then a would-be {{designer}} and former Avery weighing machine salesman who had got the job of managing the store simply because a letter he wrote describing a dress {{came to the attention}} of Shingleton.

[...] Amies' early pieces showed his lack of experience; later he would describe some of them as hideous and extravagant. In 1937, however, his tweed suit called 'Panic' scored a huge hit. Cecil Beaton photographed the suit for Vogue; it had <b>padded</b> <b>hips,</b> a nipped in waist (Amies had introduced corsets to the collection) and was made in green Linton tweed with a cerise pink check.
