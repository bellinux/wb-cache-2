40|$|Despite {{the variety}} of modern {{molecular}} techniques available, examination of foe-tal anatomy is still a fundamental part of teratological studies in evaluating the developmental toxicity of xenobiotics or other non-chemical factors. The article presents contemporary methods of embryotoxicity and <b>foetotoxicity</b> assessment. A single alizarin red S and double alcian blue followed by alizarin red S staining, as well as various methods of soft tissue examination are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Heart {{failure is}} an {{established}} predictor of primary cardiac events during pregnancy. Adequate heart failure treatment in pregnant women is hampered by important <b>foetotoxicity</b> of several conventional drugs. Hydralazine {{with or without}} long-acting nitrates has been proposed as an alternative for ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. There are no published data, however, {{on the use of}} hydralazine to treat heart failure during pregnancy. We describe the course and outcome of pregnancy in two patients with heart failure. A 31 -year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy was not treated with hydralazine during pregnancy and developed worsening heart failure. A 36 -year-old woman with ischaemic cardiomyopathy was treated with hydralazine early during pregnancy and remained stable throughout and after pregnancy. We assume that early initiation of hydralazine as an alternative for ACE inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers during pregnancy in patients with cardiomyopathy could prevent further left ventricular dilatation and worsening heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Erectile {{dysfunction}} is disability to achieve  or sustain erection to do satisfying intercourse, {{that occur}} at lest for three month. Erectile dysfunction patients are significantly increasing every year, especially in male age 40 - 70 years old. Tadalafil inhibit PDE 5 enzyme 10. 000 time more potent than PDE 1, PDE 2, PDE 4 and PDE 7; 700 time more potent than PDE 6; 900 time more potent than PDE 8, PDE 9, PDE 10, and also 14 time more potent than PDE 11 A 1. In elderly erectile dysfunction commonly is caused by  aging process, hence in young adult can caused by physiologic factor or stress. Some studies report {{there is no}} significant difference of the tadalafil’s pharmacokinetic in young adult and elderly, and in patient with and without diabetes mellitus. The dose of tadalafil {{does not need to be}} reguleted in patient who have liver function disturbance, DM, elderly, renal function disturbance, patient who take medicine like erythromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, protease inhibitor, and medicine that inhibit the CYP 3 A 4 system. Clinical study report that tadalafil can increase erection significantly and the patient able to do sex intercourse successfully. Tadalafil does not affect the blood pressure or heart rate, neither affect the concentration motility and morphology of the sperm and neither cause eye disturbance. There is no evidence of teratogenicity, embryotoxicity and <b>foetotoxicity</b> in rat that were given tadalafil 1000 mg/kg/day...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe aims of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of oil-resin of Copaiba (Copaifera duckei Dwyer), aired in vaginal cream on the reproductive performance of female rats (Rattus norvegicus). To determine the components of the C. duckei oleoresin, gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (CG–MS) was used, and considering the trans-caryophyllene sesquiterpene as a phytochemical marker in the oleoresin. Due to the extensive use of copaiba oleoresin in the suppository form for gynecological infections, an evaluation was carried out on the effects of copaiba oleoresin (Copaifera duckei Dwyer), delivered in a vaginal cream, on the reproductive performance of female Wistar rats. For this purpose, three groups (n= 5 – 6 /group) of female rats were treated as follows: 1 – vaginal cream of copaiba oleoresin (28. 6 mg/kg), 2 – base vaginal cream and 3 – control (physiological saline 0. 9 %), administered intravaginally, for 30 days before pregnancy, and from day zero to day 20 during pregnancy. Laparotomy was performed on the 21 st day of pregnancy, followed by the determination of reproductive variables: number of live and dead fetuses, mass of the fetuses and placentas, number of implantations and resorptions, number of corpora lutea, pre- and post-implantation loss, and analyses of the fetuses with regard to external and internal anomalies and/or malformations (skeletal and visceral). The trans-caryophyllene present in the sample is suggested as a phytochemical marker and the results {{of this study}} demonstrate an absence of maternal toxicity and <b>foetotoxicity</b> embryofoetotoxicity at the dose administered, corresponding to ten times the recommended dose for use in humans. Accordingly, no significant statistical difference was observed between the treated and control groups, for the variables analyzed. Thus, it is concluded that the vaginal cream containing 2. 5 % copaiba oleoresin is safe during gestation, in female rats (Rattus norvegicus) of the Wistar strain...|$|E
