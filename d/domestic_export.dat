5000|$|Under the Czechoslovak system, {{foreign trade}} {{was a state}} monopoly, {{supervised}} by the central Ministry of Foreign Trade. The ministry oversaw the operation of about thirty foreign trade enterprises. As intermediaries between the <b>domestic</b> <b>export</b> producers or import purchasers and the external market, the enterprises were responsible for arranging contracts {{as well as for}} financing and generally supervising Czechoslovak foreign trade, usually setting prices that have little connection with domestic production factors.|$|E
25|$|The first {{factories}} were {{relocated to}} Mainland China {{in the late}} 1970s. The relocation trend reached its peak in the mid-1980s. By the 1990s, over 80% of the factories had been relocated to Mainland China. The value of <b>domestic</b> <b>exports</b> continued to decrease while that of re-exportation from Mainland China increased drastically. In the toy industry, only 7% {{of the value of}} exports was gained by <b>domestic</b> <b>exports,</b> while 93% was re-exported from Mainland China. From 1989 to 1994, the value of re-exportation from Mainland China increased by 25.6% annually on average. In the 1990s, the jewellery industry moved most of their manufacturing process to Mainland {{with the exception of the}} most valuable jewellery production.|$|R

50|$|Advertising {{has gone}} through five major stages of development: <b>domestic,</b> <b>export,</b> international, multi-national, and global. For global advertisers, there are four, {{potentially}} competing, business objectives that must be balanced when developing worldwide advertising: building a brand while speaking with one voice, developing economies of scale in the creative process, maximising local effectiveness of ads, and increasing the company's speed of implementation. Born from the evolutionary stages of global marketing are the three primary and fundamentally different approaches {{to the development of}} global advertising executions: exporting executions, producing local executions, and importing ideas that travel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of FDI on <b>{{domestic}}</b> <b>exporting</b> firms. We show that domestic firms respond {{to an increase in}} the presence of FDI by increasing their exports even though the increase in foreign presence can drive up production costs and make the domestic market more profitable. Our test case for this hypothesis is China, where we confirm the significant positive impact of FDI on <b>domestic</b> firms' <b>exports.</b> This finding sheds light on the massive exports and rapid inflow of foreign investment that have been observed in China in the past three decades...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Data {{representing}} transshipment or re-exports {{are almost}} always excluded from analytical portrayals of international trade, yet transshipment is potentially an important phenomenon in understanding a number of economic questions, and is increasing in importance. Rapid technological change {{in areas such as}} containerization and hub-and-spoke routing has promoted the practice of transshipment. While there are significant gaps in the data, the share of re-exports in global exports has undoubtedly increased rapidly, from perhaps 1 in 20 in the mid- 1980 s to perhaps 1 in 6 today. Econometric analysis of U. S. <b>domestic</b> <b>exports</b> and foreign exports (re-exports) over pairs of U. S. ports and destinations suggests that re-exports are significantly more sensitive than <b>domestic</b> <b>exports</b> to factors influencing transaction costs, including distance, containerization, price-fixing liner agreements, and port efficiency and restrictive port policies in the importing country...|$|R
50|$|Previously, the United Kingdom {{and other}} EU {{countries}} constituted the major Gambian <b>domestic</b> <b>export</b> markets. However, {{in recent years}} Senegal, the United States, and Japan have become significant trade partners of the Gambia. In Africa, Senegal represented the biggest trade partner of the Gambia in 2007, which is a defining contrast to previous years that had Guinea-Bissau and Ghana as equally important trade partners. Globally, Denmark, the United States, and China have become important source countries for Gambian imports. The UK, Germany, Ivory Coast, and the Netherlands also provide {{a fair share of}} Gambian imports. The Gambian trade deficit for 2007 was $331 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} model {{is set up}} as a two-stage game. In the initial stage, the home government is able to enact an export subsidy for the home firm’s output of the homogenous product. In the second stage, the firm of each country chooses the quantity to produce and sell to the third country. Each firm takes the other’s output as given when maximizing profit. The subsidy lowers the home firm’s cost and makes it want to export more for any given export level of the rival. Since the home and foreign products are strategic substitutes, the foreign firm must reduce its output. As the <b>domestic</b> <b>export</b> subsidy increases, aggregate quantity rises, price falls, and the profits of the domestic firm rise while foreign profits decline. In effect, rents are shifted from the foreign firm to the home firm.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} the bachelor's thesis is {{the effects of the}} Great Depression on the Czechoslovak export. Its {{consequences}} reflected in the thirties, not only in territorial and commodity structure, but also in the trade policy of Czechoslovakia. In my thesis I focus briefly on the foreign trade, which despite the obstacles associated with the newly established state, developer quite satisfactorily. The main section of the thesis is the Czechoslovak export in thirties, where I analyse trade policy and the structure of <b>domestic</b> <b>export.</b> The impetus for the changes in trade policy and actions of the Czechoslovak Government in the thirties was Great Depression that hit the entire world market. These steps should have had a stimulating effect on <b>domestic</b> <b>export,</b> but its impact was at least debatable. Furthermore, the Great Depression caused significant changes not only in the commodity structure, which had to adapt to completely changed demand, but also in the territorial structure, when the interest in non-European markets generally increased...|$|E

40|$|I {{develop a}} two country general {{equilibrium}} model with heterogeneous price-setting firms to understand how shocks to monetary policy and aggregate labor productivity impact trade integration, which I capture through the (inverse) average productivity of exporting firms. A contractionary domestic monetary policy shock raises the average productivity of <b>domestic</b> <b>exporting</b> firms but lowers the average productivity of foreign exporting firms. The magnitude of these changes is greater when governments target domestic price inflation as opposed to consumer price inflation. A positive shock to domestic labor productivity generates positive - although quantitatively small - changes in the average productivity of all exporting firms when consumer price inflation is targeted. When domestic price inflation is targeted, the same shock causes a fall in the average productivity of <b>domestic</b> <b>exporting</b> firms, and a far larger rise in the productivity of foreign exporting firms.

40|$|This paper studies how the {{interests}} of <b>domestic</b> versus <b>exporting</b> firms determine multilateral tariff levels. In a Melitz model, less productive domestic firms lobby for lower tariffs whereas exporters favor liberalization to gain market access abroad. The government weighs social welfare and contributions when setting trade policy. If neither or both groups within an industry lobby, the socially optimal tariff results. When only one group lobbies, <b>domestic</b> (<b>exporting)</b> firms obtain a higher (lower) tariff.

We find that the optimal export policy is subsidy when domestic multinational does not has control of a local firm through partial ownership. However, the optimal export policy of the domestic country is {{to levy a tax}} when domestic multinational has control of a local firm. Moreover, the optimal export policy is free trade if there is no foreign ownership regulation possessed by foreign country...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} model of {{international}} market share rivalry where the <b>domestic</b> <b>export</b> subsidy is determined by lobbying. Greater domestic cost heterogeneity leads to a higher subsidy level and a larger domestic market share. However, the relationship between cost heterogeneity and welfare is ambiguous. Starting from a near-symmetric situation, an increase in heterogeneity reduces domestic welfare {{if the number of}} domestic firms exceeds some critical value. When starting farther from symmetry, the welfare effect is reversed. Our findings are in contrast with the results from the existing literature where lobbying is ignored.

The analysis confirms the general importance of exports, but finds no discernible sign of accelerated growth. There is some evidence supporting the political economist's hypothesis about declining terms of trade due to external demand-side factors. Even so, Namibia seems to represent a vent-for-surplus example in which resource rents do neither sustain early, nor stimulate new, economic growth.
