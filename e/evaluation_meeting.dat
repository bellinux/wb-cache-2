40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} distance classroom visitations and distance <b>evaluation</b> <b>meetings</b> using DVTS and mpeg 2 ts on the gigabit network. These were implemented as mean reform in teacher training. The video transfer systems {{were evaluated by}} a picture distortion which was measured by data loss rates and questionnaires. The results showed as follows; (1) the pictures on DVTS were better than on mpeg 2 ts, however, mpeg 2 ts worked more stable than DVTS. (2) In the distance classroom visitations, DVTS were better than mpeg 2 ts for “video quality ” and “class-room atmosphere”. (3) In the distance evaluation meet-ings, DVTS were better than mpeg 2 ts for “video quality”, “classroom Involvement”, “voice delay ” and “communica-tion effectiveness”. (4) Distance classroom visitations were better than actual classroom visitations, distance <b>evaluation</b> <b>meetings</b> have more use than actual meetings...|$|R

During these meetings, observations showed how participants organised themselves into smaller groups to summarise and collectively condense meeting notes. Each middle leader took on self-initiated responsibilities to complete small group tasks. Collated summaries were reported back to the whole group forming a more comprehensive overall summary that was collected by the coordinating middle leaders and sent it to the development group.|$|R

The observations showed that, {{in the absence of the}} user, the designers were unable to make decisions about technical solutions relating to usability issues, and the expert user's comments during the subsequent meeting significantly altered their decisions. These two observations indicate that the use of a support tool could have a significant role to help asynchronous communication in such a design process...|$|R
30|$|This study {{examined}} the ways {{that a group of}} families engage in the process of early intervention services for their children and how these parents reflect on their engagement in the development of early intervention service planning and delivery (e.g., referral, entry, testing and <b>evaluations,</b> <b>meetings,</b> decision-makings, actual service receiving, etc.). The following research questions guided the study: (a) How do families interact and participate with professionals in the process of accessing early intervention service? (b) How do families reflect on the process of early intervention service while working with their service providers? In studying family participation, my assumption was that professionals’ positions of power and the bureaucracy influenced the quality of families’ participation and their work with professionals while accessing and receiving early intervention services for their children.|$|R

40|$|Partnership working {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} popular way of delivering public services. It is essential, however, that partnership working actually leads to the delivery of improved public services and evaluation {{will be required to}} ensure this is happening. This paper outlines efforts to evaluate the performance of a Community Planning Partnership in the East of Scotland. Community Planning Partnerships were instigated to try to reintegrate the public services in a local authority area which had previously been fragmented. Research on process issues with the partners using a partnership assessment tool and interviews suggest that the partnership is working satisfactorily. Unfortunately outcome evaluation based on focus groups from residents associations suggested serious difficulties and perceptions that services had not improved. As a result of the <b>evaluation,</b> <b>meetings</b> took place between partners and service users and significant progress was made towards resolving these difficulties...|$|R

There is the assumption made that, if they do participate, then this participation will increase the group's general satisfaction of the meeting.

The current research study empirically examines participation's effect on <b>meeting</b> <b>evaluations.</b> This study is a field experiment conducted in a team-based organization, where successful meetings are critical.

The focus of the present article is to demonstrate that peer mentoring is {{an important aspect of}} the meetings, and to address issues contributing to successful mentoring. Likewise, potential obstacles are being presented. In short, a friendly atmosphere, constructive criticism and regular attendance are critical success factors, whereas negative communication and lack of prepared participants are potential destructive factors.

40|$|AbstractSoftware {{architecture}} {{evaluation is}} {{an effective means of}} addressing quality related issues early in the software development lifecycle. Scenario-based approaches to evaluate architecture usually involve a large number of stakeholders, who need to be collocated for face-to-face <b>evaluation</b> <b>meetings.</b> Collocating a large number of stakeholders is an expensive and time-consuming exercise, which may prove to be a hurdle in the wide-spread adoption of disciplined architectural evaluation practices. Drawing upon the successful introduction of groupware applications to support geographically distributed teams in software inspection, and requirements engineering disciplines, we propose the concept of distributed architectural evaluation using Internet-based collaborative technologies. This paper presents a pilot study used to assess the viability of a larger experiment intended to investigate the feasibility of groupware support for distributed software architecture evaluation. In addition, the results of the pilot study provide some preliminary findings on the viability of groupware-supported software architectural evaluation process...|$|R
