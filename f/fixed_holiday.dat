The Uniform Monday Holiday Act would take effect in 1971, and for 1971 and 1972, the race would be scheduled for the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. In 1973 it was scheduled for Monday (but rain delayed it until Wednesday). From 1974 onward, it was scheduled for the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. From 1974 onward, the race would only be held on May 30 if that date fell on a Sunday.|$|R
40|$|Many of the Census Bureau's {{economic}} surveys publish {{seasonally adjusted}} data. As producers of seasonally adjusted time series {{it is important}} to understand why we are making seasonal adjustments. Economists, policy makers, and consumers use time series we publish to make decisions. They try to identify important features of economic series such as direction, turning points, and consistency between other economic indicators. Sometimes seasonal movements can make these features difficult to see, so we publish economic series with the seasonal movements removed for those who prefer to view data without seasonal movements. In this paper we will explore seasonal movements, seasonal adjustment, and we'll take a look at some of the features of economic time series. To understand seasonal movements, we must first have some knowledge about the data where the seasonal movements occur. For our purposes, the data must be in the form of a time series. A time series is simply data of the same kind that are collected regularly over time. For a time series to be useful for analysis, we need data that are comparable over time. That means 1) the reporting periods must be identical (every month, every quarter, or every year), 2) that the measurements should be taken over discrete (non-overlapping), consecutive periods, and 3) that the definition of the concept and the way it is measured should be consistent over time. Figure 1 below is a monthly time series graphed from January 1988 to December 1999. Figure 1 It is easy to see that the series not only fluctuates as time goes on, but it also continuously increases. Upon closer examination we can identify that the fluctuations are cyclical, i. e. the same pattern is repeated each year. For example, notice how the values for July and August are always greater than the values in December and January. These cyclical fluctuations are what we consider seasonal movements or seasonal effects. What exactly is a seasonal effect? A seasonal effect is any effect which is stable in terms of annual timing, direction, and magnitude. Possible causes include natural factors (the weather, amount of rainfall, temperature), administrative measures (starting and ending dates of the school year, corporate policies), and social/cultural/religious traditions (<b>fixed</b> <b>holidays</b> such a...|$|R

The date of the August bank holiday was changed from the first Monday in August to the last Monday in August, and the Whitsun bank holiday (Whit Monday) was replaced by the Late Spring Bank <b>Holiday,</b> <b>fixed</b> as the last Monday in May.

40|$|It has {{now become}} the need of {{everyone}} to go for online retailing due to busy schedule, at least for those who reside and work in urban areas. There {{is no time for}} such category of persons to wait and pay for the services or products which are being consumed.

Till few years back, the working hours of employees were <b>fixed,</b> the <b>holidays</b> were <b>fixed</b> and even the dates of recursion were also fixed. But now, we can not even think of family trips for two or more days and even an evening. This trend has forced us too go for online retailing as it is much easier and faster than the earlier methods. The working group in the urban areas have now started using online retailing for almost all their required services or products. And nothing wrong in that. The paper explains the changing trend and its significant impact on the life of people residing in urban areas.

50|$|Whitsun (also Whitsunday, Whit Sunday or Whit) is {{the name}} used in Britain and Ireland, and among Anglicans and Methodists {{throughout}} the world, for the Christian festival of Pentecost, the eighth Sunday after Easter, which commemorates the descent of the Holy Spirit upon Christ's disciples (Acts of the Apostles chapter 2). In England it took on some characteristics of Beltane, which originated from the pagan celebration of Summer's Day, {{the beginning of the}} summer half-year, in Europe. Whitsuntide, the week following Whitsunday, was one of three vacation weeks for the medieval villein; on most manors he was free from service on the lord's demesne this week, which marked a pause in the agricultural year. Whit Monday, the day after Whitsun, remained a holiday in the UK until 1971 when, with effect from 1972, the movable holiday was replaced with the <b>fixed</b> Spring Bank <b>Holiday</b> on the last Monday in May. Whit was the occasion for varied forms of celebration.|$|R
30|$|The {{second group}} {{contains}} {{the so called}} weekday public holidays [9] (which can be analogously referred to as variable date public holiday or flexible date public <b>holidays</b> [8], or <b>fixed</b> weekday <b>holidays</b> [1]). These <b>holidays</b> are not <b>fixed</b> in their date, but in the weekday of their occurrence. The date of occurrence of the public holiday can thus vary from year to year, but usually falls on a similar part of the year. In many European countries, several Christian public holidays days such as Easter or Ascension can be classified into the second group. In countries like the US or the UK, some bank holidays fall into this category as well. For instance, in the UK, the Spring bank holiday is always at last Monday of May. In states with Islamic oriented public holidays, there are weekday holidays as well. Most of these countries have the so called Lunar Events and Solar Events. The latter ones depend on the Sun and thus match the standard (Georgian) calendar year. The Lunar Events depend on the Moon cycle, typical examples are e.g. Ramadan or Ashura. These public holidays are very special because they move {{in the long run}} around the entire year. This is because the Luna year (or Islam/Muslim year) does not match the periodicity of the sun. From the modeling and forecasting perspective tracking, this phenomenon is very challenging. As temperature cycles follow the Solar year and the energy consumption depends on the temperature (due to cooling and/or heating), this leads to changing interactions between Luna public holidays and temperature effects.|$|R
5000|$|Thanksgiving Day {{football}} {{games in the}} United States are nearly {{as old as the}} game—and the organized holiday—themselves. The first Thanksgiving Day football game took place in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on Thanksgiving Day of 1869, less than two weeks after Rutgers defeated Princeton in New Brunswick, New Jersey in what is widely considered to have been the first American Football game, and only six years after Abraham Lincoln declared the first <b>fixed</b> national Thanksgiving <b>holiday</b> in 1863. On November 17, 1869, the Evening Telegraph newspaper of Philadelphia published the following announcement: [...] "Foot Ball: A foot-ball match between twenty-two players of the Young America Cricket Club and the Germantown Cricket Club will take place on Thanksgiving Day at 12 1/2 o'clock, {{on the grounds of the}} Germantown Club." [...] The proximity of Philadelphia to both Rutgers and Princeton invites speculation that this game may have been played under similar rules and perhaps involved some of the same participants, or at least people familiar with the game played at Rutgers, and a second match at Princeton, earlier that month.|$|R
