2500|$|The load {{regulator}} {{is essentially a}} large potentiometer that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.

2500|$|In older designs, {{the prime}} mover's {{governor}} and a companion device, the load regulator, {{play a central}} role in the control system. The governor has two external inputs: requested engine speed, determined by the engine driver's throttle setting, and actual engine speed (feedback). The governor has two external control outputs: fuel injector setting, which determines the engine <b>fuel</b> <b>rate,</b> and load regulator position, which affects main generator excitation. [...] The governor also incorporates a separate overspeed protective mechanism that will immediately cut off the fuel supply to the injectors and sound an alarm in the cab in the event the prime mover exceeds a defined RPM.

30|$|The {{variation}} of common emission indices with <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rate</b> indicates that linear relationships are present for certain fuel flow fragments, where fuel flow fragments are the <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rate</b> regions {{for a given}} flight phase {{for all of the}} engines. For instance, the given <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> for the climb phases of all the engine models constitute a fuel flow region, while there are other specific fuel flow ranges for the other three flight phases: takeoff, approach, and landing. In other words, there is specific fuel flow region for each flight phase for the engines of each group. For these regions, the relationship between the emission indices and the <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> can be straightforwardly identified. However, for <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> outside the specified regions, particularly between the two regions, the approach based on the aforementioned relationship can lead to incorrect results. Therefore, one needs additional methods which can be obtained utilizing the sequential regions. For instance, if the overall fuel flow ranges are divided into three parts (highest, medium, and lowest regions indicating the amount of fuel flow), then the region between the highest and medium <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> and also between the medium and the lowest <b>fuel</b> flow <b>rates</b> can be described by additional relationships. The required model descriptions are presented in the following section.|$|R
