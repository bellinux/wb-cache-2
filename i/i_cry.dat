500|$|Gaga had posted two {{handwritten}} {{notes of the}} lyrics to [...] "Dope" [...] on social media site Instagram. The verses, then believed {{to be from the}} song, included references to drug intake with lines such as [...] "Been hurtin' low from living high, Toast one last puff and two last regrets" [...] and [...] "each day <b>I</b> <b>cry,</b> I feel so low, from living high", along with the hashtag #DOPE. The images raised concern from Instagram who felt that Gaga needed help and decided to reach out to her. They mailed the singer with the following message: [...] "Hi, Members of the Instagram community have raised concern for your well-being after seeing posts you’ve shared. We’re reaching out to provide you with some important safety information." [...] Gaga mockingly responded to the letter and was dismissive of their concern; she posted on her Twitter account about the mail from the social media. Following the release of the full track list for Artpop, Gaga posted an image of herself on Instagram, wearing a snapback hat, emblazoned with the NASA [...] "meatball" [...] insignia, but replacing the word NASA with DOPE, referring to the design label with the same name.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{announcing the}} character's creation, BBC Publicity {{initially}} stated of her personality: [...] "Maddy's enthusiasm and ability speaks for itself.

She's definitely {{not going to be}} single for very long, but there's a family secret she's harbouring which could just get in the way..." [...] The BBC Holby City homepage describes Maddy as: [...] "enthusiastic and eager to learn. Being with her is fun. She doesn't moan, she loves her job and gets on with it. She just wants to be happy". Comparing the character's personality to her own, [...] Lewington commented: [...] "My good pal, Sir Robert Powell (Mark Williams) has said that a character is often only yourself turned 3 degrees. I think this to be true of Maddy and I. There are similarities. Although she's smarter than me, she does the daftest things! She's says things I wouldn't.

500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't know why <b>I</b> <b>cry</b> but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E

500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; Rotem {{is also one of}} the song's producers. [...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago." [...] According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus, [...] "I don't know why <b>I</b> <b>cry</b> / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I used to love you." [...] In other poignant lyrics, she sings, [...] "I guess nobody taught you, nobody taught you how to love." [...] Kreps further compared the lyrical content of [...] "Used to Love You" [...] to [...] "Dreaming the Same Dream", a song from No Doubt's sixth album Push and Shove. Alex Kritselis of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "recalls some of [...] best ballads, like 'Cool', 'Early Winter', and '4 in the Morning'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luther wrote [...] "Aus tiefer Not schrei ich zu dir" [...] ("From {{depths of}} woe <b>I</b> <b>cry</b> to You") in 1523 as a hymnic version of Psalm 130 {{and sent it}} as a sample to {{encourage}} his colleagues to write psalm-hymns for use in German worship. In a collaboration with Paul Speratus, this and seven other hymns {{were published in the}} Achtliederbuch, the first Lutheran hymnal. In 1524 Luther developed his original four-stanza psalm paraphrase into a five-stanza Reformation hymn that developed the theme of [...] "grace alone" [...] more fully. Because it expressed essential Reformation doctrine, this expanded version of [...] "Aus tiefer Not" [...] was designated as a regular component of several regional Lutheran liturgies and was widely used at funerals, including Luther's own. Along with Erhart Hegenwalt's hymnic version of Psalm 51, Luther's expanded hymn was also adopted for use with the fifth part of Luther's catechism, concerning confession.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality. The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute my success?, I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and know exactly what to do with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, <b>I</b> <b>cry</b> and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. If I tried to look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E

The lyrics on Mastered by Guy at The Exchange have been {{described}} as not being rich with subtext.

[...] while Pitchfork Media noted theme of [...] "girls he's loved or loves, complaints about his day jobs". The lyrics are also littered with musical references. References range from trance music and the band Yes where he sings [...] "Downstair's they're playing trance again / that awful bendy guitar / up through the floor again / It's 9am till <b>I</b> <b>cry</b> / And Time and a Word my friend / Inspires me more than guitars". Pitchfork also described the song [...] "Gondry" [...] as a plea to filmmaker and music video director Michel Gondry to direct one for him with lyrics referencing his music videos for [...] "Let Forever Be" [...] and [...] "Around the World". Stylus Magazine described the album's first single for [...] "Lysine" [...] as sounding like a nutrition manual with lyrics of [...] "many foods are rich in arginine, concentrate on the ones with more lysine". Max Tundra has also stated that not everything he wrote about actually happened. In an interview with Stylus Magazine, he proclaimed that [...] "half the lyrics on that album are true and half are false, but I’m not gonna tell you which half." ...|$|E
