50|$|It {{is clear}} that the Mbam Djerem National Park {{contains}} a representative bloc of the habitat diversity that comprises the ecotone area of Cameroon and its neighbours. The large mammal fauna, now almost gone in West Africa, is still present, although threatened by commercial bushmeat (and some ivory) hunting. Local people in the area have few other activities that bring in money: profits on the small-scale agricultural products grown in the area are much lower than those gained by selling meat. The main methods of commercial hunting are thick wire snares aimed at the larger ungulates, and gun hunting, although small game hunting is carried out using thin wire snares near the villages (often outside the Park border). Conservation success will depend on reducing the levels of large mammal hunting in the area, and encouraging local people to see the wildlife of the Park as a potential for the future, not <b>just</b> <b>today.</b>|$|E
