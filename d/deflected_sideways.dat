5000|$|A {{second type}} of {{electrostatic}} converter initially proposed by Post, then developed by Barr and Moir, is the Periodic Electrostatic Focusing concept. Like the Venetian Blind concept, {{it is also a}} direct collector, but the collector plates are disposed in many stages along the longitudinal axis of an electrostatic focusing channel. As each ion is decelerated along the channel toward zero energy, the particle becomes [...] "over-focused" [...] and is <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways</b> from the beam, then collected. The Periodic Electrostatic Focusing converter typically operates with a 600 keV D-T plasma (as low as 400 keV and up to 800 keV) with efficiency of about 60% under conditions compatible with economics, and an upper technical conversion efficiency up to 90% ignoring economic limitations.|$|E
50|$|When {{water is}} {{supplied}} to the hose, it {{flows through the}} nozzle body to the opening, where it would normally flow straight forward in a stream. Just after leaving the opening it encounters the plug, which <b>deflects</b> the water <b>sideways</b> through an angle. After travelling a short distance the water encounters {{the outside of the}} nozzle opening, which deflects it forward again. This two-step process causes the water to be ejected in a ring-shaped pattern, which causes less water to strike any one location, and thereby reduces erosion while also making it easier to water larger areas.|$|R
40|$|Penetrative {{convection}} spanning multiple scale heights is studied {{within a}} simple stellar envelope consisting of three layers: a convectively unstable middle layer bounded {{above and below}} by stably stratified polytropes. Two-dimensional numerical simulations are used to investigate the fully compressible nonlinear motions that ensue. The cellular flows display prominent downward-directd plumes surrounded by broader regions of upflow. Such asymmetry arises because pressure fluctuations accentuate buoyancy driving in the concentrated plumes and can even lead to weak buoyancy braking in the surrounding ascending flows. As the plumes plunge downward into a region of stable stratification, they serve to excite {{a broad spectrum of}} internal gravity waves there. The induced waves are not passive, for they feed back upon the plumes by <b>deflecting</b> them <b>sideways,</b> thereby modulating the amplitude of the convection in time even in the unstable layer. The penetrative motions that billow upward into the upper stable zone are distinctly weaker, and they cascade back downward toward the unstable zone over a broad horizontal scale. The strong excitation of gravity waves by the convection has implications for gradual mixing deep within a star...|$|R
50|$|Optoelectronic streak cameras work by {{directing}} the light onto a photocathode, which when hit by photons produces electrons via the photoelectric effect.

A linear detector, such as a charge-coupled device (CCD) array is used to measure the streak pattern on the screen, and thus the temporal profile of the light pulse.|$|R
40|$|The {{inverted}} pendulum is {{a classic}} control problem. The system is open – loop unstable and continuously wants to reach equilibrium by falling over. The system must be stabilised by means of feedback. The developed inverted pendulum system is shown in Figure 1. In order to balance the pendulum in the inverted position the pivot must be moved continuously to correct the falling pendulum. This is similar to trying to vertically balance a broom on your hand. This interesting control problem is fundamentally {{the same as those}} involved in rocket or missile propulsion. The rocket has to balance on its engine as it accelerates. As the rocket tends to fall over, the rocket thrust must be <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways</b> to restore the rockets course. This {{is just one of many}} practical applications of the system.

40|$|This paper investigates {{flow past}} a {{rotating}} circular cylinder at 3600 ≤Re≤ 5000 and α≤ 2. 5. The flow parameter α is the circumferential speed at the cylinder surface normalized by the free-stream {{velocity of the}} uniform cross-flow. With particle image velocimetry (PIV), vortex shedding from the cylinder is clearly observed at α< 1. 9. The vortex pattern {{is very similar to}} the vortex street behind a stationary circular cylinder; but with increasing cylinder rotation speed, the wake is observed to become increasing narrower and <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways.</b> Properties of large-scale vortices developed from the shear layers and shed into the wake are investigated with the vorticity field derived from the PIV data. The vortex formation length is found to decrease with increasing α. This leads to a slow increase in vortex shedding frequency with α. At α= 0. 65, vortex shedding is found to synchronize with cylinder rotation, with one vortex being shed every rotation cycle of the cylinder. Vortex dynamics are studied at this value of α with the phase-locked eduction technique. It is found that although the shear layers at two different sides of the cylinder possess unequal vorticity levels, alternating vortices subsequently shed from the cylinder to join the two trains of vortices in the vortex street pattern exhibit very little difference in vortex strength. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Statisticians often employ (conceptually, if not physically) the quincunx to illustrate random walks and the central limit theorem. In particular how a Binomial or Gaussian distribution results from the accumulation of independent random events, that is, the collisions {{in the case of the}} quincunx. But how valid is the assumption of “indepen-dent random events ” made by Galton and countless subsequent statisticians? This paper presents evidence that this assumption is almost certainly not valid and that the quincunx has the richer, more predictable qualities of a low-dimensional deterministic dynamical system. To put this observation into a wider context, the result illustrates that statistical modelling assumptions can obscure more informative dynamics. When such dynamical models are employed they will yield better predictions and forecasts. ...|$|R
40|$|A plasma {{discharge}} {{model has been}} developed for the bulk plasma (also called the extended presheath) in sputtering magnetrons. It can be used both for high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and conventional dc sputtering magnetrons. Demonstration calculations are made for {{the parameters of the}} HiPIMS sputtering magnetron at Link "oping University, and also benchmarked against results in the literature on dc magnetrons. New insight is obtained regarding the structure and time development of the currents, the electric fields and the potential profiles. The transverse resistivity eta(perpendicular to) has been identified as having fundamental importance both for the potential profiles and for the motion of ionized target material through the bulk plasma. New findings are that in the HiPIMS mode, as a consequence of a high value of eta(perpendicular to), (1) there can be an electric field reversal that in our case extends 0. 01 - 0. 04 m from the target, (2) the electric field in the bulk plasma is typically an order of magnitude weaker than in dc magnetrons, (3) in the region of electric field reversal the azimuthal current is diamagnetic in nature, i. e. mainly driven by the electron pressure gradient, and actually somewhat reduced by the electron Hall current which here has a reversed direction and (4) the azimuthal current above the racetrack can, through resistive friction, significantly influence the motion of the ionized fraction of the sputtered material and <b>deflect</b> it <b>sideways,</b> away from the target and towards the walls of the magnetron.

40|$|The {{wake effect}} of yawing an {{upstream}} turbines {{is of interest}} {{in order to increase}} power production. In this study, the case of yawing is considered as asymmetric do to the tower and rotor rotation, and measurements have been performed in a wind tunnel. The rotational effects when yawing are obtained by investigating the difference between a disc and a rotor with the same drag and diameter. This is performed during a tower-symmetrical setup, and shows that the wake deflects approximately 1 radius for the disc and significantly less for the rotor at optimal tip speed ratio. The disc wake is similar to a jet shape in a crossflow and counter-rotating vortices are present, which is not the case for the rotor. Moreover, the differences between yawing in the different direction are investigated and show that for positive yaw-angles, the wake spreads more out and deflects more to the side and to the floor. Furthermore, for negative yaw-angles, the wake is located closer to downstream the rotor centre. These differences are slightly less present during shear flow conditions, in addition to a more <b>sideways</b> <b>deflected</b> wake...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The Coriolis force acts in a {{physically}} rotating system {{so as to}} induce a perpendicular deflection in a moving element. It can be caused inertially, by contact forces, or by both, and its action is restricted to the transverse and the axial directions. In cases where the Coriolis force is caused inertially, the precise physical nature of the inertial force varies according to the chosen point of origin. However, when we choose the origin {{to be at the}} centre of the rotating system, we can ascertain a distinct physical nature for the inertial Coriolis force that distinguishes it from the closely related centrifugal force. Centrifugal force arises from pressure differential, and the relevant causative motion in centrifugal force is directly tied up with the state of rotation. Inertial Coriolis force on the other hand is caused by an independent motion in a rotating system. This motion will induce an inertial aether pressure in the all pervading electron-positron vortex sea, and due to the asymmetry that this motion causes, the inertial pressure will give rise to a Coriolis force. Most of the well known phenomena that are believed to be caused by the Coriolis force are in fact caused by a complex mixture of illusion, general inertia, and dragging forces. Pure inertial Coriolis force in isolation can be observed where a comet is <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways</b> and prevented from collapsing into the Sun. Lesser known cases of the inertial Coriolis force arise in the reversing of the direction of...|$|E
40|$|Tiny {{interstellar}} dust grains causing the polarization {{of light from}} the nearest stars are <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways</b> in the outer heliosheath regions, along with the interstellar magnetic field. Observations of optical polarization of stars beyond the heliosphere nose, and at distances 5 – 200 pc, suggest the direction of the upwind interstellar magnetic field is relatively constant. The polarization vectors indicate an orientation of the local interstellar magnetic field consistent with the position angle in galactic coordinates of PAG ∼ 40 ◦. This position angle is consistent with the offset between interstellar He o and H o flowing into the heliosphere, indicating that the interstellar magnetic field, BIS, is inclined by ∼ 55 ◦ and ∼ 65 ◦, respectively, with respect to the galactic and ecliptic planes. The heliosphere nose is towards Loop I, and if the expansion of Loop I distorted the interarm BIS close to the Sun then the local BIS is directed from southern to northern ecliptic latitudes. The hot and cold poles of the measured Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) dipole moment are nearly symmetric around the heliosphere nose direction, to within ∼ 5 ◦. The v 22 quadrupole vector is directed towards the heliosphere nose. The area vectors of the CMB quadrupole and ocotopole moments are directed towards the band perpendicular to the ecliptic plane formed by the alternate locations for the 3 kHz emissions detected by Voyagers 1 and 2. In the upwind direction, the position angle of the null plane separating the CMB dipole hot and cold poles is almost aligned with the interstellar magnetic field direction at the Sun. The mechanisms and symmetries of possible heliospheric contamination of the low-ℓ CMB modes now require detailed studies based on the interactions of charged particles with an asymmetric heliosphere.

40|$|The {{object of}} this study is {{primarily}} to understand the behavior of the wake behind a yawed turbine, and if yaw can be a method for actively controlling the direction of the wake, and thereby controlling the power output of downstream turbines. Two model wind turbines were tested experimentally in the wind tunnel at NTNU. First of all, the performance of a single upstream turbine operating at fixed rotational speed with varying yaw angles was examined. Further, the aim was to understand to what extent the side force created by the yawed turbine affects the wake, thus the velocity deficits and turbulence intensities in the downstream flow field were experimented on. In addition, the performance and dynamic loads experienced by a second turbine operating at 3 D downstream of the upstream turbine were examined. Finally, the overall efficiency of the wind farm was found for the different yaw scenarios. The study confirms that when a turbine is operating in yaw, both the power and thrust coefficient will decrease significantly with increasing yaw angle. Yawing the upstream turbine will also affect the behavior of the wake to a great extent, as the wake is deformed and <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways.</b> When the upstream turbine is yawed 40 &# 176;, the width of the wake at 3 D downstream is decreased to half its size of un-yawed condition and is shifted about 0. 5 D sideways. The performance of the downstream turbine increases with increasing yaw angle of the upstream turbine. When the upstream turbine is yawed 50 &# 176;, the downstream turbine obtains a power gain of 24 % compared to the un-yawed condition, resulting in a maximum power coefficient of 33 %. This confirms that the second turbine experiences less interaction with an upstream turbine operating under yawed conditions. It was found that the optimal wind farm efficiency of the two model turbines occurs when the upstream turbine is yawed between 0 &# 176; to 30 &# 176;, resulting in a wind farm efficiency of approximately 54 % for all three conditions. The power loss experienced by the upstream turbine is offset by the corresponding power gain of the downstream turbine. However, fatigue loads were found to act on both the turbine operating in yaw and the downstream turbine partly exposed to the wake, which will eventually reduce their longevity. Therefore, the result of the study carried out on two wind turbines in the wind tunnel suggests that it will not be beneficial to use yaw as a mechanism for controlling the wake direction and thereby increase the wind farm efficiency since the power gain of the downstream turbine will be offset by the power loss of the yawed turbine. Tailoring the blade design of the yawed turbines may, however, {{have a positive impact on}} the overall wind farm efficiency and also reduce fatigue loads. </p...|$|E
40|$|In a {{coordinate}} system fixed {{with respect to}} the rotating Earth, the Coriolis force <b>deflects</b> an object <b>sideways</b> relative to its direction of motion. A beautiful demonstration of that effect is the Foucault pendulum, illustrated in figure 1 a. As the long pendulum rocks back and forth, the Coriolis force deflects it the same way on both the forward and reverse swings—to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The net result is that the pendulum’s plane of oscillation rotates clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere, a change evidenced in figure 1 a by the little cylinders that the pendulum has knocked down. The time rate of change of the oscillation direction is given by ϕ̇=−Ωcosθϕ̇=−Ωcosθ, where, as illustrated in figure 1 b, Ω is the rotation rate of Earth and θθ is the colatitude—that is, the angle between the local vertical and Earth’s rotation axis. The minus sign arises because the pendulum maintains its oscillation direction as Earth rotates under it. As a consequence, the pendulum’s direction of oscillation rotates in the sense opposite that of Earth’s rotation, a result most readily visualized by imagining the pendulum to be at the North Pole...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Stepped spillways {{constructed}} of roller compacted concrete (RCC) is a hydraulic and cost effective measure to dissipate energy of large water flows over the spillway of a dam. Stepped spillways, like other spillway types, have its limitations and {{a measure to}} improve the energy dissipation effectiveness is proposed. Two hydraulic models were constructed at the hydraulics laboratory of the Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) in Pretoria, South Africa. The scales of the models were 1 : 20 and 1 : 30. The study proposes the use of triangular protrusions applied over the spillway surface. The protrusions have the same height as the steps, with {{the width of the}} protrusions varying. The triangular protrusions <b>deflect</b> the water <b>sideways</b> resulting in higher energy losses. The results indicate that the protrusions reduce scouring at the toe of the dam, thus increasing the roughness of the steps. It also indicate that aeration occur earlier than with normal stepped spillways. An optimal spacing, lateral and across the steps, are proposed. The construction of the protrusions is also discussed, as well as the cost implications. It is concluded that the protrusions are effective at a unit discharge up to 35 m 3 /s. m. This value is however dependent on the configuration of the apron downstream of the toe of the dam. It is proposed that protrusions be added on the downstream face of the dam on every second step, with one protrusion and then no protrusion alternating in the flow path. It is recommended that the protrusions be cast in situ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe optimal {{root system}} {{architecture}} for increased tree anchorage {{has not yet}} been determined and in particular, the role of the tap root remains elusive. In Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster Ait.), tap roots may {{play an important role in}} anchoring young trees, but in adult trees, their growth is often impeded by the presence of a hard pan layer in the soil and the tap root becomes a minor component of tree anchorage. To understand better the role of the tap root in young trees, we grew cuttings (no tap root present) and seedlings where the tap root had (-) or had not (+) been pruned, in the field for 7 years. The force (F) necessary to <b>deflect</b> the stem <b>sideways</b> was then measured and divided by stem cross-sectional area (CSA), giving a parameter analogous to stress during bending. Root systems were extracted and root architecture and wood mechanical properties (density and longitudinal modulus of elasticity, E L) determined. In seedlings (-) tap roots, new roots had regenerated where the tap root had been pruned, whereas in cuttings, one or two lateral roots had grown downwards and acted as tap roots. Cuttings had significantly less lateral roots than the other treatments, but those near the soil surface were 14 % and 23 % thicker than plants (+) and (-) tap roots, respectively. Cuttings were smaller than seedlings, but were not relatively less resistant to stem deflection, probably because the thicker lateral roots compensated for their lower number. Apart from stem volume which was greater in trees (+) tap roots, no significant differences with regard to size or any root system variable were found in plants (-) or (+) tap roots. In all treatments, lateral roots were structurally reinforced through extra growth along the direction of the prevailing wind, which also improved tap root anchorage. Predictors of log F/CSA differed depending on treatment: in trees (-) tap roots, a combination of the predictors stem taper and %volume allocated to deep roots was highly regressed with log F/CSA (R 2 = 0. 83), unlike plants (+) tap roots where the combined predictors of lateral root number and root depth were best regressed with log F/CSA (R 2 = 0. 80). In cuttings, no clear relationships between log F/CSA and any parameter could be found. Wood density and E L did not differ between roots, but did diminish with increasing distance from the stem in lateral roots. E L was significantly lower in lateral roots from cuttings. Results showed that nursery techniques influence plant development but that the architectural pattern of Maritime pine root systems is stable, developing a sinker root system even when grown from cuttings. Anchorage is affected but the consequences for the long-term are still not known. Numerical modelling may be the only viable method to investigate the function that each root plays in adult tree anchorag...|$|R
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis involves experimental and theoretical studies related to a thin film deposition technique called high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), and more specifically the plasma properties and how they influence the coating. HiPIMS is an ionized physical vapor deposition technique based on conventional direct current magnetron sputtering (DCMS). The major {{difference between the two}} methods is that HiPIMS has the added advantage of providing substantial ionization of the sputtered material, and thus presents many new opportunities for the coating industry. Understanding the dynamics of the charged species and their effect on thin film growth in the HiPIMS process is therefore essential for producing high-quality coatings. In {{the first part of the}} thesis a new type of anomalous electron transport was found. Investigations of the transport resulted in the discovery that this phenomenon could quantitatively be described as being related and mediated by highly nonlinear waves, likely due to the modified two-stream instability, resulting in electric field oscillations in the MHz-range (the lower hybrid frequency). Measurements in the plasma confirmed these oscillations as well as trends predicted by the theory of these types of waves. Using electric probes, the degree of anomalous transport in the plasma could also be determined by measuring the current density ratio between the azimuthal current density (of which the Hall current density is one contribution) and the discharge current density, Jϕ / JD. The results were verified in another series of measurements using Rogowski probes to directly gain insight into the internal currents in the HiPIMS discharge. The results provided important insights into understanding the mechanism behind the anomalous transport. It was furthermore demonstrated that the current ratio Jϕ / JD is inversely proportional to the transverse resistivity, η⊥, which governs how well momentum in the direction of the current is transferred from the electrons to the ions in the plasma. By looking at the forces involved in the charged particle transport it was expected that the azimuthally rotating electrons would exert a volume force on the ions tangentially outwards from the circular race track region. The effect of having an anomalous transport would therefore be that the ions were transported across the magnetic field lines and to a larger extent <b>deflected</b> <b>sideways,</b> instead of solely moving from the target region towards a substrate placed in front of the target some distance away. From the experiments it was confirmed that a substantial fraction of sputtered material is transported radially away from the cathode and lost to the walls in HiPIMS as well as in DCMS, but more so for HiPIMS giving one possible explanation to why the deposition rate is lower for HiPIMS compared to DCMS. Moreover, in a separate investigation on the energy flux it could be determined that the heating due to radial energy flux reached as much as 60 % of the axial energy flux, which is likely a result of the anomalous transport of charged species present in the HiPIMS discharge. Also, the recorded ion energy flux confirmed theoretical estimations on this type of transport regarding energy and direction. In order to gain a better understanding of the complete discharge regime, as well as providing a link between the HiPIMS and DCMS processes, the current and voltage characteristics were investigated for discharge pulses longer than 100 μs. The current behavior was found to be strongly correlated with the chamber gas pressure. Based on these experiments it was suggested that high-current transients commonly seen in the HiPIMS process cause a depletion of the working gas in the area in front of the target, and thereby a transition to a DCMS-like high voltage, lower current regime, which alters the deposition conditions. In the second part of the thesis, using the results and ideas from the fundamental plasma investigations, it was possible to successfully implement different coating improvements. First, the concept of sideways deposition of thin films was examined in a dual-magnetron system providing a solution for coating complex shaped surfaces. Here, the two magnetrons were facing each other having opposing magnetic fields forcing electrons, and thereby also ionized material to be transported radially towards the substrate. In this way deposition inside tubular substrates can be made in a beneficial way. Last, the densification process of thin films using HiPIMS was investigated for eight different materials (Al, Ti, Cr, Cu, Zr, Ag, Ta, and Pt). Through careful characterization of the thin film properties it was determined that the HiPIMS coatings were approximately 5 - 15 % denser compared to the DCMS coatings. This could be attributed to the increased ion bombardment seen in the HiPIMS process, where the momentum transfer between the growing film and the incoming ions is very efficient due to the equal mass of the atoms constituting the film and the bombarding species, leading to a less pronounced columnar microstructure. The deposition conditions were also examined using a global plasma model, which was in good agreement with the experimental results...|$|E
