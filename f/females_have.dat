5|$|Differences in {{vulnerability}} to lead-induced neurological damage {{between males and}} <b>females</b> <b>have</b> also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be.|$|E
5|$|<b>Females</b> <b>have</b> {{been found}} to {{experience}} different eating habits {{at different stages of}} their menstrual cycle, with food intake being higher during the luteal phase than the follicular phase. Food intake increases by approximately 10% during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.|$|E
5|$|Midbody {{there are}} 29–41 rows of dorsal scales. These are {{strongly}} keeled {{except for the}} outermost rows. The ventral scale count is 123–147, the subcaudals 14–38. <b>Females</b> <b>have</b> no more than 24 subcaudals. The anal scale is single.|$|E
50|$|A {{study of}} {{students}} of the Polytechnic, Ibadan found that in their lifetimes 1.7% (2.5% of males and 1.1% of <b>females)</b> <b>had</b> raped and 2.7% (5.3% of males and 0.9% of <b>females)</b> <b>had</b> attempted rape.|$|R

50|$|The <b>female</b> <b>has</b> a {{wingspan}} of 35-40 mm.|$|R
5|$|The female has, on average, a {{narrower}} black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. Her cap may be gray, but many <b>females</b> <b>have</b> black caps and cannot be reliably {{distinguished from the}} male in the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of <b>females</b> <b>have</b> black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% in the Rocky Mountains, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles {{are similar to the}} adult, but duller plumaged.|$|E
5|$|The winghead shark is {{viviparous}} {{like the}} rest of its family, with the developing young sustained to term by a placental connection to the mother. Adult <b>females</b> <b>have</b> a single functional ovary, on the right, and two functional uteri. Compartments form inside the uteri during pregnancy, one for each embryo. In the waters around Mumbai, the mating season is in July and August during the monsoon. The males bite at the sides of the females as a prelude to copulation. Females can reproduce every year; the litter size ranges from 6 to 25 pups, and increases with the size of the female. The gestation period lasts 8–9 months off western India, and 10–11 months off northern Australia. Pregnant <b>females</b> <b>have</b> been reported to quarrel with each other.|$|E
5|$|Defending a {{breeding}} territory is fairly common among male dragonflies, especially among species that congregate around ponds in large numbers. The territory contains desirable {{features such as}} a sunlit stretch of shallow water, a special plant species, or a particular substrate necessary for egg-laying. The territory may be small or large, depending on its quality, the time of day, {{and the number of}} competitors, and may be held for a few minutes or several hours. Some dragonflies signal ownership with striking colours on the face, abdomen, legs, or wings. The common whitetail (Plathemis lydia) dashes towards an intruder holding its white abdomen aloft like a flag. Other dragonflies engage in aerial dogfights or high-speed chases. A female must mate with the territory holder before laying her eggs. There is also conflict between the males and females. Females may sometimes be harassed by males {{to the extent that it}} affects their normal activities including foraging and in some dimorphic species <b>females</b> <b>have</b> evolved multiple forms with some forms appearing deceptively like males. In some species <b>females</b> <b>have</b> evolved behavioural responses such as feigning death to escape the attention of males.|$|E

30|$|This {{study found}} that Malaysian <b>females</b> <b>had</b> {{significantly}} greater number of sinuous shaped rugae than the Egyptian females (P-value[*]=[*] 0.005) while the Egyptian <b>females</b> <b>had</b> significantly greater percentage of line shaped rugae (43.68 %) than the Malaysian females (27.25 %) and the P-value[*]=[*] 0.003 as showed in Table 1.|$|R
50|$|The <b>female</b> <b>had</b> 11 large (diameter 5 mm) eggs.|$|R
5|$|<b>Females</b> <b>have</b> four {{pairs of}} mammae, {{as usual in}} oryzomyines. Like most rice rats, Transandinomys species have twelve {{thoracic}} (chest) and seven lumbar vertebrae. According to a study in Costa Rica, T.bolivaris has 58chromosomes {{and the number of}} chromosomal arms (fundamental number) is 80 (2n=58, FN=80). Studies in Ecuador and Venezuela have recorded several different karyotypes in T.talamancae, with the number of chromosomes ranging from 34 to 54 and the fundamental number from 60 to 67.|$|E
5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat their mates during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the <b>females</b> <b>have</b> hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|Gryllus firmus {{exhibits}} wing polymorphism; {{some individuals}} have fully functional, long hind wings {{and others have}} short wings and cannot fly. The short-winged <b>females</b> <b>have</b> smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development, and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.|$|E
5|$|Three of the skulls {{displayed}} {{evidence that}} they had experienced violence; a probable adult <b>female</b> <b>had</b> an unhealed injury on the left frontal bone, an adult of indeterminate sex had an unhealed fracture on the left frontal, and a second adult <b>female</b> <b>had</b> a healed depressed fracture on the right frontal.|$|R
50|$|This hairstyle {{starts in}} the Ayutthaya period. In that period, it often has a war many times. So, it {{is the reason that}} the hairstyles in Ayutthaya period has changed from the Sukhothai period. Both of male and <b>female</b> <b>have</b> to have these hairstyles. For male, this hairstyle is so {{convenient}} for war because it is short and they did not have time for dressed up or concern about the hairstyle. For <b>female,</b> they <b>have</b> to have this hairstyle because this hairstyle is short and it looks like a man. So, it can be easily for escape or survive when the war was happened. But not every <b>female</b> <b>has</b> a short hair. Some <b>female</b> <b>has</b> the long hair because she loves and she wants to have the long hair.|$|R
50|$|C. parangexanthematica <b>females</b> <b>had</b> a {{total body}} length of 8.80 mm.|$|R
5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior {{to the birth of}} the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these <b>females</b> <b>have</b> a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adult females, {{but have}} broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly streaked rather than scalloped appearance, {{and the overall}} appearance is browner rather than uniformly blackish. Juvenile males have brownish-orange feet while juvenile <b>females</b> <b>have</b> brownish feet and a dusky greyish-green bill.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other members}} of its family, the whitetip reef shark is viviparous; once the {{developing}} embryos exhaust their supply of yolk, the yolk sac is converted into a placental connection through which the mother delivers nourishment {{for the remainder of}} gestation. Mature <b>females</b> <b>have</b> a single functional ovary, on the left side, and two functional uteruses. The reproductive cycle is biennial.|$|E

5|$|Male elands have 31 diploid {{chromosomes}} and <b>females</b> <b>have</b> 32. The male (Y) chromosome {{has been}} translocated {{to the short}} arm of an autosome. Both the X and Y replicate late; they do not match well and are variable. The chromosomes resemble those of the greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros).|$|E
5|$|Males {{and females}} {{of all ages}} can be {{distinguished}} by {{the position of the}} two round genital openings or gonopores. In females, they are at the bases of the third pair of pereiopods, while in males they are {{at the base of the}} fifth (last) pereiopods, furthest from the head and the closest to the abdomen. Mature <b>females</b> <b>have</b> a small claw on the fifth pereiopod, and enlarged pleopods.|$|E
5|$|Males have {{relatively}} small testes {{compared to other}} lemurs, and their canine teeth are {{the same size as}} those seen in females. During the dry season, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of sexual dimorphism are consistent with the theory of sexual selection for monogamous species and female dominance respectively. <b>Females</b> <b>have</b> two pairs of nipples.|$|E
50|$|Excessive Drinking: Percentage {{of adults}} that report either binge {{drinking}} (males having {{five or more}} drinks on one occasion, <b>females</b> <b>having</b> four or more drinks on one occasion) or heavy drinking (males having more than two drinks per day, <b>females</b> <b>having</b> more than one drink per day over a 30-day period). Data from CDC’s BRFSS.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} period, the Arabs {{used the term}} Sayyid and Sharif to denote {{descendants}} from both Hasan and Husayn. However, in the modern era, the term 'Sharif' (Sharifah for <b>females)</b> <b>has</b> been used to denote descendants from Hasan, and the term 'Sayyid' (Sayyidah for <b>females)</b> <b>has</b> been used to denote descendants from Husayn.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>female</b> <b>has</b> {{a smaller}} red wing patch, and more slaty head.|$|R
5|$|The abdomen has ten segments, {{each with}} a pair of spiracles for respiration. Segment ten bears a pair of cerci, a pair of anal styles, the anus and the {{external}} genitalia. Males have an aedeagus through which they secrete sperm during copulation and <b>females</b> <b>have</b> spermathecae for storing sperm and an ovipositor through which the ootheca is laid.|$|E
5|$|The {{operational}} {{sex ratio}} in the {{poison dart frog}} family is mostly female biased. This leads to a few characteristic behaviors and traits found in organisms with an uneven sex ratio. In general, <b>females</b> <b>have</b> a choice of mate. In turn, males show brighter coloration, are territorial, and are aggressive toward other males. Females select mates based on coloration (mainly dorsal), calling perch location, and territory.|$|E
5|$|The species {{lives in}} families, with {{population}} densities of 10 to 12 individuals per hectare. Family feeding territories do not overlap with each other, and mostly {{remain the same}} each year; however, the home territories of different family groups are larger and do overlap with each other. Both males and <b>females</b> <b>have</b> been observed to mark corners of stones mostly located {{near the center of}} their home territory, from April to December, by rubbing their neck glands against them.|$|E
