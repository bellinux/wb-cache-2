40|$|Sex {{differences}} exist for stress reactivity {{as well as}} for the prevalence of depression, which is more frequent in women of reproductive age and often precipitated by stressful events. In animals, the differential effect of stress on male's and female's emotional behavior has been well documented. Crosstalk between the gonadal and stress hormones, in particular between estrogens and glucocorticoids, underlie these sex differences on stress vulnerability. We have previously shown that corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG) deficiency in a mouse model (Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.)</b> leads, in males, to an increased despair-like behavior caused by suboptimal corticosterone stress response. Because CBG displays a sexual dimorphism and is regulated by estrogens, we have now investigated whether it plays a role in the sex differences observed for emotional reactivity in mice. By analyzing Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> and wild-type (WT) animals of both sexes, we detected sex differences in despair-like behavior in WT mice but not in Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> animals. We showed through ovariectomy and estradiol (E 2) replacement that E 2 levels explain the sex differences found in WT animals. However, the manipulation of E 2 levels did not affect the emotional behavior of Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> females. As Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> males, Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> females have markedly reduced corticosterone levels across the circadian cycle and also after stress. Plasma free corticosterone levels in Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> mice measured immediately after stress were blunted in both sexes compared to WT mice. A trend for higher mean levels of ACTH in Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> mice was found for both sexes. The turnover of a corticosterone bolus was increased in Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> Finally, the glucocorticoid-regulated immediate early gene early growth response 1 (Egr 1) showed a blunted mRNA expression in the hippocampus of Cbg <b>k.</b> <b>o.</b> mutants while mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors presented sex differences but equivalent mRNA expression between genotypes. Thus, in our experimental conditions, sex differences for despair-like behavior in WT mice are explained by estrogens levels. Also, in both sexes, the presence of CBG is required to attain optimal glucocorticoid concentrations and normal emotional reactivity, although in females this is apparent only under low E 2 concentrations. These findings suggest a complex interaction of CBG and E 2 on emotional reactivity in females...|$|R

40|$|Correlations {{are shown}} to arise in nonidentical mixed-particle pairs like <b>K</b> <b>o</b> ¯ <b>K</b> <b>o</b> when {{observed}} in identical decay modes like KSKS in multiparticle final states containing many partial waves. No enhancement {{is found in}} any single partial wave and all partial wave analyses of the s-wave threshold resonance ao and fo should give the same results for all decay modes. In CP violation experiments where Bo − ¯ Bo pairs are inclusively produced and correlated decays into ψKS and leptonic modes are observed, the CP-violating lepton asymmetry is enhanced {{by a factor of}} two in the kinematic region where Bose enhancement occurs. The Bose-Einstein correlations observed between identical charged pions [1] or charged kaons [2] in experiments leading to multiparticle final states are a consequence of quantum mechanics and well understood. The <b>K</b> <b>o</b> and ¯ <b>K</b> <b>o</b> are two different particles and one might expect no correlations. But detecting neutral kaon pairs by 2 π decays projects out a final KSKS state which does have two identical bosons (we neglect small CP-violation effects). A straightforward calculation with all proper interference terms and phases shows an enhancement in the momentum distribution of the KSKS system. Experiments [3] have now seen a KSKS enhancement identical to that found for the π + π + system in the region of phase space where the two kaons have nearly the same momentum. Whether one calls this Bose enhancement or something else is a matter of semantics and taste. In this paper we first show how Bose enhancement arises in production of flavor neutral meson pairs which are not identical bosons. We then investigate effects of these Bose correlations on experiments in hadron spectroscopy and searches for CP violation. Consider a reaction in which a final state denoted by ∣ f(pα, pβ, ξ) 〉 containing a <b>K</b> <b>o</b> ¯ <b>K</b> <b>o</b> pair with momenta respectively pα and pβ is produced inclusively with an arbitrary number of assorted other particles, ∣ f(pα, pβ, ξ) 〉 ≡ ∣ ∣ <b>K</b> <b>o</b> (pα); ¯ <b>K</b> <b>o</b> (pβ); ξ) ...|$|R

40|$|Mannans are hemicellulosic polysaccharides in {{the plant}} primary cell wall (CW). Mature seeds, {{specially}} their endosperm cells, have CWs rich in mannan-based polymers that confer a strong mechanical resistance for the radicle protrusion upon germination. The rupture of the seed coat and endosperm are two sequential events during the germination of Arabidopsis thaliana. Endo-β-mannanases (MAN; EC. 3. 2. 1. 78) are hydrolytic enzymes that catalyze cleavage of β 1 → 4 bonds in the mannan-polymer. In the genome of Arabidopsis, the endo-β-mannanase (MAN) family is represented by eight members. The expression of these eight MAN genes has been systematically explored in different organs of this plant and only four of them (AtMAN 7, AtMAN 6, AtMAN 2 and AtMAN 5) are expressed in the germinating seeds. Moreover, in situ hybridization analysis shows that their transcript accumulation is restricted to the micropylar endosperm and to the radicle and this expression disappears soon after radicle emergence. T-DNA insertion mutants in these genes (<b>K.</b> <b>O.</b> MAN 7, <b>K.</b> <b>O.</b> MAN 6, <b>K.</b> <b>O.</b> MAN 5), except that corresponding to AtMAN 2 (<b>K.</b> <b>O.</b> MAN 2), germinate later than the wild type (Wt). <b>K.</b> <b>O.</b> MAN 6 is the most affected in the germination time course with a t 50 almost double {{than that of the}} Wt.
