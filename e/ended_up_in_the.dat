The library revealed the existence of the document in 1999, and sent it on permanent loan to the Skirball Cultural Center, which placed it on public display. The document was transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration in Washington in August 2010.|$|E

Around 1630 Quiney tried to sell the lease on the house but was prevented by his kinsmen. In 1633, to protect the interests of Judith and the children, the lease was signed over to the trust of John Hall, Susanna's husband, Thomas Nash, the husband of Judith's niece, and Richard Watts, vicar of nearby Harbury, who was Quiney's brother-in-law and who had officiated at Thomas and Judith's wedding. Eventually, in November 1652, the lease to The Cage <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Thomas' eldest brother, Richard Quiney, a grocer in London.|$|E
5|$|Astle {{made his}} ODI debut against the West Indies at Eden Park, Auckland in January 1995. His first century came {{the same year}} against India at the Vidharba Cricket Association Ground, Nagpur. Opening the batting, Astle made 114 runs from 128 balls in a match which New Zealand won. He {{followed}} that with another century in the 1996 Cricket World Cup, against England. Astle's match-winning innings of 119 against Pakistan finds a mention in the 100 best ODI innings of all-time by Wisden in 2002. He scored his second century in World Cup, this time against Zimbabwe in the 2003 tournament. His highest ODI total of 145 not out was achieved against the United States during the 2004 Champions Trophy. In ODIs Astle was most successful against India making five centuries.

5|$|In {{that first}} {{election}} {{he was in}} favour of Henryk II Walezy (later, Henry III of France). Subsequently, {{he was part of}} the diplomatic mission that traveled to France to finish formalities with the newly elected king. He also published a pamphlet praising the new king, and thus suffered a loss of face when Henryk secretly abandoned Poland and returned to France. During the following 1575 election he was a vocal enemy of the Habsburg dynasty and its candidate, and this anti-Habsburg stance, resounding among the lesser nobility, helped him regain his popularity. For the king, Zamoyski championed the case of a Polish candidate, which <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> marriage of Anna Jagiellon with the anti-Habsburg Stephen Bathory of Transylvania.|$|E
5|$|Kesha {{had been}} {{recording}} demos {{for a few}} years, when one of her demos <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Samantha Cox, senior director of writer/publisher relations at BMI. Cox, {{who had worked with}} Kesha before, passed along the demos to a friend at BMI, who passed it to the manager of Lukasz Gottwald, known as Dr. Luke. At the age of eighteen, Kesha signed to Dr. Luke's label, Kemosabe Records, and his publishing company, Prescription Songs. Luke was busy with other projects at the time, and Kesha ultimately wound up signed to David Sonenberg's management company, DAS. While at DAS she worked with several top writers and producers, but rarely worked with or even spoke to Luke. DAS searched for a label deal for Kesha despite her still being in a signed contract with Luke. Kara DioGuardi, an artists and repertoire (A) representative for Warner, was also interested in signing Kesha but the deal never went through because of the outstanding contract with Luke. Shortly after, Kesha and DAS parted ways and Kesha wound up reunited with Luke.|$|E
5|$|On 20 August 1948, the Jewish National Fund {{called for}} {{building}} a settlement on some of al-Birwa's lands, and on 6 January 1949, Yas'ur, a kibbutz, was established there. In 1950, the moshav of Ahihud was inaugurated on the village's western lands. According to Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, one of al-Birwa's schools, two shrines for local sages, and three houses remained standing as of 1982. One of the shrines was domed and built of stone. Most of the structures stood amid cacti, weeds, olive and fig groves, and mulberry trees. Most of al-Birwa's inhabitants fled to nearby Arab towns and villages, including Tamra, Kabul, Jadeidi-Makr, Kafr Yasif, and other localities. Some fled to Lebanon, and <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Shatila refugee camp, in the outskirts of Beirut, where Palestinian historian Nafez Nazzal interviewed them in 1973. Among the refugees of al-Birwa was Mahmoud Darwish, {{who was born in}} the village in 1941 and lived part of his childhood there.|$|E
