5|$|The RAF {{committed}} No. 3 Group RAF to the attack. Usually {{the group}} consisted of 9 Squadron, 37 Squadron, 38 Squadron, 99 Squadron, 115 Squadron, 149 Squadron together with 214 Squadron and 21 Squadron in reserve. However, the Group was hastily set up for daylight missions, having been intended for night bombing attacks. The quality of the training was dubious, many of the crews had not been given proper tuition for <b>formation</b> <b>flying.</b> Only 9 and 214 squadrons were able to fly in perfect formations. In an effort to improve <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> and give crews experience of combat conditions, No. 3 Group's No. 37 Squadron practised mock combats with RAF Fighter Command Supermarine Spitfires from RAF Tangmere. Warnings were given by the Spitfire pilots {{that they could have}} decimated the squadron within ten minutes because of their poor <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> and lack of fighter escort, but were ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a failure {{as a result of}} poor <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E
5|$|During the war RAF Uxbridge was {{tasked with}} {{despatching}} personnel {{to and from}} training and operational units in Northern France. It also housed the RAF Uxbridge Language School, where Polish Air Force pilots were taught key RAF codewords. Pilots practised <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> on the station football pitch, using tricycles fitted with radios, compasses and speed indicators. British Expeditionary Force troops returning from Dunkirk were processed at Uxbridge. In mid-1940, staff at the station processed an average of 2,500 recruits and experienced troops per week.|$|E

50|$|Activated in England in 1943 as an Eighth Air Force {{heavy bomber}} {{pathfinder}} group, flying RADAR-equipped B-17s that preceded bomber <b>formations</b> <b>flying</b> from England to Germany and indicated targets such as airfields, submarine installations, and marshalling yards obscured by weather. Squadron's aircraft were assigned individually to various groups during combat missions. Returned to United States {{after the end}} of the war in Europe, but inactivated in California in 1945.|$|R
5|$|No. 77 Squadron {{returned}} to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7July. The Mirages {{were charged with}} interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages ever saw combat. No.481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, {{as well as most}} heavy maintenance. No.77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> at night on 24June 1976.|$|E
5|$|No.285 Squadron {{generally}} holds two {{pilot and}} navigator conversion courses per year. Each six-month course includes approximately 120 {{hours in the}} FFMS and 30 hours in flying aircraft. It culminates in an airborne operation module, which includes <b>formation</b> <b>flying,</b> airdrops, night landings with night-vision goggles, and simulated combat utilising the C-130's self-defence systems to prepare the aircrew for conditions in Middle East deployments. Following this exercise, the new C-130 aircrew are posted to No.37 Squadron. No.285 Squadron may run 30 or more courses each year for ground support staff; these courses can last {{from one day to}} five weeks.|$|E
5|$|No.410 Squadron is now (2010) a Royal Canadian Air Force {{aircraft}} squadron {{located at}} Canada's primary CF-18 training base at Cold Lake, Alberta. In 1982, the squadron was renamed 410 Tactical Fighter (Operational Training) Squadron. It runs one fighter pilot course every year, training approximately 20 pilots. The training program consists of {{nine months of}} ground school, simulator flights, and operational flying. Students are taken from among the graduates of a Fighter Lead-In Training Course and are provided {{with the knowledge of}} basic skills in both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. Areas covered in depth include aircraft handling, instrument flight, <b>formation</b> <b>flying,</b> night flying, navigation, air-to-air refuelling, and weapons delivery and tactics.|$|E
30|$|The German Aerospace Center (DLR) {{has been}} {{operating}} Germany’s first two <b>formations</b> <b>flying</b> Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellites, TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X, with the objective to generate an updated global DEM. The DEM has a spatial resolution of 0.4 arc-second (≈ 12 [*]m) with 2 – 4 [*]m in relative vertical accuracy. The vertical datum of TanDEM-X is WGS 84 -G 1150 ellipsoidal heights (Wessel 2016) and it has changed to geoid system to standardize the datum system with SRTM. As the DEM has higher accuracy and higher resolution than SRTM, it used for training of ANN after the resampling.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, Miller {{was elected}} {{a member of}} Parliament. In this capacity, he {{successfully}} lobbied for government support for civil aviation. He gave flying demonstrations, toured the country to popularise flying, and encouraged the <b>formation</b> of <b>flying</b> clubs.|$|R

5|$|Number 88 Squadron was a {{new unit}} {{and part of the}} {{expansion}} schemes of the late 1930s designed {{to increase the number of}} aircraft in response to the threat of the German Luftwaffe. He joined the squadron on 6 December 1937 and it was re-equipped with the Fairey Battle. He flew the aircraft for the first time on 30 December. On 1 March 1938 his commission as pilot officer was confirmed and in May 1938 he joined the No. 7 Armament Training Station in Northumberland to engage in <b>formation</b> <b>flying,</b> aerial gunnery and bombing practice. It also practiced mock attacks on the British Army 2nd Infantry Division. By the time war broke out in September 1939, MacLachlan had two years of experience of flying the machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{course at}} SFTS {{typically}} {{consisted of two}} streams, intermediate and advanced, and included such techniques as instrument flying, night flying, advanced aerobatics, <b>formation</b> <b>flying,</b> dive bombing, and aerial gunnery. The total duration of training varied during the war as demand for aircrew fluctuated. Initially running for 16 weeks, the course was cut to 10 weeks (which included 75 hours flying time) in October 1940. A year later it was raised to 12 weeks (including 100 hours flying time), and again to 16 weeks two months later. It continued to increase after this, peaking at 28 weeks in June 1944.|$|E
5|$|Wendover's {{mission was}} to train heavy bomb groups. The {{training}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator groups began in April 1942, {{with the arrival of}} the 306th Bomb Group flying B-17s. From March 1942 through April 1944, Wendover AAF hosted twenty newly formed B-17 and B-24 groups during one phase of their group training. The Second Air Force organized bombardment training into three phases. In the first, training focused on the individual crew members. In the second, training involved the whole crew, who would conduct training together. The third and final phase saw the group's crews training together, with <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> and practice combat missions. Until the end of 1943, each phase of training was conducted at a different base.|$|E

5|$|Finucane had {{completed}} 108 fighter operations over France {{by the fourth}} week of June 1942. On 27 June, Leigh-Mallory, {{with the approval of}} Sholto Douglas, promoted Finucane to wing commander. Finucane became the youngest wing commander in the RAF, and was to lead the Hornchurch Wing. Duncan Smith later said, that though he admired Finucane, he resented the young fighter pilot's appointment and felt as an older, experienced leader, he could have led the wing himself. Duncan Smith also felt the press gave the young pilot too much attention. Nevertheless, the two maintained a cordial relationship. In his short time as wing commander of Hornchurch, Finucane made a few alterations to the formation. The most notable was to tighten flying discipline, loosen <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> and increase low-level navigation skills.|$|E
5|$|In December 1937 {{he began}} flight {{training}} at the No. 7 Elementary Flying School (EFS) at Desford. It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor. For Braham, progress was slow and {{he made his first}} solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction. On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo {{for the first time in}} a Tiger Moth. In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge. After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft. Now assigned to the No. 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart. He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase of training in the Hawker Fury. He completed his training in <b>formation</b> <b>flying,</b> aerobatics and gunnery practice over the next four months, graduating in December 1938.|$|E
5|$|In May German forces {{attacked}} the Netherlands and Belgium which fell quickly. In June France collapsed. Fighter Command now needed {{an influx of}} pilots after losses in Western Europe. Finucane had improved and on 27 June 1940 he was posted to 7 Operational Training Unit (7 OTU) in Hawarden near Chester, to undergo conversion training onto Supermarine Spitfires while awaiting a fighter squadron posting. Finucane made his first flight in a Spitfire on 3 July 1940 and made 26 such flights in nine days. The pilots were tested on radio transmission, handling, <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> and aerobatics. On 11 July 1940 he was permitted just one firing practice. At {{the end of his}} stay at 7 OTU he had logged 2 hours 40 minutes on the Magister, 2 hours 25 minutes on the Fairey Battle, 15 minutes on the Hawker Hurricane and 22 hours and 20 minutes on the Spitfire.|$|E

5|$|No.410 Squadron was {{reactivated}} on 1 December 1946 as an Air Defence squadron flying de Havilland Vampire F.3 aircraft, and was re-formed from a defence role {{into that}} of a fighter role at St Hubert (Montreal), Quebec on 1 December 1948. From May 1949 to August 1951, the Blue Devils aerobatics team formed, to demonstrate the abilities of the new Vampire aircraft at <b>formation</b> <b>flying.</b> The squadron later converted to Canadair Sabres and was deployed to Europe, flying from RCAF Station North Luffenham in the UK, and then at RCAF Station Marville (No.1 (Fighter) Wing) in France. The squadron {{had been the first}} regular force fighter unit to fly the Vampire aircraft and was the first to fly the Sabre and the first to join No.1 (Fighter) Wing of No.1 Air Division Europe.|$|E
5|$|Squadron Leader Harris of 149 Squadron and Wing Commander Kellett {{were the}} only {{experienced}} combat leaders. However, Kellett had not flown with No. 9 or 37 Squadrons as a group and {{had never had a}} chance to practice <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> or bombing with these squadrons. He had not been given the time or opportunity to discuss or formulate a plan for bombing naval targets, whether as a group, squadron, or even as flight sections. Nor had he even been able to discuss or pass on any tactical advice about what the formation should do in the event of fighter attack. He was given command of an incoherent group of squadrons which were highly inexperienced. For the 18 December mission, 24 Wellington Bombers from No. 9, 37 and 149 Squadrons were given to Kellet. The British bombers flew in a diamond shape formation.|$|E
5|$|XXI Bomber Command {{arrived on}} Saipan on October 12, 1944, {{and from the}} start Hansell was beset {{by a host of}} serious command problems, the worst of which were {{continued}} teething problems with the B-29, tardy delivery of aircraft, aircrews untrained in high altitude <b>formation</b> <b>flying,</b> primitive airfield conditions, lack of an air service command for logistical support, no repair depots, a total absence of target intelligence, stubborn internal resistance to daylight operations by his sole combat wing, subordinates in the XXI Bomber Command who lobbied for his removal, and Hansell’s inferiority in rank in dealing with other AAF commanders in the theater. Furthermore, Hansell was soon prohibited from flying combat missions with his command, possibly because of limited knowledge of the atomic bomb or the perception that he knew the existence of Ultra.|$|E

5|$|By late 1940 {{there were}} severe {{shortages}} of pilots and wireless operators/gunners, with 100 pilots and 200 other personnel required. In {{the short term}} the OTU course was reduced to get the crews out to operational commands faster. It now took no longer than a month compared with the {{six to eight weeks}} considered necessary. This reduced the number of fit pilots, and the quality of pilots overall. The number of unfit pilots was recorded at 374. To cope with the shortening of training, it had to have a well-stocked general training programme. Coastal Command did not possess such an administration. Only 24 pupils were graduating when the minimum requirement was 64. This was compensated by the removal of gunnery and bombing training and a reduction in night and <b>formation</b> <b>flying.</b> Still, Bomber Command received most of the 36,000 aircrew between 1940 and 1942. Entry requirements for crews were relaxed and the programmes found more recruits that way. Manpower was also supplemented by the Commonwealth with Canada providing some of the 6,500 personnel sought by the Air Ministry. By the end of 1941, the operational strength of Coastal Command increased by seven squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Detailed {{planning}} for the Tonga began in February, starting {{with the number of}} transport aircraft assigned to the operation being expanded rapidly to accommodate the entire division. Two Royal Air Force (RAF) air groups were provided for the operation to ensure that the division could be deployed in just two airlifts. The pilots and crew of these transport aircraft then began <b>formation</b> <b>flying</b> training and specialised aircrew training to ensure that they were as familiar with what the operation required of them. The 6th Airborne Division carried out several large-scale airborne exercises, using them to find {{the most efficient way to}} deploy a brigade group on one or multiple landing-zones. On 6 February, the 3rd Parachute Brigade undertook an exercise in which the entire brigade was dropped by 98 transport aircraft. At the end of March, 284 aircraft were used in Exercise 'Bizz II' in which the entire division was deployed by parachute or glider. Finally, between 21 April and 26 April, Exercise 'Mush' utilised approximately 700 aircraft to deploy the British 1st Airborne Division and the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade against the 6th Airborne Division, who moved by road, in a simulation of a full-scale airborne operation.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, <b>Formation</b> <b>Flying,</b> orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not to stay together, saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E
