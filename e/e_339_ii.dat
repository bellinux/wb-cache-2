40|$|The {{nucleoprotein}} (NP) of the {{influenza virus}} exists as trimers, and its tail-loop binding pocket {{has been suggested}} as a potential target for antiinfluenza therapeutics. The possibility of NP as a drug target was validated by the recent reports that nucleozin and its analogs can inhibit viral replication by inducing aggregation of NP trimers. However, these inhibitors were identified by random screening, and the binding site and inhibition mechanism are unclear. We report a rational approach to target influenza virus with a new mechanism-disruption of NP-NP interaction. Consistent with recent work, <b>E</b> <b>339</b> A, R 416 A, and deletion mutant Delta 402 - 428 were unable to support viral replication {{in the absence of}} WT NP. However, only <b>E</b> <b>339</b> A and R 416 A could form hetero complex with WT NP, but the complex was unable to bind the RNA polymerase, leading to inhibition of viral replication. These results demonstrate the importance of the <b>E</b> <b>339</b> [...] . R 416 salt bridge in viral survival and establish the salt bridge as a sensitive antiinfluenza target. To provide further support, we showed that peptides encompassing R 416 can disrupt NP-NP interaction and inhibit viral replication. Finally we performed virtual screening to target <b>E</b> <b>339</b> [...] . R 416, and some small molecules identified were shown to disrupt the formation of NP trimers and inhibit replication of WT and nucleozin-resistant strains.

40|$|Apelin plays a {{prominent}} role in body fluid and cardiovascular homeostasis. To explore further upstream the role played by this peptide, nonpeptidic agonists and antagonists of the apelin receptor are required. To identify such compounds that do not exist to date, we used an original fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based assay to screen a G-protein-coupled receptor-focused library of fluorescent compounds on the human EGFP-tagged apelin receptor. This led to isolated <b>E</b> <b>339</b> - 3 D 6 that displayed a 90 nM affinity and behaved as a partial agonist with regard to cAMP production and as a full agonist with regard to apelin receptor internalization. Finally, <b>E</b> <b>339</b> - 3 D 6 induced vasorelaxation of rat aorta precontracted with noradrenaline and potently inhibited systemic vasopressin release in water-deprived mice when intracerebroventricularly injected.

40|$|Studies of mouse {{models of}} anemia have long {{provided}} fundamental insights into {{red blood cell}} formation and function. Here we show that the semidominant mouse mutation Nan (“neonatal anemia”) carries a single amino acid change (<b>E</b> <b>339</b> D) within the second zinc finger of the erythroid Krüppel-like factor (EKLF), a critical erythroid regulatory transcription factor. The mutation alters the DNA-binding specificity of EKLF so {{that it no longer}} binds promoters of a subset of its DNA targets. Remarkably, even when mutant Nan and wild-type EKLF alleles are expressed at equivalent levels, the mutant form selectively interferes with expression of EKLF target genes whose promoter elements it no longer binds.

40|$|Paramutation and {{transposon}} silencing are two epigenetic {{phenomena that}} have intrigued and puzzled geneticists for decades. Each involves heritable changes in gene activity without changes in DNA sequence. Here we report the cloning {{of a gene}} whose activity {{is required for the}} maintenance of both silenced transposons and paramutated color genes in maize. We show that this gene, Mop 1 (Mediator of paramutation 1) codes for a putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, whose activity is required for the production of small RNAs that correspond to the MuDR transposon sequence. We also demonstrate that although Mop 1 is required to maintain MuDR methylation and silencing, it is not required for the initiation of heritable silencing. In contrast, we present evidence that a reduction in the transcript level of a maize homolog of the nucleosome assembly protein 1 histone chaperone can reduce the heritability of MuDR silencing. Together, these data suggest that the establishment and maintenance of MuDR silencing have distinct requirements.

40|$|The DNA {{mismatch}} repair system (MMR) identifies replication errors and damaged bases in DNA and functions to preserve genomic integrity. MutS performs {{the task of}} locating mismatched base pairs, loops and lesions and initiating MMR, and the fundamental question of how this protein targets specific sites in DNA is unresolved. To address this question, we examined the interactions between Saccharomyces cerevisiae Msh 2 -Msh 6, a eukaryotic MutS homolog, and DNA in real time. The reaction kinetics reveal that Msh 2 -Msh 6 binds a variety of sites at similarly fast rates (kON ∼  107  M- 1  s- 1), and its selectivity manifests in differential dissociation rates; e. g., the protein releases a 2 -Aminopurine:T base pair approximately 90 -fold faster than a G:T mismatch. On releasing the 2 -Ap:T site, Msh 2 -Msh 6 is able to move laterally on DNA to locate a nearby G:T site. The long-lived Msh 2 -Msh 6 ·G:T complex triggers {{the next step in}} MMR—formation of an ATP-bound clamp—more effectively than the short-lived Msh 2 -Msh 6 · 2 -Ap:T complex.

The nucleoprotein is also essential for transcription and replication during the virus life cycle. In the H 5 N 1 NP structure, the tail loop region is important for NP to form oligomers. Here, by an RNP reconstitution assay, we identified eight NP mutants that had different degrees of defects in forming functional RNPs, with the RNP activities of four mutants being totally abolished (<b>E</b> <b>339</b> A, V 408 S P 410 S, R 416 A, and L 418 S P 419 S mutants) and the RNP activities of the other four mutants being more than 50 % decreased (R 267 A, I 406 S, R 422 A, and E 449 A mutants). Further characterization by static light scattering showed that the totally defective protein variants existed as monomers in vitro, deviating from the trimeric/oligomeric form of wild-type NP. The I 406 S, R 422 A, and E 449 A variants existed as a mixture of unstable oligomers, thus resulting in a reduction of RNP activity. Although the R 267 A variant existed as a monomer in vitro, it resumed an oligomeric form upon the addition of RNA and retained {{a certain degree of}} RNP activity.

40|$|Background— Inherited long-QT {{syndrome}} {{is characterized by}} prolonged QT interval on the ECG, syncope, and sudden death caused by ventricular arrhythmia. Causative mutations occur mostly in cardiac potassium and sodium channel subunit genes. Confidence in mutation pathogenicity is usually reached through family genotype-phenotype tracking, control population studies, molecular modeling, and phylogenetic alignments; however, biophysical testing offers {{a higher degree of}} validating evidence. Methods and Results— By using in vitro electrophysiological testing of transfected mutant and wild-type long-QT syndrome constructs into Chinese hamster ovary cells, we investigated the biophysical properties of 9 KCNQ 1 missense mutations (A 46 T, T 265 I, F 269 S, A 302 V, G 316 <b>E,</b> F <b>339</b> S, R 360 G, H 455 Y, and S 546 L) identified in a New Zealand-based long-QT syndrome screening program. We demonstrate through electrophysiology and molecular modeling that 7 of the missense mutations have profound pathological dominant-negative loss-of-function properties, confirming their likely disease-causing nature. This supports the use of these mutations in diagnostic family screening. Two mutations (A 46 T, T 265 I) show suggestive evidence of pathogenicity within the experimental limits of biophysical testing, indicating that these variants are disease-causing via delayed- or fast-activation kinetics. Further investigation of the A 46 T family has revealed an inconsistent cosegregation of the variant with the clinical phenotype. Conclusions— Electrophysiological characterization should be used to validate long-QT syndrome pathogenicity of novel missense channelopathies. When such results are inconclusive, great care should be taken with genetic counseling and screening of such families, and alternative disease-causing mechanisms should be considered...|$|R
40|$|Summary The formin {{homology}} domain-containing protein 1 (FHOD 1) suppresses actin polymerization by inhibiting nucleation, but bundles actin filaments and caps filament barbed ends. Two polyclonal antibodies against FHOD 1 {{were generated}} against (i) its N-terminal sequence (residues 1 - <b>339)</b> and (<b>ii)</b> a peptide corresponding the sequence from position 358 to 371, which is unique for FHOD 1 {{and does not}} occur in its close relative FHOD 3. After affinity purification both antibodies specifically stain purified full length FHOD 1 and a band of similar molecular mass in homogenates of cardiac muscle. The antibody against the N-terminus of FHOD 1 was used for immunostaining cells of established lines, primary neonatal (NRC) and adult (ARC) rat cardiomyocytes and demonstrated the presence of FHOD 1 in HeLa and fibroblastic cells along stress fibres and within presumed lamellipodia and actin arcs. In NRCs and ARCs we observed a prominent staining of presumed intercalated discs (ICD). Immunostaining of sections of hearts with both anti-FHOD 1 antibodies confirmed the presence of FHOD 1 in ICDs and double immunostaining demonstrated its colocalisation with cadherin, plakoglobin and a probably slightly shifted localisation to connexin 43. Similarly, immunostaining of isolated mouse or pig ICDs corroborated the presence of FHOD 1 and its colocalisation with the mentioned cell junctional components. Anti-FHOD 1 immunoblots of isolated ICDs demonstrated {{the presence of an}} immunreactive band comigrating with purified FHOD 1. Conversely, an anti-peptide antibody specific for FHOD 3 with no cross-reactivity against FHOD 1 immunostained on sections of cardiac muscle and ARCs the myofibrils in a cross-striated pattern but not the ICDs. In addition, the anti-peptide-FHOD 1 antibody stained the lateral sarcolemma of ARCs in a banded pattern. Double immunostaining with anti-cadherin and -integrin-� 1 indicated the additional localisation of FHOD 1 in costameres. Immunostaining of cardiac muscle sections or ARCs with antibodies against mDia 3 -FH 2 -domain showed colocalisation with cadherin along the lateral border of cardiomyocytes suggesting also ist presence in costameres...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Numerical {{data for}} the {{distribution}} of citations are examined for: (i) papers published in 1981 in journals which are catalogued by the Institute for Scientific Information (783, <b>339</b> papers) and (<b>ii)</b> 20 years of publications in Physical Review D, vols. 11 - 50 (24, 296 papers). A Zipf plot {{of the number of}} citations to a given paper versus its citation rank appears to be consistent with a power-law dependence for leading rank papers, with exponent close to − 1 / 2. This, in turn, suggests that the number of papers with x citations, N(x), has a large-x power law decay N(x) ∼ x −α,withα≈ 3.

Namely, how often is a paper cited? While the average or total number of citations are often quoted anecdotally and tabulations of highly-cited papers exist [1, 2], the focus of this work is on the more fundamental distribution of citations, namely, the numbe...|$|R
40|$|Em experimentos com irrigação por aspersão instalados em diferentes zonas tritícolas paulistas, avaliaram-se a produtividade de grãos, as reações aos agentes causais de ferrugem-da-folha, de oídio e de helmintosporiose e a qualidade tecnológica da farinha de dezesseis genótipos de trigo em 1991 - 93. O genótipo TUI"S" apresentou melhor produtividade e boa adaptação nas diferentes zonas estudadas. Destacaram-se também o IAC 289, IAC 335, IAC 338, IAC 286 e IAC 60. As zonas D (Tatuí) e C (Paranapanema) apresentaram, respectivamente, a maior e a menor produção, diferindo significativamente entre si. A ocorrência da mancha foliar, causada por Helmínthosporium sp., e do oídio foi generalizada em todas as zonas no decorrer do período. De acordo com os parâmetros físicos, químicos e reológicos, os genótipos IAC 24, IAC 315, IAC 334, TUI"S" <b>e</b> IAC <b>339</b> apresentaram farinha de qualidade {{superior}} (forte), enquanto a dos genótipos 79 - 218 e NS. 55. 58 /PJN"S" foi considerada de baixa qualidade (fraca). From 1991 to 1993, sixteen wheat genotypes {{were evaluated}} in experiments {{carried out at}} the different wheat regions of the State of São Paulo, Brazil, under sprinkler irrigation. Grain yield, reactions to the causal agents of leaf rust, powdery mildew and leaf spots and the flour technological quality were evaluated. The genotype TUI"S" presented high productivity and good adaptation at the different studied wheat regions. The genotypes IAC 289, IAC 335, IAC 338, IAC 286 and IAC 60 also showed good performance. The wheat region D (Tatuf) exhibited the highest grain yield, differing significantly from the region C (Paranapanema), which presented the lowest grain yield. The occurrence of leaf spots, caused by Helminthosporium sp. and powdery mildew were generalized in all regions during the considered period. Taking into account the physical, chemical and rheologic parameters, the genotypes IAC 24, IAC 315, IAC 334, TUI"S" and IAC 339 presented superior flour quality (hard) {{as compared to the}} others. The flour of the genotypes 79 - 218 and NS. 55. 58 /PJN"S" was considered of inferior quality (soft) ...|$|R
40|$|A new {{disease of}} rabbits is described. Following an acute febrile course, animals die or recover by the 11 th day postinoculation. The {{characteristic}} pathologic finding is multifocal myocardial degeneration and necrosis. The disease {{can be transmitted}} by various routes with tissue filtrates or with infectious sera diluted to 10 (- 6) and passed through 0. 1 micron filters. Virus particles with morphologic features characteristic of a coronavirus are present in infectious but not in normal rabbit serums. The antigen(s) in the infectious serums cross-reacts with the 229 E and the OC 43 strains of human coronavirus. Antigen cross-reacting with the 229 E virus is detectable by immunofluorescent staining in frozen sections of heart tissue from sick but not from healthy animals. Animals surviving infection seroconvert to coronavirus specificity, {{as demonstrated by the}} presence in convalescent serums of antibody capable of reacting with the <b>339</b> <b>E</b> virus. Susceptibility to infection has not been demonstrated in mice, hamsters, or guinea pigs, and the virus was not adapted for growth in tissue culture. It is uncertain whether the agent is a natural pathogen of rabbits or a coronavirus contaminant from another species, possibly human. The name rabbit infectious cardiomyopathy is suggested for this disease...|$|R
40|$|The excited {{states of}} 199 At and 201 At were studied using fusion {{evaporation}} reactions, a gas-filled recoil separator and various tagging methods. The level scheme of 201 At was extended a lot including {{a cascade of}} magnetic dipole transitions, that is suggested to form a shears band. In addition, a 29 / 2 + [T 1 / 2 = 3. 39 (9) s] isomeric state was observed. The 29 / 2 + state is suggested to originate from the p(h 9 / 2) j 200 Po; 11 i configuration, and it depopulates through 269 -keV <b>E</b> 2 and <b>339</b> -keV <b>E</b> 3 transitions. In both nuclei 199, 201 At we have observed also the isomeric 1 / 2 + [T 1 / 2 = 273 (9), 45 (3) ms, respectively] intruder state, that is suggested to originate from the p(s 1 / 2) 1 configuration. The 1 / 2 + state decays through 103 - keV and 269 -keV E 3 transitions in 199, 201 At, respectively. In both nuclei the 1 / 2 + state is fed from 3 / 2 + and 5 / 2 + states, which are suggested to originate from the p(d 3 / 2) 1 and p(d 5 / 2) 1 configurations, respectively...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} role of the equine {{herpesvirus}} type 1 (EHV- 1) ICP 0 protein (EICP 0) in gene regulation, a variety of molecular studies on the EICP 0 gene and gene products of both the attenuated cell culture-adapted Kentucky A (KyA) strain and the Ab 4 p strain were conducted. These investigations revealed that (i) the ICP 0 open reading frame (ORF) of the KyA virus strain is 1, 257 bp in size and would encode a protein of 419 amino acids, and in comparison to the ICP 0 gene (ORF 63) of the Ab 4 p strain of 1, 596 bp (E. A. Telford, M. S. Watson, K. McBride, and A. J. Davison, Virology 189 : 304 - 316, 1992), it has an internal in-frame deletion of <b>339</b> bp; (<b>ii)</b> one early transcript of 1. 4 kb predicted to encode the EICP 0 protein and a late transcript of 1. 8 kb are detected in Northern blot analyses using probes containing the EICP 0 ORF; (iii) the KyA EICP 0 protein (50 kDa) and the Ab 4 p EICP 0 protein (80 kDa) are expressed as several species of early proteins that are first detected at 3 to 4 h postinfection by Western blot analyses of infected-cell polypeptides, using an antiserum generated to a TrpE fusion protein that harbors amino acids 46 to 153 of the EICP 0 protein; and (iv) the EICP 0 protein of both EHV- 1 strains is a potent transactivator of EHV- 1 genes. Transient expression assays using a simian virus 40 expression construct of the EICP 0 protein of the KyA strain showed that the EICP 0 protein independently transactivated chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter constructs {{under the control of the}} immediate-early promoter (3. 9 -fold), the early thymidine kinase promoter (95 -fold), the late (gamma 1) IR 5 promoter (85 -fold), and the late (gamma 2) glycoprotein K promoter (21 -fold). The finding that the EICP 0 protein of the KyA virus can function as an activator of gene expression indicates that amino acids corresponding to residues 319 to 431 of the Ab 4 p EICP 0 protein are not essential for EICP 0 transactivation of EHV- 1 promoters...|$|R
