5|$|Winnipeg {{developed}} rapidly {{after the}} coming of the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1881. The railway divided the North End, which housed mainly <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europeans,</b> from the richer Anglo-Saxon southern part of the city. It also contributed to a demographic shift beginning shortly after Confederation that saw the francophone population decrease from a majority to a small minority group. This shift resulted in Premier Thomas Greenway controversially ending legislative bilingualism and removing funding for French Catholic Schools in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Stratton wrote Social Psychology for International Conduct {{for social}} science {{teachers}} {{who wanted to}} use psychology to analyze international affairs. The book's first part evaluated races. Stratton concluded the Caucasoid and Mongoloid races were innately more intelligent enabling them to build strong cultures. He also stated the prejudice of other people was from {{the social and political}} advantages it brought. Stratton saw nations as made up of individuals and possessing a national character similar to what individuals had. Reviewing the book in the American Journal of Sociology, Ellsworth Faris objected to the author concluding the Northern and Central Europeans were more intelligent than Southern and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europeans,</b> noting intelligence measures correlated also with length of stay in America.|$|E

30|$|The results {{indicate}} that an education-occupation mismatch experienced by post- 1991 <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> immigrants in general also exists among <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> professionals. The socioeconomic disparities experienced by <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> professionals can perhaps be attributed to differences in their educational systems, pre-emigration labor market experiences, and the language barrier, which may hinder the transfer of skills and human capital into the U.S. labor market. These disparities also suggest that despite their white racial background, <b>Eastern</b> <b>European</b> professionals experience an income disadvantage similar to non-white immigrants.|$|R

25|$|Gorbachev's {{visit to}} China on 15 May during the protests brought many foreign news {{agencies}} to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals {{of the protesters}} helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and <b>Eastern</b> <b>Europeans</b> who were watching.

25|$|The {{economy is}} chiefly agricultural. Cattle, sheep, pig rearing and some horse {{breeding}} {{are the main}} types of husbandry practiced. Poultry rearing, once popular, has very much declined. Wheat, barley, rapeseed, and oats are grown, as are potatoes. Sugar beet is no longer grown due to the withdrawal of EU subsidies. The numbers involved in farming have been declining {{for many years and}} many of the seasonal workers are now <b>eastern</b> <b>Europeans.</b> Mushrooms are also grown indoors.

We believe that a deeper analysis of corruption’s drivers can produce a better articulated and more efficient anti-corruption strategy.
