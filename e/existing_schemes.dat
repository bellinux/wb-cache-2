It is similar to the <b>existing</b> <b>schemes</b> such as the Singapore road pricing scheme, London congestion charge, Stockholm congestion tax, and the Milan Area C.

25|$|In the 1980s, the {{government}} began experiencing budget constraints which put a strain on the ambitious projects of providing universal access to safe water and expanding the water and sewerage systems. Priority {{was given to the}} rehabilitation of <b>existing</b> <b>schemes</b> and the construction of large-scale water projects such as the Baricho and Kilimanjaro water schemes. In 1980 a National Sanitation Council was established to sensitise the population about the health benefits of sanitation and to advise and guide local authorities on the matter. The Council slowly faded without accomplishing its mandate.|$|E
25|$|The {{layout of}} the gojūon table {{promotes}} a systematic view of kana syllabograms as being always pronounced with the same single consonant followed by a vowel, {{but this is not}} exactly the case (and never has been). <b>Existing</b> <b>schemes</b> for the romanization of Japanese either are based on the systematic nature of the script, e.g. nihon-siki チ ti, or they apply some Western graphotactics, usually the English one, to the common Japanese pronunciation of the kana signs, e.g. Hepburn-shiki チ chi. Both approaches conceal the fact, though, that many consonant-based katakana signs, especially those canonically ending in u, can be used in coda position, too, where the vowel is unvoiced and therefore barely perceptible.|$|E

25|$|According to FAO, {{water fees}} {{are too low}} to meet {{maintenance}} and operation requirements for hydraulic infrastructure. For instance, cost recovery for water and sanitation is minimal. Average tariffs are moderate at US$0.21 per cubic meter for water and US$0.07 per cubic meter for sewerage. In addition, collection rates for {{water supply and sanitation}} are extremely low at only 28%. As a result of moderate tariffs and very low collection rates, according to a WHO estimate in 1998, households paid on average only US$0.50 per month for water and US$0.09 per month for sewerage. Not surprisingly, the regional water and sewer companies and INAPA (the national water and sewerage authority) rely largely on transfers from the central budget to fund their operations. The <b>existing</b> <b>schemes</b> lack transparency and efficiency in the use of subsidies.|$|E
25|$|The Industrial Development Act 1966 {{changed the}} name of Development Districts (parts of the country {{with higher levels of}} {{unemployment}} than the national average and which governments sought to encourage greater investment in) to Development Areas and increased the percentage of the workforce covered by development schemes from 15% to 20%, which mainly affected rural areas in Scotland and Wales. Tax allowances were replaced by grants in order to extend coverage to include firms which were not making a profit, and in 1967 a Regional Employment Premium was introduced. Whereas the <b>existing</b> <b>schemes</b> tended to favour capital-intensive projects, this aimed {{for the first time at}} increasing employment in depressed areas. Set at £1.50 a man per week and guaranteed for seven years, the Regional Employment Premium subsidised all manufacturing industry (though not services) in Development Areas.|$|E
25|$|Labour MP Caroline Flint {{has said}} that {{independence}} would mean higher energy bills in Scotland, as its customers {{would have to pay}} more to support renewable energy in Scotland, which represents one third of the UK total. Euan Phimister {{has said that}} bills are likely to increase across the whole of Great Britain because renewable schemes and new nuclear power stations in England are both receiving higher subsidies than the power plants which will shortly close due to environmental regulations. He also said that there is a distinction between existing and proposed renewable schemes in that the <b>existing</b> <b>schemes</b> have already been paid for, whereas any new construction requires the promise of subsidy from the consumer. Energy and Climate Change Secretary Ed Davey stated Scottish generators would no longer be eligible for UK subsidies, which would increase energy bills for consumers.|$|E

40|$|The {{transfer}} of program data between the nodes of a distributed {{system is a}} fundamental operation. It usually requires some form of data serialization. For a functional language such as Scheme it is clearly desirable to also allow the unrestricted {{transfer of}} functions between nodes. With the goal of developing a portable implementation of the Termite system we have designed the Mobit Scheme interpreter which supports unrestricted serialization of Scheme objects, including procedures and continuations. Mobit is derived from an <b>existing</b> <b>Scheme</b> in Scheme fast interpreter.

In this paper, we propose an improved version of the visual digital signature scheme with enhanced security. The improvement was made based on Yang’s non-expansion visual cryptography technique and Boolean operations. The security of the improved version of the visual digital signature scheme is assured by the K-SAT (3 -SAT and 4 -SAT) NP-hard problem. This is to compare with the security of the <b>existing</b> <b>scheme</b> which is based on the difficulty of solving random Boolean OR operations. Besides improved in security the propose scheme is also efficient in generating shares, compared to the <b>existing</b> <b>scheme</b> where the probability of generating black shares is high...|$|R
