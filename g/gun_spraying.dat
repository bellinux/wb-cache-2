50|$|Spray {{painting}} is a painting technique where a device sprays a coating (paint, ink, varnish, etc.) {{through the air}} onto a surface. The most common types employ compressed gas—usually air—to atomize and direct the paint particles. Spray guns evolved from airbrushes, and the two are usually distinguished by their size {{and the size of}} the spray pattern they produce. Airbrushes are hand-held and used instead of a brush for detailed work such as photo retouching, painting nails or fine art. Air <b>gun</b> <b>spraying</b> uses equipment that is generally larger. It is typically used for covering large surfaces with an even coating of liquid. Spray guns can be either automated or hand-held and have interchangeable heads to allow for different spray patterns. Single color aerosol paint cans are portable and easy to store.|$|E

30|$|Detonation <b>gun</b> <b>spraying</b> {{is a high}} {{temperature}} and a high velocity technique which is thought to introduce {{a higher degree of}} melting to starting powder. This technique has also been explored to prepare calcium orthophosphate coatings on titanium alloys (Gledhill et al. 1999, 2001). In this process, a mixture of oxygen and acetylene is fed into a barrel together with a charge of the power. The gas is ignited, and detonation waves accelerate the powder up to about 750 [*]m/s. The process produces a denser coating, which has a higher proportion of the amorphous phase with some evidence for the appearance of β-TCP. A lower crystallinity and higher residual stress found in the detonation gun sprayed coatings resulted in a faster dissolution rate both in vitro and in vivo (Gledhill et al. 1999, 2001).|$|E

Traditionally, these coatings are prepared by Atmospheric Plasma Spraying (APS), but processes such as Detonation <b>Gun</b> <b>Spraying</b> (DGS) and High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) spraying can produce coatings with lower porosity and higher wear resistance. Traditionally, feedstock powders have been used for coating preparation. Recent developments have seen the emergence of suspensions as a new feedstock, but tribological properties of coatings prepared using suspensions have not yet been studied in detail.

The friction coefficient of the WC-Co coating first increases rapidly in the initial running-in phase, and then gradually increases slightly after entering into the steady-state phase; whereas the friction coefficient of multilayer composite coating steps in the steady-state phase soon and starts to decline gradually when the top WC-Co coating became perforated. By comparison, the coating cohesion declines slightly after adding the self-lubricating layer MoS 2 -Ni, but the friction coefficient decreases by about 40 %, and the wear resistance is also improved slightly...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFiber-reinforced polymer {{composites}} (CFRP) {{are increasingly}} used in aerospace for weight-sensitive applications. However, they {{are subjected to}} degradation from the erosive forces of solid particles and water droplets. This degradation results in a decreased service life of composite components and increased repair costs. A coating can protect the CFRP surface against wear and plasma spraying could be a candidate technique to achieve this coating. However, an issue is the thermal and mechanical damage to the composite surface by the plasma- sprayed particles. Another issue is the coating adhesion, because of the low wettability of polymer surface to liquid metal and ceramic and different atomistic properties between substrate and coating material. A possible solution to both issues {{is the use of}} a primary layer deposited by a "softer" technique than thermal spraying. This study deals with the deposition of this primary layer by three methods (magnetron sputtering, air <b>gun</b> <b>spraying</b> and sol-gel) and the deposition of topcoat layer by plasma spraying. The effectiveness of the protection of the CRFP by the primary layer during topcoat plasma spraying is investigated as well as the interfaces of the duplex coatings...|$|E
40|$|The {{tungsten}} carbide coating with both high hardness and dense microstructure was prepared by optimizing the detonation <b>gun</b> <b>spraying</b> parameters. The phase identifications and microstructure of the coating were observed and analyzed by optical microscope, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The {{results show that}} {{with the increase of}} oxygen-fuel ratio, the hardness and adhesive strength of the coating firstly enhance and then decrease, while porosities firstly decrease and then increase. When the oxygen fuel ratio is too low, slow particle flight speed and insufficient melt are the main reasons for the degradation of the coating compactness and mechanical properties. When the oxygen fuel ratio is too high, particle decarburization and binder phase nonuniform contract in the cooling process are the determining factors to the coating structure and properties. When the oxygen-fuel ratio is 1. 15, comprehensive performance of the coating is optimal, and the oxidation and decarburization of the coating can be effectively reduced.

This system {{was designed to}} apply dilute fertilizer and pesticide solutions at high spray volumes and low nozzle pressure. The lawn spray gun application at a mean volume rate of 1122 L ha[superscript]- 1 in comparison to flat fan nozzles at 187 L ha[superscript]- 1 or Raindrop nozzles at 374 L ha[superscript]- 1 significantly reduced the injury potential to non-target plants 90 cm or more from the spray swath edge. The direct deposition of spray at the 30 cm downwind location suggests that a small unsprayed buffer area next to non-target plants should be left {{in order to avoid}} direct spray contact to non-target plants for all nozzle types tested. The percentage of spray recovered indicates that large differences do occur within the spray swath. The corresponding coefficient of variation (CV) values for the nozzle types were above the recommended CV value of 15 %; however, other research has shown that applications with a CV range of 14 % to 28 % provided satisfactory uniformity for droplet deposition. The low percent spray recovery with RA- 6 nozzles and the spray gun on turfgrass suggests that droplets produced by flat fan nozzles may have greater collection efficiencies than those by RA- 6 nozzles or the spray gun.
