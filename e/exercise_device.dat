500|$|By {{the fifth}} orbit, Schirra {{had begun to}} relax, commenting {{that it was the}} first rest he had had since December 1961. He used a small bungee cord <b>exercise</b> <b>device</b> for [...] "a little bit of stretching", before {{dropping}} into manual attitude control, where he reported a sudden burst of oversteering and high fuel use. Over the Atlantic he returned to observation and photography; he failed to spot the planned high-power light near Durban, in South Africa, due to cloud cover, but did make out the brightly lit city of Port Elizabeth. Over the Philippines, he reported on his fuel status; after four and a half of the planned six orbits, he still had eighty percent remaining in both manual and automatic fuel tanks. Passing over Quito, Ecuador, towards the end of his fifth orbit, Schirra was asked by the tracking station if he had any message to pass on [...] "in Spanish to the fellows down here", and he made some comments on how beautiful the country appeared from orbit, ending with a cheery [...] "Buenos Dias, y'all!" [...] Schirra later noted that he was [...] "furious" [...] at this point—he was preparing for re-entry and didn't want to be distracted with making public statements.|$|E

During an exercise session of squats on the ISS, Chiao sent a vibration through the space station that caused the solar arrays to ripple – a low amplitude frequency response. When Chiao did this, the response from Mission Control was [...] "knock it off." [...] However, several years later during an ISS assembly flight in December 2006 (STS-116), German astronaut Thomas Reiter of the European Space Agency was told to do 30 seconds of robust exercise on the bungee-bar IRED machine to help retract ISS solar arrays, specifically to relieve tension in a wire system that was preventing the array from folding up like an accordion. An eventual unplanned spacewalk during the same shuttle mission managed to finally retract the array.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, NASA {{is using}} {{advanced}} computational tools {{to understand the}} how to best counteract the [...] bone and muscle atrophy experienced by astronauts in microgravity environments for prolonged periods of time. [...] The Human Research Program's Human Health Countermeasures Element chartered the Digital Astronaut Project to investigate targeted questions about exercise countermeasure regimes. [...] NASA is focusing on integrating {{a model of the}} advanced Resistive <b>Exercise</b> <b>Device</b> (ARED) currently on board the International Space Station with OpenSim [...] musculoskeletal models of humans exercising with the device. [...] The goal of this work is to use inverse dynamics to estimate joint torques and muscle forces resulting from using the ARED, and thus more accurately prescribe exercise regimens for the astronauts. [...] These joint torques and muscle forces could be used in conjunction with more fundamental computational simulations of bone remodeling and muscle adaptation in order to more completely model the end effects of such countermeasures, and determine whether a proposed exercise regime would be sufficient to sustain astronaut musculoskeletal health.|$|E
