40|$|The {{reaction}} of phosgene with <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> {{has been shown}} to be a good method for preparing thorium tetrachloride. The equilibria of the reaction showed that nearly complete utilization of phosgene could be attained in a properly designed reactor. The kinetics of the reaction could not be represented by a simple rate law but the effects of bed depth, particle size, mode of oxide preparation and temperature on the rate of reaction were established. The depth of the bed of <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> and the particle size of the oxide did not affect the initial rate of reaction. At high conversions the rate of the reaction was probably controlled by the slow solid state diffusion of oxygen to the surface of the thorium tetrachloride crystals and the highest conversion of <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> to <b>thorium</b> tetrachloride obtained was approximately 91 o/o. The size of the crystallites in the <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> particles increased as the temperature at which thorium oxalate was calcined to <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> was increased.

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{understand}} the behavior of thorium breeder reactor fuel in a repository environment, the behavior of <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> was investigated. The kinetics of crystalline <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> dissolution were studied under argon and argon/ 10 % CO 2 over a broad pH range in 0. 1 M ionic strength NaC 1 O 4 solution. Samples were analyzed for thorium concentration using ICP-AES, ICP-MS, and NAA. Data was fit to a first order kinetics model. The kinetic rate constant under pure argon was 0. 0107 ± 0. 00123 h- 1 for pH 2 - 3. Under 10 % CO 2, the rate constant was 0. 00511 ± 0. 000863 h- 1. No kinetics results could be discerned from the data at higher pH. Under argon, solubility at pH greater than 3 was at nm/L levels, three orders of magnitude lower than at pH 3 and below. Under 10 % CO 2, solubilities decreased from 10 [mu]mol/L at pH 2. 06 to 80 nm/Lat pH 3. <b>Thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> powder remnants from each experiment were analysed using XRD, FflR, and BET surface area analysis.

Results: <b>Thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> having 4 % U- 233 burned 1 MW power results in less Sm- 149 reactivity than <b>thorium</b> <b>oxide</b> having 4 % U- 235 burned in 0. 5 MW power. Xe- 135 reactivity has an overestimated shift by 15 days in the core operated in 0. 5 MW than the other, after 15 days both the cores behave similarly. 480 g of U- 235 burns into the core using 0. 5 MW power and 364 g of U- 233 invents after 3 months. Burn up calculation of the modeled core of (Th-U- 233) O- 2 fuel shows a fissile mass reduction by 60 days while the consumed fissile mass reaches to its initial value after 120 days. The core flux is constant during 3 months for both modeled cores.

Surface area values by the emanation method were compared with BET values from like samples. The difference between values obtained by the two methods was attributed to the efficiency of the radioactive gas-detecting system and the porosity of the oxide samples. The contribution of Rn/sup 2 //sup 2 //sup 2 / from the oxide samples containing uranium was found to be negligible and presented no problem. Samples fired at temperatures above 1500 %DEC for one hour in air exhibited a marked increase in "room temperature" emanation rates. The predicted lattice-loosening temperature of metal oxides is approximately one-half their absolute melting point. Above this temperature, sufficient thermal agitation is induced to permit exchange and possibly permanent displacement of atoms in the crystal lattice. Therefore, firing these oxide preparations at temperatures above 1500 deg C would probably result in lattice defects throughout the crystal structure, with the surface defects contributing to an increase in surface area and a corresponding increase in the emanation rate.
