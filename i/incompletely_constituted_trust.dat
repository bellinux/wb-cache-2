40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{whether there}} {{is some kind of}} truth that shows itself in performance and how it is achieved. The investigation focuses on somatic practices and the performer's own awareness. It outlines concepts of authenticity and truth (particularly ontological truth) that might be relevant to bodily experience and (with particular reference to Drew Leder) whether the discontinuity in embodied experience is an obstacle, or a means, to experiencing or perceiving truth. Despite being Husserl's 'remarkably <b>incompletely</b> <b>constituted</b> thing,' the body makes available our sense of a continuous world, a continuous body and a unified Self. These perceived unities, of body, identity and world, block from view the moments and processes by which they come to be, but these unities, as habitually experienced, can be disrupted, creating a 'gap' in which being-becoming becomes available to attention. Central to this process are attention, proprioceptive awareness (which provides both a means of observing the body in its transformations and of making those transformations), imagination and a willingness to improvise. The performance practices of Rosalind Crisp, Deborah Hay and Body Weather (originating from Min Tanaka) effect strategies that open 'gaps' as fields of becoming- focusing on attention, perceiving and being perceived, and omnicentral phenomenological investigation. The thesis discusses and documents 'Lizard -a box of gaps', my performance experiment in exploring, from within, the type of somatic experience and awareness provided by, seemingly, incompatible modes and ideologies of performance...|$|R

40|$|Platform {{services}} - {{services that}} are provided to organizations through online platforms - are increasingly being adopted and used within firms. The novelty of these services is generating uncertainties for both providers and customers. As these uncertainties and their consequences are not well understood in the existing literature, our research focused on articulating {{the nature of these}} uncertainties and explicating how they are being managed by providers of platform services. We conducted an 18 -month field study of a platform service in the enterprise cloud computing industry, and found uncertainties associated with a number of concerns over the platform's privacy, security, flexibility, capacity, responsiveness, and innovativeness, and about the trustworthiness and credibility of the platform provider. We identified five mechanisms that the platform provider employs to manage these concerns - architecting boundaries, enforcing safeguards, segmenting customers, producing trust rhetoric, and articulating trust indicators. The first three mechanisms can be seen to constitute platform work - the work of designing, safeguarding, and keeping the system up and running so as to ensure the reliability of the platform, while the latter two mechanisms <b>constitute</b> <b>trust</b> work - the work of producing and disseminating a trust rhetoric so as to assure customers and prospects of the accountability of the platform provider. We found that both platform and trust work entail practices of materialization that normalize the uncertainties by downplaying certain concerns (privacy, capacity, responsiveness, credibility), while emphasizing others (security, flexibility, innovativeness, trustworthiness). Our findings highlight the enactment of uncertainty management, showing how reliability (of the platform) and accountability (of the platform provider) are performed in an ongoing manner, with important implications for the delivery of platform services to firms. by Arvind Karunakaran.

40|$|One of the {{research}} fields at the Institute for Simulation and Software Technology at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), is to discover new concepts which provide reliability and trustworthiness in software applications. Since today's process operations in distributed systems are fairly complex, recording all actions is critical {{in order to ensure}} reliability and <b>constitute</b> <b>trust</b> in the systems. One example application, developed by the department of Intelligent and Distributed Systems in collaboration with the German Space Operations Center (GSOC), is the Backend Catalog for Relational Debris Information (BACARDI). Its purpose is to collect and store information about more than ten million objects in orbit around earth, measured by various sensor networks. Before storing the data additional calculations like size, velocity, orbit, and collision detection with other objects, are performed on each object in a distributed manner. Collecting provenance about involved steps and actors is vital to prove the reliability of the events, especially to detect possible collisions. On the one hand it is about collecting provenance, on the other hand it is about protecting provenance from unintended or intended changes, since only unchanged data can be utilized for trustworthy predictions and safe inference in BACARDI or similar systems. After Nakamoto proposed the blockchain technology in his paper, new types of tamper resistant and distributed data storage techniques have evolved from it. These technologies can be applied to vital provenance data to protect it from possible alternation, even in distributed systems. Therefore, the main subject of this thesis is to elaborate and survey concepts for storing provenance data in blockchain-like databases. These concepts are analysed in terms of their advantages and disadvantages, tamper-resistance, and possible use cases, followed by a proof-of-concept implementation of all concepts in one particular blockchain-like database. Subsequently, performance measurements are conducted on each implementation followed by an analysis with respect to the concept design...|$|R

The status of feeling value in gold has prime six reasons and mostly {{the influence of}} gold on the human mind is due to its assured exchange value, otherwise there are few needs that might be satisfied directly by gold or its chemical compositions. The potential of status of gold is founded on the prime six reasons and it <b>constitutes</b> <b>trust</b> in assured exchange value (not value) that ultimately becomes a hope of satisfying various needs of a man. A big catastrophic collapse of social systems automatically makes gold valueless, this is proved by history also, {{and it is the}} proof of its dependency on exchange value as well as inevitability of social system.

That is the difference one should try to understand before using word value for gold while explaining critical topics of economics.

However, man has faced occasions and events that convinced him about futile impression of value in gold that he carried throughout his life till date.

40|$|Past {{research}} has striven to decompose {{the elements that}} <b>constitute</b> virtual <b>trust</b> often through the device of designing generalised online trust models or frameworks. Understandably most of these efforts have been centred on online trust with regards to buying and selling of commodities or services over the internet but this work extends these to Virtual Learning Environments. A number of online trust models and frameworks have been proposed but there remains an important omission (contribution to knowledge) in regards to trust within learning institutions. Within this omission, this investigation examines and reveals the factors that <b>constitute</b> students <b>trust</b> in Virtual Learning Environments. It also reveals how these trust factors and the elements that constitute them in Virtual Learning Environments vary in parametric values across cultures. The revealed trust factors (usability, Influence, trial and self-decision-making power) are what we used as constructs {{for the development of}} our Culture Influence Virtual Learning Environments Trust (CIVLET) framework. In CIVLET, culture is used as a major construct to determine the associated parametric values with these trust factors. Hence culture is seen as a major determinant of trust and students trust in VLEs is seen to vary with cultures. From the analysis of past work/literature in the field of Information Systems, Virtual environments, Virtual trust and Culture we derived the dependent and independent variables used in this work. The dependent variables were grouped under these four headings for questions to be asked in regards to students' opinion toward their intentions to participate and their experiences after participation to trusting VLEs across cultures: Behavioural Intention towards Virtual Learning Environments, Attitude towards Virtual Learning Environments, Subjective norm towards Virtual Learning Environments and Perceived Behavioural control. The cultures in questions are of the Europeans, Africans, Asians and the South American/Caribbean. We raised two hypotheses and set four research questions. From our hypotheses, we rejected hypothesis (HO) in favour of (HI). We derived Usability trust factor, Influential trust factor, Trial trust factor and Self-decisionmaking power trust factor as the factors that <b>constitute</b> students <b>trust</b> in Virtual Learning Environments across cultures.

40|$|Defence date: 17 October 2012 Examining Board: Professor Sven Holger Steinmo, European University Institute (Supervisor); Professor Pepper Culpepper, European University Institute; Professor Bo Rothstein, University of Gothenburg; Professor Marlene Wind, University of Copenhagen. Why {{do people}} trust certain {{political}} institutions and not others, and {{how best to}} account for trust’s relationship with democratic participation? This dissertation focuses on the relationship between democratic participation and deliberation, and its influence on political trust. It is based on a puzzle, showing almost as high a level of trust in the European Union (EU) vis-à-vis the national democracy. 1 This finding is counterintuitive. Most recent research on the EU emphasizes a converse relationship. A popular interpretation of “the EU democratic malaise” is that the EU is neither transparent nor understood by its people. Hence people cannot trust it, and they reject or show reluctance towards further integration, for example, in popular referendums or by the very low voter turnout in the European Parliament elections. My initial descriptive findings show a different pattern. People actually trust the EU to quite a high degree in comparison to the trust they place in the national democracy. 2 So I ask the question: to what degree does enhanced deliberation and participation lead to increased political trust? Thus, the dissertation tests the relationship between political trust and different kinds of participation. The first part of the dissertation (chapters 1 and 2) places the puzzle in a theoretical context, and provides the framework of the study. Chapter 3 describes Denmark as the study’s case. The second part (chapters 4 and 5) explores the research questions empirically through OLS regression analysis and laboratory experiments. The study has two main conclusions: The relationship between trust and deliberation and participation is curvilinear. If provided with {{too much or too little}} deliberative participation, people have less political trust. Differences exist between what <b>constitutes</b> <b>trust</b> at the EU level and the national level as well as between different cultures and different political systems...|$|R
