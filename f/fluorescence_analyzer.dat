50|$|Typically, {{the rate}} at which a {{molecule}} rotates is indicative of its size. When a fluorescent-labelled molecule (tracer) binds to another molecule the rotational motion will change, resulting in an altered intensity of plane-polarized light, which results in altered fluorescence polarization. Fluorescence polarization immunoassays employ a fluorophore bound antigen that when bound to the antibody of interest, will increase fluorescence polarization. The change in polarization is proportional to the amount of antigen in sample, and is measured by a <b>fluorescence</b> polarization <b>analyzer.</b>|$|R

40|$|Background. A {{well-documented}} {{source of}} mercury contamination is skin-whitening cream. The heavy metal is sometimes {{added to the}} cream to block production of melanin. Past {{studies have shown that}} about one third of skin whitening creams for sale in Phnom Penh contained mercury levels considerably higher than both United States and Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) guidelines. Developing nations such as Cambodia do not have the resources for monitoring and enforcement. Objectives. Evaluate the utility of handheld X-ray <b>fluorescence</b> <b>analyzers</b> for detection of mercury in skin-whiteners. Methods. A handheld XRF unit was used to measure the total mercury content of 676 skin-whitening creams collected from volunteers from a cross-section of Phnom Penh’s residents. Results. About 16 % of bleaching creams collected contained more than 20 ug/g of mercury. The highest concentration was about 35, 000 ug/g. A third of the samples that were custom-made or modified by beauty shops contained more than 20 ug/g of mercury. Conclusions. The handheld XRF analyzer proved an excellent tool for screening mercury in skin creams, and could be particularly useful in developing countries because it is relatively inexpensive, requires no sample preparation or extraction, can be used by staff with little technical background, and can facilitate on-site education.

40|$|Modern {{photoengraving}} {{methods can}} generate forged prints really similar to original ones. Till recently, {{in order to}} distinguish between these fakes and original prints, art historian specialized in art prints have been using only magnifiers (magnifying lenses). The aim {{of the present study}} was to set up a scientific method based on non-invasive techniques to find out differences between photoengraving reproducing etching of the century XVIII and original etching of the century XVII, and to document them. To this aim, several devices were tested: IR reflectography, Portable X-Ray <b>Fluorescence</b> <b>Analyzers</b> (XRF) and optical microscope. We aimed at analysing mainly the kind ink used and the lines. We chose not to analyse the kind of used paper, since for forged prints antique paper can be used as support. The IR response of the two kinds of print, was found to be not relevant. Ink components, as analysed by XRF were not to be distinguished between the ones used for photoenvravings and for the original prints. With the microscope, small areas showing lines were investigated with a 10 X enlargement. Obtained macrophotographies allowed to point out a lot of differences between the two prints. The main ones were: the thickness of the ink, which is greater on originals than on fakes, the kind of light reflection: on originals light is absorbed (ink is dull) while on fakes light is specularly reflected (ink is bright and it seems without consistence), moreover thin and continuous lines in original prints can result broken in forged prints. While the other investigation methods were considered not useful in this study case, microscope gave good results that are easy to achieve and to understand. It represents an easy way of investigation. Microscope can be considered helpful to support art historian during their investigation, and it provides a reliable and affordable way to document the differences between photoengravings and original prints...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study on the}} design of an X-ray <b>fluorescence</b> (XRF) <b>analyzer.</b> The relative geometric positions of the analyzer’s source, detector and specimen are emphasized, which impacts the analyte’s characteristic X-ray fluorescence counts. The theoretical formula for the X-ray fluorescence intensity was derived. The geometric factors (angle and distance) were simulated using Monte Carlo Neutron-Particle Transport Code MCNP 5. The Cu’s X-ray characteristic peak counts were calculated. These Monte Carlo model calculations analyzed two types of geometry changes. The best geometric positions for the XRF analyzer had the incident angle for the excitation source (β) equivalent to the exit angle for the specimen’s characteristic X-ray (β). The maximal characteristic X-ray peak counts were obtained when α and β were orthogonal, and the minimum counts were obtained when parallel. To increase the fluorescence counts, the source and detector should be set as close to the specimen as possible. This method and these conclusions can provide technical guidance for designing XRF analyzers...|$|R

It is demonstrated that the portable XRF results are accurate for many elements, particularly for those with atomic numbers greater than 17. 304 cutting samples from three drillholes in the Tauhara geothermal field were subsequently analyzed by pXRF. Downhole elemental concentrations plotted against lithological units defined on geological well logs indicate that significant variations in elemental concentrations occur, some of which correlate with logged lithology boundaries.
