To carry out this analysis, we constructed two sets of model based on EBITDA margin and return on equity. Panel data analysis is {{used to examine the}} relationship between foreign capital ownership and Brazilian firms’ performance. We construct a cross-section time-series sample of companies listed on the BOVESPA index from 2006 to 2010. Empirical results led us to validate two hypotheses. First, foreign capital participations improve companies’ performance up to a certain level of participation. Then, <b>joint</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>or</b> strategic partnership between a Brazilian company and a foreign investor provide high operating performance...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a block-based simulation environment, developed {{on top of}} Matlab/Simulink TM to facilitate research into various aspects of undulatory robotic locomotion in biology and robotics, including assessing the effect of different body configurations on gait generation. Simulations of snake-like mechanisms are made in this environment by connecting customisable body segment blocks via appropriate joint blocks, which are activated (either by explicit <b>joint</b> <b>control</b> blocks, <b>or</b> by neuromusclular <b>control</b> blocks) to propagate a travelling wave along the mechanism. Several force models are used to characterise the interaction with the locomotion environment, and emulate crawling, walking and swimming. Simulations of anguilliform swimming are presented to illustrate the versatilit...|$|R

30|$|First, {{transmit}} beamforming at CBS is {{more complicated}} in that the beamformers must be optimized jointly. This is because SUs’ beamformers cannot be separately designed, as the interference introduced to each SU’s beamformer {{is a function of}} all the beamformer vectors and power allocation. We tackle this problem by introducing separable game [19] to the design framework, as explained in Section 3. Partially related results have been found in [20 – 22]. In [20, 21], under the sum-power constraint, an alternating optimization strategy for <b>joint</b> power <b>control</b> <b>or</b> linear beamforming has been proposed to solve the SINR balancing problem. Although this beamforming strategy is optimal, identifying an eigenvalue optimization problem for an extended coupling matrix poses heavy computational burden. In [22], subject to interference constraints of PUs and peak transmission power constraints of SUs, a jointing beamforming and power control algorithm called decoupled multiple-constraint power allocation has been presented to balance the SINR level for all SUs. However, when large numbers of active PUs and SUs exist, the computation complexity is still quite high. Our first contribution {{of this paper is to}} solve SINR balancing problem in CR MIMO-BCs with much lower complexity.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The early {{diagnosis}} and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is important to reduce joint destruction. Many of the current imaging techniques have disadvantages, such as the need for contrast agents and interpretation by specialists. Fluorescence imaging is an emerging technique that overcomes some of these problems. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging of indocyanine green (ICG) -lactosomes can detect joint inflammation in a mouse model of RA. Methods: Control and arthritic SKG/Jcl mice were injected with ICG alone or ICG-lactosomes and examined by NIR fluorescence imaging. Arthritis severity was assessed macroscopically and histopathologically. Results: ICG fluorescence was detected in the liver soon after injection and then decreased over the next several hours. ICG was not detected in the <b>joints</b> of <b>control</b> <b>or</b> arthritic mice. In contrast, ICG-lactosomes remained in mice for at least 48 [*]h and accumulated specifically at inflamed joints. ICG-lactosome fluorescence was higher in arthritic versus normal joints at all times examined and was maximal at 24 [*]h after injection. Conclusions: NIR fluorescence imaging of ICG-lactosomes detects arthritic joints in a mouse model of RA. ICG-lactosomes may preferentially localize to inflamed joints via enhanced permeability and retention...|$|R

40|$|Swimmer's {{shoulder}} is a musculoskeletal {{condition that}} results in symptoms {{in the area of}} the anterior lateral aspect of the shoulder, sometimes confined to the subacromial region. The onset of symptoms may be associated with impaired posture, glenohumeral <b>joint</b> mobility, neuromuscular <b>control,</b> <b>or</b> muscle performance. Additionally, training errors such as overuse, misuse, or abuse may also contribute to this condition. In extreme cases, patients with swimmer's shoulder may have soft tissue pathology of the rotator cuff, long head of the biceps, or glenoid labrum. Physical therapists involved in the treatment of competitive swimmers should focus on prevention and early treatment, addressing the impairments associated with this condition, and analyzing training methods and stroke mechanics. The purpose of this clinical commentary is to provide an overview of the biomechanics of swimming, the etiology of the clinical entity referred to as swimmer's shoulder, and strategies for injury prevention and treatment...|$|R
