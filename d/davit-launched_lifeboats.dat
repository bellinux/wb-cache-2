40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the development and}} use of a data acquisition system to capture deployment and manoeuvring performance data from full-scale twin falls <b>davit-launched</b> <b>lifeboats</b> for the purpose of correlation with model-scale experimental results. Full-scale trials were performed at the Fisheries and Marine Institute of Memorial University (MI), Offshore Safety and Survival Centre (OSSC), during September 2002. This training facility's conventional twin falls davit launch system, equipped with a Preferred Orientation and Displacement (PrOD) boom, was used to deploy a Totally Enclosed Motor Propelled Survival Craft (TEMPSC) from a fixed platform in calm conditions. Data was collected during TEMPSC deployment and operation in each of several lifeboat and launch system configurations. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the <b>Davit-Launched</b> <b>Lifeboat</b> Project (DLLBP). The project was initiated by the Norwegian Oil Industry Association (OLF) in December 2009, and was executed as a joint effort between OLF and the Norwegian Shipowners' Association (NSA). The project is a continuation of NSA LAP (Life-saving Appliances Project) and lessons learned in OLF Free Fall Lifeboat Project. The project was organised in six Work Packages (WPs) and was completed in June 2011. The studies in the project covered the following phases during lifeboat evacuation; (1) lifeboat lowering, (2) water entry, (3) release of wire falls and (4) sail-away. Findings and recommendations related to each of the four phases are presented in this paper. The members of the Norwegian Lifeboat Network, consisting of representatives from authorities, unions, suppliers, OLF and NSA, were informed {{during the course of the}} project...|$|R
40|$|The {{capabilities}} of various {{marine evacuation systems}} have been investigated using systematic series of model experiments in a large test facility. Tests were done with a conventional <b>davit-launched</b> twin-falls <b>lifeboat,</b> a similar system {{with the addition of}} a flexible boom, and a free-fall lifeboat. The performance of each system was evaluated as a function of weather conditions, ranging from calm conditions to severe storms. The results of this experimental campaign can be used by designers, regulators and operators in their decisions concerning safety. In this paper, a simple application of some of the results is made in the context of a hypothetical case study to illustrate the utility of the experimental work.
