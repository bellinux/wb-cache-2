5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>Now,</b> the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>Now,</b> the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and their style.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 Harris's {{short stories}} were {{collected}} {{under the title}} Away from the <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>Now.</b> Her stories have also been reprinted in anthologies such as Daughters of Earth: Feminist Science Fiction in the 20th Century (with a critical essay), Sci-Fi Womanthology, Amazing Science Fiction Anthology: The Wonder Years 1926-1935, and Gosh Wow! Sense of Wonder Science Fiction. She wrote one novel, Persephone of Eleusis: A Romance of Ancient Greece (1923).|$|E

Community Chest is replaced with <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> cards while the <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> space replaced the railroads. Houses and hotels have been removed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the opinion}} of Sasha Sokolov:It seems he was only really {{appreciated}} by professionals. Living <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> in Tel-Aviv, I remember our few meetings and frequently walk along Ben Yehuda Street, past his house... Sasha is difficult. He's not only difficult stylistically, but also philosophically. He offers up his immense knowledge without thinking of the reader, without glancing back at him – a knowledge of art, science, philology, naturally. I can {{understand the value of}} his texts, but I don't understand how they were made.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} the <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> especially as an opportunity to look past any preconceived notions and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings that may not have been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E

25|$|Early 20th century theorists, such as Kurt Koffka, Max Wertheimer, and Wolfgang Köhler (students of Carl Stumpf) saw {{objects as}} {{perceived}} within an environment {{according to all}} of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of perception—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It {{is based on the}} <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into figure or ground. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.|$|E
25|$|In time, he is paroled {{from the}} institution, {{and he is}} sent to a place 'for a little gentle treatment'.

25|$|Hines stopped {{recording}} in {{the early}} 1980s until she returned with Right <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> <b>Now</b> in 1994, the same year she became an Australian citizen. She {{was the subject of}} the 2001 biography Diva: the life of Marcia Hines which coincided with the release of the compilation album Diva. Since 2003 she has been a judge on Australian Idol, and her elevated profile led to a renewed interest in her as a performer. Her 2006 album, Discotheque, peaked at number 6 on the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) albums chart. Hines was inducted into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 18 July 2007.|$|E

25|$|HR characterizes {{feelings}} and emotions {{as indicators of}} the quality of one's thinking. Within the HR model, unpleasant feelings or emotions, or stressful feelings, indicate that one's thinking is based on insecurity, negative beliefs, conditioning or learned patterns that are not necessarily appropriate to the live moment <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> They simultaneously indicate that the individual has temporarily lost sight of what HR asserts is his or her own role in creating experience. Pleasant or desired feelings (such as a sense of well-being, gratitude, compassion, peace, etc.) indicate, within the HR model, that the quality of one's thinking is exactly as it needs to be.|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now</b> and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet for all he {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E
25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> We are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
