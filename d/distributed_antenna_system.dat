30|$|FADAC-OFDM {{has been}} {{proposed}} for FO-tolerant Alamouti-coded OFDM for frequency-asynchronous <b>distributed</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> [4]. FADAC-OFDM employs a frequency reversal structure at the TX side. Then, FADAC-OFDM detects the symbols by performing simple linear combining after two separate DFT operations with local carriers synchronized to each TX antenna. By doing so, FADAC-OFDM cancels the major parts of intra-block ICI terms from neighboring subcarriers, and thus, FADAC-OFDM significantly improves the performance for the <b>distributed</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>systems.</b> However, despite the ICI self-cancelation property of FADAC-OFDM, two kinds of ICI terms, i.e., intra-block ICI and inter-block ICI, still remain non-negligible.

40|$|Abstract—Energy {{efficiency}} (EE) {{has caught}} {{more and more}} attention in future wireless communications due to steadily rising energy costs and environmental concerns. In this paper, we propose an EE scheme with proportional fairness for the downlink multiuser <b>distributed</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>systems</b> (DAS). Our aim is to maximize EE, subject to constraints on overall transmit power of each remote access unit (RAU), bit-error rate (BER), and proportional data rates. We exploit multi-criteria optimization method to systematically investigate the relationship between EE and spectral efficiency (SE). Using the weighted sum method, we first convert the multi-criteria optimization problem, which is extremely complex, into a simpler single objective optimization problem. Then an optimal algorithm is developed to allocate the available power to balance the tradeoff between EE and SE. We also demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed scheme and illustrate the fundamental tradeoff between energy- and spectralefficient transmission through computer simulation.
