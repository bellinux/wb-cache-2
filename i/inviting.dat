5|$|Blatty was a Roman Catholic. In 2012, {{he filed}} a canon law {{petition}} against {{his alma mater}} Georgetown University.

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1917, the War was {{dragging}} on towards its fourth year, and Zita's brother Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, a serving officer in the Belgian Army, was a main mover behind a plan for Austria-Hungary to make a separate peace with France.

5|$|During Davuluri's {{visit to}} Central York High School in Pennsylvania, 18-year-old Patrick Farves was {{suspended}} for <b>inviting</b> her to his 2014 prom during a question-and-answer session.

5|$|It {{will also}} have glass walls, which {{according}} to DITIB spokesman Alboga will give visitors a feeling of openness.

5|$|Optimus salvages a shard of the AllSpark from Megatron’s body. The United States {{government}} {{shuts down}} Sector Seven, disposing {{of the dead}} Decepticons in the Laurentian Abyss. Sam and Mikaela then start a relationship while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth, Optimus sends a transmission into space <b>inviting</b> any surviving Autobots to join them.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the game's {{mechanisms}} for contacting players grew more complex. Players were sent messages via email, called on their cell phones, and travelled to arranged meetings between players and characters.

5|$|The National Union of Seamen's Strike of 1966 {{damaged the}} already fragile {{finances}} of Cunard, and left Smallpeice with few options.

The central figure looks out of the picture as if <b>inviting</b> the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E
5|$|The support ship {{eventually}} {{arrived from}} Santo Domingo, and Montejo {{used it to}} sail south along the coast, while he sent D'Avila over land.

Meanwhile, Heidi and Spencer are planning their housewarming party; Spencer plans on <b>inviting</b> several of his friends, while Heidi was only planning on <b>inviting</b> Lauren, Whitney, and Audrina Patridge. Visiting Audrina at Epic Records unannounced, she delivers invitations for Audrina and Lauren. Audrina accepts the invitations, although later tells her co-worker that she believes that Heidi and Spencer were speaking badly of Lauren and were responsible for spreading the sex tape rumors.|$|E
5|$|To mark Sonic's fifteenth {{anniversary in}} 2006, Sega {{released}} a papercraft version of Green Hill as a PDF on its website.

5|$|A devoted Star Trek fan, Pausch {{was invited}} by film {{director}} J. J. Abrams to film {{a role in}} Star Trek.

In addition to appearing in the film, {{he also has a}} line of dialogue {{at the beginning of the}} film ("Captain, we have visual.") and donated the $217.06 paycheck to charity.|$|E
5|$|After 1143 the war ground on, but {{progressing}} {{slightly better}} for Stephen. Miles of Gloucester, {{one of the}} most talented Angevin commanders, had died whilst hunting over the previous Christmas, relieving some of the pressure in the west. Geoffrey de Mandeville's rebellion continued until September 1144, when he died during an attack on Burwell. The war in the west progressed better in 1145, with the King recapturing Faringdon Castle in Oxfordshire. In the north, Stephen came to a fresh agreement with Ranulf of Chester, but then in 1146 repeated the ruse he had played on Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1143, first <b>inviting</b> Ranulf to court, before arresting him and threatening to execute him unless he handed over a number of castles, including Lincoln and Coventry. As with Geoffrey, the moment Ranulf was released he immediately rebelled, but the situation was a stalemate: Stephen had few forces in the north with which to prosecute a fresh campaign, whilst Ranulf lacked the castles to support an attack on Stephen. By this point, however, Stephen's practice of <b>inviting</b> barons to court and arresting them had brought him into some disrepute and increasing distrust.|$|E
5|$|After <b>inviting</b> {{reporters in}} mid-April, Samsung {{launched}} the Galaxy SIII during the Samsung Mobile Unpacked 2012 event at Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, United Kingdom, on 3 May 2012, instead of unveiling their products {{earlier in the}} year during either the World Mobile Congress or Consumer Electronics Show (CES). One explanation for this decision is that Samsung wanted to minimize the time between its launch and availability. The keynote address of the hour-long event was delivered by Loesje De Vriese, Marketing Director of Samsung Belgium.|$|E
5|$|Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{intended}} to follow You Only Live Twice with The Man with the Golden Gun, <b>inviting</b> Roger Moore to the Bond role. However, filming was planned in Cambodia, and the Samlaut Uprising made filming impractical, {{leading to the}} production being cancelled. On Her Majesty's Secret Service was produced instead with George Lazenby as Bond. Lazenby's next Bond film, Saltzman told a reporter, would be either The Man with the Golden Gun or Diamonds Are Forever. The producers chose the latter title, with Sean Connery returning as Bond.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle Onassis's second {{marriage}} exacerbated the tensions already inherent in {{his relationship with}} his son. He also disapproved of Alexander's secret relationship with Fiona Thyssen (née Campbell Walter), a British fashion model some 16 years his senior and the former wife of industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. Onassis had first met Fiona Thyssen when he was 12, and as an 18-year-old had surprised his mother by <b>inviting</b> her to a dinner party, as she was one of his mother's friends.|$|E
5|$|Candaules was {{completed}} and {{exhibited at the}} Royal Academy in 1830. Etty felt that the moral lesson of the story was that women were not male chattels, and that if men—even their husbands—violated a woman's rights she was within her rights to punish them. However, he made little effort to explain what was, at the time, an unusual view, instead allowing viewers to form their own judgement of the piece. Thus, unusually for a painting of the time, Candaules appears morally highly ambiguous, <b>inviting</b> the viewer to sympathise either with the sexually immoral Candaules, the murderous Nyssia or the voyeuristic Gyges.|$|E
5|$|Catherine Hicks plays Doctor Gillian Taylor, a {{biologist}} on 20th century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part {{had been created}} after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer Nicholas Meyer denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a woman biologist featured in a National Geographic documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after <b>inviting</b> her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two. The role was originally written for Eddie Murphy as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.|$|E
5|$|During {{the tour}} an {{anonymous}} person named Publius posted {{a message on}} an internet newsgroup, <b>inviting</b> fans to solve a riddle supposedly concealed in the new album. The veracity of the message was demonstrated when white lights {{in front of the}} stage at a performance in East Rutherford spelled out the words Enigma Publius. During a televised concert at Earls Court in October 1994, the word enigma was projected in large letters on to the backdrop of the stage. Mason later acknowledged that the Publius Enigma did exist, and that it had been instigated by the record company rather than the band. As of 2014 the puzzle remains unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{retirement}} in 1980, Choor Singh continued his close involvement in Indian and Sikh affairs. One of the young Sikhs who founded the Singapore Khalsa Association in 1931, he served as its patron and honorary chairman of its board of trustees. He also contributed to educational charities and causes, both Sikh and non-Sikh, and wrote several books on Sikhism. In 1994, the Sikh community bestowed on him its highest honour by <b>inviting</b> him to lay the foundation stone for the new Gurdwara Sahib building at the Gurdwara Khalsa Dharmak Sabha at 18 Niven Road.|$|E
