On August 28, the Supreme Court ruled that a voter did not have to vote to recall in order to vote <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement,</b> but that the Senators could only be recalled by a majority vote. Secretary of State Gessler announced that Brooks did not have sufficient signatures to qualify for the ballot, leaving only Republican opponents on the ballot.|$|E

In the transfer market, Benfica brought back Rui Costa and recruited other notable players including Katsouranis and David Luiz. Fabrizio Miccoli had his loan renewed for a second year, while Geovanni, Manuel Fernandes and Ricardo Rocha left the club during the season.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} swept wing designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement</b> for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E

However, Yardley opted to not take the ball, and Hassett managed to score a single and get off strike before the English captain called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement</b> ball. O'Reilly said the failure to take the new ball immediately after the appeal was a missed opportunity to maximise the psychological pressure on Hassett.|$|E

The Third Circuit rejected these arguments, ruling that the Seventeenth Amendment does not require primaries.|$|E
5|$|In early July, a {{few days}} after a communist-led mass {{uprising}} commenced, Aćimović reshuffled his government, replacing three commissioners and appointing deputies for most of the portfolios. By mid-July, the Germans had decided that the Aćimović regime was incompetent and unable to deal with the uprising, and began looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement.</b> At the end of August this resulted in the resignation of the Commissioner Government and the appointment of the Government of National Salvation led by former Minister of the Army and Navy General Milan Nedić, in which Aćimović initially retained the Interior portfolio.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, the USAF {{began looking}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement</b> for its fighter aircraft, {{especially}} {{to counter the}} advanced Su-27 and MiG-29. A number of companies, divided into two teams, submitted their proposals. Northrop and McDonnell Douglas submitted the YF-23. Lockheed, Boeing and General Dynamics proposed and built the YF-22, which, although marginally slower and having a larger radar cross-section, was more agile than the YF-23. Primarily for this reason, it was picked by the Air Force as {{the winner of the}} ATF in April 1991. Following the selection, the first YF-22 was retired to a museum, while the second prototype continued flying until an accident relegated it to the role of an antenna test vehicle.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s CDOT began {{considering}} plans <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement</b> bridge. The major issue was whether a new bridge should be built {{along the same}} alignment as the existing bridge, or instead curve westward to make a more direct connection with the interstate's Exit 116. After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred.

5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it was looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement</b> for the A310. Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled {{for the third quarter}} of 2003 and entry into service within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers was lacking.|$|E
5|$|Spanish EAV-8Bs joined Operation Deny Flight, {{enforcing}} the UN's no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Starting in 2007, Spain was looking to replace its Harrier IIs–with the likely option being the F-35B. The Spanish government, in May 2014 however, announced that it had decided to extend the aircraft's service life to beyond 2025 {{due to a lack of}} funds <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>replacement</b> aircraft.|$|E
