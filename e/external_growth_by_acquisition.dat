40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of <b>external</b> <b>growth</b> through mergers and acquisitions (M&As) in a typical Continental European country, Belgium. For this purpose, we use data on 378 private and listed firms that engaged in 816 M&A transactions during 1997 – 2005, and match this sample with companies that did not pursue any <b>external</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>By</b> analyzing bidder characteristics, industry and aggregate market variables, {{we are able to}} determine what motives are important in the decision to acquire. Our results show that intangible capital, leverage and firm size significantly positively affect the decision to grow through M&As whereas the proportion of debt that consists of bank loans and ownership concentration have a negative impact. Furthermore, M&As are significantly more likely in industries that were recently deregulated, that are less concentrated and where industry incumbents are operating at a relatively low scale. Also, the data indicate that internal and external investments are independent growth strategies. The results further show that {{the determinants of}} the M&A decision differ significantly in low- versus high-growth industries. Finally, investigating related versus diversifying M&As provides evidence supporting the market power and bankruptcy avoidance theory...|$|R

40|$|In the mid- 1990 s several {{building}} {{societies in}} the UK ceased to be mutual organisations and became public limited companies (plcs). This paper seeks to explain this change, which has ended the building societies' historic dominance of the mortgage market. The thesis that mutuality had become redundant as an ownership form is rejected. Structural changes in the industry have presented mortgage lenders with strategic choices, rather than dictated a single viable course. Structural change necessitated demutualisation only in the limited cases where a larger plc took over a small mutual. Case studies {{of each of the}} building societies that have converted indicated four other principal reasons for demutualisation: (1) an attempt to maintain full organisational independence; (2) an attempt to maintain operational independence; (3) a <b>growth</b> <b>by</b> <b>acquisition</b> strategy; and (4) a members' revolt. Along with the continued commitment to mutuality of some societies, these represent a variety of responses to structural change...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we look at}} the {{relationship}} of Penrose's theory of the growth of the firm to the multinational enterprise. We argue that one element in exploring the nature and evolution of the MNE may lie in asking the question; ‘what was there before there was the MNE?’ The answer to this may lie in examining corporate growth processes and the evolution of large firms through internal <b>growth</b> and <b>external</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>By</b> placing the MNE in the broader context of Penrosian growth processes, {{it may be possible to}} develop a fuller analysis of the globalisation of economic activity. We also argue that the potential benefits from pursuing such possible links may not just be limited to work in the international business field. By developing an approach to the multinational based on such foundations, it may be possible to contribute to understanding and analysis in areas (such as corporate growth) that have been traditionally regarded as the preserve of the industrial organisation theorists, but which have been relatively neglected by them in recent years...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} antecedents of growth through mergers and {{acquisitions}} (M&As) in a typical continental European country, Belgium. The article reports on a study using data on 484 private and listed bidders engaging in 990 M&As during 1997 - 2007, and matches this sample with companies that did not pursue any <b>external</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>By</b> analyzing firm characteristics, industry, and aggregate financial market variables, the study can also discern the motives {{that are important in}} the decision to acquire. The results show that neither the firm's cash position nor its cash-generating abilities influence its choice to grow externally. Yet, intangible assets affect the M&A decision positively, whereas ownership concentration and bank loans have a negative effect. In industries where incumbents are operating at a lower scale and in more highly concentrated industries, the odds of firms participating in M&As are larger. Industry deregulation, industry growth, and financial market conditions have no influence. These findings are largely comparable across listed and private firms. Yet, the data do reveal that the operating scale of industry incumbents and industry concentration matter only in horizontal and domestic takeover decisions.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of the local {{industrial}} structure on employment dynamics in Western Germany. Following an approach of Combes/Magnac/Robin (2004) for France, local employment growth is decomposed into internal growth resulting from employment changes in existing plants and into <b>external</b> <b>growth</b> determined <b>by</b> employment decisions of newly established plants. The dynamics of both components are estimated simultaneously, taking explicitly into account the timing of {{the impact of}} specialization, diversity, and competition in a region. The analysis is conducted for 24 sectors in the West German labor market regions from 1993 to 2002. Estimation results emphasize the positive influence of diversity on both internal and <b>external</b> employment <b>growth,</b> whereas there is no clear result on specialization. A high degree of competition fosters external employment, but is detrimental to internal employment. Dynamic panel regressions show that static externalities dominate. Importantly, {{the impact of the}} local industrial structure on employment dynamics does not differ between small and larger plants, nor are there fundamental differences between Western Germany and France.

Bacteriol. 89 : 889 – 896. 1965. —The {{extent to which}} the intracellular growth of microbes is dependent upon capacities for growth in vitro has been investigated by use of organisms which require a specific factor, mycobactin, for isolation and growth on conventional mycobacterial media. Similarities between growth on bacteriological media and within tissue cells have been demonstrated by examining the responses of Mycobacterium paratuberculosis and wood pigeon mycobacteria to mycobactin, iron, CO 2, and glycerol, and to the low pH which characterizes phagocytic vacuoles. The results indicate that success of intracellular infections depends upon the independent growth of microbes and that the phagocytic vacuoles of sheep and mouse macrophages seem to be freely accessible to bacterial growth factors, minerals, and substrates. Because these factors did not modify the appearance, overall metabolism, or surface properties of macrophages, it was concluded that the intracellular growth of microbes is not determined solely by the components, metabolism, or immunological properties of host cells, but is influenced to an important degree by compounds and conditions provided by extracellular environments...|$|R
