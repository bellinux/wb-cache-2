5|$|Construction began for Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D in September 2011. By April 2012, the {{previous}} ride {{had been completely}} cleared, with the availability of an empty show building to accommodate the new ride. In June 2012, Warner Bros. Movie World released some images <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> attraction, mid-way through its construction. On 3 September 2012, the park unveiled the Justice League: Alien Invasion 3D's Hall of Justice façade, which replaced the Wayne Manor façade from the former Batman attraction.|$|E

5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers {{shot in a}} {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view outside of the ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic {{the feeling of being}} hit.|$|E
5|$|Merritt {{brought the}} score to 59–35 with her seventh scoring shot. As the game {{drew to a}} close, there were several missed shots by Sarah Vinci and Hill, but Mexico was unable to {{capitalise}} on the opportunities, continuing to miss shots and turn over the ball. With nineteen seconds of play remaining, Hill took a two-point shot <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> paint; attracting a foul, she scored another point from a free throw. Although Mexico's Wendy Garcia Amador scored the last two points of the game, her team lost to Australia 62–37.|$|E

This limits its capacity in UEFA-sanctioned matches to the 3,000 seats in the two main stands as terracing has not been permitted in UEFA matches since 1998.|$|E
5|$|A {{lingering}} controversy {{exists in}} ichthyology over {{the validity of}} the four species Beebe described on the basis of visual descriptions only, which he had observed during his Bathysphere dives. The naming of a new species ordinarily requires obtaining and analyzing a type specimen, something which was obviously impossible <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Bathysphere. Some of Beebe's critics claimed that these fish were illusions resulting from condensation on the Bathysphere's window, or even that Beebe willfully made them up, although the latter would have been strongly at odds with Beebe's reputation as an honest and rigorous scientist. While many of Beebe's observations from the Bathysphere have since been confirmed by advances in undersea photography, it is unclear whether others fit the description of any known sea animal. One possibility is that although these animals indeed exist, so much remains to be discovered about life in the deep ocean that these animals have yet to be seen by anyone other than him.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Adelaide, South Australia, Oliphant {{graduated}} from the University of Adelaide in 1922. He was awarded an 1851 Exhibition Scholarship in 1927 {{on the strength of}} the research he had done on mercury, and went to England, where he studied under Sir Ernest Rutherford at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory. There, he used a particle accelerator to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons) at various targets. He discovered the nuclei of helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons). He also discovered that when they reacted with each other, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.|$|E

5|$|Emmerson was {{released}} by the club after failing to make any first-team appearances, while Ferrell joined Gateshead for a £3,500 fee and Jamie Clarke signed having been released by Grimsby Town. Purkiss gave York the lead away to Histon before Bradley Hudson-Odoi scored to equalise as the match finished a 1–1 draw, which ended a club record run of league victories at nine. A 1–0 away win over Kettering came after Rankine scored the only goal with a volley <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> penalty area. Goalkeeper Simon Miotto joined the club as goalkeeping coach, and later registered as a player. York suffered their first league defeat since October 2009 after being beaten 1–0 away to Ebbsfleet; Brodie was sent off in this match, for which he received a three-match suspension. This {{was followed by a}} 0–0 draw at home to fellow play-off contenders Luton. York suffered their first home defeat in 10 months after being beaten 1–0 by Eastbourne Borough.|$|E
5|$|Every {{episode of}} the 13-part series was soon {{available}} for download {{on a range of}} sites. It was reported that on mininova.org more than 3,000 users were attempting to download episode seven late on the afternoon of 27 February 2008. The Nine Network said it was considering legal action, and was looking into how copies got into the hands of underworld figures in Victoria, including Roberta Williams, the former wife of gangland kingpin Carl Williams. Unauthorised copies of the entire series were also made available to the public. People were offered a 4-disc DVD set for between A$10 and $80 in public places such as carparks and building sites. The episodes were commercial-free and came with introductory station countdowns, suggesting a major leak <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> network's production department.|$|E
5|$|Following their exit in the Champions League in midweek, Arsenal beat Everton 4–1 on 21 April 2001. They moved {{four points}} clear in second with a further win, this time away at Derby County. Wiltord scored the winning goal against Leeds United {{to secure a}} Champions League place for Arsenal; a draw against Newcastle United {{confirmed}} the club as runners-up for the third season running. Arsenal ended their league campaign against Southampton, in the final match played at The Dell. With the score 2–2 in the 89th minute, striker Matthew Le Tissier volleyed the ball <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> penalty box and over goalkeeper Alex Manninger, to win the match for the home team.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Beebe and Barton's Bathysphere dives were {{interrupted}} {{for a year}} due to technical problems and uncooperative weather. An additional difficulty in 1931 was the death of Beebe's father, and Beebe left Nonsuch Island for a week in order to attend his father's funeral. A second year-long interruption occurred in 1933, and was caused {{in part by a}} lack of funds due to the Great Depression. Although Beebe and Barton performed no dives in 1933, their work gathered a large amount of publicity when the Bathysphere was displayed in a special exhibit for the American Museum of Natural History, and later at the Century of Progress World's Fair in Chicago, where they shared the fair's Hall of Science with Auguste Piccard. Beebe and Barton also obtained publicity for their dives from several articles Beebe wrote describing them for National Geographic, and from an NBC radio broadcast in which Beebe's voice transmitted up the phone line <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> Bathysphere was broadcast nationally over the radio.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} match from the Raw brand, Kane faced Rob Van Dam in a No Disqualification match. Both wrestlers used a ladder {{to their advantage}} early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van Dam, he attempted to hit Van Dam with a flying clothesline. However, Van Dam {{moved out of the}} way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a folding chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with a chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van Dam in mid-air and executed a Tombstone Piledriver, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall.|$|E

5|$|Marge forbids Bart and Lisa from {{watching}} the Itchy & Scratchy Halloween special, removing the batteries from the remote control. When Marge leaves, Bart finds plutonium in Homer's toolbox and hammers {{it into the}} remote's battery slot. When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday, May 25, 1941, {{ground was}} broken for Mount St. Peter Church. The event was celebrated by the priests of St. Peter's {{congregation}} and about two thousand {{people showed up}} to watch. The cornerstone was blessed on Sunday, September 7, 1941, by Reverend Alfred Koch, who was the Arch Abbot of St. Vincent in Latrobe, Pennsylvania. Many other priests from the area were also present. Father Paul Tomlinson of St. Peter's Church in Pittsburgh delivered the sermon in English and Archabbot Koch closed the ceremony with the Pontifical Benediction in Italian. The large red cornerstone was made of granite and was fitted with an iron box. The box contained the memorial reports of the congregation, newspapers, American and Papal coins, and medals of the church. The cornerstone was placed {{so that it can}} be seen <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> church. It is located by the altar of the Sacred Heart.|$|E
5|$|Production was centred at Pinewood Studios and {{principal}} photography began there on 11 January 1999 with scenes <b>from</b> <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> MI6 offices, designed by Peter Lamont. The pre-title sequence {{was shot in}} Bilbao, Spain, in February, with production moving to Chamonix, France, which doubled for the Caucasus scenes. The exterior of a Kazakh nuclear facility was shot at the Bardenas Reales, in Navarre, Spain, while the exterior of an oil refinery control centre was doubled by the Motorola building in Groundwell, Swindon. The exterior of the oil pipeline was filmed in Cwm Dyli, Snowdonia, Wales, while the production teams shot the oil pipeline explosion in Hankley Common, Elstead, Surrey. The production also visited Istanbul, Turkey; the scenes of villain Elektra King's Baku villa were filmed in the city, and the famous Maiden's Tower {{was used for the}} hideout of the second villain Renard. The underwater submarine scenes were filmed in the Bahamas.|$|E
