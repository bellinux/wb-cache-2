In addition the paper tries to establish whether <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> invest in different amounts of Swedish education also differ in their returns to schooling.

40|$|Using 2006 Canadian Census data, {{this paper}} {{focuses on the}} {{economic}} performance of highly educated <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> were born in less developed countries and who studied inside or outside Canada. There are two outcomes that are studied for immigrants and Canadian-born: access to a full-time full-year job and earnings. This study finds that immigrants from all places of birth have a lower probability of having a full-time full-year job than Canadian-born individuals and that, for most places of birth; <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> studied outside Canada have a lower probability of having such a job than <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> studied in Canada. People with more years of schooling earn more for both immigrants and Canadian-born, but immigrants earn less than the Canadian-born workers with the same educational attainment. Among the immigrants, some completed their higher education {{in their own country}} while others studied in Canada. The results show that <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> studied in Canada tend to earn more than <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> studied outside Canada...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Samuel Aboah (Willie Amakye), an African <b>immigrant</b> <b>who</b> {{is seeking}} citizenship, attacks {{a young black}} man while he is waiting for a bus, {{kidnapping}} him. Investigating Kittel's disappearance, Mulder predicts that another seed will be found. They have Marcus Duff (Carl Lumbly), a social worker who is helping Aboah apply for citizenship, cross-reference the names from the flight with those applying for permanent residency or a work visa. This leads them to Aboah, who runs when they try to question him and is discovered after squeezing himself into a drainage pipe. Aboah appears to have no symptoms of disease when he is analyzed at a local medical center, but Scully plans to examine him more.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{emerged in}} the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar <b>immigrant</b> <b>who</b> studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, {{a few members of}} Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles led by its {{minister}} Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to branch out to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976 and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} founded on the Monterey Peninsula, California, in 1958 by Dr. Béla H. Bánáthy, a Hungarian <b>immigrant</b> <b>who</b> taught at the {{language}} school. In the 21st century, there are two programs in California: one in Concord, sponsored by the White Stag Association, and one in Monterey, sponsored by the White Stag Leadership Development Academy. Bánáthy drew from his youth experience at the 1933 World Jamboree in Gödöllő, Hungary; he named the program after the mythological white stag used as an emblem at the jamboree. Years later, in June 1951 Bánáthy met two other Hungarians teaching at the Army Language School. They had all escaped Hungary before Soviet occupation, Joe Szentkiralyi and Paul Sujan, who had also attended the 1933 World Jamboree. They were initially assisted by a local American Scouter, Fran Peterson.|$|E

30|$|Difficulties in {{measuring}} return migration have limited empirical analyzes of this process. As Dustmann and Weiss (2007) note, “there are typically no procedures {{in place that}} register <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> leave a country”. At the macro level, this leaves researchers attempting to combine information from various censuses and surveys to infer the numbers (and characteristics) of <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> appear to have emigrated (e.g. Dustmann and Weiss 2008). At the micro level, researchers often rely on immigrants’ stated intentions regarding return migration {{to understand how the}} behavior of temporary and permanent migrants differs. The general conclusion is that <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> intend to emigrate both save and remit more than <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> intend to remain permanently in the host country (Merkle and Zimmermann 1992; Sinning 2011; Bauer and Sinning 2011).|$|R

Methods: Using the Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS) to measure the social support condition of the first batch of immigrants {{before and after the}} intervention, and then compare it with the <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> were not intervened. Results: Compared with the <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> were not intervened, the <b>immigrants</b> <b>who</b> received intervention have a higher score on the availability of social support (P< 0. 05).
