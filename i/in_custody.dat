Specifically, the police had Alvarado's parents bring him to the police station, brought Alvarado to an interrogation room, kept his parents out, and questioned him for two hours.|$|E

500|$|The {{benefits}} {{for children to}} maintain relationships with both parents have been repeatedly shown in research. [...] Children <b>in</b> joint <b>custody</b> arrangements often report greater levels of satisfaction with the division of time between their parents and children are also less likely to feel torn between their parents when compared with children who are <b>in</b> sole <b>custody</b> arrangements. <b>In</b> addition, children <b>in</b> joint <b>custody</b> arrangements report feeling closer to both parents than children <b>in</b> sole <b>custody</b> arrangements. Joint custody arrangements also appear to benefit the parents. Not only do parents <b>in</b> joint <b>custody</b> arrangements report lower levels of conflict with one another, when compared to those <b>in</b> sole <b>custody</b> arrangements, but joint custody is frequently related to more positive relationships, effective parenting, and lower inter-parental conflict; key factors that ensure a child’s well-being following divorce. However, {{it is important to}} point out that children are far less likely to do well with joint custody and sole custody arrangements when their parents used them as pawns or when they consistently witness their parents' frequent, intense, and ongoing conflict.|$|R

5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v.

If a defendant <b>in</b> <b>custody</b> is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
