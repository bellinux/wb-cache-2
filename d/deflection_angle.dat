5|$|The {{experiment}} {{had previously}} been considered, but rejected, by Isaac Newton as a practical demonstration of his theory of gravitation. However, a team of scientists, notably Nevil Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, {{was convinced that the}} effect would be detectable and undertook to conduct the experiment. The <b>deflection</b> <b>angle</b> depended on the relative densities and volumes of the Earth and the mountain: if the density and volume of Schiehallion could be ascertained, then so could the density of the Earth. Once this was known, then this would in turn yield approximate values for those of the other planets, their moons, and the Sun, previously known only in terms of their relative ratios. As an additional benefit, the concept of contour lines, devised to simplify the process of surveying the mountain, later became a standard technique in cartography.|$|E

25|$|To {{find the}} wire's torsion coefficient, the torque exerted by the wire {{for a given}} angle of twist, Cavendish timed the natural {{oscillation}} period of the balance rod as it rotated slowly clockwise and counterclockwise against the twisting of the wire. The period was about 20 minutes. The torsion coefficient could be calculated from this and the mass and dimensions of the balance. Actually, the rod was never at rest; Cavendish had to measure the <b>deflection</b> <b>angle</b> of the rod while it was oscillating.|$|E
25|$|In {{oscilloscope}} CRTs, {{electrostatic deflection}} is used, {{rather than the}} magnetic deflection commonly used with television and other large CRTs. The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an electric field between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the <b>deflection</b> <b>angle</b> is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.|$|E

40|$|We model massive dark objects at {{centers of}} many galaxies as Schwarzschild black hole lenses and study {{gravitational}} lensing by them in detail. We {{show that the}} ratio of mass of a Schwarzschild lens to the differential time delay between outermost two relativistic images (both of them either on the primary or on the secondary image side) is extremely insensitive {{to changes in the}} angular source position as well as the lens-source and lens-observer distances. Therefore, this ratio can be used to obtain very accurate values for masses of black holes at centers of galaxies. Similarly, angular separations between any two relativistic images are also extremely insensitive to changes in the angular source position and the lens-source distance. Therefore, with the known value of mass of a black hole, angular separation between two relativistic images would give a very accurate result for the distance of the black hole. Accuracies in determination of masses and distances of black holes would however depend on accuracies in measurements of differential time delays and angular separations between images. <b>Deflection</b> <b>angles</b> of primary and secondary images as well as effective <b>deflection</b> <b>angles</b> of relativistic images on the secondary image side are always positive. However, the effective <b>deflection</b> <b>angles</b> of relativistic images on the primary image side may be positive, zero, or negative depending on the value of angular source position and the ratio of mass of the lens to its distance. We show that effective <b>deflection</b> <b>angles</b> of relativistic images play significant role in analyzing and understanding strong gravitational field lensing. Comment: 26 pages, 12 figures.

2500|$|These shocks are curved {{and form}} a small {{distance}} {{in front of the}} body. Directly in front of the body, they stand at 90 degrees to the oncoming flow and then curve around the body. Detached shocks allow the same type of analytic calculations as for the attached shock, for the flow near the shock. They are a topic of continuing interest, because the rules governing the shock's distance ahead of the blunt body are complicated and are a function of the body's shape. Additionally, the shock standoff distance varies drastically with the temperature for a non-ideal gas, causing large differences in the heat transfer to the thermal protection system of the vehicle.
