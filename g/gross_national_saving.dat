40|$|Rebalancing growth {{patterns}} of Asian economies {{is an important}} component of the overall rebalancing effort that will be required in the world economy. In this paper, I provide an empirical characterization of the composition of GDP levels and growth rates for the key emerging markets and other developing economies in Asia. China has by far the lowest share of private consumption to GDP in Asia and, during this decade, has recorded the lowest rate of employment growth relative to GDP growth. Investment growth has dominated GDP growth in China during this decade but is also important in the cases of India and Vietnam. To examine the global implications of domestic growth patterns in Asia, I analyze saving-investment balances, the composition of <b>national</b> <b>savings,</b> and the determinants of the evolution of household saving rates. During 2000 - 08, household saving rates (relative to household income) have risen gradually in China and India but fallen sharply in Korea. Corporate savings have surged across Asia during this period, becoming the main component of <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>savings</b> in the region. In terms of sheer magnitudes, China’s <b>national</b> <b>savings</b> and current account surpluses dominate the region’s saving-investment balances. China accounts for just under half of GDP in Asia ex-Japan, but accounts for 60 percent of total <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>savings</b> and nearly 90 percent of the current account surplus of the region. Finally, I discuss some policy implications that come out of the analysis on how to shift the {{patterns of}} growth, especially in China, from a welfare-enhancing perspective. ...|$|R

The essential objective behind {{this paper is to}} explore the effect of the alternative adjustment of China’s real exchange rate. Different with the previous simulation designs, this paper considers the formation mechanism of the real exchange rate. By assuming the same change of factor’s price during different time periods and using the recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model, the two different scenarios are simulated against the baseline, one is to adjust the macro-structural imbalance by decreasing the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> rate in China and the other is to adjust the micro-structural imbalance by increasing the real wage rate of Chinese labor. It can be seen that, first, the external imbalance will be improved by both the internal structural adjustments in the long-term; second, the effect of macro-adjustment is more significant than the micro-adjustment; third, a real appreciation would be sufficient for China to improve its terms of trade and change the export-oriented model of development into demand-oriented model of development in the next decade.

40|$|It is income {{rather than}} the {{peculiar}} saving behavior of Chinese households that constrains consumption in the People’s Republic of China. The low share of consumption in gross domestic product (GDP) {{is consistent with the}} reduced share of GDP of wage earnings—a major source of household income. Corporate savings, which accounted for 23 % of national income in 2007, contributed most to the significant increase in the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> rate. The surging corporate savings was mainly due to the bias of income distribution toward capital. The profits of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) made with monopolistic power and government support comprises a substantial part of corporate savings. A series of enterprise reforms have made SOEs leaner and bigger, and transformed a handful central SOEs into monopolies in highly profitable industries. Retained profits by SOEs only benefit managers and employees in these firms, not the general public who are their true owners. The empirical analysis indicates that high levels of compensation by SOEs contributed to rising inter-industry income disparity. To boost domestic demand, it is essential that the government address the bias in distribution between SOEs and households. Collecting dividends from SOEs to fund social welfare systems or direct income transfers to low-income families will reduce the <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> rate, boost consumption, and more importantly, mitigate social inequality.

A number of authors have suggested that redressing government saving, through fiscal discipline characterised by a low government budget deficit ratio, should be a key in redressing the national saving trend in South Africa. In order to assess this hypothesis, this paper studies the dynamics of <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving,</b> government saving and private saving in response to fiscal shocks, by using the impulse response functions (IRF) obtained from the structural vector autoregressive (SVAR).

Whilst Botswana {{has one of the}} highest <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>savings</b> in sub-Saharan Africa, the same cannot be said regarding household savings. Household savings in Botswana have grown at a very slow pace between 2003 and 2012, a worrisome trend given the importance of savings. The main objective of the research assignment was to determine the factors that influence households saving behaviour in Botswana. A probit econometric model was used to find out what factors influence households to choose to save and which ones influence them not to save. Saving behaviour was measured by whether an individual has saved money with a financial institution within the past 12 months. The individual characteristics that were modelled for influence on households saving behaviour were age, income level, education level, gender, formal credit, informal credit, insurance and property ownership. The results indicated that, as suggested by theory and empirical evidence, age, income level and education level have a positive and significant influence on households saving behaviour, whereas, also in line with theory, formal and informal credit and insurance have a negative and significant influence on households saving behaviour. Being female also has a negative but insignificant influence on households saving behaviour. Contrary to expectations, property ownership, which was used as proxy for non-financial assets, has a positive influence on household saving behaviour, although the influence is not significant...|$|R

Others have suggested more radical reforms such as moving OASDI entirely from a Defined Benefit scheme to a Defined Contribution plan based on the Chilean model. Canada has moved to a system of greater pre-funding for the C/QPP in order to cap contribution rates at 9. 9 percent. These proposals are based on the goal of creating higher investment returns, in order to make social security benefits easier to finance in the long run.

40|$|Abstract. Governments of {{transition}} countries should {{become aware of}} the importance of implementation of such an economic policy that would encourage higher saving rates and at the same time bringing it in accordance with investment rates in order to achieve other important macroeconomic goals, without jeopardizing macroeconomic stability of their respective economies. Transition countries EU members have not conduct such an economic policy, which resulted in existence of a substantial difference between total investments and <b>gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>savings</b> in their countries. Although the influence of saving on investments was significant, conducting of economic (investment) policy of the right-wing governments of the transition countries EU members has more influenced imbalance of saving and investment in comparison to the left-wing governments. Should the right-wing governments, in applying of economic measures that stimulate higher investment rate than previous, follow their ideological point of view instead of turning to 'middle' voters, they would have an easier position in reducing saving-investment gap and in achieving macroeconomic stability in comparison to the left-wing governments. However, should the right-wing governments turn more opportunistically to 'middle' voters, instead following their ideological programme, that would make their position difficult in reducing saving-investment gap, because influence of saving to investment would be significantly lesser. Increasing of saving rate with left-wing governments would have significantly weaker influence on balancing of saving and investment in comparison to the right-wing governments, but their opportunistically turning to 'middle' voters would create slightly better position in realizing of macroeconomic stability, because by this their influence on reducing saving-investment gap would be improved compared to the situation when they would follow their left-oriented party programme.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to explain why a low and declining saving rate should be a problem in a world of free capital flows and {{increasing}} wealth. In Italy consumer households’ saving have been the main driver of economic stability and growth, funding investments and public debt, and despite international turbulences Italy was acknowledged as a high saving country until the early 1990 ’s. Ever since, however, households saving rate plunged, in spite of an increasing financial wealth, and our aim is to explain why: we suggest two main causes. The first is related to the economic policies implemented to deal with four major economic events, prompted by economic misalignments: a) the 1992 ’s currency crisis, b) the run-up to the Euro, c) the 2006 ’ turning point, preceding the 2008 ’s crisis, and d) the 2009 ’s public debt crisis and the following policy of fiscal consolidation. These four events were dealt with economic policies which overlooked the huge income and saving shifts from households to government and private sectors: rising tax burden, especially indirect taxes, freezing of nominal public expenditures and falling real wages were the main policy instruments, while a decreasing households’ income and saving was a primary consequences. Households have been struggling to smooth their standard of life drawing on their saving and wealth, but the effort became all the more difficult as the saving rate was falling below a critical level, increasing the probability of negative saving and debt. <b>Gross</b> <b>national</b> <b>saving</b> turned less than aggregate investment, prompting an increasing borrowing from abroad and a corresponding negative current account. The second cause is structural and covers two crucial issues: the first is the deep economy impacts of a changing age structure, as a consequence of a sudden fertility drop. The second issue is related to the falling households size composition jointly with the rising share of quasi-fixed costs necessary for a decent life. We show how and why a well designed Welfare State could help to restore income stability and saving, tackling the widespread problem of changing age structure in most countries...|$|E
