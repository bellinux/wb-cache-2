The two have a discreet meeting at {{the parking lot of the}} Watergate Hotel, where Mulder admits that he has been doubting <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paranormal since Deep Throat's assassination. Mulder flashes back to the night when his sister, Samantha, was abducted.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his career}} as a senator, Hugo L Black would give speeches based on <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} power of the Constitution. He came to see the actions of the anti-New Deal Supreme Court as judicial excess; in his view, the Court was improperly overturning legislation that had been passed by large majorities in Congress.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{served as}} a Ruling Elder at the Presbyterian General Assembly of 1832, then {{relocated}} to Princeton, New Jersey, to study under Samuel Miller at Princeton Theological Seminary. In November 1832, he succeeded his brother John as pastor of Second Presbyterian Church of Baltimore, Maryland. His tenure saw numerous converts, but he was put at odds with his brother and Samuel Miller over practices employed in his church. His counselors were also concerned that he was wavering on <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doctrine of limited atonement. Eventually, he was persuaded back into the doctrines of the orthodox Calvinism {{and became one of}} the leaders of the Old School Presbyterian movement.|$|E
5|$|In 1583, Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio {{claimed to}} have {{discovered}} a non-fragmentary version of the Consolatio. While this news was met with excitement at first, scholars—after reading the work—began {{to argue that the}} manuscript was a fraud, with humanist Antonio Riccoboni being among the most vocal. However, Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death, even mentioning in two different orations <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> truthfulness of the text. The scholar Latino Latini, however, later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed. By and large, the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine, and the document later earned the name the Pseudo-Ciceronian Consolatio.|$|E
5|$|Some historians such as Angela Woollacott and Kumari Jayawardena {{state that}} even though Gandhi often and {{publicly}} expressed <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> equality of sexes, yet his vision was one of gender difference and complementarity between them. Women, to Gandhi, should be educated to be better in the domestic realm and educate the next generation. His views on women's right were less liberal and more similar to puritan-Victorian expectations of women, states Jayawardena, than other Hindu leaders with him who supported economic independence and equal gender rights in all aspects.|$|E
50|$|A {{reading of}} Krippner's book, Human Possibilities, {{published}} by Doubleday, {{convinced me that}} there is a man sincere <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paranormal and bending over backward to be fair and open minded but incredibly naive. In his book he endorses the feats of several psychics who have already been exposed as frauds.|$|R
50|$|As a Christian reform physiologist, Graham {{explored}} {{the relationship between}} sexuality and the mind, body, and health, rooting <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Christian tradition. <b>His</b> piece On Self-Pollution, published in 1834, contributed to <b>the</b> masturbation scare <b>in</b> antebellum America. He believed youthful masturbation was dangerous to children's health because of the immaturity of their reproductive organs.|$|R

5|$|The {{historian}} H. S. Offler in 1951 {{felt that}} the Libellus was not a contemporary account of the trial, and instead dated from {{the second quarter of}} the 12th century and was produced at Durham. More recent scholars, including W. M. Aird, Frank Barlow, and Emma Mason have concluded that the work is indeed a contemporary record of the trial. Barlow bases <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> authenticity on the level of detail {{and the fact that the}} account lacks all knowledge of events outside the court, and explains that Offler's concerns can be explained by the late date for all the manuscripts, which allowed scribal errors to creep in.|$|E
5|$|Ti Noel is well {{established}} early on as not only a witness to events, but also as someone who makes observations and offers reflection. It is he who considers slavery under Henri Christophe worse than that under French rule because blacks are now enslaving fellow blacks. It is also he who offers reflections about the difficulty of this world allowing {{for the possibility of}} greatness during the concluding remarks of the novel. His perspective represents that of the folk, including <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> African gods.|$|E
5|$|While Briggs held to {{traditional}} Christian teaching in many areas, such as <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> virgin birth of Jesus, conservatives were alarmed by his assertion that doctrines were historical constructs {{that had to}} change over time. He {{did not believe that}} the Pentateuch was authored by Moses or that the book of Isaiah had a single author. In addition, he also denied that biblical prophecy was a precise prediction of the future. In 1891, Briggs preached a sermon in which he claimed the Bible contained errors, a position many in the church considered contrary to the Westminster Confession's doctrines of verbal inspiration and biblical inerrancy.|$|E
5000|$|Enjolras (...) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{acts as the}} charismatic leader of the Friends of <b>the</b> ABC <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1862 novel Les Misérables by Victor Hugo. <b>In</b> both <b>the</b> novel and the musical that it inspired, Enjolras is a revolutionary who fights for a France with more rights {{for the poor and}} oppressed masses, ultimately dying for <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> June 1832 rebellion.|$|R
25|$|It {{has been}} ranked {{as the most}} {{important}} American book published before 1800. The book is Jefferson's vigorous and often eloquent argument {{about the nature of the}} good society, which he believed was incarnated by Virginia. In it he expressed <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He also compiled extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy.|$|R
50|$|In 1712, Addison {{wrote his}} most famous work of fiction, Cato, a Tragedy. Based on {{the last days of}} Marcus Porcius Cato Uticensis, it deals with such themes as {{individual}} liberty versus government tyranny, Republicanism versus Monarchism, logic versus emotion, and Cato's personal struggle to cleave to <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of death. It has a prologue written by Alexander Pope and an epilogue by Dr. Garth.|$|R
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cyclical nature of time, something which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E

5000|$|On other {{occasions}} the paper served to inform its readers on the pseudo-scientific research Himmler commissioned to support <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mystical {{powers of the}} ancient Germanic predecessors.

50|$|He became {{editor of}} the Western Labour News. A week after the {{editor of the}} strike {{bulletin}} {{was arrested and charged with}} seditious libel, Woodsworth found himself <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position, but was released on bail after five days' imprisonment, and the charges were never filed. These events were instrumental in establishing Woodsworth's credentials with the labour movement and in propelling him to a twenty-year tenure in public office. They also affirmed <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> importance of social activism.|$|R
5000|$|Sikorsky was {{a deeply}} {{religious}} Russian Orthodox Christian and authored two religious and philosophical books (The Message of the Lord's Prayer and The Invisible Encounter). Summarizing <b>his</b> <b>beliefs,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> latter he wrote: Our concerns sink into insignificance {{when compared with}} the eternal value of human personality - a potential child of God which is destined to triumph over life, pain, and death. No one can take this sublime meaning of life away from us, and this is the one thing that matters.|$|R

25|$|In 1665, {{the plague}} found London and George Starkey. For all of <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{ability of the}} Helmontian {{medicines}} to cure disease and prevent illness, the Helmontian alchahest Starkey prepared to combat the plague was ineffective. To the end, Starkey remained faithful to the Flemish iatrochemist that he revered.|$|E

50|$|Widely {{considered}} the most important American book published before 1800, Notes on the State of Virginia is both a compilation of data by Jefferson about the state's natural resources and economy, and his vigorous and often eloquent argument {{about the nature of}} the good society, which he believed was incarnated by Virginia. He expressed <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> separation of church and state, constitutional government, checks and balances, and individual liberty. He wrote extensively about slavery, the problems of miscegenation, and <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> that whites and blacks could not live together in a free society.|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> {{extending}} <b>the</b> counter-tenor repertoire {{has prompted}} new {{work to be}} composed for him by Richard Rodney Bennett, Alexander Goehr, Tan Dun, Anthony Powers, John Tavener, and Elvis Costello - amongst others.|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Constantine favored the Central Powers and wanted Greece to remain neutral. He was {{influenced}} both by <b>his</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military superiority of Germany {{and also by}} his German wife, Queen Sophia, and his pro-German court. He therefore strove to secure a neutrality, which would be favorable to Germany and Austria.|$|E

25|$|Following {{service as}} USAF Vice Chief of Staff (1957–1961), LeMay was made the fifth Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force on the {{retirement}} of Gen Thomas White. <b>His</b> <b>belief</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> efficacy of strategic air campaigns over tactical strikes and ground support operations became Air Force policy during his tenure as chief of staff.|$|E
40|$|Considering {{that the}} German dramatist Heiner Müller has treated several times {{the subject of}} the angel of history, this essay proposes a {{comparison}} between Müller’s first angel (Der glücklose Engel) from 1958 and the original “angel of history” (Engel der Geschichte), a seminal text written by Walter Benjamin in 1940. Benjamin’s work reflects the author’s thoughts on the corruption of history and the dangerous notion of progress. Müller’s angel, on <b>the</b> contrary, despite <b>his</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> destructive force of the history, sees <b>the</b> future <b>in</b> a positive perspective...|$|R
