He was a professor at the École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, École Polytechnique and École des Ponts et Chaussées in France. In hydraulic engineering, he is often credited improperly for the application of the momentum principle to a hydraulic jump in a rectangular open channel in 1828. His true contribution in 1828 was the development of the backwater equation for <b>gradually</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flows</b> in open channels (Bélanger 1828) and the application of the momentum principle to the hydraulic jump flow in 1838 (Bélanger 1841).|$|R

The work {{was focused on the}} study of <b>gradually</b> <b>varied</b> open channel <b>flows</b> (Bélanger 1828). The originality of Bélanger's (1828) essay was the successful development of the backwater equation for steady, one-dimensional <b>gradually</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flows</b> in an open channel, together with the introduction of the step method, distance calculated from depth, and the concept of critical flow conditions. In 1828, Jean-Baptiste Bélanger understood the rapidly varied nature of the jump flow, but he applied incorrectly the Bernoulli principle to the hydraulic jump.The correct application of momentum considerations to the hydraulic jump flow was derived 10 years later and first published by Bélanger (1841) as part of a series of lecture notes for the École nationale des ponts et chaussées. His notes formed a comprehensive treatise in hydraulic engineering (Chanson 2008). They were re-edited several times and used at the École des Ponts et Chaussées and École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, and available at the École Polytechnique et École des Mines de ParisAltogether Jean-Baptiste Bélanger's (1828,1841) contributions to modern open channel hydraulics were remarkable and influenced the works by Jacques Antoine Charles Bresse, Henry Darcy, Henry Émile Bazin, Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant, and Joseph Valentin Boussinesq, as well as Philipp Forchheimer and Boris Bakhmeteff.|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is developed for real-time {{estimation of the}} cross-sectional average velocity of a channel flow by using an upward-looking pulsed wave acoustic Doppler velocity meters (ADVM). The Velocity Contour Weighting Method (VCWM) is applicable to <b>gradually</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flows</b> in prismatic channels and requires little to no calibration. VCWM estimates the average velocity as a weighted average of ADVM bin velocities. Weights {{are based on the}} velocity distribution sampled by the ADVM. Collectively, the VCWM is able to adapt {{to a wide range of}} channel geometry and roughness features. Expressions for the velocity weights are developed by first applying a validated 3 D computation fluid dynamics (CFD) channel flow model to a wide range of flow scenarios including differing channel geometries, discharge rates, depths, and boundary roughness. CFD simulation data are then reduced empirically with the aid of dimensional analysis to obtain the velocity weight equation. Special attention is given to the first weight accounting for near-wall velocity where the ADVM does not measure. Application of the method to a large rectangular flume shows that the VCWM predicts the average velocity with an uncertainty less than ± 5 % and that this uncertainty can be reduced by minimizing the buffer distance between the channel bottom and the first velocity measurement. In a companion paper, the performance of the VCWM is examined in irrigation canals with trapezoidal cross sections...|$|R

They have been selected in relation to practical applications by their resemblance to the main characteristics of cardiovascular and pulsed locomotion flows. Analysis of measured velocity and vorticity fields suggested a general criterion to establish the instant of vortex pinch-off directly from the imposed velocity program. This allows the proper scaling of the entire time evolution of the vortex ring for all tested inflows. Since it is quite easy to identify this instant experimentally, these results give a simple, practical rule for the computation of scales in vortex ring formation and development in the case of gradual inflows.

Our findings support the hypothesis of a maximum flow resistance principle valid for a range of spacing rather than for a unique configuration. A value of c = 1 and DN ~ 100 was found to economically meet the ODI conditions throughout the different sedimentation stages of the structure. When our model was applied using the same parameters to the range typical of step-pool systems, the predicted results fell within a similar region to that observed in field experiments.

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with solving the transport pollutant problem for a steady, <b>gradually</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> in an open channel network. The 1 D advective-diffusive transport equation is solved using the splitting technique. An analytical solution of the linear advective-diffusive equation {{in the form of}} an impulse response function is used to solve the advection-diffusion part of the governing equation. This approach, previously applied in solutions of the advection-diffusion equation for a single channel, is extended to a channel network. Numerical calculations are only required to compute the integral of convolution. The finite difference method is used to solve the second part of the governing equation, containing the source term. The applied approach has considerable advantages, especially appreciable in the case of advection-dominated transport with large gradients of concentration, since it generates no numerical dissipation or dispersion. The flow parameters are obtained via solution of the steady, <b>gradually</b> <b>varied</b> <b>flow</b> equation. In the final non-linear system of algebraic equations obtained through approximation of the ordinary differential equation, the depths at each cross-section of channels and the discharge at each branch of the network are considered as unknowns.

40|$|In {{open channel}} flows an {{important}} design parameter {{is the amount}} of entrained air. The presence of air in high velocity flows or steep chutes increases the bulk of the flow and this is a design parameter that determines the height of chute sidewalls. Furthermore the presence of air within the boundary layer reduces the shear stress between flow layers and hence the shear forces. The resulting increase of fluid motion must be taken in account when designing ski jump and stilling basin downstream of a spillway. Besides the presence of air within high-velocity flows may prevent or reduce cavitation damage. Estimation of the quantity of air entrained along the spillway is required by the design engineer when sitting aerators to artificially introduce more air, or determining whether aerators are required. Recently air entrainment on chutes has also been recognized for its contribution to air-water transfer of atmospheric gases such as oxygen and nitrogen.
