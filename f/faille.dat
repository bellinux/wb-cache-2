50|$|Due to the {{considerable}} number of works on paper by Van Gogh, for a valid identification reference is to the numbers of Jacob Baart de la <b>Faille's</b> Catalogue raisonné (1928 & 1970) (F) or to Jan Hulsker's updated compilation (1978, revised 1989) (JH).|$|R
2500|$|Dutch scholar J.B. de la <b>Faille,</b> who {{compiled}} {{the first}} exhaustive catalog of Van Gogh works in 1928, {{noted in his}} manuscript, [...] "We consider this painting a very weak replica of the preceding one, missing the piercing look" [...] of the original. Editors of the posthumous 1970 edition of Faille's book disagreed with his assessment, stating they considered both works to be of high quality.|$|E
2500|$|A cummerbund may be {{worn with}} a dinner jacket {{in lieu of}} a {{waistcoat}} and, although it is considered slightly less formal, it is equally correct. It looks especially good with a shawl collar dinner jacket but may be worn in conjunction with peak lapels. The material of the cummerbund should be silk satin, grosgrain (or <b>faille),</b> or barathea to match that of the bow tie. [...] It features upward facing folds, which were originally used to store theatre or opera tickets, and are now considered to be more decorative than functional. Just like the waistcoat, cummerbunds are not worn with a double breasted jacket.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1970 {{catalogue}} raisonné, {{based on}} [...] Jacob Baart de la <b>Faille's</b> researches, the paintings were dated 1882. Jan Hulsker, however, feels {{they must be}} associated with his 1883 painting Cows in the Meadow, a painting known only by a very poor photograph, and accordingly dates them as August 1883, thus executed shortly before van Gogh broke with his mistress Sien Hoornik and left for Drenthe.|$|R
50|$|His {{most famous}} book is Theoremata de centro gravitatis partium circuli et {{ellipsis}} (1632) {{in which he}} determined the centre of gravity of the sector of a circle, for the first time. At the request of della <b>Faille's</b> family, the Flemish painter Anthony van Dyck painted {{a portrait of the}} mathematician in 1629. The portrait shows the mathematician in his Jesuit outfit with a set of tools (including a compass, a t-square and a globe). He died in Barcelona, aged 55.|$|R
50|$|Wacker's {{paintings}} {{were to be}} exhibited in January 1928 by the firm of Paul Cassirer in Berlin. It was organized {{to coincide with the}} publication of de la <b>Faille's</b> standard catalogue of Van Gogh's work. When Wacker delivered the last four paintings, Grete Ring and Walter Feilchenfeldt, the general managers of the exhibition, noticed the differences and recognized them as fakes. The canvases were returned to Wacker. Further investigation revealed 33 suspect paintings, all of them supplied by Wacker. Galleries that had sold his paintings asked their customers to return them. Hugo Perls, an art dealer and lawyer who had bought several paintings, still insisted that they were authentic. In December 1928 the Matthiesen gallery, with the aid of the Federation of German Art and Antique Dealers, sued Wacker.|$|R
