50|$|Fluid {{inclusion}} {{analysis from}} fluids trapped in minerals can show {{a path of}} volatile evolution in volcanic rocks. <b>Isotopic</b> <b>analyses</b> and interpretation of degassing scenarios are {{required in order to}} derive the origin of magmatic volatiles. When gas bubbles accumulate in a melt that is crystallizing, they create a vesicular texture. Vesicules are created by super cooling a melt while gases are present. Because the rock crystallized very quickly while in the Earth's atmosphere, it is possible to examine some igneous rocks for fluids trapped in vesicules. By examining many different inclusions, it is possible to detect crustal assimilation and depressurization that account for volatile release.|$|E

50|$|For example, two {{separate}} studies on Mangrove Lake, Bermuda and Lake Yunoko, Japan show irregular, abrupt fluctuations between C/N around 11 to around 18.

Times in which lakes are dominated by algal signals suggest the lake is a deep-water lake, while times in which lakes are dominated by vascular plant signals suggest the lake is shallow, dry, or marshy.
