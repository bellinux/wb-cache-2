2500|$|A {{significant}} amount of {{research in this area}} has been spent exploring methods of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of antineoplastic drugs to tumors in the central nervous system. For example, radiolabeled polyethylene glycol coated hexadecylcyanoacrylate nanospheres targeted and accumulated in a rat gliosarcoma. However, this method is not yet ready for clinical trials, due to the accumulation of the nanospheres in surrounding healthy tissue. Another, more promising approach, is the coating of polyalkylcyanoacrylate or poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) nanoparticles with polysorbate 80 or poloxamer 188. [...] Due to this coating the particles [...] adsorb apolipoproteins E or A-1 from the blood and [...] thus interact with the LRP1 or with the scavenger receptor followed by transcytosis across the blood-brain barrier into the brain. These particles loaded with doxorubicin for the treatment of glioblastomas are presently in Clinical Phase I. Recently, a novel class of multifunctional nanoparticles known as magneto-electric nanoparticles (MENs) has been discovered for externally controlled targeted delivery and release of drug(s) across BBB as well as wireless stimulation of cells deep in the brain. This approach depends more on the <b>field</b> <b>control</b> and less on the cellular microenvironment. In vitro and in vivo (on mice) experiments to prove the feasibility of using MENs to release a drug across BBB on demand and wirelessly stimulate the brain have been conducted by the research group of Prof. Sakhrat Khizroev at Florida International University (FIU).|$|E

In first time, we confirm {{the existence of}} magneto-electric coupling and multiferro-electric properties at room temperature in the Ga doped α-Fe 2 O 3 system based on the experimental observation of magnetic <b>field</b> <b>controlled</b> electric polarization and electric <b>field</b> <b>controlled</b> magnetization. The α-Fe 2 O 3 system does not exhibit electric <b>field</b> <b>controlled</b> magnetic exchange bias effect, where as Ga doped α-Fe 2 O 3 showed exchange bias shift up {{to the value of}} 370 Oe. We have recorded the response of current-voltage characteristics and in-field magnetic relaxation of the system under the simultaneous application of magnetic and electric fields. The magnetization of the system is found highly sensitive to the ON and OFF modes, as well as change of the polarity of external electric field. The system is a new addition in the list of non-traditional magneto-electrics/multi-ferroelectrics so far reported in literature. Such novel materials, where magnetization and electric polarization can be controlled by simultaneous application of magnetic and electric fields, is in the increasing demand for potential applications in the field of next generation magnetic sensor, switching, non-volatile memory and spintronic devices.

40|$|This work {{is devoted}} to the {{construction}} of a class of prior stochastic models for non-Gaussian positive-definite matrix-valued random fields, having recourse to the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) principle. Specifically, the proposed approach aims at taking into account, in addition to usual constraints (e. g. normalization condition for the p. d. f., invertibility, etc.), some information related to the variances of some selected eigenvalues. After having recalled the general stochastic framework, we will present some mathematical derivations and discuss a few fundamental properties of the proposed class. It will be shown that the latter is basically parameterized by a set of spatial correlation lengths, a real-valued deterministic <b>field</b> <b>controlling</b> the overall level of statistical fluctuations and a Rm -valued deterministic <b>field</b> <b>controlling</b> the variances of m selected random eigenvalues.
