5|$|A {{key issue}} facing Kenya was a border dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya.

5|$|A {{possible}} <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> causeway's identification as a Roman {{structure in}} the latter half of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course. Roman military roads are usually straight in both their overall course, and also typically from one vantage point to the next. Both the Foss Way and the Stanegate, roads of established Roman provenance, have sinuous courses similar to Wade's causeway, so the objection is not conclusive.|$|E

Before the Olympic Games, {{the size of}} the sun disc of the national flag was changed partly because the sun disc was not considered striking when it was being flown with other national flags. Tadamasa Fukiura, a color specialist, chose to set the sun disc at two thirds of the flag's length. Fukiura also chose the flag colors for the 1964 as well as the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano.|$|E

5|$|Following {{enquiries}} by the media, Paramount and Namco {{released a}} joint statement explaining {{that it was an}} <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Steam system, and was something that the company was seeking to fix shortly.

After the PC issue was rectified, a further statement was published to alert customers that they could now use this type of gameplay. A day after the co-op issues with Star Trek were resolved, the Dead Island: Riptide problems were also corrected, with speculation by reviewers presuming that it was the same error in both games.|$|E
5|$|In September 1982 {{she visited}} China {{to discuss with}} Deng Xiaoping the {{sovereignty}} of Hong Kong after 1997. China was the first communist state Thatcher had visited {{and she was the}} first British prime minister to visit China. Throughout their meeting, she sought the PRC's agreement to a continued British presence in the territory. Deng insisted that the PRC's sovereignty on Hong Kong was non-negotiable, but stated his willingness to settle the sovereignty <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British government through formal negotiations, and both governments promised to maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity. After the two-year negotiations, Thatcher conceded to the PRC government and signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration in Beijing in 1984, agreeing to hand over Hong Kong's sovereignty in 1997.|$|E
5|$|New backup oxygen {{generators}} and filters have been {{installed on the}} aircraft.

The presence of toxins and particles in some ground crew was deemed to be unrelated. On 4 April 2013, the distance and altitude flight restrictions were lifted after the F-22 Combined Test Force and 412th Aerospace Medicine Squadron determined that breathing restrictions on the pilot were responsible as opposed to an <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> oxygen provided.|$|E

5|$|Savaric first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1157 when he is named as a canon of Coutances Cathedral in Normandy. He then was archdeacon of Countances from 1162 to 1174. He was Treasurer of Salisbury in 1174 and archdeacon of Northampton from 1175 to 1187. The medieval chronicler Ralph Diceto says that a Savaric was appointed as Archdeacon of Canterbury, but whether {{this was the same}} Savaric is unclear. He incurred large debts to King Henry II of England, which caused the king to complain to Pope Urban III. During the years 1182–1184, Savaric was deprived of his archdeaconries, which may have been connected to the debt <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> king.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} shot {{over a period}} six weeks at the Huntington Hartford Estate, on a small budget.

During the production, Nicol promised the actors a cut of the film's ultimate box office earnings, but due to an <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> film's distributor, this never occurred. During filming, Webber discovered she was pregnant with a son, and so several scenes had to be re-written, like one where she was meant to fall down a staircase.|$|E
