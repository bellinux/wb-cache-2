40|$|Recently {{scale of}} LAN systems is rapidly increasing, and {{integrated}} network systems {{are required to}} improve usability and reduce maintenance cost. However there are many problems to construct the integrated networks such as network design, network connection for <b>file</b> <b>servers</b> and designing application servers. This paper addresses schemes for integrated network systems based on a real integrated network in our university. Network designing policy, routing schemes for central huge <b>file</b> <b>servers</b> and high availability schemes for application servers are discussed. Our proposal for network design is construction with two different generation network facilities to avoid hardware and software failure. For <b>file</b> <b>servers</b> which has many network interface to improve bandwidth, many routing algorithms are standardized to select network interface for packets from <b>file</b> <b>servers,</b> {{but there are no}} effective implementation for client which throw packets toward <b>file</b> <b>servers.</b> We propose network interface selecting method that looks up optimal interface in NIS maps and set as "automount" arguments. We implement these approaches on our network and evaluate its efficacy under real network system operation. In consequence, routing schemes for <b>file</b> <b>servers</b> can reduce roundabout routing. リサーチレポート（北陸先端科学技術大学院大学情報科学研究科...|$|R

However, with Visual SourceSafe 2005, other client–server modes were added, Lan Booster and VSS Internet (which used HTTP/HTTPS).

500|$|The game used {{an updated}} version of the company's Jade engine, {{designed}} for Beyond Good & Evil. When the team saw the capacities of the Jade engine, they decided to use it for The Sands of Time. For The Sands of Time, the team made improvements to the engine by adding additional walking and running animations, enabling smoother character movement. They also made custom animations for the character. The engine made editing and fine-tuning the game very easy due to its easy-to-use tools. Using this as a base, they were able to focus on rapid integration of new elements into the game, and were also able to do quick testing and adjustments. The team developed [...] "substance" [...] and [...] "glow" [...] systems, which respectively enabled natural movements of cloth and gave the lightning effects a [...] "magical" [...] feel. The way the engine was structured, with all assets in a single accessible folder, proved problematic when alterations needed to be made or new features added, as the team size meant too many people were accessing the engine and were causing data to be overwritten, files to be corrupted, and the whole system to crash. They attempted to solve the problem using a [...] "data monkey" [...] solution which would allow for simultaneous access, but it came late in development and they did not risk making such a radical change to the system. Instead, they set up a <b>file</b> <b>server</b> to manage check-in times, which could allow for management of access and prioritisation of critical work.|$|E

2500|$|File sharing is {{an example}} of {{transferring}} large amounts of data across the Internet. A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment.

It can be put into a [...] "shared location" [...] or onto a <b>file</b> <b>server</b> for instant use by colleagues. The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of [...] "mirror" [...] servers or peer-to-peer networks. In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file. The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed– usually fully encrypted– across the Internet. The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests. These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission. This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts. This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.|$|E
