5|$|Chile's National Monuments Council {{declared}} Patio 29 a National Monument on 13 July 2006 at {{the request}} of a group of Chamber of Deputies legislators. The Council chose the site for its proof of the Pinochet military government's elaborate procedures used to conceal the disappeared's bodies and their identities. At the ceremony, Patio 29 was described {{as a symbol of the}} country's painful history and an educational place for human rights. As a national monument, the site will be conserved and maintained by <b>government</b> <b>funds</b> unless ordered otherwise by the courts. It is the first cemetery to become a national monument in Chile.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Canning River as {{a source}} of water for Perth was first {{proposed}} in a report of the first Metropolitan Water Works Board of Perth in 1896.

40|$|As the {{importance}} of NGOs is in the aid process increases, this research asks whether NGOs respond to criteria similar to the proposed economic factors important in the conditional aid literature. Data from US-based NGOs, specifically, is used to ask whether country involvement varies based on funding source (receiving versus not receiving US government contracts and grants) and economic criteria. Results indicate that NGOs overall do respond to low per capita incomes.

5|$|Keynes's {{personal}} interest in classical opera and dance led him to support the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden and the Ballet Company at Sadler's Wells. During the war, {{as a member of}} CEMA (Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts), Keynes helped secure <b>government</b> <b>funds</b> to maintain both companies while their venues were shut. Following the war, Keynes was instrumental in establishing the Arts Council of Great Britain and was its founding chairman in 1946. Unsurprisingly, from the start the two organisations that received the largest grants from the new body were the Royal Opera House and Sadler's Wells.|$|E

5|$|The {{display of}} the Hinomaru at homes and {{businesses}} is also debated in Japanese society. Because {{of the association of}} the Hinomaru with uyoku dantai (right wing) activists, reactionary politics, or hooliganism, some homes and businesses do not fly the flag. There is no requirement to fly the flag on any national holiday or special events. The town of Kanazawa, Ishikawa, has proposed plans in September 2012 to use <b>government</b> <b>funds</b> to buy flags with the purpose of encouraging citizens to fly the flag on national holidays.

5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with <b>government</b> <b>funds.</b> One highway connected Grants Pass with the California coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1790, Hamilton issued {{another set}} of {{recommendations}} in his Second Report on Public Credit. The report called {{for the establishment of}} a national bank and an excise tax on distilled spirits. Hamilton's proposed national bank would provide credit to fledgling industries, serve as a depository for <b>government</b> <b>funds,</b> and oversee one nationwide currency. In response to Hamilton's proposal, Congress passed the Bank Bill of 1791, establishing the First Bank of the United States. The following year, it passed the Coinage Act of 1792, establishing the United States Mint, and the United States dollar, and regulating the coinage of the United States. Historian Samuel Morison points to Hamilton's Second Report as the event that precipitated Jefferson's change of attitude toward Hamilton and his policies. Jefferson feared that the creation of the national bank would lead to political, economic, and social inequality, with Northern financial interests dominating American society much as aristocrats dominated European society.|$|E
5|$|The Confederate {{government}} {{also tried to}} raise revenue through unorthodox means. Early on (in {{the first half of}} 1861), when the support for the separation from the Union and the military effort was running strong, the donation of coins and gold to the government accounted for about 35% of all sources of <b>government</b> <b>funds.</b> This source, however, dried up over time as individuals and institutions in the South both ran down their personal holdings of bullion and became more unwilling to make donations as war-weariness set in. As a consequence, by the summer of 1862, the share of government revenue coming from these donations fell to less than 1%. Over the course of the entire war this source of revenue contributed only 0.2% of total wartime expenditure.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for factory production. As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The <b>government</b> <b>funds</b> generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft dogging its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E
5|$|The Louvre {{is owned}} by the French government; however, since the 1990s it has become more independent. Since 2003, the museum has been {{required}} to generate funds for projects. By 2006, <b>government</b> <b>funds</b> had dipped from 75percent of the total budget to 62percent. Every year, the Louvre now raises as much as it gets from the state, about €122 million. The government pays for operating costs (salaries, safety and maintenance), while the rest – new wings, refurbishments, acquisitions – is up to the museum to finance. A further €3 million to €5 million a year is raised by the Louvre from exhibitions that it curates for other museums, while the host museum keeps the ticket money. As the Louvre became a point of interest in the book The Da Vinci Code and the 2006 film based on the book, the museum earned $2.5million by allowing filming in its galleries. In 2008, the French government provided $180million of the Louvre's yearly $350million budget; the remainder came from private contributions and ticket sales.|$|E
