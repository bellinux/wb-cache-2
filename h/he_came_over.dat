Besides the calculus courses, Craig taught differential equations, elliptic functions, elasticity, partial differential equations, calculus of variations, definite integrals, mechanics, dynamics, hydrodynamics, sound, spherical harmonics, and Bessel functions.|$|E
500|$|Francis Bacon met George Dyer in a Soho pub. According to Bacon [...] "George {{was down}} {{the far end}} of the bar and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> and said 'You all seem to be having a good time, can I buy you a drink?'" [...] (Francis Bacon quoted in: Michael Peppiat, Francis Bacon: Anatomy of an Enigma, London 2008, p. 259). From that point on, Dyer became devoted to Bacon. He admired his intellect and power and was in awe of his self-confidence. He felt as if he had found a purpose, as the {{prominent}} artist's companion. Dyer was then about thirty years old and had grown up in the East End of London in a family steeped in crime. He had spent his life drifting between theft, juvenile detention center and jail. Typical of Bacon's taste in men, Dyer was fit, masculine, and not an intellectual.|$|E
500|$|In October 1963, Macmillan {{was taken}} ill and {{resigned}} as Prime Minister. Lord Home {{was chosen to}} succeed him. By the 1960s it was unacceptable for a Prime Minister {{to sit in the}} House of Lords, and Home renounced his earldom and successfully stood for election to the House of Commons as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The manner of his appointment was controversial, and two of Macmillan's cabinet ministers refused to take office under him. He was criticised by the Labour Party as an aristocrat, {{out of touch with the}} problems of ordinary families, and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> stiffly in television interviews, by contrast with the Labour leader, Harold Wilson. As Prime Minister, Douglas-Home's demeanor and appearance remained aristocratic and old-fashioned. His understanding of economics was primitive, and he gave his Chancellor, [...] Reginald Maudling, free rein to handle financial affairs. Douglas-Home enjoyed dealing with foreign policy, but there were no major crises or issues to resolve. His Foreign Minister, Rab Butler, was not especially energetic. Britain's application to join Europe had already been vetoed by De Gaulle, the Cuban missile crisis had been resolved, and Berlin was again on the back burner. Decolonisation issues were largely routine, and the Rhodesia and South African crises lay in the future.|$|E

Of the event, Womack said, [...] "Most guys wouldn't have even thought of the pitcher at such an important time.

2500|$|Schembechler {{thought so}} much of Revelli’s {{performance}} that he invited him back every year to teach the freshmen what Michigan tradition was about. [...] Schembechler recalled, “He was absolutely great, and the freshmen absolutely loved it. [...] And let me tell you, {{every one of those}} freshmen came out of that session with Revelli knowing ‘The Victors.’ [...] They knew the words, they knew how to sing it, and they knew how to emphasize the right spots. [...] They flat out knew how to do it. [...] And it was only because <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> there with the idea that those guys were {{going to come out of}} that meeting room knowing how to sing this fight song the right way or else! [...] And they did. [...] That was Bill Revelli.” ...|$|E

He went very quickly about East Anglia into the Humber's mouth, and so upward along the Trent till he came to Gainsborough. Earl Uchtred and all Northumbria quickly bowed to him, as did {{all the people of}} the Kingdom of Lindsey, then the people of the Five Boroughs. He was given hostages from each shire. When he {{understood}} that all the people had submitted to him, he bade that his force should be provisioned and horsed; he went south with {{the main part of the}} invasion force, while some of the invasion force, as well as the hostages, were with his son Cnut. After <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> Watling Street, they went to Oxford, and the town-dwellers soon bowed to him, and gave hostages. From there they went to Winchester, and the people did the same, then eastward to London.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, in {{the lead}} group, Sylvain Calzati had stormed {{away from the other}} five escapees with about [...] to go, only to be chased after {{somewhat}} later by Patrice Halgand and Kjell Carlström. The other three riders mainly {{looked at each other and}} did not believe they could stay out of the peloton's grip. However, the peloton would catch up with those three non-believers, but the other three were not to be caught before the finish line. Sylvain Calzati proved to be too strong for the other two as they coöperated to get back to him but never saw him again before Lorient, instead the gap only became bigger. In the end Sylvain Calzati scored his most beautiful professional victory of his career as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> the finish line more than two minutes ahead of Carlström and Halgand, who both just ended a few seconds before the peloton. In the peloton, Robbie McEwen again won the sprint, enlarging his lead in the standings for the green jersey over the other sprinters.|$|E

Before the second show, according to Walker, Foley came to his dressing room and Walker shared his faith in Christ: Foley said, [...] "Do you think God could ever forgive a sinner like me?" [...] He began to tell me all the rotten things he had done in his life, and I {{looked him in the}} face and said, [...] "Red, if God can forgive me, He can forgive you." [...] I prayed with Red. [...] He went out, and the last song he sang was [...] "Peace in the Valley." [...] <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> to side of the stage and said, 'Billy, I've never sung that song and feel the way I do tonight.' Foley suffered respiratory failure that night and died in his sleep, prompting Hank Williams, Jr. to write and record (as Luke the Drifter, Jr.) I Was With Red Foley (The Night He Passed Away). [...] According to the song, which charted that November, his last words were, [...] "I'm awful tired now, Hank. [...] I've got to go to bed." [...] Foley had sung [...] "Peace in the Valley" [...] at Hank Sr.'s funeral. [...] Foley was interred in Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville.|$|E
2500|$|Mia {{initially}} {{thinks she}} {{is in love with}} popular jock Josh Richter, but by the second book, she acknowledges her feelings and states that she's been in love with Michael Moscovitz since the day <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>over</b> to give Lilly a school project when they were in the first grade and he was in the fourth. From {{the end of the first}} book to the third, Mia has an unrequited crush on Michael, feelings which he finally returns in Princess in Love. Their relationship continues through Mia's sophomore year and Michael's first years at Columbia University but their relationship becomes slightly strained when Michael tells Mia he would like to have sex while Mia would prefer to wait until her prom night. Michael respects Mia's wishes but when Michael gets an offer to move to Japan, he believe it would be easier for their relationship as he is [...] "tired of taking cold showers". Mia proposes sex in order to keep him from leaving but is upset to find out that he slept with Judith Gershner before discovering her love for him and the two break up. Michael believes Mia is overreacting and attempts to reconcile with her before leaving for Japan but is hurt to find her sharing a kiss with J.P. Mia attempts to reunite and work out the distance situation but Michael decides that it is best they remain [...] "just friends" [...] and he still emails Mia regularly. When Michael returns from Japan after an absence of almost two years, he flirts with Mia during her interview for the school paper. Mia notices that Michael still looks incredibly hot and realises that she does still, indeed, love him. The two eventually kiss, despite Mia having a boyfriend, and Michael declares that he still loves Mia and will wait for her. They reunited on Mia's prom night and they have sex.|$|E
