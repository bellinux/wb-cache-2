5|$|In 1478, the Catholic Monarchs of Spain, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, {{established}} an ecclesiastical tribunal {{known as the}} Spanish Inquisition. It was intended to maintain Catholic orthodoxy in their kingdoms. Hundreds of Jews were killed, and their synagogues destroyed. One {{of the consequences of}} these disturbances was the mass <b>forced</b> <b>conversion</b> of Jews.|$|E
5|$|The fatwa {{appeared}} to enjoy wide currency within the Muslim and Morisco community in various kingdoms of Spain, {{for it was}} translated and copied as late as 1563 and 1609. The full geographical reach of the text is unknown, but it {{appeared to}} be originally addressed to the Muslims (or Moriscos) of Castile as a response to their forced conversions in 1500–1502. After the <b>forced</b> <b>conversion</b> was extended to the Crown of Aragon in the 1520s, the fatwa likely circulated there, too.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians had {{difficult}} {{time during the}} Safavid period and faced repeated persecution and <b>forced</b> <b>conversion.</b> Safavid kings sought to compel them to accept Shia Islam, Sunnis too were forced to convert to Shia or were killed. Zoroastrians were also branded as impure, {{in addition to being}} infidels. As earlier in the century, so this period also witnessed sporadic campaigns for the conversion of Armenians and Zoroastrians, focusing blame for economic and other ills on these and other minorities whose involvement in the spice export, for example, was well known.|$|E

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century, Spain was split between two realms: Crown of Castile and the smaller Crown of Aragon. The marriage between King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile united the two crowns, and ultimately their grandson Charles would inherit both crowns (as Charles I of Spain, but better known as Charles V, per his regnal number as Holy Roman Emperor). Despite the union, the lands of the two crowns functioned very differently, with disparate laws, ruling priorities, and treatment of Muslims. There were also Muslims living in the Kingdom of Navarre, which was initially independent but was annexed by Castile in 1515. <b>Forced</b> <b>conversion</b> varied in timeline by ruling body: it was enacted by the Crown of Castile in 1500–1502, in Navarre in 1515–1516, and by the Crown of Aragon in 1523–1526.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese, {{after their}} arrival in Sri Lanka in 1505, began a {{campaign}} of <b>forced</b> <b>conversion</b> and destruction of many Buddhist and Hindu temples around the island. They destroyed the Munneswaram temple completely in 1578 CE {{with the exception of}} the basement, and used the core of the building as a Roman Catholic chapel. Jesuits recorded that they used iron bars to destroy the presiding deity. According to a 1640 Portuguese records, they were able to convert 500 people from the village of Munneswaram as Roman Catholics. However, the locals and temple administrators were able to hide many of the idols of the temple complex before the destruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{predominant}} {{position of}} Islamic scholars {{had been that}} a Muslim could not stay {{in a country where}} rulers made proper religious observance impossible: therefore, a Muslim's obligation was to leave when they were able to. Even before the systematic <b>forced</b> <b>conversion,</b> religious leaders had argued that Muslims in Christian territory would be subject to direct and indirect pressure, and preached emigration as a way to protect the religion from eroding. Ahmad al-Wansharis, the contemporary North African scholar and leading authority on Spanish Muslims, wrote in 1491 that emigrating from Christian to Muslim lands was compulsory in almost all circumstances. Further, he urged severe punishment for Muslims who remained and predicted that they would temporarily dwell in hell in the afterlife.|$|E

5|$|On paper, the edict ordered {{expulsion}} {{rather than}} a <b>forced</b> <b>conversion,</b> but it forbade nearly all possible destinations; in reality, the Castilian authorities preferred Muslims to convert than emigrate. Castile's western neighbor Portugal had already banned Muslims since 1497. The order explicitly forbade going to other neighboring regions, such as the Kingdoms of Aragon and Valencia, the Principality of Catalonia, and the Kingdom of Navarre. Of possible overseas destination, North Africa and territories of the Ottoman Empire were also ruled out. The edict allowed travel to Egypt, then ruled by the Mamluk Sultanate, but there were few ships sailing between Castile and Egypt in those days. It designated Biscay in the Basque country as the only port where the Muslims could depart, which meant that those from the south (such as Andalusia) would have to travel {{the entire length of}} the peninsula. The edict also set the end of April 1502 as the deadline, after which Islam would become outlawed and those harboring Muslims would be punished severely. A further edict issued on 17 September 1502 forbade the newly converted Muslims to leave Castile within the next two years.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of the reconquista, the defeated Muslims were generally given freedom of religion as terms of their surrender. For example, the Treaty of Granada, which governed the surrender of the emirate, guaranteed a set of rights to the conquered Muslims, including religious tolerance and fair treatment, in return for their capitulation. The increasing occurrences of <b>forced</b> <b>conversion</b> triggered a series of Muslim rebellions in Granada (1499–1501). The rebellions were suppressed, and afterwards the Muslims in Granada were no longer given the rights that had been provided to them by the Treaty of Granada. They were given the choice to remain and accept baptism, to reject baptism and be enslaved or killed, or to be exiled. The option of exile was often not feasible in practice because of the difficulty in uprooting one's family and making the journey to Muslim lands in North Africa, the inability to pay the fee required by the authorities for safe passage, and the general tendency by the authorities to discourage and hinder such an exodus.|$|E
