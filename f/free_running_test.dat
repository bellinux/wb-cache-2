Incidence of exercise-induced asthma in {{adolescent}} athletes under different training and environmental conditions. J Strength Cond Res 26 (6) : 1644 - 1650, 2012 -Different sports and environmental conditions {{are known to}} influence exercise-induced asthma (EIA). The {{aim of this study}} was to establish if there were differences in the incidence of exercise-induced bronchospasm between athletes in different sports, which take place under different environmental conditions such as open places, closed courses, and swimming pools with similar exercise intensity (football, basketball, water polo) using the <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test.</b> The study included 90 adolescents (3 groups of 30) aged 14 - 18 years recruited from academies in northern Greece. All the participants were initially subjected to (a) a clinical examination and cardiorespiratory assessment by a physician and (b) <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> of a 6 -minute duration and measurement with a microspirometer of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1). Only the participants who had measured a decrease in FEV 1 >= 10 % were reevaluated with the microspirometer during a training session. The examination of all the participants during the <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> showed that 22 athletes, that is, 9, 8, and 5 of football, basketball, and water polo athletes, respectively, demonstrated an FEV 1 >= 10 drop. Reevaluation of the 22 participants during training showed that 5 out 9 (55 %) football athletes, 4 out of 8 basketball athletes (50 %), and none of the 5 athletes of the water polo team displayed a drop of FEV 1 >= 10 %. Despite the absence of any significant statistical differences between the 3 groups, the analysis of variances did show a trend of a lower incidence of EIA in the water polo athletes. It was found that a football or basketball game can induce EIA in young athletes but to a lesser degree than the <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> can induce. The water polo can be a safer sport even for participants with a medical history of asthma or allergies...|$|E
40|$|Background: Asthma is {{the most}} common chronic disease of childhood; asthma {{prevalence}} and incidence have been increasing in children in developed countries during the past few decades. The rapid increase of asthma in developed and urban environments is more likely explained by changes in environment and life style. The {{purpose of this study was}} to know the prevalence and comparison of Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm (EIB) positive urban and rural school children by simple <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test.</b> Methods: This study was conducted at Department of Physiology BMSI, JPMC Karachi with collaboration of urban and rural schools of Sindh. A total number of 498, apparently healthy study subjects of either sex, age ranging from 9 – 16 years were selected for this study. Subjects exercised for 6 min by simple running at 80 % of their maximum heart rate recorded by pulse oximeter, and Peak Expiratory Flow Rate was measured by using PEF meter. Results: In this study the prevalence of EIB+ve in urban school children was 39. 35 % and in rural school children it was 31. 72 %.

40|$|Thesis (M. Nurs.), College of Nursing, Washington State UniversityAsthma is a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} in children and adolescents. Exercise-induced asthma (EIA) is transient airway narrowing causing symptoms of cough and shortness of breath during and after exercise, either with or without chronic asthma. Parents and children may not recognize the symptoms of EIA as such and therefore children may lack proper treatment. Screening children for EIA will assist in identifying those at risk. A systematic review of EIA screening tests was conducted by searching PUBMED for key terms. Sixty-seven articles were identified; after abstracting the papers, seven met inclusion criteria for the focus of the review. These peer-reviewed studies screened presumably healthy children and children with known asthma or presumed EIA for EIA. The most common screening test used was the six-minute exercise challenge using a treadmill or <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test.</b> The most common criteria for determining EIA was a decrease in FEV 1 by 10 or 15 %. Screening for EIA in schools has the potential to identify at risk children and adolescents, but screening needs to be both time- and cost-effective in order to be implemented successfully. More research is needed to identify feasible screening. A program is suggested that, with more research, may be implemented in schools to identify children and adolescents with undiagnosed EIA...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAirway {{response}} to deep inhalation (DI) may provide information {{relevant to the}} mechanisms of airway obstruction (AO). The hypothesis examined here is that DI provokes bronchodilation in children during exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). EIB was attested in 15 children aged 10 ± 3 year (mean±SD) by a decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) ⩾ 15 % from baseline after a <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test.</b> The respiratory resistance {{was measured by the}} forced oscillation technique at 12 Hz using a head generator to vary transrespiratory pressure around the head. The airway {{response to}} DI was estimated by the effect on respiratory conductance (Grs), calculated as the reciprocal of respiratory resistance in inspiration. During EIB, DI induced a variable but significant increase in Grs, from 0. 085 ± 0. 023 to 0. 101 ± 0. 029 lhPa− 1 s− 1 (P= 0. 0003). The post- to pre-DI Grs ratio (1. 19 ± 0. 14) was found to correlate negatively with EIB-induced reduction in FEV 1 (P= 0. 02), forced vital capacity (FVC) (P= 0. 01) but not FEV 1 /FVC, i. e., DI induced more bronchodilation in those children with small EIB associated reduction in FVC. It is concluded that the bronchodilator effect of DI may be demonstrated in children with EIB. It is suggested that the associated small airway closure and lung hyperinflation may contribute to limit this response to DI...|$|E

Trinta crianças de ambos os sexos com asma intermitente participaram do estudo. Cada teste foi realizado em 3 dias diferentes, através de randomização: a) broncoprovocação com metacolina, método do dosímetro; b) teste de exercício: corrida livre em um corredor de 50 m; c) teste de exercício: bicicleta ergométrica com ar seco. A freqüência cardíaca atingida foi 80 a 90 % da freqüência cardíaca máxima. A espirometria foi realizada aos 3, 6, 10, 15, 20 e 30 minutos após o exercício. Broncoespasmo induzido por exercício foi definido como a queda de volume expiratório forçado no primeiro segundo (VEF 1) > 10 % em relação aos valores pré-teste. RESULTADOS: A média de idade foi 11 ± 3 anos. O VEF 1 e VEF 1 /CVF (capacidade vital forçada) foram normais e similares antes dos três testes de broncoprovocação. A freqüência cardíaca máxima foi de 178 ± 7 bpm durante o exercício na bicicleta e 181 ± 6 bpm na corrida livre (p > 0, 05). Broncoespasmo significante foi visto em 23 crianças após o teste com metacolina, em 19 após a corrida livre e em 14 crianças após exercício em bicicleta (p OBJECTIVE: To compare airway {{responsiveness}} to methacholine, cycle ergometer exercise and free running {{in children with}} intermittent asthma. METHODS: A randomized {{study was conducted with}} 30 children of both genders with intermittent asthma. Each child was submitted to challenge testing on three separate days, in random order: a) Methacholine challenge using a dosimeter; b) Exercise challenge testing - free running along a 50 -meter-long corridor; c) Dry-air exercise challenge on a cycle ergometer. Target heart rate during exercise was 80 to 90 % of the maximum predicted value. Spirometry was performed 3, 6, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes after exercise. Exercise-induced bronchospasm was defined as a decrease in FEV 1 of > 10 % in comparison to pretest values. RESULTS: Mean age was 11 ± 3 years. FEV 1 and FEV 1 /FVC ratios were normal and similar before all provocation tests. The maximum heart rate was 178 ± 7 bpm during cycling and 181 ± 6 bpm during the <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> (p > 0. 05). Significant bronchospasm was observed with methacholine in 23 cases, after free running in 19 and after cycling in 14 children (p < 0. 05, methacholine vs exercise tests). Taking all FEV 1 measurements after exercise into account, the <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> resulted in greater exercise-induced bronchospasm in comparison with exercise made on a cycle ergometer (p = 0. 003, chi 2 = 8. 948). There was a significant, but poor, correlation between the maximum percentage decrease in FEV 1 after free running and cycling (r = 0. 46, p < 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: Methacholine challenge identifies a greater number of asthmatics in comparison to exercise tests. When bronchial provocation test with methacholine is not available, free running should be the test of choice due to its simplicity and greater ability to induce bronchospasm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt {{has been}} {{suggested}} that airway eosinophilic inflammation is associated with the severity of exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB). Blood eosinophils are known to be an indirect marker of airway inflammation in asthma. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate that a simple and easy blood test for blood eosinphil counts may predict the severity of EIB in asthma. Seventy-seven men with perennial asthma (age range 18 – 23 years) were included. Lung function test, skin prick test, and blood tests for eosinophils counts and total IgE levels were performed. Methacholine bronchial provocation test and, 24 h later, <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> were carried out. EIB was defined as a 15 % reduction or more in post-exercise FEV 1 compared with pre-exercise FEV 1 value. Atopy score was defined as a sum of mean wheal diameters to allergens. EIB was observed in 60 (78 %) of 77 subjects. Asthmatics with EIB showed significantly increased percentages of eosinophils (P 700 μ l− 1 (36 · 9 ± 12 · 7 %) had significantly greater maximal % fall in FEV 1 after exercise than asthmatics with eosinophils of 350 μ l− 1 yielded the specificity of 88 % and positive predictive value of 93 % for the presence of EIB. When a multiple regression analysis of maximal % fall in FEV 1 according to log eosinophil counts, log PC 20, log IgE and atopy score was performed, only blood eosinophil counts were significant factor contributing to the maximal % fall in FEV 1 after exercise. These findings not only suggest that a simple blood test for eosinophils may be useful in the prediction of the severity of EIB, but also reinforce the view that airway eosinophilic inflammation may play a major role in EIB in asthma...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{underwater}} vehicles have control surfaces to enable manoeuvring. The problem with an underwater vehicle with control surfaces is operating it at low speed. At low speed, the control surfaces become inoperative as {{the magnitude of}} the generated lift relates to the water speed passing over the control surfaces. A novel device, which is a potential solution to this problem, is the collective and cyclic pitch propeller (CCPP). The CCPP can generate both axial and transverse thrusts in one device. The research focused on the performance of the CCPP and the performance of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP. The information about the true performance of this CCPP has not been investigated. Assessing the true performance in a straight line of the CCPP was the first objective of this research. The development of the simulation program was the second objective of this research in order to assess the motion control of an underwater vehicle by using the CCPP. The performance in a straight line of the CCPP behind an underwater vehicle was assessed by using a captive test in the Towing Tank at the Australian Maritime College. In the experiment, the propeller was set at various pitch angles, and it was tested at various advance coefficients. Polynomial equations for estimating the thrust and the torque coefficients of the propeller with the collective pitch setting were established. In addition, the effects of the collective pitch, cyclic pitch, and advance coefficient related to the magnitude and direction of the transverse thrust were studied. Increasing {{the magnitude of the}} collective pitch setting caused the direction of the transverse thrust to rotate clockwise when looked at from aft. The magnitude of the transverse thrusts increased as the collective pitch setting increased. Different types of cyclic pitch setting affected the direction of the transverse thrust differently. Increasing the magnitude of the cyclic pitch setting raised the magnitude of the transverse thrust. According to the experimental information, the direction and the magnitude of the transverse thrust was found to be difficult to control manually. Hence a motion control system of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP was developed in order to assist an operator to control the vehicle. The proportional integral derivative control law was used to develop the control system. The capability of the motion control system and the manoeuvrability of {{the underwater}} vehicle equipped with the CCPP were assessed by using a developed simulation program. In addition, the numerical simulation of an underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP is an essential tool to develop the CCPP in the future. The simulation program was developed by using the mathematical model of a test underwater vehicle. Furthermore, the forces of the CCPP were modelled by using the experimental results and the performance prediction program. The simulation study has shown that the underwater vehicle equipped with the CCPP has flexible manoeuvrability, and controllability. The CCPP is capable of controlling an underwater vehicle in all directions. For further development, the <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>test</b> should be conducted in order to demonstrate the performance of the underwater vehicle and to verify the simulation program...|$|E

Different tests are used, including <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>tests</b> with poor standardization of exercise load. The present study aimed to assess the role of exercise load in relationship to level of EIB. Methods: 20 asthmatic children, 9 – 17 years old with a history of EIB, underwent two treadmill test with 85 % and 95 % exercise load. The children ran with increasing speed for the first 2 min until reaching a heart rate of 85 % or 95 % of calculated maximum (220 –age) and maintained this speed for the last 4 min. Lung function was measured before running, and 0, 3, 6, 10 and 15 min after the run. Borg scale for perceived exertion was employed for children's self-evaluation of exercise load. Results: Peak heart rate, mean Borg score during 85 % exercise load was 178 · 7 / 13 · 6 and during 95 % was 194 · 3 / 18 · 2 (P< 0 · 001). Maximum fall in FEV 1 after 85 % exercise load was 8 · 84 %vs. 25 · 11 % after 95 % (P< 0 · 001).

40|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{contribute}} to efforts for a robust and effective numerical tool addressing ship motion in astern seas, this paper presents {{the development of a}} coupled non-linear 6 -DOF model with frequency dependent coefficients, incorporating memory effects and random waves. A new axes system that allows straightforward combination between seakeeping and manoeuvring, whilst accounting for extreme motions, is proposed. Validation of the numerical model with the results of benchmark tests commissioned by ITTC's Specialist Group on Stability demonstrated qualitative, yet not fully satisfactory agreement between numerical and experimental results in line with other predictive tools. The numerical results indicate that the inclusion of frequency coefficients definitely affects the accuracy of the predictions. In order to enhance further the numerical model and obtain useful information on motion coupling, extensive captive and <b>free</b> <b>running</b> model <b>tests</b> were carried out. Good agreement with the experimental results was achieved. These studies provide convincing evidence of the capability of the developed numerical model to predict the dangerous conditions that a ship could encounter in extreme astern seas. As a result, it could offer new insights towards establishing relationships linking ship behaviour to design, environmental and operational parameters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Uncertainty was performed in accordance with the performance test codes written by ASME during 2013 to find the systematic standard and random uncertainty of measurements. The random uncertainty is found based on the standard deviation of repeated measurements, while the systematic standard uncertainty is found based on the bias of the measurement system and the sensitivity coefficients found from the data reduction equations. The data reduction equations are used to non-dimensionalize the measured values to compare to CFD results as well as results from other model scales. From the data reduction equations partial derivatives are taken to determine how the uncertainty propagates throughout the sensitivity coefficients. After the uncertainties are calculated the results were compared to other facilities to evaluate the method used and gauge the quality of the repeatability of the measurements. Few other facilities have analyzed the uncertainty during <b>free</b> <b>running</b> <b>tests</b> past looking at the random error based on repeated tests. The comparison with these facilities displayed that the uncertainty process and measurement repeatability used by IIHR at the wave basin produce consistent results with limited uncertainties when the end results of maneuvering characteristics are observed. Large uncertainties occur for some of the measured variables during the full scale of the testing time when the uncertainties are reported {{as a percentage of the}} harmonic amplitudes and the reported harmonic amplitude are near zero with a small uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Repeated sprint ability {{has been}} widely studied by researchers, however, {{analysis}} {{of the relationship between}} most kinetic variables and the effect of fatigue is still an ongoing process. To search for the best biomechanical parameter to evaluate repeated sprint ability, several kinetic variables were measured in a tethered field <b>running</b> <b>test</b> and compared regarding their sensitivity to fatigue and correlation with time trials in a <b>free</b> <b>running</b> condition. Nine male sprint runners (best average times: 100 m = 10. 45 +/- 0. 07 s; 200 m = 21. 36 +/- 0. 17 s; 400 m = 47. 35 +/- 1. 09 s) completed two test sessions on a synthetic track. Each session consisted of six 35 m sprints interspersed by 10 s rest under tethered field <b>running</b> or <b>free</b> <b>running</b> conditions. Force, power, work, an impulse and a rate of force development were all directly measured using the sensors of a new tethered running apparatus, and a one-way ANOVA with Scheffe post-hoc test used to verify differences between sprints (p < 0. 05). Pearson product-moment correlation measured the relationship between mechanical variables and <b>free</b> <b>running</b> performance. A total impulse, the rate of force development and maximum force did not show significant differences for most sprints. These three variables presented low to moderate correlations with <b>free</b> <b>running</b> performance (r between 0. 01 and - 0. 35). Maximum and mean power presented the strongest correlations with <b>free</b> <b>running</b> performance (r = - 0. 71 and - 0. 76, respectively; p < 0. 001), followed by mean force (r = - 0. 61; p < 0. 001) and total work (r = - 0. 50; p < 0. 001). It was concluded that under a severe work-to-rest ratio condition, power variables were better suited to evaluating repeated sprint ability than the other studied variables...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{model test}} {{results of the}} USCGC Healy are {{reported}} here and correlated with full-scale data. The design requirement for the Healy was for ?continuous icebreaking at 3 knots through 4. 5 ft (1. 37 m) of ice of 100 psi (690 kPa) strength?. The full-scale trials were designed to test this capability. Unfortunately, the ice strength found on the trials was approximately half of that specified. One of the objects of the model tests {{was to determine the}} effect of ice strength on the delivered power necessary for the Healy to meet her icebreaking specification. Propulsion overload tests in open water combined with limited ice tests, and the IOT standard method for analyzing propulsion tests in ice, gave consistent results for delivered power, which agreed well with the available full-scale data from the Healy. A correlation friction coefficient of 0. 05 was again shown to be appropriate. From the analysis of the resistance and propulsion tests, the Healy, with its total shaft horsepower of 30, 000, was shown to be capable of its design requirement. Using a similar analysis, an imaginary ?Polar 8 ? icebreaker of the Healy design was shown to require 85, 000 HP to continuously break ice of 2. 44 m (8 ft.) thickness, of 500 kPa strength, at 3 knots. <b>Free</b> <b>running</b> maneuvering <b>tests</b> performed in the ice tank gave arcs of circles whose diameters agreed well with the full-scale data of turning circles obtained on the ship trials.

40|$|The <b>free</b> <b>running</b> asthma {{screening}} <b>test</b> (FRAST) {{was evaluated}} in 503 Sheffield schoolchildren aged 6 to 12 years and compared with responses to an asthma questionnaire. The FRAST measured {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR) before and at 1, 5, and 10 minutes after maximum voluntary running {{for at least}} 5 minutes in a standardised environment. A fall in PEFR of greater than 15 % in at least two postexercise readings was defined as abnormal. Six (1 %) children did not do the test and 69 (14 %) failed to complete it. Of these, 14 were known asthmatics, 18 were not testable, and 37 were normal when retested. There were 14 abnormal FRAST results among 412 'normal' children who completed the test and 10 of these were subsequently diagnosed asthmatic. None of 14 children with an abnormal FRAST result had been identified as wheezy, chesty, or asthmatic in the questionnaire. In this sample there was, on average, one child in every school class with unrecognised exercise induced bronchospasm. The FRAST is an acceptable, feasible, and cost effective way of identifying such potential asthmatics at school...|$|R

40|$|The <b>free</b> <b>running</b> asthma {{screening}} <b>test</b> (FRAST) {{was used}} to screen children in a state middle school during a normal physical education lesson. The test was conducted by the teachers with a general practitioner available via a radiopager. Of the 249 children attending the school, aged 8 - 12 years, 237 (95 %) were tested. Twenty two (9 %) children were known to have asthma, of whom 18 were tested. Thirty one children had a significant decrease (> 15 %) in their {{peak expiratory flow rate}} (PEFR) after exercise. Six of these children were known to have asthma, indicating that their asthma treatment may be suboptimal. A further six children assessed clinically had false positive results. The 31 children with significant decreases in their PEFR were matched for age and sex with a control group of 30 children who were considered to have a normal result. Of the control group, one child had clinical asthma. In total, 19 (8 %) new cases of asthma were identified, giving an overall prevalence of asthma in the school of 16 %. These results indicate that it is feasible to screen schools for asthma using the FRAST. Children with undiagnosed asthma can be identified and the control of children with known asthma monitored...|$|R

40|$|Asthma is {{a common}} chronic disease of {{childhood}} {{that is associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. We aimed to estimate the prevalence of asthma among secondary school pupils in urban and rural areas of coast districts of Tanzania. The study also aimed to describe pupils' perception towards asthma, and to assess their knowledge on symptoms, triggers, and treatment of asthma. A total of 610 pupils from Ilala district and 619 pupils from Bagamoyo district formed the urban and rural groups, respectively. Using a modified International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, a history of "diagnosed" asthma or the presence of a wheeze in the previous 12 months was obtained from all the studied pupils, along with documentation of their perceptions regarding asthma. Pupils without asthma or wheeze in the prior 12 months were subsequently selected and underwent a <b>free</b> <b>running</b> exercise <b>testing.</b> A >= 20 % decrease in the post-exercise Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) values was the criterion for diagnosing exercise-induced asthma. The mean age of participants was 16. 8 (+/- 1. 8) years. The prevalence of wheeze in the past 12 months was 12. 1 % in Bagamoyo district and 23. 1 % in Ilala district (p < 0. 001). Self-reported asthma was found in 17. 6 % and 6. 4 % of pupils in Ilala and Bagamoyo districts, respectively (p < 0. 001). The prevalence of exercise-induced asthma was 2. 4 % in Bagamoyo, and 26. 3 % in Ilala (P < 0. 002). In both districts, most information on asthma came from parents, and there was variation in symptoms and triggers of asthma reported by the pupils. Non-asthmatic pupils feared sleeping, playing, and eating with their asthmatic peers. The prevalence rates of self-reported asthma, wheezing in the past 12 months, and exercise-induced asthma were significantly higher among urban than rural pupils. Although bronchial asthma {{is a common}} disease, pupils' perceptions about asthma were associated with fear of contact with their asthmatic peers in both rural and urban schools...|$|R
