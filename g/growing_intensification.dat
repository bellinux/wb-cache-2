40|$|This essay {{begins with}} an {{examination}} of the differences between natural reality and social reality, but along lines {{different from those of the}} traditional Methodenstreit. The aim is to clarify the methodological implications of these differences, which appear essential to proper motivation of the objectives, purposes, and the very existence of social economics. The analysis pays a particular attention to identifying some procedures useful in formulating general principles and, more broadly, to achieve some robust notions notwithstanding the <b>growing</b> <b>intensification,</b> in modern society, of innovation. A main result of the research is that it permits an unambiguous distinction between the aspects that express necessity and those that can be the object of choice in the organization and development of economic and social systems, and a peculiar treatment of ethical-ideological aspects.

30|$|Firstly, we {{have found}} that most of the auroral {{substorm}} events (~ 83  %) observed by THEMIS all-sky imagers during 2008 – 2009 show wave-like arc brightness structures along the substorm onset arcs with exponentially <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> prior to the auroral substorm expansion onset. Thus, the wave-like auroral brightening feature is commonly observed prior to the auroral substorm expansion onset. This wave-like auroral arc structure which shows exponential growth in luminosity implies the existence of instabilities in the near-Earth plasma sheet. Thus, the auroral observations give potential constraints on the instabilities that may cause the production of the substorm arcs. In Fig.  7, the mean azimuthal mode number of the substorm wave-like arc structure is in the range of ~ 100 – 240 prior to the expansion onset. Because the most unstable kinetic ballooning instability in the plasma sheet has high azimuthal mode number and low frequency in the Pi 2 range, it is a candidate to explain the Pi 2 disturbance observed in the plasma sheet.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. To study {{influence}} of experimental salpingectomy on morphofunctional state of ovaries in different terms of postoperative period. Materials and methods. The experiment {{was conducted on}} mature female rats. The main group consisted of 20 rats with removed oviducts, the control group – 20 intact rats. Rats were euthanized at 2 nd, 10 th, 30 th and 60 th days of experiment. Paraffin slides of ovaries were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and with Van Gieson’s stain. Histological and morphoquantitative investigations were performed. Results. Hemodynamic and exudative disorders, such as leukocyte infiltration focuses in cortex and medulla, stasis of blood cells and leukocytes boundary distance, occur in early terms after bilateral removal of oviducts.  On the 2 nd day the number of growing follicle increases, {{most of them have}} atresia sights. On the 60 th day the number of growing follicles decreases and the number of atretic bodies increases. The process of collagen formation enhances. Conclusion. The experimental salpingectomy leads to the deorganization of gonads, interruption of the follicular <b>growing,</b> <b>intensification</b> of atretic processes. </p...|$|E

The research aims to trace the evolution of urban regeneration policies in two different geographical contexts, paying attention to both temporal and geographical variations in governmental approaches to regeneration. The study aims to review {{the manner in which}} the <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of the neoliberal agenda has differently affected the process of urban regeneration in Paris and Dublin. The aim is to account for variations in the global neoliberal project. This research seeks to make a contribution to the development of urban studies by offering empirical evidence of path-dependency in the evolution of regeneration policies. The study also strives to identify how different socio-political ideological contexts have shaped the ability of indigenous communities to change the outcomes of regeneration. The overall objective is to discuss how powerful socially disadvantaged communities are in influencing the processes of regeneration.

40|$|Abstract: The {{reconfiguration}} of {{the employment}} relationship – through the <b>growing</b> <b>intensification,</b> informalization and casualization of work, downsizing and retrenchments – impacts directly on workers ’ households and the communities within {{which they are}} embedded. To understand these responses, we need to rethink the way we study the changing employment relationship. Employment relations should not only analyse the workplace: we need to research workers in the totality of their lives. To comprehend these processes we surveyed and interviewed workers {{in the workplace and}} in their households and communities. Through following workers into their homes and communities in South Africa, Australia and South Korea, the differential impact of the global restructuring of one industry, the white goods industry, on the non-working life of working people emerged. Two types of responses were identified: on the one hand, a retreat from, or an adaptation to, rapid market liberalization; on the other, mobilization to challenge the market. All three research sites evidenced innovative attempts at the local level to search for security. However, these responses lacked an overall vision of alternative possibilities to the realities of the free market paradigm of globalization...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the spatial {{development of the}} cross-border region between the two cities - Graz (Austria) and Maribor (Slovenia) - {{with regard to the}} integration processes in the past, present and future. First, the analyses of the past, when both parts of the region shared the national border, will be discussed. It will emphasize the consequences of the ćborder effectć, which are mostly characterised by <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of urbanization alongside the main transport axis, the emergence of new 2 ̆ 7 urban nods 2 ̆ 7, and the gradual urban sprawl in the hinterland. For decades, the area has been generating various integration processes of economic, social and cultural collaboration, which were in most cases partly financed by the European Union (EU). In 2004, after Slovenia joined the EU, some traditional relationships started to perform in the opposite way, demonstrating the gradually diminishing rate of commuter flows, especially those of shopping tourism. However, the current regional development is characterised by strong efforts for balancing the economic, social and cultural standards {{on both sides of the}} cross-border region.

40|$|To {{maintain}} {{and restore the}} ecological integrity of floodplains, allocating water for environmental benefits (i. e. environmental water) is widely practised globally. To efficiently manage the always limited environmental water, there is pressing need to advance {{our understanding of the}} ecological response to long-term climate cycles as evidence <b>grows</b> of <b>intensification</b> of extreme climatic events such as severe drought and heat waves. In this study, we assessed the alleviating effects of artificial flooding on drought impact using the canopy condition of the iconic river red gum forests in Australia's Murray Darling Basin (MDB). To achieve this, we jointly analysed spatial-temporal patterns of NDVI response and drought conditions for the period of 2000 – 2013, during which the MDB experienced an extreme dry–wet cycle. Our results indicated that while NDVI-derived canopy condition was better at the sites receiving environmental water during the dry phases, both watered and unwatered sites displayed great similarity in seasonality and trends. Furthermore, we did not find any significant difference in NDVI response of the canopy between the sites to suggest significant differences in ecosystem stability and resilience, with watered and unwatered sites showing similar responses to the extreme wet conditions as the drought broke. The highly significant relationship between long-term drought index and NDVI anomaly suggest that climate phase is the main forcing driving canopy condition in semi-arid floodplain forests. 9 page(s...|$|R
40|$|As {{human populations}} {{continue}} to <b>grow,</b> the <b>intensification</b> of agricultural production {{is occurring in}} order to maintain food consumption and rural income levels in developing countries. The demand for livestock products is generally income-elastic, so that, with increases in real incomes in most regions, the demand for livestock products is growing as well, resulting in greater projected numbers of both ruminant and monogastric livestock. Both trends and, indeed, their interaction will have consequences for rural and urban environments in the future and for the sustainability of land-use systems. The intensification of agricultural land use may degrade soils and alter natural habitats and biodiversity or, in some cases, may lead to excessive levels of inputs, with consequent effects on the environment. Similarly, increased livestock production may lead to animal-waste pollution in some settings, and contribute to greenhouse-gas production. What may not be well recognized, however, is the role that ruminant livestock, in particular, play in assisting the attainment of higher and more sustained levels of agricultural production, often in ways that have net positive environmental impacts. This role is particularly important in the crop-livestock systems on which (sub) tropical agricultural production is increasingly dependent. 'Win-win' situations are clearly possible, especially through the contribution of intensive livestock production to soil fertility, which is relevant for large areas of the world, where soil nutrient deficits and slow nutrient turnover rates remain the primary agricultural constraint. This chapter begins by describing the relative importance of different livestock production systems and the global trends associated with them. Within each system, the net impact of livestock production on the environment is discussed and case studies of positive livestock and environment interactions are presented. Finally, the possibilities for and implications of further intensification of livestock production are explored in some depth...|$|R
40|$|Background As {{a result}} of rapidly <b>growing</b> human populations, <b>intensification</b> of {{livestock}} production and increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal agriculture, the interface between wildlife, livestock and humans is expanding, with potential impacts on both domestic animal and human health. Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. Results Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV 4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C–like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV- 1 variants, one TTSuV- 2 variant as well as PPV 4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming {{the findings from the}} 454 sequencing. Conclusions Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated {{for the first time the}} presence of PPV 4 in a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel variants of TTSuV- 1 and 2 in bushpigs. Swedish International Development Cooperation Agenc...|$|R
40|$|As Southeast Asia (SEA) is {{characterized}} by high human and domestic animal densities, <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of trade, drastic land use changes and biodiversity erosion, this region {{appears to be a}} hotspot to study complex dynamics of zoonoses emergence and health issues at the Animal–Human–Environment interface. Zoonotic diseases and environmental health issues can have devastating socioeconomic and wellbeing impacts. Assessing and managing the related risks implies to take into account ecological and social dynamics at play, in link with epidemiological patterns. The implementation of a One Health (OH) approach in this context calls for improved integration among disciplines and improved cross-sectoral collaboration, involving stakeholders at different levels. For sure, such integration is not achieved spontaneously, implies methodological guidelines and has transaction costs. We explore pathways for implementing such collaboration in SEA context, highlighting the main challenges to be faced by researchers and other target groups involved in OH actions. On this basis, we propose a conceptual framework of OH integration. Throughout 3 components (field-based data management, professional training workshops and higher education), we suggest to develop a new culture of networking involving actors from various disciplines, sectors and levels (from the municipality to the Ministries) through a participatory modelling process, fostering synergies and cooperation. This framework could stimulate long-term dialogue process, based on the combination of case studies implementation and capacity building. It aims for implementing both institutional OH dynamics (multi-stakeholders and cross-sectoral) and research approaches promoting systems thinking and involving social sciences to follow-up and strengthen collective action...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture is an {{increasingly}} important force in both the Malaysian {{as well as the}} Singaporean economies. In recent years, Singapore has focused on the aquarium fish trade, {{making it one of the}} largest ornamental fish production and transhipment centers in the world. Similarly, the Malaysian aquaculture industry has made rapid strides in the last few years and is poised to become a major contributor to the national fish supply by the early part of the next century. A significant trend in both countries has been the <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of culture systems to achieve higher production per unit area. This has led to a greater occurrence of disease, particularly among aquarium fish, shrimp and marine fish farms. To obviate and control these diseases, there has been a concurrent increase in the use of chemotherapeutants. The three major groups of commonly used chemotherapeutants are: topical disinfectants, antimicrobials and probiotics. There is a wide range of topical disinfectants used by aquafarmers. The most common of these include lime, teaseed cake, formalin, benzalkonium chloride, acriflavine, malachite green, hypochlorite and poly-vinyl pyrrolidine. Of these, lime and teaseed cake are used exclusively in ponds, and acriflavine and malachite green only in hatcheries, while the others are used in both systems. Antimicrobials being used include sulfonamides, tetracyclines, nitrofurans, chloramphenicol, oxolinic acid and virginiamycin. A number of other chemotherapeutants are also used, albeit on a limited basis. The current concerns surrounding the use of chemotherapeutants and the legislative framework surrounding their sale and distribution are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} an {{analysis}} of economic factors which affect production and consumption of flower branch products. It answers scientic questions set on base {{of the fact that}} this branch started to get in a centers of attention and experiences growth again. The paper uses both the linear and the nonlinear regression models results of which are instrumental to recognition of practical problems in the monitored area. The most important surveyed factor influencing the production appears an amount of covered areas used for growing. The use of this production factor was decreasing till 2004; only in the following period growing areas have been enlarged. Despite the fact the decrease in covered space leads to an increase in production thanks to <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of the production. Subsidies to farmers provided by the European Union in a form of direct payments SAPS affect the production positively, however, with a lower sensitivity than the intensively used growing area. Basic determinants of the flower consumption monitored in expenditures for the flowers are among others the price and the income. Because {{a significant part of the}} price is the value added tax the VAT rate was used as a representative explanatory variable. Its change will influence the consumption with a lower sensitivity than the variable of the income.

40|$|Agricultural {{greenhouse}} gas (GHG) emissions contribute approximately 12 % to total global anthropogenic GHG emissions. Cereals (rice, wheat, and maize) {{are the largest}} source of human calories, and {{it is estimated that}} world cereal production must increase by 1. 3 % annually to 2025 to meet <b>growing</b> demand. Sustainable <b>intensification</b> of cereal production systems will require maintaining high yields while reducing environmental costs. We conducted a meta-analysis (57 published studies consisting of 62 study sites and 328 observations) to test the hypothesis that the global warming potential (GWP) of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from rice, wheat, and maize, when expressed per ton of grain (yield-scaled GWP), is similar, and that the lowest value for each cereal is achieved at near optimal yields. Results show that the GWP of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from rice (3757 kg CO 2 eq ha- 1 season- 1) was higher than wheat (662 kg CO 2 eq ha- 1 season- 1) and maize (1399 kg CO 2 eq ha- 1 season- 1). The yield-scaled GWP of rice was about four times higher (657 kg CO 2 eq Mg- 1) than wheat (166 kg CO 2 eq Mg- 1) and maize (185 kg CO 2 eq Mg- 1). Across cereals, the lowest yield-scaled GWP values were achieved at 92 % of maximal yield and were about twice as high for rice (279 kg CO 2 eq Mg- 1) than wheat (102 kg CO 2 eq Mg- 1) or maize (140 kg CO 2 eq Mg- 1), suggesting greater mitigation opportunities for rice systems. In rice, wheat and maize, 0. 68 %, 1. 21 %, and 1. 06 % of N applied was emitted as N 2 O, respectively. In rice systems, there was no correlation between CH 4 emissions and N rate. In addition, when evaluating issues related to food security and environmental sustainability, other factors including cultural significance, the provisioning of ecosystem services, and human health and well-being must also be considered...|$|R

Starting at approximately 10 : 48 UT, around magnetometers in Greenland and northern Canada observe pulsations consistent with the passing overhead {{of a series of}} alternating TCV filed-aligned current pairs. Azimuthal scans by the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar located near Kangerlussuaq (formerly Sondrestrom), Greenland, at this time show strong modulation in the strength and direction of ionospheric plasma flow.

The intensification of auroral emissions at 11 : 39 UT is associated with the trailing vortex of the third TCV pair, thought {{to be the result of}} an upward field aligned current.

40|$|Available {{evidence}} suggests that sub-saharan Africa as a group has suffered serious setbacks in recent years, culminating in the stagnation of farm production and productivity amidst sustained and sometime escalating poverty rates. At the same time, increases in human population levels have resulted in rising demand for food {{as well as for}} arable land. The <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of farming has been accompanied by degradation of wild lands, including tropical forests and wetlands, at an alarming rate. Further pressure on fragile land has come from associated urbanization. Recent increases in food prices have drawn attention to this problem even more strongly. Integrating crops and livestock into existing farming systems is being recognized as a means to address these problems. The main objective of this paper was to investigate farmer’s perception of the relative importance of crop-livestock integration in the small holder farming systems. Data collected from 70 emerging and smallholder farmers Nkonkobe Municipality were analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression models and the binary logistic regression model. The results reveal that the smallholder farmers have the possibility of realizing immense benefits from the integrated systems. The most feasible option for enhancing productivity of the farming system and achieving sustainable livelihood improvements seems to be augmentation of existing and locally available inputs which will undoubtedly be less costly than their wholesale replacement with new and exotic inputs. It is recommended that collective action to identify innovative practices as part of innovation platforms comprising diverse rural and agricultural stakeholders be encouraged to enable farmers learn from one another and optimize the positive effects of a better targeted extension exposure...|$|E

The analysis has been performed in a spatial approach, j. e. according to rural administrative corrmunes for the entire analyzed area and according to rural units in the central zone of the Bełchatów Industrial Region. Changes in the number of particular kinds of livestock have been correlated with corresponding changes in factors exerting their influence on anirnal production such as: fodder potential, labour resources, pricing system, equipment of farms with tractive force. The performed analysis has revealed that trends of changes in particular kinds of animals in their spatial lay-out are characterized by a considerable differentiation of the hinter land of the fuel-power combine encompassing the area of rural communes of Kleszczów, Kamieńsk and Kluki, which re cord growing extensiveness of agricultural production.

40|$|Expanding {{national}} services {{sectors and}} global competition aggravate current and perceived future market pressures on traditional manufacturing industries. These perceptions of change have provoked a <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of geo-political discourses on technological innovation and ‘learning’, {{and calls for}} competency in design among other professional skills. However, these political discourses on innovation and learning have paralleled public concerns with the apparent ‘growth pains’ from factory closures and subsequent increases in unemployment, and its debilitating social and economic implications for local and regional development. In this respect the following investigation sets out to conceptualize change through the complementary and differing perceptions of industry and regional actors’ experiences or narratives, linking these perceptions to their structure-determined spheres of agent-environment interactivity. It aims to determine whether agents’ differing perceptions of industry transformation can {{have a role in}} the legitimization of their interests in, and in sustaining their organizational influence over the process of industry-regional transformation. It argues that industry and regional agent perceptions are among the cognitive aspects of agent-environment interactivity that permeate agency. It stresses agents’ ability to reason and manipulate their work environments to preserve their self-regulating interests in, and task representative influence over the multi-jurisdictional space of industry-regional transformation. The contributions of this investigation suggest that agents’ varied perceptions of industry and regional change inform or compete for influence over the redirection of regional, industry and business strategies. This claim offers a greater appreciation for the reflexive and complex institutional dimensions of industry planning and development, and the political responsibility to socially just forms of regional development.

40|$|Globalization creates <b>growing</b> {{need for}} <b>intensification</b> of {{generating}} innovation. The most important {{platform for the}} formation of new ideas is higher education, where students can realize their ideas and transform them from theoretical ideas into profitable business projects. The European experience of such transformation is useful for the Ukrainian educational system. Since the study of the means of adapting foreign experience to support innovation in higher school of Ukraine was not paid sufficient attention to, {{there is a need for}} relevant research. The aim of the research is the analysis of the experience of support and implementation of innovations of students in Europe at Lund University and Gdańsk University of Technology to identify the tools of its adaptation in higher education of Ukraine. The research methods are abstract–logical, analytical. The paper analyzes experience of one of the oldest universities in the world – Lund University and it was revealed that education and carrying out research in the areas of engineering, law, sociology, economics and management, medicine, theology, art, music and drama takes place on its basis. Demola Innovation Center, created on the basis of the University, provides collaboration and open innovation through interdisciplinary interaction between student groups that work with real customers. On the basis of the Center communication between representatives of the businesses, the higher school and the real buyers is carried out. It was established that at Gdańsk University of Technology, support of innovation is realized within the innovation program "Horizon 2020 " – a financial tool aimed at developing innovations to ensure the competitiveness of the EU economy under conditions of globalization. It was found that the development of the European education system by implementing innovations has been going on for 25 years already. This experience, as the practice shows is quite successful. Incubators, created on the basis of the universities allow implementing the new economy. Funding today the innovation processes on the basis of higher education, the European government forms the platform for the development of profitable business as a guaranteed taxpayer in the future. We made a conclusion that the application of this practice in the Ukrainian higher education will intensify the processes of generating innovation, which, in its turn, will enhance the competitiveness of national higher education. The scientific novelty of this work consists in identifying means of supporting innovation of the youth by creating innovation incubators, student research labs on the basis of higher education (University), which allow implementing new ideas, creating new jobs, increase the level of competition of national economies. The practical value of the work lies in the fact that the use of the European experience of implementation of innovation through the development of scientific laboratories will generate ideas and increase the level of competitiveness of national education.

Here, we hypothesized that the exposure risk to livestock fluoroquinolones, as indicators of pharmaceutical burden in food, {{is related to the}} variable reliance of scavengers on domestic versus wild animal carcasses. Since the misuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major predisposing factor for opportunistic mycoses, we evaluated disease signs potentially associated with diet-dependent drug exposure in nestlings of two threatened vultures. A greater occurrence (100 %, n= 14) and concentration of fluoroquinolones (mean±SD= 73. 0 ± 27. 5 µg L, range= 33. 2 – 132. 7), mostly enrofloxacin, were found in Cinereous vultures, Aegypius monachus, due to their greater dependence on livestock carcasses than Egyptian vultures, Neophron percnopterus (fluoroquinolones occurrence: 44 %, n= 16, concentration: 37. 9 ± 16. 6 µg L, range= 11. 5 – 55. 9), which rely much more on carcasses of wild animals (42 % of remains vs. 23 % in the cinereous vulture). The chaotic, chronic and pulsed ingestion of these drugs throughout nestling development is proposed {{as one of the most}} plausible explanations for the high occurrence and intensity of oral Candida-like lesions in nestling vultures. The high occurrence of fluoroquinolone residues and disease hindered the probing of a cause-effect relationship between both factors in individual vultures. This relationship could be evaluated through a population-based approach by sampling vultures not exposed to these drugs. The high dependence of vultures on domestic animals today compared to past decades and the <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of livestock farming, imply an expected increase in the impact of pharmaceuticals on scavenger populations. This requires further evaluation due to potential consequences in biodiversity conservation and environmental health. We encourage the prioritization of efforts to promote the use of less medicated free-ranging livestock carcasses left in the countryside, rather than stabled stocks made available in vulture restaurants. Additionally, attention should be paid to the population recovery of wild species that dominated scavenger diets in the past.

40|$|For decades, {{there has}} been {{significant}} investment {{in the development of}} agricultural technologies that aim to increase productivity of smallholder farmers in Africa. But farm output and productivity have stagnated and poverty rates have remained high and even increasing in some areas. At the same time, increases in human population levels have resulted in rising demand for food as well as for arable land. The <b>growing</b> <b>intensification</b> of farming has been accompanied by degradation of wild lands, including tropical forests and wetlands, at an alarming rate. Further pressure on fragile land has come from associated urbanization, leading to agricultural land being converted to residential and industrial uses with serious consequences for agricultural production and food supply. The recent increases in food prices across the globe as well as South Africa have drawn attention to this problem even more strongly. The main objective of the current study was to investigate farmer’s perception of the relative importance of crop-livestock integration in the small holder farming systems. Data were collected from 70 emerging and smallholder farmers selected by stratified random sampling in the communities surrounding Alice, Middledrift and the Seymour- Balfour area of Nkonkobe municipality of the Eastern Cape Province. To collect the data, a semi-structure questionnaire was administered to the respondents through face-to-face interviews. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the farmers in terms of their socio-economic and demographic backgrounds. A series of multiple linear regression models and a binary logistic regression equation were fitted to determine the factors influencing farmers’ perception and how these in turn contribute to the decision to adopt or not to adopt crop-livestock integration. The results of the study reveal that small farmers in the Nkonkobe municipality have the possibility of realizing immense benefits from the integrated systems which also have the potential to lead to substantial improvements of the physical, chemical and biological soil properties. There is clear evidence of widespread interest to experiment with the practices based on the strong positive perceptions {{that a majority of the}} survey farmers exhibited during the course of the survey. But the farmers are facing challenges in coping with the associated complexities of competition on land, and management skill which are often in limited supply. That in most cases is not enough and efficient even to manage one of these two enterprises alone and reduction in crops yield due to use of manure as a substitute of fertilizer. Constraints to integrating crops and livestock include the competition for resources, especially land. Managing two types of farming on the same farm was perceived as difficult and many respondents held the view that use of waste of one enterprise as input to the other enterprise can reduce productivity. For example some farmers considered that the use of manure to improve soil fertility may not lead to output growth to the same extent as the use of fertilizer. A number of farmers (86 %) pointed out that they only market their produce after deducting their consumption share, highlighting the crucial role of food security as a motivation for crop-livestock integration. Complementation of inputs rather than substituting inputs is required to render the system more productive and sustainable as costs are minimized and output is boosted. Associations of grain and livestock producers are useful for filling these gaps which include limited access to credit, technology and knowledge and can promote the adoption of a crop-livestock system...|$|E
