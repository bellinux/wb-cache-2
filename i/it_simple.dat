5|$|Keep <b>It</b> <b>Simple,</b> Morrison's 33rd studio {{album of}} {{completely}} new material {{was released by}} Exile/Polydor Records on 17 March 2008 in the UK and released by Exile/Lost Highway Records in the US and Canada on 1 April 2008. It comprised eleven self-penned tracks. Morrison promoted the album with a short US tour including an appearance at the SXSW music conference, and a UK concert broadcast on BBC Radio 2. In {{the first week of}} release Keep <b>It</b> <b>Simple</b> debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number ten, Morrison's first Top Ten charting in the US.|$|E
5|$|There {{should be}} a {{continuous}} effort to simplify the code, because otherwise just adding capabilities will slowly increase the software complexity. The code should be refactored over time to make <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> and clear, not just constantly add new features. The goal should be code that is “obviously right”, as opposed to code that is so complicated that “I can’t see any problems”.|$|E

5|$|Both NAD and NADH {{strongly}} absorb {{ultraviolet light}} {{because of the}} adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays– by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340nm using a spectrophotometer.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, {{as the second}} entry in a planned Ace Attorney trilogy. It was originally intended to feature the first game's prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, in all episodes; Franziska was created when the development team learned that Edgeworth had become popular among players, and Takumi {{wanted to use the}} character more carefully and sparingly. They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi wanted to keep the game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to keep <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the lack of the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.|$|E

25|$|The flist program {{provided}} {{a list of}} files in the user's minidisk, and allowed sorting by any file attribute. The file attributes could be passed to scripts or function-key definitions, making <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> to use flist as part of CMS EXEC, EXEC 2 or XEDIT scripts.|$|E
25|$|Syntax {{highlighting}} {{also helps}} programmers find errors in their program. For example, most editors highlight string literals {{in a different}} color. Consequently, spotting a missing delimiter is much easier because of the contrasting color of the text. Brace matching is another important feature with many popular editors. This makes <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> {{to see if a}} brace has been left out or locate the match of the brace the cursor is on by highlighting the pair in a different color.|$|E

25|$|Released August 22, 2017, Parallels Desktop® 13 for Mac {{provides}} macOS High Sierra readiness {{and support}} for upcoming Windows 10 features. According to Parallels, the new version makes <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> for MacBook Pro users to add Windows applications to the Touch Bar, and use Touch Bar within Windows applications. It is also the first solution to bring the upcoming Windows 10 People Bar feature to the Mac – including integration with the Mac Dock and Spotlight. The new version also features up-to 100 percent performance improvements for completing certain tasks. The update also brings in a slightly refreshed UI to better match macOS and visual improvements for Windows users on Retina displays.|$|E
25|$|Ultraviolet microscopes {{have two}} main purposes. The {{first is to}} utilize the shorter {{wavelength}} of ultraviolet electromagnetic energy to improve the image resolution beyond that of the diffraction limit of standard optical microscopes. This technique is used for non-destructive inspection of devices with very small features such as those found in modern semiconductors. The second application for UV microscopes is contrast enhancement where the response of individual samples is enhanced, relative to their surrounding, due to the interaction of light with the molecules within the sample itself. One example is {{in the growth of}} protein crystals. Protein crystals are formed in salt solutions. As salt and protein crystals are both formed in the growth process, and both are commonly transparent to the human eye, they cannot be differentiated with a standard optical microscope. As the tryptophan of protein absorbs light at 280nm, imaging with a UV microscope with 280nm bandpass filters makes <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> to differentiate between the two types of crystals. The protein crystals appear dark while the salt crystals are transparent.|$|E
500|$|The {{cold weather}} and ice {{conditions}} reduced {{the game to}} a slower speed than usual, with little physical play. [...] Both teams struggled to deal with bouncing pucks, while arena staff were called out to fix patches of the ice on numerous occasions. Flames' defenceman Steve Staios stated that Calgary's strategy revolved around [...] "keeping <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> and trying {{to play the game}} in straight lines". Montreal's James Wisniewski admitted after the game that the Canadiens struggled to adapt to the conditions.|$|E

500|$|... "Touch My Body" [...] rides a {{relatively}} restrained slow-dance groove, with some light, orchestral-synth flourishes thrown in. The rhythm is almost completely carried by an effortless keyboard bump, the easygoing repetitiveness of which eventually wears the listener down, and {{sets up a}} delicate frame for Carey to sing around. She pulls back when the song picks up the pace, and Carey keeps <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> here, playing with tempos rather than range. Indeed, she almost quietly slides into the chorus. [...] "If you run around and brag about this secret rendezvous, I will hunt you down", she sings, letting the last line trail off. But you don't necessarily believe her, as the feel is more playful that sinful.|$|E
500|$|Judge Sheindlin’s third {{book for}} adults, “Keep <b>It</b> <b>Simple,</b> Stupid: You’re Smarter Than You Look,” {{also on the}} New York Times best seller list, {{published}} in 2000, shares her wisdom and opinions on solving everyday family squabbles. Her career as an author began prior to her courtroom series. One of her more recent books, which hit shelves on April 25, 2013, was inspired by one of her advisory catch phrases encouraging romantic partners to be judicious with regards to domestic partnerships. This catch phrase is: “There is no Court of People Just Living Together.” In September 2014, Sheindlin celebrated the opening of her 19th season by giving out her latest book, [...] "What Would Judy Say: Be the Hero of Your Own Story," [...] for free. Sheindlin's seven books are as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|In a 1995 interview, Guitar World writer Jeff Gilbert {{described}} Vitalogy as [...] "strange" [...] and [...] "very eclectic." [...] McCready agreed, saying, [...] "There is {{some weird}} stuff on there." [...] McCready attributed the album's sound {{to the group}} recording it on tour. During this period Vedder began to contribute in a large capacity as a guitarist. Gossard said, [...] "Vitalogy {{is the first one}} where Ed plays guitar and he wrote three to four songs. I remember thinking, 'This is so different. Is anyone going to like this?'...It had a more punk feel to <b>it.</b> <b>Simple</b> songs recorded really quickly." [...] The album has a notable lack of guitar solos compared with the band's first two albums. McCready said, [...] "Vitalogy is not really a 'solo' album. I don't think the songs demanded solos; {{it was more of a}} rhythmic album." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} given a {{specific}} budget, so Weisman and Cook wanted to allow the animation to [...] "move" [...] more than anything, giving <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> and stylistic designs. Sam Raimi, director of the Spider-Man live action films, [...] "set the bar" [...] for the fluent movement styles Spider-Man has, which Weisman and Cook were in complete agreement of incorporating into the series. When designing the Vulture, the two employed the dark green shades from his original design, a color which they use thematically {{for most of their}} villains and other negative aspects of Peter's life, along with touches of blood-like red. His wings were employed in the same style that his comic book counterpart; [...] " [...] for steeringthey don’t keep him air born," [...] Weisman describes. Vulture was voiced by Robert Englund, iconic for his portrayal as the horror film character Freddy Krueger.|$|E
500|$|However, Blackley instead {{proposed}} an aerobatics training simulation, {{which he had}} conceived while reading an aerobatics magazine on a Lexington, Massachusetts bus. Collaborating with Ultima Underworld II programmer Greg Travis, he created a thirty page concept document that outlined the game. His core idea was to recreate the [...] "yummy, visceral, fluid feeling that you get when flying a real airplane". He wanted the project to bear more resemblance to a playground than to a video game, and he sought to give <b>it</b> <b>simple</b> controls and realistic terrain to decrease the learning curve for beginners. Blackley {{assumed the role of}} project leader and then engaged the team in [...] "flaming sessions" [...] to generate ideas. According to programmer Doug Church, Blackley's concept of the game was not fully developed, but he clearly expressed his thoughts and motivated the team. The first months of the project produced disparate prototypes that demonstrated prospective features. The company committed to full development of the game in early 1993, and production commenced in March.|$|E
500|$|Swift {{performed}} [...] "Picture to Burn" [...] {{to close}} the main set, before commencing the encore on all venues of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour (2009–10). During 2009 performances, Swift donned a black cocktail dress with sparkly ornaments along the stomach, as she roamed throughout the stage, which was projected with images of searing flames, singing the song. In the 2010 extension, Swift bared a spangly, violet mini-dress. Jim Harrington of the San Jose Mercury News believed [...] "Picture to Burn"'s performance on April 11, 2010 [...] at the HP Pavilion in San Jose, California demonstrated how versatile Swift was as a performer, feeling equally at gusto with tender ballads and uptempo rockers. Of the performance at the tour's final concert on June 5, 2010 at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, Jay N. Miller of The Patriot Ledger said, [...] "She strutted down the catwalk chastising another hapless ex-boyfriend". Attending the same concert, Molly Trust of Billboard deemed the performance {{one of the most}} energized moments of the night, while Susan McDonald of The Sun Chronicle deemed <b>it</b> <b>simple,</b> yet the most powerful.|$|E
