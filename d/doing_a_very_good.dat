6000|$|Now if you {{had noticed}} {{anything}} about him, {{it would have been}} chiefly to notice how little he was noticeable. He wore the black morning coat, the black tie, and the speckled grey nether parts (descending into shadow and mystery below the counter) of his craft. He was of a pallid complexion, hair of a kind of dirty fairness, greyish eyes, and a skimpy, immature moustache under his peaked indeterminate nose. His features were all small, but none ill-shaped. A rosette of pins decorated the lappel of his coat. His remarks, you would observe, were entirely what people used to call cliche, formulae not organic to the occasion, but stereotyped ages ago and learnt years since by heart. [...] "This, madam," [...] he would say, [...] "is selling very well." [...] "We are <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> article at four three a yard." [...] "We could show you something better, of course." [...] "No trouble, madam, I assure you." [...] Such were the simple counters of his intercourse. So, I say, he would have presented himself to your superficial observation. He would have danced about behind the counter, have neatly refolded the goods he had shown you, have put on one side those you selected, extracted a little book with a carbon leaf and a tinfoil sheet from a fixture, made you out a little bill in that weak flourishing hand peculiar to drapers, and have bawled [...] "Sayn!" [...] Then a puffy little shop-walker would have come into view, looked at the bill for a second, very hard (showing you a parting down the middle of his head meanwhile), have scribbled a still more flourishing J. M. all over the document, have asked you if there was nothing more, have stood by you--supposing that you were paying cash--until the central figure of this story reappeared with the change. One glance more at him, and the puffy little shop-walker would have been bowing you out, with fountains of civilities at work all about you. And so the interview would have terminated.|$|E

50|$|Professor Harold Everett (Richard Long), {{a widower}} and {{mathematics}} teacher at Collier University. Everett's three children are so rambunctious that he cannot retain a nanny {{to take care}} of them; In the first episode they have gone through five different au pairs {{in less than a year}} before Nanny's arrival. Though he admits Nanny is already <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> job, his skepticism and Nanny's lack of references maintain his doubts as to whether it will work out, added to which the sheer implausibility of the many strange things that have happened since Nanny's arrival contradict Everett's discipline of practicality. Initially he spends most of his time working, but with Nanny's subtle prompting he begins to spend more and more time with his family. As the series progressed there were increasingly prevalent hints of a romantic interest between Everett and Nanny.|$|E

[...] "Though it was {{at the height of the}} drug-crazed rock era, the members of the band had all turned to Transcendental Meditation, were completely clean and sober, and were dealing with a lot of political issues that other musicians wouldnt tackle, like confronting the American Federation of Musicians which was not <b>doing</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>good</b> job at providing benefits and protections for musicians. It was the beginning of a journey through consciousness-raising and political development for me". Tillery stayed with The Loading Zone a few years, but the lifestyle became [...] "too much, too soon …. I kind of crashed after that….The lifestyle can either make or break a human being. There are some people who are destroyed by their early success. At least I can say Im a survivor". The group broke up and reformed in 1969, and had varying membership for periods of time in the late 1960s and early 1970s. One account shows that Tillery left the group in January 1969, rejoined in March 1970 through 1971, and left the Loading Zone for the final time in 1972.|$|E
