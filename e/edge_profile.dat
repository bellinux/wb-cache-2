They have many common features: in each case, the tiles are constructed from shapes related to the pentagon (and hence to the golden ratio), but the basic tile shapes need to be supplemented by matching rules in order to tile aperiodically; these rules may be described using labeled vertices or edges, or patterns on the tile faces [...] alternatively the <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> can be modified (e.g. by indentations and protrusions) to obtain an aperiodic set of prototiles.|$|E
2500|$|Stone (usually granite) countertops and {{bathroom}} vanities both involve a finished slab of stone, usually polished but sometimes with another finish (such as honed or sandblasted). Industry standard thicknesses in the United States are 3/4" [...] (2cm) and 1.25" [...] (3cm). Often 2cm slabs will be laminated {{at the edge}} to create {{the appearance of a}} thicker <b>edge</b> <b>profile.</b> The slabs are cut to fit the top of the kitchen or bathroom cabinet, by measuring, templating or digital templating. Countertop slabs are commonly sawn from rough blocks of stone by reciprocating gangsaws using steel shot as abrasive. More modern technology utilizes diamond wire saws which use less water and energy. Multi-wire saws with as many as 60 wires can slab a block in less than two hours. The slabs are finished (i.e., polished, honed), then sealed with resin to fill micro-fissures and surface imperfections typically due to the loss of poorly bonded elements such as biotite. The fabricators shop cuts these slabs down to final size and finishes the edges with equipment such as hand-held routers, grinders, CNC equipment, or polishers. In 2008, concerns were raised regarding radon emissions from granite countertops; the National Safety Council states that the contributions of radon to inside air come from the soil and rock around the residence (69%), the outdoor air and the water supply (28%), and only 2.5% from all building materials-including granite countertops. [...] A concerned homeowner can employ ASTM radon mitigation and removal techniques.

5000|$|Scythe and sickle blades have {{traditionally}} been sharpened by occasional peening followed by frequent honing in the field during use. In the example below, a short scythe blade, being used for clearing brambles, is being sharpened by reforming the malleable steel to create an <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> that can then be honed. Because this blade {{is being used to}} cut tough-stemmed brambles it is being peened about every thirty hours of work. Nicks and cuts to the blade edge are also worked out of the blade by peening and a new <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> then formed for honing. A peening jig is used here but blades can be free-peened using various designs of peening anvils. The peening jig shown has two interchangeable caps that set different angles. A coarse angle is set first about 3mm back from the edge and the fine angle is then set on the edge, leaving an edge that lends itself to being easily honed.

The included angle of a blade is important in controlling its cutting ability and edge strength, i.e. a low angle makes the edge thin and optimized for cutting while a large angle makes it thick, which cuts poorly, but is very strong.|$|E
40|$|Feedback-directed {{optimization}} (FDO) {{is effective}} in improving application runtime performance, but has not been widely adopted due to the tedious dual-compilation model, the difficulties in generating representative training data sets, and the high runtime overhead of profile collection. The use of hardware-event sampling to generate estimated <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> overcomes these drawbacks. Yet, hardware event samples are typically not precise at the instruction or basic-block granularity. These inaccuracies lead to missed performance when compared to instrumentation-based FDO. In this paper, we use multiple hardware event profiles and supervised learning techniques to generate heuristics for improved precision of basic-block-level sample profiles, and to further improve the smoothing algorithms used to construct <b>edge</b> <b>profiles.</b> We demonstrate that sampling-based FDO can achieve an average of 78 % of the performance gains obtained using instrumentation-based exact <b>edge</b> <b>profiles</b> for SPEC 2000 benchmarks, matching or beating instrumentation-based FDO in many cases. The overhead of collection is only 0. 74 % on average, while compiler based instrumentation incurs 6. 8 %– 53. 5 % overhead (and 10 x overhead on an industrial web search application), and dynamic instrumentation incurs 28. 6 %– 1639. 2 % overhead.

5000|$|Cabinet {{frames and}} doors may be {{fashioned}} from solid wood (typically {{a species of}} hardwood), medium density fiberboard (MDF), particle board, plywood, or a combination, and may include lamination or a surface coating over these core materials. A floating panel in a door can be hardwood-veneer plywood captured within a solid wood or MDF frame. Solid wood and MDF can be edge-shaped, e.g., to round or pattern the edges of doors, drawer fronts, or face frames. Particle board, once manufactured, cannot be edge-shaped suitably. Plywood cannot be shaped without revealing its veneer core, often considered unsightly, though edge-shaped furniture-grade plywood with thin plies 1/16 in is considered attractive for limited uses. MDF, once shaped, can be coated conformally with flexible veneers such as thermofoil or can be painted. It can also be covered with wood veneer or high-pressure laminate {{but only if the}} <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> is square or approximately so (to within the veneer thickness). Today many cabinet doors and drawer fronts utilize an MDF core. Doors and drawer fronts may also be fashioned of particle board surfaced with high-pressure laminate. Natural wood offers its subtle combination of color, grain, pore pattern, variable absorption and smoothness of finish, and variation with viewing angle and lighting condition. The appearance of natural wood can only be achieved with solid wood components (wherever edges are shaped) or possibly veneer (where they are not); as already pointed out, the two approaches can be combined in a single cabinet. Various transparent grain-revealing finishes including shellac, lacquer, varnish, or polyurethane have been devised. A built-up finish may optionally utilize diverse pigments, dyes, bleaches, glazes, or wood fillers that may highlight contrasting colorants. Finishes can be applied by brush or spray and may comprise many separately applied layers. Accordingly, finishes formulated by differing manufacturers do not, in general, exactly match. Distressing the wood cabinets is another finish application and is often done in conjunction with glazes, stains, paints or dyes. This process consists of adding manufactured imperfections to cabinet doors to give the wood cabinets an aged, distressed, old-world rustic appearance. Common techniques include creating wormholes, rasping, dings and dents and sanding through the wood and layers of finish unevenly.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates optimal {{constellation}} labeling in {{the context}} of the <b>edge</b> <b>profile.</b> A constellation’s <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> lists the minimum-distance edge for each binary symbol error. The paper introduces the symmetric-ultracomposite (SU) labeling structure and shows that this structure provides undominated edge profiles for 2 -PSK, 2 -PAM, and 22 -point square QAM. The SU structure is a generalization of the commonly used reflected binary Gray code. With the proper choice of basis vectors, SU labeling can support either set-partition or Gray-code labeling of 2 -PSK, 2 -PAM, and 22 -point square QAM. Notably, there are Gray-code and set-partition labelings that do not have the SU structure. These labelings yield inferior edge profiles. The SU structure does not apply to cross constellations. However, for any standard cross constellation with 32 or more points, a quasi-SU labeling structure can approximate the SU structure. With the correct choice of basis, quasi-SU labelings produce quasi-Gray labelings. However, the quasi-SU structure cannot support set-partition labeling. In fact, the quasi-SU structure provides a better <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> than standard set-partition labeling. Thus, for cross constellations there is a choice between <b>edge</b> <b>profile</b> optimality and the group structure provided by set-partitioning. Here, the correct choice depends on whether the encoder trellis has parallel branches...|$|E
