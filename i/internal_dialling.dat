5000|$|When {{the complex}} was {{complete}} in November 1930, {{the population of}} the block increased from approximately 400 to roughly 5,000, making better use of the valuable real estate. The complex included restaurants, swimming pool, gymnasium, and a [...] "modernistic garage with club rooms for both patrons and chauffeurs". The pool was regularly used for swim meets. An <b>internal</b> <b>dial</b> telephone system connected the apartments and businesses in the complex.|$|R
50|$|Palestinians use the Israeli {{telecommunication}} infrastructure {{either directly or}} through the Palestinian Paltel company, which allocates numbers reserved for it by the Israeli Ministry of Communication.The 059 prefix is reserved exclusively for the Palestinian Jawwal cellular communication company (a subsidiary of Paltel), and the 056 prefix is similarly reserved for the Wataniya Telecom company. Note that these prefixes {{had been used in}} the past as Israeli <b>internal</b> <b>dialing</b> prefixes, but were replaced or merged with other dialing codes, and reintroduced for the exclusive use of the Palestinian telecommunication system.|$|R
50|$|The device also enabled {{owners to}} tell {{the time in the}} dark. This was done by turning the front disc {{clockwise}} until it went no further (because of the cam inside) and then feeling at which hour marker (indicated by the surrounding circle of jewels) the watch hand was positioned. In the case of the 2011 discovery, the 12 o'clock position was marked by the chain attachment. The watch was also fitted with a small <b>internal</b> <b>dial</b> with two normal hands so that the exact time could be read when the case was opened.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Western Electric model 554 wall phone, {{derived from}} the model 500 desk phone. It uses the same <b>internal</b> components, <b>dial</b> and handset as a desk phone. This unit is dated 1959 ...|$|R
50|$|For the clock, {{the work}} {{consisted}} of a RPH50C motor and Junior winder weighing approximately 16 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 10 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. For the strike, the installation {{consisted of a}} RPH50AC motor and Mark II winder weighing approximately 40 pounds with overload protection and regulator. A 16-tooth split chain and 35 feet of one-half-inch pitch roller chain with idler and chain adjuster. The clock was also cleaned and repainted with the <b>internal</b> <b>dial</b> re-lacquered. The work {{was carried out by}} the inventor of the system, David Gamble of Eaton Socon and consists of a small electric motor clamped to weights and geared with sprockets onto a continuous chain. As the weight operates the clock mechanism by pulling downwards, the electric motor monkey is climbing up the chain at the same speed, so that the weight never has to be cranked back to the top.|$|R
50|$|A PBX, in {{contrast}} to a key system, employs an organizational numbering plan for its stations. In addition, a dial plan determines whether additional digit sequences must be prefixed when dialing to obtain access to a central-office trunk. Modern number-analysis systems permit users to <b>dial</b> <b>internal</b> and external telephone numbers without special codes to distinguish the intended destination.|$|R
50|$|Each MF tone {{consists}} of two frequencies, shown in the table on the left. The Touch Tone encoding is shown by the table on the right:Normally, the tone durations are on for 60ms, with 60ms of silence between digits. The 'KP' and 'KP2' tones are sent for 100ms. KP2 (ST2 in the R1 standard) was used for <b>dialing</b> <b>internal</b> Bell System telephone numbers. However, actual frequency durations can vary depending on location, switch type, and the machine status.|$|R
5000|$|Frederique Constant {{introduced}} a Worldtimer watch in 2012 {{with a unique}} mechanism, adjusted solely via the crown. The Worldtimer function is used by selecting the desired city and placing it at the 12 o'clock position on the <b>dial.</b> <b>Internal</b> discs automatically synchronise, and after that, {{it is possible to}} see what time it is in any of the 24 cities on the dial. In addition, thin discs also indicate at a glance whether it is day (white disc) or night (black disc).|$|R
50|$|Some {{types of}} calls are not charged, such as local calls (and <b>internal</b> calls) <b>dialed</b> {{directly}} by a telephone subscriber in Canada, the United States, Hong Kong, United Kingdom, Ireland or New Zealand (Residential subscribers only). In most other areas, all telephone calls are charged {{a fee for}} the connection. Fees depend on the provider of the service, the type of service being used (a call placed from a landline or wired telephone will have one rate, and a call placed from a mobile telephone will have a different rate) and {{the distance between the}} calling and the called parties. In most circumstances, the calling party pays this fee. However, in some circumstances such as a reverse charge or collect call, the called party pays the cost of the call. In some circumstances, the caller pays a flat rate charge for the telephone connection and does not pay any additional charge for all calls made. Telecommunication liberalization has been established in several countries to allows customers to keep their local phone provider and use an alternate provider for a certain call in order to save money.|$|R
