5|$|Several {{types of}} <b>incense</b> clock have been found, {{the most common}} forms include the <b>incense</b> stick and <b>incense</b> seal. An <b>incense</b> stick clock was an <b>incense</b> stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, {{sometimes}} having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that {{a certain amount of}} time had elapsed. Some <b>incense</b> clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray. Sticks of <b>incense</b> with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance. The <b>incense</b> sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples.|$|E
5|$|Fragrance may {{refer to}} the sweet taste of the harbour's fresh water estuarine influx of the Pearl River or to the <b>incense</b> from {{factories}} lining the coast of northern Kowloon. The <b>incense</b> was stored near Aberdeen Harbour for export before Hong Kong developed Victoria Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, a geisha {{was paid}} {{for the number of}} senkodokei (<b>incense</b> sticks) that had been {{consumed}} while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. <b>Incense</b> seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals. The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which <b>incense</b> was placed. These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the <b>incense</b> powder trails. Different powdered <b>incense</b> clocks used different formulations of <b>incense,</b> depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of <b>incense,</b> directly related {{to the size of the}} seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.|$|E

50|$|These rules, {{except for}} the manner of <b>incensing</b> the offerings at Mass, applied also before 1969. Earlier editions of the Roman Missal {{prescribe}} that the offerings be <b>incensed</b> by forming over them with the thurible first three crosses and then three circles, the first two anticlockwise and last clockwise, while also saying a prescribed prayer. They also direct that <b>incensing</b> of the altar be done with single swings at 29 designated points of an altar attached to the rear wall of the sanctuary, and at 22 points of a freestanding altar.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, <b>incense</b> clocks {{were used in}} the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms. <b>Incense</b> clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that <b>incense</b> clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, <b>incense</b> clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use.|$|E
5|$|Ptolemy II Philadelphus, {{emperor of}} Ptolemaic Egypt, may have forged an {{alliance}} with the Lihyanites {{in order to secure}} the <b>incense</b> route at Dedan, thereby rerouting the <b>incense</b> trade from Dedan to the coast along the Red Sea to Egypt. I. E. S. Edwards connects the Syro-Ephraimite War to the desire of the Israelites and the Aramaeans to control the northern end of the <b>Incense</b> route, which ran up from Southern Arabia and could be tapped by commanding Transjordan.|$|E
5|$|Cubeb {{was thought}} {{by the people}} of Europe to be repulsive to demons, just as it was {{by the people of}} China. Ludovico Maria Sinistrari, a Catholic priest who wrote about methods of {{exorcism}} in the late 17th century, includes cubeb as an ingredient in an <b>incense</b> to ward off incubus. Even today, his formula for the <b>incense</b> is quoted by neopagan authors, some of whom also claim that cubeb can be used in love sachets and spells.|$|E

5|$|Gerrha – {{inhabited}} by Chaldean exiles from Babylon – controlled the <b>Incense</b> trade routes across Arabia to the Mediterranean and exercised {{control over the}} trading of aromatics to Babylon in the 1st century BCE. The Nabateans exercised control over the routes along the <b>Incense</b> Route, and their hold was challenged – without success – by Antigonus Cyclops, emperor of Syria. The Nabatean control over trade further increased and spread in many directions.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Incense</b> Route {{served as}} a channel for trading of Indian, Arabian and East Asian goods. The <b>incense</b> trade flourished from South Arabia to the Mediterranean between roughly the 3rd century BCE to the 2nd century CE.

5|$|Hill censer: The hill censer, {{a vessel}} used for burning <b>incense,</b> {{dates to the}} Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). The censers are shaped like {{mountains}} and were used for religious rituals. The shape of the hill censer acts as a visual aid for envisioning the sacred mountains that {{were said to have}} been inhabited by Taoist immortals. Hill censers were originally designed for Taoist rituals, but were later used by Chinese Buddhists. Hill censers often include carvings of wilds animals and birds. Some censers depict waves at the foundation of the vessel, said to be the waves of the East China Sea. A hole {{at the top of the}} censer releases the smoke of the <b>incense.</b>|$|E

5|$|While early <b>incense</b> seals {{were made}} of wood or stone, the Chinese {{gradually}} introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create {{both large and small}} seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts. <b>Incense</b> seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.|$|E
5|$|Common bronze items {{included}} domestic wares like oil lamps, <b>incense</b> burners, tables, irons, stoves, and dripping jars. Iron goods were {{often used for}} construction and farmwork, such as plowshares, pickaxes, spades, shovels, hoes, sickles, axes, adze, hammers, chisels, knives, saws, scratch awls, and nails. Iron was also used to make swords, halberds, arrowheads and scale armor for the military.|$|E
5|$|During filming, {{the crew}} and several cast members objected to cinematographer Michael Seresin and camera {{operator}} John Stanier's European style of single-source lighting, which involved the use of <b>incense</b> burners. In response, representatives of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) halted the production, and forbade Parker from using smoke on the set due to the noxious atmosphere it created.|$|E

5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} <b>incense</b> cedars exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|E
