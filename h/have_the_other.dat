5|$|On the Continent, {{particularly}} Germany, crests have a {{far greater}} significance than in Britain, and {{it is common for}} one person to display multiple crests with his arms; certain high-ranking noblemen are entitled to as many as seventeen. This practice did not exist in Britain until the modern era, and arms with more than one crest are still rare. In contrast to Continental practice, where a crest is never detached from its helm, a Briton with more than one crest may choose to display only one crested helm, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> crests simply floating in space. Though usually adopted through marriage to an heiress, examples exist of secondary crests being granted as augmentations: after defeating the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, Robert Ross was granted, in addition to his original crest, the crest of an arm holding the US flag with a broken flagstaff.|$|E

25|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version is}} {{different}} from the other three versions insofar as it is more RPG based, and is played from an isometric three-quarter top-down view. Gameplay focuses on turn-based combat, and at various points, all nine members of the fellowship (Frodo, Sam, Pippin, Merry, Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli and Boromir) are controllable, each with their own strengths, weaknesses and growth charts. During combat, the player has the choice to fully control each member of their active party (up to four characters), or instead, control only the main player character, and <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three controlled by the AI.|$|E

25|$|Say we {{are told}} that a woman has two children. If we ask whether either of them is a girl, and are told yes, what is the {{probability}} that the other child is also a girl? Considering this new child independently, one might expect the probability that the other child is female is ½ (50%). But by building a probability space (illustrating all possible outcomes), we see that the probability is actually only ⅓ (33%). This is because the possibility space illustrates 4 ways of having these two children: boy-boy, girl-boy, boy-girl, and girl-girl. But we were given more information. Once {{we are told}} that one of the children is a female, we use this new information to eliminate the boy-boy scenario. Thus the probability space reveals that there are still 3 ways to have two children where one is a female: boy-girl, girl-boy, girl-girl. Only ⅓ of these scenarios would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> child also be a girl. Using a probability space, we are less likely to miss one of the possible scenarios, or to neglect the importance of new information. For further information, see Boy or girl paradox.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not {{figure out how to make}} the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
500|$|Bret Hart's {{feud with}} Bob Backlund dated {{back to the}} July 30, 1994 episode of WWF Superstars of Wrestling. Backlund {{believed}} that he had won the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Hart. The match had not ended, however, and Hart pinned Backlund. When Hart tried to shake Backlund's hand after the match, Backlund slapped {{him in the face}} and locked him in a crossface chickenwing. After that Backlund began acting in a completely different manner than he had before, demanding respect from his fellow wrestlers insisting that they call him [...] "Mr. Backlund" [...] and using the crossface chickenwing, a hold he said was unbreakable, on them if they did not adhere to his wishes. He claimed that he had never truly been beaten for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship on December 26, 1983, as the match ended when his manager, Arnold Skaaland, threw a towel into the ring rather than allowing Backlund to submit to The Iron Sheik's camel clutch. Playing off of this, a rematch between Hart and Backlund was signed for Survivor Series. The match was signed as a submission match, but with the stipulation that the only way for a wrestler to win was to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> person throw in a towel. Since this required a wrestler to have a cornerman, each of the participants chose one. The challenger chose Owen Hart, while the champion went with Davey Boy Smith.|$|E

500|$|The French translation, {{published}} in 1752, contained an experiment {{suggesting that a}} long, pointed iron rod would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud. In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed iron rod high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity. Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the iron rod. In London it was repeated in Spital Square on July 20, 1752, and again in Chelmsford, Essex, on August 12, 1752. The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the kite experiment that he talked about {{in a letter to}} Collinson dated October 19, 1752. A {{man by the name of}} G. W. Richman was killed in 1753 from electrocution doing the kite experiment. Franklin had proven that lightning bolts and electricity were one and the same. He also showed that this [...] "electric fluid" [...] was attracted to a sharply pointed object high in the sky. An iron rod could <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> end put into the ground to create a path for safe conduction of the high voltage electricity. Thus, a way of diverting lightning bolts from wooden buildings [...] and preventing them from going aflame due to lightning hits [...] had been discovered. Franklin's lightning conductor invention, with its lightning rod uppermost point, became a model for the lightning-protection system used in America in the eighteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|Another way to {{understand}} {{the solution is to}} consider the two original unchosen doors together (Adams 1990; Devlin 2003, 2005; Williams 2004; Stibel et al., 2008).

The switch in this case clearly gives the player a [...] probability of choosing the car.|$|E

According to Kenneth Katzman of the Congressional Research Service, [...] "Oman has {{a tradition of}} cooperation with Iran dating back to the Shah of Iran’s regime and Oman has always been less alarmed by the perceived threat from Iran than <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> Gulf states." [...] Unlike the majority of its Gulf neighbors, Oman managed to uphold diplomatic relations with both sides during the Iran-Iraq war from 1980-1988 and strongly supported UN Security Council resolutions to end the conflict. Secret cease-fire talks between the two adversaries were held in Muscat during the war, and although an agreement was never reached during these talks, they did reduce distrust on both sides. Moreover, after the war, Oman mediated talks to restore diplomatic ties between Iran and Saudi Arabia and Iran and the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|The 2011 Japanese Fukushima nuclear {{disaster}} {{has led some}} European energy officials to [...] "think twice about nuclear expansion". Switzerland has abandoned plans to replace its old nuclear reactors and will take the last one offline in 2034. Anti-nuclear opposition intensified in Germany. In the following months the government decided to shut down eight reactors immediately (August 6, 2011) and to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> nine off the grid {{by the end of}} 2022. Renewable energy in Germany is believed to be able to compensate for much of the loss. In September 2011 Siemens, which had been responsible for constructing all 17 of Germany's existing nuclear power plants, announced that it would exit the nuclear sector following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent changes to German energy policy. Chief executive Peter Loescher has supported the German government's planned energy transition to renewable energy technologies, calling it a [...] "project of the century" [...] and saying Berlin's target of reaching 35% renewable energy sources by 2020 was feasible.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1990, {{an equally}} {{contentious}} discussion of vos Savant's article {{took place in}} Cecil Adams's column The Straight Dope (Adams 1990). Adams initially answered, incorrectly, that the chances for the two remaining doors must each be one in two. After a reader wrote in to correct the mathematics of Adams's analysis, Adams agreed that mathematically he had been wrong. [...] "You pick door #1. Now you're offered this choice: open door #1, or open door #2 and door #3. In the latter case you keep the prize if it's behind either door. You'd rather have a two-in-three shot at the prize than one-in-three, wouldn't you? If you think about it, the original problem offers you basically the same choice. Monty is saying in effect: {{you can keep your}} one door or you can <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> two doors, one of which (a non-prize door) I'll open for you." [...] Adams did say the Parade version left critical constraints unstated, and without those constraints, the chances of winning by switching were not necessarily two out of three (e.g., it was not reasonable to assume the host always opens a door). Numerous readers, however, wrote in to claim that Adams had been [...] "right the first time" [...] and that the correct chances were one in two.|$|E

2500|$|If a 3-regular graph on {{a surface}} is 3-edge-colored, its dual graph forms a {{triangulation}} {{of the surface}} which is also edge colored (although not, in general, properly edge colored) {{in such a way}} that every triangle has one edge of each color. Other colorings and orientations of triangulations, with other local constraints on how the colors are arranged at the vertices or faces of the triangulation, may be used to encode several types of geometric object. For instance, rectangular subdivisions (partitions of a rectangular subdivision into smaller rectangles, with three rectangles meeting at every vertex) may be described combinatorially by a [...] "regular labeling", a two-coloring of the edges of a triangulation dual to the subdivision, with the constraint that the edges incident to each vertex form four contiguous subsequences, within each of which the colors are the same. This labeling is dual to a coloring of the rectangular subdivision itself in which the vertical edges have one color and the horizontal edges <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> color. Similar local constraints on the order in which colored edges may appear around a vertex may also be used to encode straight-line grid embeddings of planar graphs and three-dimensional polyhedra with axis-parallel sides. For each of these three types of regular labelings, the set of regular labelings of a fixed graph forms a distributive lattice that may be used to quickly list all geometric structures based on the same graph (such as all axis-parallel polyhedra having the same skeleton) or to find structures satisfying additional constraints.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, the {{referendum}} had re-opened the old feud between Chrétien and Martin with Chrétien taking {{the view that}} the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin simply could not be trusted on national unity because he was [...] "soft on nationalists" [...] and [...] "too eager to grant concessions to the provinces". In the weeks leading to {{the referendum}} on October 30, 1995, the federal government was seized with fear and panic as polls showing that under the leadership of Bouchard, the oui side was going to win. Further contributing to the demoralization of the no side was the open split that emerged when the chairman of the non committee, the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Daniel Johnson asked {{for the federal government to}} pass a constitutional amendment recognizing Quebec as a [...] "distinct society", a request that the [...] "hard federalist" [...] Chrétien flatly rejected. To assist the work of the no committee, Chrétien sent over some of his staffers from the PMO such as Dominic LeBlanc and Jean Carle to work on the non committee in Montreal. The federal Liberals from the PMO recalled that the Quebec Liberals on the non committee decidedly made them feel unwelcome and unwanted. Chrétien's Chief of Staff Jean Pelletier recalled: [...] "Relations were not good. We were frustrated, you know...And even the federal Liberals from Quebec were not welcome by the provincial Liberals, which I think is nuts". An additional problem for the no side occurred when the Gaullist president of France, Jacques Chirac, stated in a TV interview that France would not only recognize an independent Quebec at once, but also use its influence within the European Union to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> EU nations recognize Quebec as well, a statement that boosted support for the yes side. Such was Chrétien's alarm at Chirac's remark that the prime minister—who normally fiercely resented anything that smacked of American interference in Canadian internal affairs in the slightest—lobbied U.S. President Bill Clinton behind the scenes for an American statement in favor of a united Canada. Chrétien's efforts paid off, and Clinton not came out very strongly for the federalist side in a TV interview, but also stated that an independent Quebec would not automatically became a member of NAFTA as the yes side was claiming.|$|E
