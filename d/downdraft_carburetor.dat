50|$|The XZ550 was {{the first}} Yamaha model to feature automotive-style <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors</b> with the air cleaner box mounted atop the carburetors, as opposed to most motorcycles' sidedraft carburetors with their side-mounted air cleaners. While <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors</b> flow air into the engine more {{efficiently}} than sidedraft carburetors, {{the height of the}} carburetors and their airbox required Yamaha to design a large tunnel {{into the bottom of the}} gas tank. While the tank holds 17 liters(4.5 gallons) of fuel, it looks much larger thanks to the tunnel and suggests that the bike is top-heavy, which it is not.|$|R

50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1930s, <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors</b> were the most popular type for {{automotive}} use in the United States. In Europe, the sidedraft <b>carburetors</b> replaced <b>downdraft</b> as free space in the engine bay decreased {{and the use of}} the SU-type carburetor (and similar units from other manufacturers) increased. Some small propeller-driven aircraft engines still use the updraft carburetor design.|$|R
50|$|The Rayfield was an American {{automobile}} line manufactured from 1911 until 1915 by the Rayfield Motor Car Co. Dashboard-radiatored 18 hp fours and 22 hp sixes touring {{cars were}} built in Springfield, Illinois and a few cyclecars in Chrisman, Illinois. All featured popular Rayfield <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors.</b> Lack of capital and production experience led to financial failure.|$|R

Exports of this Corona proved popular in the USA and Europe, with increased engine performance and durability improvements over previous versions. In September 1967 alone, Toyota produced 80,000 cars, with 30,000 being Coronas.|$|E
5000|$|The Plymouth Cambridge was a {{full-size}} automobile, produced by Plymouth in 1951 through 1953. It represented Plymouth's medium model in its lineup.

50|$|The {{following}} is {{the list of}} initial products, with cylinder heads modified, but not originally designed by Cosworth, on Ford Kent engine cylinder blocks. The exceptions were Mk.XVII and MAE, which had intake port sleeves for <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors</b> brazed into the stock cast iron cylinder head, {{in place of the}} normal side draft ports, thus could be considered Cosworth designs.In addition to the above, Cosworth designed and provided the assembly work for Lotus Elan Special Equipment optional road engines with special camshafts and high compression pistons.|$|R
5000|$|The 1966 B1500/Proceed {{presented}} in October 1965 {{used the same}} 1,484 cc OHV I4 engine as its predecessor, with {{minor changes to the}} cylinder head and valves and the use of a <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> instead of the sidedraft unit used on the models sold between 1961 and 1965. The UA engine now produced [...] at 5200 rpm. The chassis was now called the [...] "BUD61"; it was longer than its predecessor and received new bodywork of a squarer design, and four headlights. In January 1971, a 1600 cc model with the chassis code BNA61 was introduced. This had [...] SAE in global markets; US brochures did not specify its power output and European importers claimed [...] DIN. In Japan, a minimum [...] (SAE gross) was claimed; the model was advertised in Japan as the [...] "GT-Truck".|$|E
5000|$|The final {{model of}} the above initial series was the MAE in 1965, when new rules were {{introduced}} in Formula 3 allowing up to [...] engines with 36mm intake restrictor plate. MAE used one barrel of a two barrel Weber IDA <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> with the other barrel blanked off. The domination of this engine was absolute as long as these regulations lasted until 1968. As Cosworth had a serious difficulty meeting the demand, the MAE was mainly sold as a kit. This experience led to the later FVA/DFV contract to be drawn where the responsibility of development rested with Cosworth, and the manufacturing right and responsibility rested with Ford. There also were some specially cast iron heads with similar dimensions to these brazed heads with Titanium alloy valve spring retainers called the 'Screamer Head' for MAE in later years.|$|E
5000|$|For 1984, the Pony {{came only}} with a 1439 cc (88ci) 4G33 engine inline-four, rated at 70hp (52kW) and 82 lb·ft (111 N·m) of torque. This engine was {{available}} with either a four-speed or five-speed manual or a three-speed automatic transmission. The 1238 cc (74ci) 4G36 engine was not available in Canada. This engine was retained across the line until 1986, after which only the 1597 cc (97ci) 4G32 engine (74 hp (55 kW), 93 lb·ft (126 N·m) torque) was available. In mid-1985, the door handles were blacked out, chrome {{was removed from the}} windshield wipers, and the [...] "HD" [...] badge was removed from the centre of the grille and replaced with the lettering [...] "Hyundai" [...] off to the left side. A 1.6-liter model 4G32 engine became available in 1985, with optional air conditioning.

5000|$|In 1933, Chrysler {{decided to}} catch up with Ford and Chevrolet with respect to engine {{cylinder}} count. The 190 cu in version of Chrysler's flathead-six engine was equipped with a <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetor</b> and installed in the new 1933 Plymouth PC, introduced on November 17, 1932. However, Chrysler had reduced the PC's wheelbase from 112 to 107 in, and the car sold poorly. By April 1933, the Dodge division's Model DP chassis, with a 112 in wheelbase, was put under the PC body with DP front fenders, hood, and radiator shell. The model designation was advanced to PD' and the car was marketed as the [...] "DeLuxe" [...] 1933 Plymouth. This car sold very well and is the 1933 model most commonly found in collections. The PC became the 'Standard Six'. It had been the 'Plymouth Six' at introduction, and was sold through to the end of 1933, but in much lower numbers. It is consequently in the minority in collectors' hands today. In 1937, Plymouth (along with the other Chrysler makes) added safety features such as flat dash boards with recessed controls and the back of the front seat padded for the rear seat occupants.The PC was shipped overseas to Sweden, Denmark, and the UK, as well as Australia. In the UK, it was sold as a 'Chrysler Kew', Kew Gardens being the location of the Chrysler factory outside London. The flathead six which started with the 1933 Model PC stayed in the Plymouth until the 1959 models.|$|E

5000|$|The Jensen S-type {{was a car}} {{built by}} Jensen Motors from 1936 until 1941 as both a saloon and a convertible. It was the firm's first volume {{production}} car, based on Ford motors from the United States, and chassis parts from Ford of Britain sourced through M B K Motors. The car was built on a steel chassis and used aluminium for the body panels. The car was sold with either a [...] or a [...] Ford Sidevalve V8 engine, equipped with two <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors,</b> Vertex ignition, and a Columbia overdrive rear axle. The cars were available in three body styles: 2-door convertible, 3-door tourer, and 4-door saloon.|$|R
50|$|The dohc Genesis engine {{has five}} valves per {{cylinder}} and <b>downdraft</b> <b>carburetors.</b> Yamaha adopted the 5-valve concept, using three intake valves and two exhaust valves per cylinder, because it allowed both excellent volumetric efficiency and high rpm. As designers began {{to appreciate the}} benefits of multi-valve layout, 4-valves-per-cylinder (and even 3-valves) became common. In a multivalve engine, maximum rpm {{is limited by the}} size of the largest valves: in a 3-valver, the exhaust valve is larger, and in a 4-valver, the inlet valves are larger. The significance of the five-valve engine compared to other multivalve configurations engines is that (like a 3-valver) there were more intake valves than exhaust ones; yet all valves were small and of very similar sizes and weights. There are diminishing returns: the benefits of increasing numbers of valves actually decrease after five-valves-per-cylinder.|$|R
