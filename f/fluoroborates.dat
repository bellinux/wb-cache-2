Using Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory, we have simulated the optical signatures of these <b>fluoroborates.</b> In particular, we have computed the 0 − 0 energies and shapes of both the absorption and the emission bands. To assess the importance of solvent effects three polarization schemes have been applied within the Polarizable Continuum Model: the linearresponse (LR), the corrected linear-response (cLR), and the state-specific (SS). We show that the SS approach is unable to yield consistent chemical trends for these challenging compounds that combine charge-transfer and cyanine characters.

40|$|A new {{treatment}} method for wastewater containing concentrated fluoride and <b>fluoroborate</b> ions by hydrothermal treatment were developed. The treatment is an earth-mimetic method to produce natural minerals by hydrothermal treat-ment with Ca(OH) 2 as a mineralizer. Results of various {{analyses of the}} precipitate indicated that the recovered minerals were Ca 2 B 2 O 5 H 2 O (parasibirskite) and CaF 2 (fluorite). By optimizing the conditions, {{it was possible to}} recover more than 98 percent of the boron and 99. 9 percent of the fluorine from model wastewater samples containing fluoride (7000 mgL 1) and <b>fluoroborate</b> (8000 mgL 1) ions. Moreover, in the case of <b>fluoroborate</b> ions, the present treatment simultaneously caused the decomposition of the <b>fluoroborate</b> ion, the formation of each minerals, and the preventation of redissolution of parasibirskite.

40|$|International audienceA review. Cyanine derivs., named {{from the}} Greek word kyanos meaning dark-blue, were {{discovered}} 150 {{years ago and}} remain {{one of the most}} widely used classes of org. dyes with contemporary applications in photog. (panchromatic emulsions), information storage (CD-R and DVD-R media) and biochem. (DNA and protein labeling) fields. Cyanine chromogens consist of a charged π-conjugated segment contg. an odd no. of sp 2 carbon atoms with the chain capped at the extremities by two electroneg. centers, typically nitrogen or oxygen atoms. Cyanines were characterized by a vanishing bond length alternation indicating nearly equal carbon-carbon bond lengths, as well as a very intense and sharp absorption band presenting a shoulder. This hallmark band undergoes a strong red shift when the chain is extended. This so-called vinyl shift is extremely large (∼ 100 nm for each pair of carbon atoms added in the π-conjugated path), making cyanines ideal building blocks for the design of devices with near-IR applications. Numerous cyanines also exhibit emission bands with large quantum yields. These exceptional optical properties explain why both canonical cyanines and the corresponding <b>fluoroborates</b> (e. g., boron-dipyrromethene, BODIPY) remain the focus of an ever-growing body of exptl. work. In turn, this popularity has stimulated quantum mech. studies aiming, on the one hand, at probing the specific electronic nature of cyanine dyes and, however, at helping to design new dyes. However, the adiabatic approxn. to time-dependent d. functional theory, the most widespread ab initio model for electronically excited states, fails to accurately reproduce the absorption spectra of cyanine derivs. : it yields a systematic and large underestimation of the exptl. wavelengths irresp. of the details of the computational protocol. In contrast, highly correlated wave function approaches provide accurate transition energies for model systems but are hardly applicable to real-life cyanines and BODIPY. Setting up a computationally tractable theor. protocol that provides both robust and accurate optical spectra for cyanine-based dyes is a major challenge that has only been taken up lately. In this Account, the authors compile the most recent advances in the field by considering both compact streptocyanines and large <b>fluoroborates.</b> For the former, the authors summarize the key results obtained with a large panel of theor. approaches, allowing the authors not only to understand the origin of the cyanine challenge but also to pinpoint the schemes presenting the most promising accuracy/effort ratio. For the latter, the authors show via selected examples how theor. models can be used to reproduce simultaneously exptl. band shapes and transition energies, thus paving the way to an efficient in silico design of new compds...|$|E

40|$|A new {{synthetic}} method, {{applicable to}} the preparation {{of a wide range}} of hydrazine derivatives, is described. This involves the diborane reduction of a hydrazone, or, more conveniently, the reductive-condensation of a hydrazine and the appropriate aldehyde (or ketone). The method gives high yields and provides a particularly simple route to the relatively inaccessible 1, 2 -disubstituted hydrazines bearing a different group on each nitrogen. The new method has also been applied to the preparation of 1, 2 -disubstituted hydrazines with the same group on both nitrogens (via the azine), the very rare 1, 2 -disubstituted hydrazines bearing a tert-butyl group, trisubstituted hydrazines and monosubstituted hydrazines. Application of the reaction to the preparation of diaziridines has also been investigated. A mechanism for the reduction, supported by the isolation of a boron-containing intermediate, is suggested. Some limitations of the procedure are discussed. A general i. r. method of distinguishing the isomeric disubstituted hydrazines, as stable salts, has been developed. This has the advantages of speed and simplicity over previous methods. The mass spectra of a series of monosubstituted hydrazines, a series of 1, 2 -disubstituted hydrazines and some 1 -benzoyl 2 -alkylhydrazines have been examined in detail. The spectra are generally dominated byα -cleavage processes and the compounds show a variety of interesting rearrangement reactions. The mass spectra of some 1, 1 -disubstituted hydrazines and some trisubstituted hydrazines have also been examined. Rearrangement processes occurring in the mass spectrum of tropylium fluoroborate have been examined. Similar rearrangements have been found in the spectrum of trityl fluoroborate and may be of general occurrence in the mass spectra of aromatic <b>fluoroborates.</b> Chemical shift values for some groups on hydrazine nitrogen are recorded and the results of tumour inhibitory tests on some hydrazines are also given...|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} were to {{determine}} the phytoavailability and phytotoxicity of hydrogen fluoride (HF) and <b>fluoroborate</b> (BF₄⁻) in solution when exposed {{to the root of}} the plant. As <b>fluoroborate</b> undergoes a slow hydrolysis to F and borate ions, the stability of BF₄⁻ under solution culture conditions was determined. <b>Fluoroborate</b> was found to have a zero order rate constant of 0. 0136 and took approximately 72 days to hydrolyse completely. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and oat (Avena sativa) plants were grown in dilute nutrient solutions which contained a range of activities of HF and BF₄⁻. Dry matter production of both tomato and oat plants grown in nutrient solutions were found to be restricted by increased activity of HF and BF₄⁻ in solution. Tomatoes were more sensitive to HF and BF₄⁻ than oats. Limitations to dry matter production coincided with increased uptake of F for F concentrations in tissue of both tomatoes and oats. Fluoride uptake of both HF and BF by tomatoes and oats was orders of magnitude higher compared to similar activities of other ionic species of F reported in previous studies. Possible mechanisms of uptake are discussed...|$|R

These compounds are Na[(UO 2) B 5 O 8 (OH) F]center dot H 2 O (NaUBOF- 1), K[(UO 2) B 5 O 8 (OH) F] (KUBOF- 1), K- 11 [(UO 2) (6) B 24 O 36 F 22) ](H 2 BO 3) (KUBOF- 2), Rb[(UO 2) B 5 O 8 (OH) F] (RbUBOF- 1), and Tl[(UO 2) B 5 O 8 (OH) F] (TlUBOF- 1). A new neptunium(VI) fluoroborate that is isotypic with NaUBOF- 1, Na[(NpO 2) B 5 O 8 (OH) F]center dot H 2 O (NaNpBOF- 1), was synthesized via the boric acid flux reaction of neptunium(VI) nitrate with sodium fluoride. These new actinide <b>fluoroborates</b> share a common structural motif consisting of a linear actinyl (U(Np) O- 2 (2 +)) cation surrounded by BO 3 triangles and BO 4 tetrahedra to create an U(Np) O- 8 hexagonal bipyramidal environment around uranium or neptunium. The borate anions bridge between actinyl units to create layers. B-F bonds were formed during the reactions to yield BO 3 F tetrahedral units. The BO 3 F tetrahedra and additional BO 3 triangles extend from the actinyl polyborate layers and are directed approximately perpendicular to the layers. A novel actinyl borate layered topology was found in K- 11 [(UO 2) (6) B 24 O 36 F 22) ](H 2 BO 3) (KUBOF- 2).

40|$|Borabox ligands {{proved to}} be {{efficient}} ligands for controlling the enantioselectivity of various metal-catalyzed reactions. Therefore modification of an existing borabox backbone was implemented and new borabox ligands modified on C(5) position of the oxazoline ring were prepared and tested in the copper-catalyzed asymmetric cyclopropanation. In this study high stereocontrol of the reaction was observed. However the presence of sterically demanding groups at position C(5) did not improve the results compared to the C(5) non-substituted analogs. The synthesis of analogous boron-bridged phosphino-oxazolines was attempted via several synthetic approaches in order to prepare new zwitterionic N,P-ligands. The simple stepwise substitution by subsequent addition of lithiated oxazoline and phosphine was not possible. It either led to borabox ligands or to undesired dimeric species, which were inert towards reaction with other nucleophiles. We decided to tune the electronic properties of the boron compound by variation of the substituents {{in order to avoid}} multiple substitution or undesired dimer formation. Therefore aminochloroborates were examined due to their lower reactivity compared to chloroboranes or chloroborates. A derivative with a phosphine-aminoborate backbone was prepared but unfortunately the decreased reactivity of the nitrogen-substituted boron center did not allow another nucleophilic addition of the oxazoline moiety. In order to avoid dimer formation the reactivity of potassium diaryldifluoroborates was investigated. These tetrasubstituted boron compounds reacted with lithium oxazolines and provided products of nucleophilic substitution at the boron center. The resulting oxazoline-substituted <b>fluoroborates</b> could be isolated as zwitterions after protonation of the oxazoline nitrogen atom. However, the second intended substitution with the phosphine moiety was not possible. In addition, quantum chemistry calculations were carried out to support the experimental studies. The synthesis of new NeoPHOX ligands derived from inexpensive chiral aminoacids L-serine and L-threonine was developed. These chiral ligands were tested in the iridium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation and palladium-catalyzed allylic substitution. In both reactions the enantioselectivities achieved were excellent for most of the substrates tested. In the iridium catalyzed hydrogenation it was found that presence of an acid-stable protecting group of tertiary alcohol (R 2) is necessary in order to achieve full conversions. The enantioselectivities obtained in the catalytic asymmetric hydrogenation and allylic substitution with the L-serine and L-threonine derived ligands were almost identical to those reported for tert-butyl- substituted NeoPHOX ligands, which are derived from very expensive amino acid tert- leucine. The use of Ir catalysts for the diastereoselective hydrogenation of Diels-Alder products was investigated. The best results were obtained with a pyridine-phosphinite complex that afforded the saturated cyclohexane derivatives with diastereoselectivities of up to 98 : 2 and full conversion. The reaction is strongly catalyst-controlled, so it is possible to obtain each of the two diastereomeric products with high selectivity using either (R) - or (S) -catalyst. ...|$|E
