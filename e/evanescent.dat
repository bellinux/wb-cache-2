5|$|An {{alternative}} approach to designing smaller waveguide filters {{was provided by}} the use of non-propagating <b>evanescent</b> modes. Jaynes and Edson proposed <b>evanescent</b> mode waveguide filters in the late 1950s. Methods for designing these filters were created by Craven and Young in 1966. Since then, <b>evanescent</b> mode waveguide filters have seen successful use where waveguide size or weight are important considerations.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{updated version}} of the <b>evanescent</b> field optical {{tweezers}} makes use of extended optical landscape patterns to simultaneously guide {{a large number of}} particles into a preferred direction without using a waveguide. It is termed as Lensless Optical Trapping (“LOT”). The orderly movement of the particles is aided by the introduction of Ronchi Ruling that creates well-defined optical potential wells (replacing the waveguide). This means that particles are propelled by the <b>evanescent</b> field while being trapped by the linear bright fringes. At the moment, there are scientists working on focused <b>evanescent</b> fields as well.|$|E
25|$|In optical tweezers, a {{continuous}} <b>evanescent</b> field {{can be created}} when light is propagating through an optical waveguide (multiple total internal reflection). The resulting <b>evanescent</b> field has a directional sense and will propel microparticles along its propagating path. This work was first pioneered by S. Kawata and T. Sugiura, in 1992, who showed that the field can be coupled to the particles in proximity {{on the order of}} 100 nanometers.|$|E
25|$|The <b>evanescent</b> field {{can also}} be used to trap cold atoms and {{molecules}} near the surface of an optical waveguide or optical nanofiber.|$|E
25|$|Still's disease (AOSD) is a rheumatic {{disorder}} of unknown etiology {{characterized by a}} triad of fever, polyarthritis and <b>evanescent</b> rash. An idiopathic case has been reported with celiac disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{waveguide}} {{analysis shows}} that the light energy in the fiber is not completely confined in the core. Instead, especially in single-mode fibers, a significant fraction of the energy in the bound mode travels in the cladding as an <b>evanescent</b> wave.|$|E
25|$|The {{important}} contribution of Jeffreys, Wentzel, Kramers and Brillouin to the method was {{the inclusion of}} the treatment of turning points, connecting the <b>evanescent</b> and oscillatory solutions at either side of the turning point. For example, this may occur in the Schrödinger equation, due to a potential energy hill.|$|E
25|$|At one moment, indeed, Charles (then in Bewdley) rose to {{the idea}} of marching north to join Rupert and Newcastle, but he soon made up his mind to return to Oxford. From Bewdley, therefore, he moved to Buckingham, the distant threat on London, {{producing}} another <b>evanescent</b> citizen army drawn from six counties under Major-General Browne. Waller followed him closely. When the King turned upon Browne's motley host, Waller appeared in time to avert disaster, and the two armies worked away to the upper Cherwell.|$|E
25|$|A {{difficult}} question is if domesticated horses were first ridden or driven. While the most unequivocal evidence shows horses first {{being used to}} pull chariots in warfare, there is strong, though indirect, evidence for riding occurring first, particularly by the Botai. Bit wear may correlate to riding, though, as the modern hackamore demonstrates, horses can be ridden without a bit by using rope and other <b>evanescent</b> materials to make equipment that fastens around the nose. So the absence of unequivocal evidence of early riding in the record does not settle the question.|$|E
25|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Leucocoprinus birnbaumii are agaricoid (mushroom-shaped) and occur singly {{or in small}} clumps. All parts are bright, pale sulphur-yellow, but fade with age. When young, the cap is usually taller than broad, later {{becoming}} convex and around 20–60mm (1–2.5in) across. The cap surface is smooth but dotted with fine, easily detached scales, and often develops shallow, radial grooves near the margin. The gills are free (not attached to the stem) and are covered by a partial veil when young, which ruptures to leave a fragile, <b>evanescent</b> ring on the stem. Microscopically, the species is distinguished by its thick-walled, ellipsoid spores that are dextrinoid, have a germ pore, and measure around 8–12 by 5–9 μm.|$|E
25|$|Hugh J. Schonfield, in the {{controversial}} The Passover Plot and other works, saw {{evidence that the}} source of this Gospel was the Beloved Disciple of the Last Supper and further that this person, perhaps named John, was a senior Temple priest and so probably a member of the Sanhedrin. This would account for the knowledge of and access to the Temple which would not have been available to rough fishermen and followers of a disruptive rural preacher from the Galilee, one who was being accused of heresy besides. And probably for the <b>evanescent</b> presence of the Beloved Disciple in the events of Jesus' Ministry. On this reading, the Gospel was written, perhaps by a student and follower of this Disciple in his last advanced years, perhaps at Patmos.|$|E
500|$|<b>Evanescent</b> modes are modes {{below the}} cutoff frequency. [...] They cannot {{propagate}} down the waveguide for any distance, dying away exponentially. [...] However, {{they are important}} in the functioning of certain filter components such as irises and posts, described later, because energy is stored in the <b>evanescent</b> wave fields.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} to design filters that operate internally entirely in <b>evanescent</b> modes. [...] This has space saving advantages because the filter waveguide, which often forms the housing of the filter, {{does not need to}} be large enough to support propagation of the dominant mode. [...] Typically, an <b>evanescent</b> mode filter consists of a length of waveguide smaller than the waveguide feeding the input and output ports. [...] In some designs this may be folded to achieve a more compact filter. [...] Tuning screws are inserted at specific intervals along the waveguide producing equivalent lumped capacitances at those points. [...] In more recent designs the screws are replaced with dielectric inserts. [...] These capacitors resonate with the preceding length of <b>evanescent</b> mode waveguide which has the equivalent circuit of an inductor, thus producing a filtering action. [...] Energy from many different <b>evanescent</b> modes is stored in the field around each of these capacitive discontinuities. [...] However, the design is such that only the dominant mode reaches the output port; the other modes decay much more rapidly between the capacitors.|$|E
500|$|Irises are {{a form of}} {{discontinuity}} {{and work}} by exciting <b>evanescent</b> higher modes. [...] Vertical edges are parallel to the electric field (E field) and excite TE modes. [...] The stored energy in TE modes is predominately in the magnetic field (H field), and consequently the lumped equivalent of this structure is an inductor. [...] Horizontal edges are parallel to the H field and excite TM modes. [...] In this case the stored energy is predominately in the E field and the lumped equivalent is a capacitor.|$|E
500|$|In 1881, O'Connell {{published}} Lyrics, a book {{of poetry}} evincing a [...] "Celtic strain." [...] The poetry displays O'Connell's sense of sunt lacrimae rerum, {{that there will be}} tears with trials, and it expresses his bittersweet joy in life's <b>evanescent</b> pleasures. O'Connell wrote an Irish-themed play, The Red Fox, which was staged with moderate success in San Francisco about 1882. O'Connell wrote [...] "Ghoul's Quest" [...] for The Argonaut. In 1891, he published The Inner Man: Good Things to Eat and Drink and Where to Get Them, a collection of anecdotes and advice for the epicurean who finds himself in the San Francisco area, and a cautionary description of common 19th century food adulterants such as chemical dyes and powdered lead.|$|E
500|$|On {{the day of}} Clark's departure, April 16, 1877, {{students}} and faculty of SAC rode with him {{as far as the}} village of Shimamatsu, then [...] outside of Sapporo. As recalled by one of the students, Masatake Oshima, after saying his farewells, Clark shouted, [...] "Boys, be ambitious!" [...] Several differing versions of Clark's parting words persist today including, [...] "Boys, be ambitious, like this old man!" [...] and, [...] "Boys, be ambitious for Christ!" [...] A painting of Clark's departure, rendered in 1971, hangs in the Prefectural Capitol building in Sapporo and includes a lengthier version of his parting words, [...] "Boys, be ambitious! Be ambitious not for money or for selfish aggrandizement, not for that <b>evanescent</b> thing which men call fame. Be ambitious for that attainment of all that a man ought to be." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s and 1980s, the Supreme Court {{revisited}} {{questions about}} the constitutionality of involuntary bodily intrusions in several key cases. In 1973, the Court ruled in Cupp v. Murphy {{that the police were}} permitted to extract a tissue sample from underneath a suspect’s fingernails to recover [...] "evanescent" [...] physical evidence. The suspect in Cupp was suspected of strangling his wife and voluntarily went to a police station to answer questions. Officers noticed bloodstains under the suspect’s fingernails and detained him, but did not place him under arrest. Against the suspect’s wishes, the police scraped out a tissue sample from under his fingernails to retrieve the evidence. The biological material found under the suspect’s fingernails was later found to have come from the victim. Citing Schmerber, the Court held that this warrantless search was justified under the exigent circumstances exemption of the Fourth Amendment because the search was necessary to preserve the “highly <b>evanescent</b> evidence” under the defendant’s fingernails.|$|E
500|$|The {{deliberately}} non-linear, enigmatic and cryptic {{style of}} the music video was intended to stimulate the imaginations of its viewers and their interpretations of the music video." [...] Miyazaki offered {{an interpretation of the}} angel as [...] "Hope" [...] and to protect hope could paradoxically mean [...] "to let it go where no-one can touch it". Dani Cavallaro, an author of books related to anime, reflected on this by proposing that hope retains its purity and authenticity when it is ephemeral, <b>evanescent</b> and elusive. Hope may cause exertion and possibly pain, but denying hope is to deny the feasibility or and vision it provides. Miyazaki said that in the music video's setting, humans live in an underground city after the surface of the Earth has been contaminated with radiation, creating a sanctuary for nature. Miyazaki did not find this believable, though, as humanity would suffer on the surface instead. Miyazaki intentionally misinterpreted the lyrics to reflect upon the vision of a world filled with disease and radiation and people's reactions to that world. Cryptically, he implied the two policemen {{might not be able to}} return to their old life, but offered no reason as to why.|$|E
500|$|Carl Swanson of New York {{magazine}} was {{amazed by the}} ArtRave, from the Volantis display to the actual party area, and added that [...] " [...] event, mostly staged for Gaga's cameras {{as well as those}} of the feverishly Instagramming guests, was surprisingly well organized for something so manifestly difficult. The idea was clearly to be in control of it." [...] However, he noticed a bit of [...] "vulnerability" [...] in Gaga as she performed onstage. Swanson relegated Gaga's lectures about Koons and their collaboration as [...] "borderline gibberish", adding that: [...] "It's less of a collaboration than a feeling that she is searching to attach herself to something bigger than herself, something less <b>evanescent</b> than pop, or maybe just something to contain herself before she flames out completely, like a hashtag in the wind." [...] Kia Makarechi of The Huffington Post was critical of the set up when Gaga had to wade through a crowd to reach the stage, but wrote that [...] "nce Gaga took the stage, however, all was nearly forgotten. The singer worked through the new album with an impressive commitment to weirdness." [...] Nick Murray of Spin magazine criticized the [...] "underwhelming display" [...] of Volantis and found that Gaga's ideas about [...] "changing the world" [...] with the album and the technology were [...] "both dry and ridiculous, vaguely utopian but overly confident in the liberating power of technology, and just when the whole thing was beginning to seem more and more like a farce, [...] cannily explained that beyond whether the Volantis is ever mass-produced, 'the important thing is about the possibilities'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{optical fiber}} transmission, <b>evanescent</b> waves are surface waves.|$|E
2500|$|An <b>evanescent</b> field [...] is a residue {{optical field}} that [...] "leaks" [...] during total {{internal}} reflection. This [...] "leaking" [...] of light fades off at an exponential rate. The <b>evanescent</b> field {{has found a}} number of applications in nanometer resolution imaging (microscopy); optical micromanipulation (optical tweezers) are becoming ever more relevant in research.|$|E
2500|$|However, an {{analysis}} by Herbert G. Winful from the University of Michigan suggests that the Hartman effect cannot actually be used to violate relativity by transmitting signals faster than c, because the tunnelling time [...] "should not be linked to a velocity since <b>evanescent</b> waves do not propagate". The <b>evanescent</b> waves in the Hartman effect are due to virtual particles and a non-propagating static field, as mentioned in the sections above for gravity and electromagnetism.|$|E

By patterning the surface with gold microscopic islands it is possible to have selective and parallel trapping in these islands. The forces of the latter optical tweezers lie in the femtonewton range.|$|E
2500|$|One {{difference}} between dielectric and metal waveguides {{is that at}} a metal surface the electromagnetic waves are tightly confined; at high frequencies the electric and magnetic fields penetrate a very short distance into the metal. [...] In contrast, {{the surface of the}} dielectric waveguide is an interface between two dielectrics, so the fields of the wave penetrate outside the dielectric {{in the form of an}} <b>evanescent</b> (non-propagating) wave.|$|E
2500|$|The 2010 BBC Proms {{premiere of}} Latent Manifest {{performed}} by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Litton, was widely reviewed in London: [...] personal canvas, taking us {{a long way from}} a literal reworking into the realms of <b>evanescent</b> fantasy, with delicately evocative results (The Guardian, London), ...a beguiling response to response itself – a mirage of intimations and allusions to [...] own experience of hearing Bach’s third solo Violin Sonata (The Times, London), a gracefully-controlled meditation on a single Bach phrase (The Independent, London).|$|E
2500|$|Although a {{particle}} hypothetically behaving {{as a point}} mass would be reflected, {{a particle}} actually behaving as a matter wave has a finite probability that it will penetrate the barrier and continue its travel as a wave on the other side. In classical wave-physics, this effect is known as <b>evanescent</b> wave coupling. [...] The likelihood that the particle will pass through the barrier is given by the transmission coefficient, whereas the likelihood that it is reflected is given by the reflection coefficient. [...] Schrödinger's wave-equation allows these coefficients to be calculated.|$|E

2500|$|Buechner's {{combination}} of literary style with approachable, universally applicable subject matter has, {{to many of}} his fans, revolutionized contemporary Christian literature: [...] "In my view, Buechner is doing a distinctively new thing on the literary scene, writing novels that are theologically exciting without becoming propaganda, and doing theology with artistic style and imagination." [...] Buechner's earliest works, written before his entrance into Union Theological Seminary, were hailed as profoundly literary works, notable for their dense, descriptive style. Of his first novel, A Long Day's Dying, David Daiches wrote: [...] "There is a quality of civilized perception here, a sensitive and plastic handling of English prose {{and an ability to}} penetrate to the <b>evanescent</b> core of a human situation, all proclaiming major talent."

2500|$|The concept behind {{resonant}} {{inductive coupling}} is that high Q factor resonators exchange energy {{at a much}} higher rate than they lose energy due to internal damping.

[...] Resonant inductive coupling can achieve high efficiency at ranges of 4 to 10 times the coil diameter (Dant). [...] This is called [...] "mid-range" [...] transfer, in contrast to the [...] "short range" [...] of nonresonant inductive transfer, which can achieve similar efficiencies only when the coils are adjacent. [...] Another advantage is that resonant circuits interact with each other so much more strongly than they do with nonresonant objects that power losses due to absorption in stray nearby objects are negligible.|$|E
