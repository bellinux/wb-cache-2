40|$|How can {{rational}} {{political actors}} maximize their interests when bargaining through representatives? This project challenges the conventional argument of the canonical principalagent and rationalist international relations (IR) bargaining literatures, {{arguing that the}} importance of constraining representatives’ actions and choices varies {{depending on the type of}} bargaining process in which they are involved. I argue that in “cooperative bargaining processes”, giving representatives a high degree of autonomy will lead to the maximization of interests. On the other hand, in more “competitive bargaining processes”, constraining one’s representatives will lead to the maximization of interests in decision-making outcomes. Using original interview evidence with member state representatives in COREPER, I demonstrate that agent autonomy is crucial for the ability of <b>deputy</b> and <b>permanent</b> <b>representatives</b> to forward the interests of their principals – the various ministries of their member state – within a cooperative bargaining process...|$|R
