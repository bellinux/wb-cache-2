Results - A syndrome characterised by affective blunting and insidious and early onset of illness, non-specifically predicted psychosis in the first-degree relatives, whereas a manic syndrome specifically predicted affective psychosis in the relatives. No other main effects were observed, but there were interactions with proband diagnosis: a syndrome characterised by bizarre behaviour, inappropriate affect, catatonia and poor rapport predicted psychosis in relatives of schizophrenic probands, and a syndrome of <b>depressive</b> symptoms predicted <b>psychosis</b> in relatives of schizoaffective probands.

40|$|Background: Sleep is {{a complex}} yet vital process {{essential}} for energy, productivity and emotional balance. Sleep disruption has significant implications for an individual’s health, wellbeing and occupational performance. Sleep disruption is linked to many psychiatric conditions including First Episode Psychosis (FEP). Early recognition and subsequent treatment of FEP can reduce the social and occupational disruption with which it is associated. Objectives: The research aimed to explore {{the relationship between the}} clinical characteristics of FEP and the occupation of sleep. Methods: Secondary data analysis was carried out on anonymised information previously gathered by early intervention service, DETECT. No participants were recruited. Data originated from symptom measurement instruments administered as part of standard protocol. Mann Whitney U and Chi square testing were used to identify any correlations between clinical characteristics and sleep. Results: Almost half (47 %) of the FEP cohort reported dissatisfaction with sleep. There {{was no significant difference between}} those who were satisfied and those who were dissatisfied with sleep in terms of duration of untreated <b>psychosis,</b> <b>depressive</b> symptoms and positive symptoms. In contrast it was identified that sleep was associated with negative symptoms, anxiety and overall quality of life. Conclusion: This study compliments previous findings that sleep disturbance affects an individual’s occupational performance. The impact of sleep on first episode psychosis is multidimensional affecting anxiety levels, negative symptom severity and quality of life. These findings are congruent with literature outside of occupational therapy but further studies examining the effect of sleep on FEP or other conditions would strengthen the evidence base...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} of an association between negative social comparisons (NSC) and both psychosis, and psychosis proneness. The majority of the work thus far, however, has focused largely on one type of NSC, namely, social rank. Whilst social rank is clearly an important factor, an individual’s perception of belonging is likely also of importance; particularly, when considering individuals from collectivistic cultures such as China, where greater {{emphasis is placed on}} fitting into the group. There is also limited research investigating what factors may contribute towards the relationship between NSC and psychosis proneness, and to what extent this relationship may be due to common familial factors. To address these issues, we examined whether 1) Social rank and perceived belonging predict negative, positive and depressive psychotic experiences in a Chinese, adolescent, twin and sibling population, 2) coping styles moderate the impact of these relationships and 3), there is a familial association between NSC and psychosis proneness. Both social rank and perceived belonging were found to predict the negative and <b>depressive</b> dimensions of <b>psychosis.</b> These relationships were moderated by problem-focused coping styles. Interestingly, the association between perception of belonging, and negative psychotic experiences was familial—and stronger in Monozygotic twins—indicating perhaps shared aetiology due to common genes. Our findings highlight NSC as potential vulnerability markers for negative and depressive psychotic experiences, and suggest potentially different aetiological pathways amongst different NSC and different psychotic experiences. On a clinical level, our findings emphasize the need to consider coping styles when treating at-risk individuals...|$|R
40|$|Child maltreatment {{has been}} {{associated}} {{with a wide range of}} mental disorders in adulthood. Whether child maltreatment is specifically associated with psychosis risk in individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) for psychosis, or leads to a general vulnerability for overall psychopathology in the UHR stage remains unclear. The present study examines the association between child maltreatment and transition to psychosis and other mental disorders. The sample consisted of 259 UHR individuals from the EUropean network of national schizophrenia networks studying Gene-Environment Interactions (EU-GEI) study. Participants were followed-up for 2 years to assess clinical outcome. Clinical outcome was assessed at 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after baseline. Child maltreatment before the age of 17 years was assessed at baseline. Our findings show that a history of emotional abuse was associated with an increased risk for transition to psychosis (OR = 3. 78, 95 % CI = 1. 17 to 12. 39, P =. 027). Apart from psychosis, a history of physical abuse was associated with depressive disorder (OR = 4. 92, 95 % CI = 2. 12 to 11. 39, P =. 001), post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 2. 06, 95 % CI = 1. 10 to 3. 86, P =. 023), panic disorder (OR = 2. 00, 95 % CI = 1. 00 to 3. 99, P =. 048) and social phobia (OR = 2. 47, 95 % CI = 1. 18 to 5. 16, P =. 016) at follow-up.

40|$|This journal suppl. entitled: Abstracts of the 4 th Biennial Schizophrenia International Research ConferencePoster presentationConference theme: Fostering Collaboration in Schizophrenia ResearchBACKGROUND: Psychosis proneness {{refers to}} {{psychotic}} events experienced at sub-threshold level, {{and can be}} regarded as representing one part of the continuum that extends from normal daily experiences to clinical symptoms. Poor social cognition and low self-esteem are identified predictors of schizophrenia and possibly psychosis proneness. In light of this, the current study aimed to verify the predictive power of self-esteem, perceived social standing and speech illusion on psychosis proneness in a Chinese population and to verify the relationship between the three. It was hypothesized that self-esteem mediates the effect of perceived social standing on psychosis proneness. METHODS: 100 Chinese participants aged 15 to 21 were recruited in Beijing and Hong Kong (52 males, Mean age = 18. 92, SD = 2. 05). All participants were healthy without existing significant medical condition or mental illnesses and underwent a procedure that included three self-report questionnaires and a computerized task. More specifically, the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE) was administered to measure the frequency and distress of positive, negative and <b>depressive</b> symptoms (<b>psychosis</b> proneness). The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) was used to measure individual’s self-esteem. All 10 items were rated on a four-point scale in which a higher score reflected a higher global self-esteem. The Social Comparison Scale (SCS) measured relative social standing using a semantic differential methodology on 11 bipolar constructs. Finally, speech illusion was assessed by the White Noise Task (Galdos et al. (2011)). In this task sentences were embedded in white noise to compose three types of stimuli (i) noise, (ii) clearly audible sentence and (iii) barely audible sentences. Participants responded by indicating them as (1) positive, (2) negative, (3) neutral, (4) no speech, or (5) uncertain for each of the 75 recordings. RESULTS: Participants showed more negative and depressive psychotic symptoms than positive symptoms in general. Low self-esteem and low perceived social standing predicted higher psychosis proneness, more negative and depressive symptoms (self-esteem: all ps< 0. 001; perceived social standing: ps= 0. 027, 0. 005, 0. 001). Further, the effect of perceived social standing on psychosis proneness was completely mediated through self-esteem (p< 0. 001). Nevertheless, no significant correlation was found between speech illusion with other variables. DISCUSSION: The results suggest that low self-esteem and perceived social standing are possible risk indicators of psychosis. The complete mediating effect of self-esteem on the association between perceived social standing and psychosis proneness suggests that poor self-judgments based on internalized social information may intensify one’s vulnerability in developing psychosis. Self-esteem and perceived social standing may add to the list of cognitive markers of psychosis identified so that at-risk individuals could be identified more effectively in the pre-morbid stage...|$|R

They again play very heavy music, close to sympho-rock, though it is always difficult to describe their music.

40|$|Abstract Background People with {{long-term}} serious mental illness live with severe and debilitating symptoms that can negatively influence {{their health and}} quality of life, leading to outcomes such as premature mortality, morbidity and obesity. An interplay of social, behavioural, biological and psychological factors is likely to contribute to their poor physical health. Participating in regular physical activity could bring symptomatic improvements, weight loss benefits, enhanced wellbeing and when undertaken in a community-based group setting can yield additional, important social support benefits. Yet poor uptake of physical activity by people with serious mental illness is a problem. This review will systematically search, appraise and synthesise the existing evidence that has explored the experience of community-based physical activity initiation and key features of social support within these contexts by adults with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major <b>depressive</b> disorder or <b>psychosis</b> using the meta-ethnography approach. This new understanding may be key in designing more acceptable and effective community-based group PA programmes that meet patients’ need and expectations. Methods This will be a systematic review of qualitative studies using the meta-ethnography approach. The following databases will be searched: ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Health Technology Assessment Database, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. Grey literature will also be sought. Eligible studies will use qualitative methodology; involve adults (≥ 18  years) with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder or psychosis; will report community-based group physical activity; and capture the experience of physical activity initiation and key features of social support {{from the perspective of}} the participant. Study selection and assessment of quality will be performed by two reviewers. Data will be extracted by one reviewer, tabled, and checked for accuracy by the second reviewer. The meta-ethnography approach by Noblit and Hare (Meta-ethnography: synthesizing qualitative studies 11, 1988) will be used to synthesise the data. Discussion This systematic review is expected to provide new insights into the experience of community-based group physical activity initiation for adults who have a serious mental illness to inform person-centred improvements to the management of serious mental illness through physical activity.

Participating in regular physical activity could bring symptomatic improvements, weight loss benefits, enhanced wellbeing and when undertaken in a community-based group setting can yield additional, important social support benefits. Yet poor uptake of physical activity by people with serious mental illness is a problem. This review will systematically search, appraise and synthesise the existing evidence that has explored the experience of community-based physical activity initiation and key features of social support within these contexts by adults with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major <b>depressive</b> disorder or <b>psychosis</b> using the meta-ethnography approach. This new understanding may be key in designing more acceptable and effective community-based group PA programmes that meet patients’ need and expectations. Methods This will be a systematic review of qualitative studies using the meta-ethnography approach. The following databases will be searched: ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, Health Technology Assessment Database, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Sociological Abstracts, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science. Grey literature will also be sought. Eligible studies will use qualitative methodology; involve adults (≥ 18 years) with schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, major depressive disorder or psychosis; will report community-based group physical activity; and capture the experience of physical activity initiation and key features of social support {{from the perspective of}} the participant. Study selection and assessment of quality will be performed by two reviewers. Data will be extracted by one reviewer, tabled, and checked for accuracy by the second reviewer. The meta-ethnography approach by Noblit and Hare [1] will be used to synthesise the data. Discussion This systematic review is expected to provide new insights into the experience of community-based group physical activity initiation for adults who have a serious mental illness to inform person-centred improvements to the management of serious mental illness through physical activity.

Guidelines recommend initiating AD therapy through initiation phase (3 months of therapy), and continuation phase (6 months beyond initiation phase), with a recommended total duration of 9 months of therapy. Even at the minimal recommended duration of therapy (6 months), it is estimated that only 12 - 34 % of patients remain adherent to AD therapy, increasing the chance of relapse back into the depressive episode and resource utilization. Further research on A&P is warranted due to lack of estimates for new AD therapy and incomparability among existing findings. Methods: To date, this was the largest US insurance claims analysis conducted of A&P to initial AD therapy. Truven Marketscan® Commercial, Medicare, and Medicaid databases were queried for MDD patients between the years 2003 - 2014. Qualifying MDD diagnoses for inclusion included either one inpatient, or one outpatient service claim with a second confirmatory claim (either inpatient or outpatient), after ensuring 6 months of negative MDD diagnosis and AD prescription history. Patients with a diagnosis of other mental disorders (Schizophrenia, Bipolar, Alzheimer’s, Dementia, <b>depressive</b> type <b>psychosis,</b> or other mood disorders) were excluded if diagnosed from 6 months before to 12 months after the IDD. 527, 907 patients were identified who initiated therapy with one AD within 60 days of a qualifying MDD diagnosis and had continuous insurance coverage from 6 months before to 12 months after this index AD prescription date (IPD). A&P was calculated to initial AD medication, to initial therapeutic class, and overall, to any AD therapy, over the first 3, 6, 9, and 12 months from the IPD, using Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) /Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) and days to discontinuation, respectively. Adherence to continuation phase, or adherence between 4 - 9 months, was calculated similarly. The proportion adherent was defined as the proportion whose MPR/PDC was {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 80, where the proportion persistent was defined as the proportion remaining persistent over the time frame. Chi-squared testing was used to test differences in the proportion adherent or persistent, when grouped by initial AD or comparing proportions over time. Odds ratios of adherence comparing initial ADs to sertraline were estimated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the IPD through multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, insurance source, region, insurance plan type, MDD diagnosis code, Charlson Comorbidity Index, and comorbid anxiety or chronic pain disorders. In a separate logistic model adjusted for the same covariates, the odds ratio of adherence to continuation phase among those adherent/not adherent to initiation phase was estimated. Results: The proportion adherent to initial AD medication over time frames was 0. 43 / 0. 41 (MPR/PDC) at 3 months, and 0. 23 / 0. 21 at 12 months (p value< 0. 0001). The proportion persistent to initial AD medication was 0. 44 at 3 months and 0. 17 at 12 months (p value< 0. 0001). A&P to initial therapeutic class and overall, to any AD therapy was slightly higher than to initial AD medication, yet each measure similarly decreased over time (p value< 0. 0001). For each logistic regression for the primary model, association of initial AD and adherence to the time frame was found to be significant (p value < 0. 0001). Compared to sertraline, patients initiating with desvenlafaxine, duloxetine, and venlafaxine XR had greater odds of adherence at 6 months (adjusted odds ratios of 1. 30, 1. 07, and 1. 19, respectively; p values all < 0. 0001). In a separate logistic model, adherence to the first 3 months of treatment was associated with adherence to continuation phase, or months 4 - 9 (p value< 0. 0001). Patients who were adherent to the first 3 months of therapy had 13. 7 times greater odds of adherence to continuation phase, when adjusted for covariates (95 % Confidence Interval 13. 4 - 14. 0). Conclusion: Results support that the choice of initial AD is an important clinical decision, associated with A&P, and thus, has the potential to improve clinical outcomes and decrease resource utilization...|$|R
