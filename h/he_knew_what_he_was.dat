5|$|His {{work on the}} X-Men {{franchise}} {{would continue}} {{with a number of}} covers for The New Mutants and The Uncanny X-Men in 1986 and 1987, respectively. He also drew all but three of the first 23 covers and interior frontispieces to Classic X-Men from 1986 to 1988. His interior X-Men-related work included a two-issue run on X-Factor and the one-shot , both in 1989, and three Uncanny X-Men Annuals, in 1986, 1988 and 1990. It was in drawing the 1988 annual that Adams says he felt like a professional comic book artist for the first time, as he first felt confident that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E
500|$|Jasmyn Burke and Morgan Waters, {{who first}} met {{each other in}} a bar, started Weaves in 2012 when the two made demo songs based on files of song ideas Burke {{recorded}} on her iPhone. In 2013, bassist Zach Bines and drummer Spencer Cole joined the project and started recording their self-titled debut EP immediately after. [...] "Motorcycle", [...] "Take A Dip", [...] "Do You See Past" [...] and [...] "Hulahoop" [...] were produced by Waters in his bedroom using Garageband, while [...] "Buttercup" [...] and [...] "Closer" [...] was produced by David Newfeld in his church studio of Dobbstown North. Waters described Newfeld's production contributions as [...] "music lessons and artist lessons in a way," [...] given that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> making. He also said, [...] "That open mindedness and visibility to capture what happens in the moment and allow mistakes and encourage them brings you out of your comfort zone." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Disease of the mind" [...] is not {{a medical}} term; it instead means that the {{defendant}} must show {{he was suffering from}} a disease which affected the functioning of the mind, which does not necessarily have to be a disease of the brain. This was confirmed in the case of R v Kemp [...] 1 QB 399, where the defendant's arteriosclerosis led to him assaulting his wife while unconscious. It must then be shown that this disease of the mind led to a [...] "defect of reason"; that the defendant's ability to reason was impaired by the disease. Alternately, the defendant can try to show {{that he did not know}} [...] "the nature or quality of his act or that it was wrong". The first requires proof that the defendant did not know what he was doing; that he had no awareness of what he was happening, that he was unaware of the consequences of his act or that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, but was deluded as to the circumstances; for the latter, Jonathan Herring gives the example of a man who [...] "thought he was killing a monstrous person when he was in fact killing a person". When arguing that the defendant was [...] "not knowing the act was wrong", [...] "wrong" [...] is taken to mean [...] "illegal", as set out in R v Windle [...] 2 QB 826.|$|E

2500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in CounterPunch, author Tariq Ali said, [...] "The Bavarian is a razor-sharp reactionary cleric. I think <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> saying and why. In a neo-liberal world suffering from environmental degradation, poverty, hunger, repression, a 'planet of slums' (in the graphic phrase of Mike Davis), the Pope chooses to insult the founder of a rival faith. The reaction in the Muslim world was predictable, but depressingly insufficient." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a {{transportation}} hub, Singapore {{has always been}} a potential transit point for Golden Triangle heroin. In a letter to David Hawker, the Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, Abdullah Tarmugi, the Speaker of the Parliament of Singapore, wrote: [...] "He was caught in possession of almost 400 grams of pure heroin, enough for more than 26,000 doses of heroin for drug addicts.... <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing and the consequences of his actions. As representatives of the people, {{we have an obligation to}} protect the lives of those who could be ruined by the drugs he was carrying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winwood recalled, [...] "There were no chord sheets, no nothing. [...] He [...] {{just started}} playing. [...] It was a one-take job, with him singing and {{playing at the}} same time. [...] He just had such mastery of the {{instrument}} and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> and knew his abilities". [...] Engineer Eddie Kramer saw it differently: [...] "The idea that these jam sessions were informal is something that I completely disagree with. [...] They may have seemed casual to the outside observer, but Jimi plotted and planned out nearly all of them. [...] He'd reason {{that if he had}} his songs together, if he really wanted to pull out what he heard in his head, he needed the right people... and that's what he did". [...] During the recording session, Hendrix is heard advising Winwood on his organ part.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{good to see}} you up there," [...] said Slone. [...] "An' that splendid horse! ... <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is. It'll break Bostil's {{heart to}} see that horse beat." ...|$|R
60|$|A queer smile {{crept into}} Andrew's eyes. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> owed to Leonard, but Florence must not guess. She should keep {{her faith in}} her husband, if she could.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mister Wilson," [...] {{answered}} the captain, with the gruff {{air of a}} man who assumes and asserts that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is about, and does not want advice.|$|R
2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then I notice in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, {{do you have any idea}} how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, Gravano {{and several}} {{other members of the}} Gambino family became disenchanted with Gotti's lust for the media and {{high-profile}} antics, feeling they brought too much heat. Several members of the family informed Gravano that Gotti's high profile and large gatherings of mob members at the Ravenite Social Club were constant targets for the FBI and that the media attention put a large spotlight on the Gambinos. Many members of the family, according to Gravano, complained to him about Gotti's use of Gravano in murders despite Gravano's position as underboss of the family. Members were also concerned about Gotti's frequent appearances in court. He was first tried for assaulting a refrigerator repairman over a parking space. Through witness intimidation, he was acquitted. Gravano had paid a juror in Gotti's second trial to vote in favor of an acquittal allowing Gotti to beat the RICO charges lodged against him. Gotti's third trial on state assault charges ended the same way. Gotti's ego began to bother Gravano as well as several other members of the family. Gotti was first known as the [...] "Dapper Don" [...] in the press for his Brioni suits and hand-painted ties as well as his well-combed hair and quick wit with reporters. Gotti required Gravano and Gambino consigliere Frank LoCascio to be at the Ravenite social club five days a week and all of his captains to make an appearance once a week. When Gravano warned Gotti about the negative attention from reporters as well as the constant surveillance from the FBI, Gotti instructed Gravano not to worry about it, as Gotti said that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm your man;" [...] and Gus {{looked as}} if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> promised, for {{he had given up}} smoking to oblige his father, and kept his word like a hero.|$|R
6000|$|But no, {{his head}} was level, <b>he</b> <b>knowed</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was about. He swooped down to within thirty or forty feet of the lake, and stopped right over the center, and sung out: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, never mind; I wish I knew it all," [...] {{answered}} another. [...] "I guess <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is doing." [...] And in this he was right; Theodore Roosevelt <b>knew</b> exactly <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{was trying}} to accomplish.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{going to}} say was humiliating, but he was broken down with jealousy and desire.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was Norman {{grave and}} steadfast, as if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about, and was manfully and calmly ready--he {{might have been}} a young knight, {{watching}} his armour." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{these words}} he fell fainting from his chair, {{and as the}} youth, before <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing, had {{squeezed}} the bird to death, the old man died also.|$|E
60|$|The {{horse and}} Miss Adams arrived simultaneously, {{both of them}} very serious and quiet. The horse because <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had before him in that weather; the girl because {{of what she had}} left behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "The lad did {{not speak}} boastfully, {{when he said he}} was a fair swordsman," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "He does not fight in our fashion, but at least <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> about. I was {{so fond of}} {{my pillow}} this morning that I thought I'd let the hunting slide for once. A man should not make a toil of his pleasure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to bargaining, {{and asking}} so much more, {{and all the}} rest of it, that's out of the question. Somebody fixed a price, and I suppose <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at." ...|$|E
60|$|He was {{a masterful}} man up {{to a certain}} point only. Her humility now tapped him in a new place, and before <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about he began to run pity.|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{scarcely}} all, my lady"--he indicated respectfully that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> talking about. [...] "There's tea in her ladyship's tent; but," [...] he qualified, [...] "it {{has also}} been ordered for the saloon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had to say," [...] said Mary. And {{then she}} blushed, as though fearing {{that she had}} {{appeared}} to have been quite sure that her lover would not have been so dull.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, here's a perposal to squander, all right," [...] said McNutt. [...] "But the {{question}} is, Does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he's</b> runnin' up agin', and what it'll cost {{to do all}} the idiotic things as he says?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog, {{who is very}} wise. [...] "Jerry Muskrat knows. If Jerry {{says that}} we are going to have a long cold winter you may be sure that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is talking about." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} day a fly came and stung him on the shoulder, and before <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> doing he lifted up his trunk and hit that fly dead with the end of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I've been {{learning}} the game all the time. I'm going on holding you up {{until we get}} out of here. Savvy? When God made me a light-weight I guess <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about. Now, shut up. I'm busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I comforted myself,' said Mrs. Ponsonby; 'I {{said things}} {{to him that}} I had longed to say, and how beautifully he took them! But I could not feel that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> about much better than he did the first time.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Persuasion {{is not at}} command; but pardon me, if I cannot even {{endeavour}} {{to persuade}} him. I have myself told him that Miss Thorpe is engaged. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> is about, and must be his own master." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. <b>He</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{is talking}} about," [...] said Mrs. Travers {{in such a}} bitter tone as to disconcert d'Alcacer for a moment. [...] "I don't see a single soul about the decks," [...] Mrs. Travers continued, almost directly.|$|R
6000|$|... "You say right, Jacques d'Arc. Well, {{what would}} you of one that is mad? Does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> does? No. Does <b>he</b> do <b>what</b> others make him do? Yes. Now, then, I tell you he has signed the treaty." ...|$|R
