The {{exposure to the}} gases NO 2, NO and ozone is also discussed. The results are presented in tables and graphs. The correlation between the arc-time factor and the welding fume concentration in the breathing zone appeared to be bad MMA-welding fumes of stainless steel contain mainly soluble hexavalent chromium. During MIG and TIG welding the fumes contain chromium which was insoluble in water and not hexavalent. The nickel was insoluble in water in all three processes. In comparison with the Dutch occupational health standards, {{it appears that the}} dust exposure is often higher than the limit value of 5 mg m 3 in M MA and <b>gas-shielded</b> <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> The exposure to chromium is usually higher than the standard of 0. 05 mg m 3 lor hexavalent chromium and the standard o[0. 5 mg m- 3 lor total chromium in MMA welding of stainless steel, and the exposure to copper fumes during welding of copper is usually higher than the standard of 02 mg m 3.

The traditional <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> power source is backward in technology and large amount of consumables, so <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> inverter power has become the direction of its development. With the enhanced awareness of energy saving and environmental protection, this paper concentrates on new high power factor of <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> power source as the research object, and introduces the main structure of high-power <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> power source.

5000|$|Welding: Processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and {{shielded}} metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> cannot be used, {{due to the}} deposition of impure material and potential introduction of voids or porosity. Gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> (with an appropriate heat profile and properly selected filler material) is necessary. Other clean processes, such as electron beam welding or laser beam welding, are also acceptable; however, those that involve potential slag inclusions (such as submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and Flux-cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding)</b> are obviously not. To avoid trapping gas or high vapor pressure molecules, welds must fully penetrate the joint or be made from the interior surface.|$|R

50|$|To {{supply the}} {{electrical}} energy necessary for <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> processes, {{a number of}} different power supplies can be used. The most common classification is constant current power supplies and constant voltage power supplies. In <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> the voltage {{is directly related to the}} length of the arc, and the current is related to the amount of heat input. Constant current power supplies are most often used for manual welding processes such as gas tungsten <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> and shielded metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> because they maintain a relatively constant current even as the voltage varies. This is important because in manual welding, it can be difficult to hold the electrode perfectly steady, and as a result, the arc length and thus voltage tend to fluctuate. Constant voltage power supplies hold the voltage constant and vary the current, and as a result, are most often used for automated welding processes such as gas metal <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding,</b> and submerged <b>arc</b> <b>welding.</b> In these processes, arc length is kept constant, since any fluctuation in the distance between the wire and the base material is quickly rectified by a large change in current. For example, if the wire and the base material get too close, the current will rapidly increase, which in turn causes the heat to increase and the tip of the wire to melt, returning it to its original separation distance.|$|R

Failure to use such protection when <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> or even being near where <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is going on can result in a painful condition called “arc eye” or photokeratitis, which is akin to a severe sunburn of the cornea and conjunctiva of the eye.|$|R

GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored <b>arc</b> <b>welding</b> is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction.
