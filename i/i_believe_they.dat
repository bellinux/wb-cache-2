5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
25|$|As {{the miners}} work only {{six in the}} twenty-four hours in the mines, and as the barrenness of the soil affords little scope for {{agricultural}} pursuits, they have of course abundance of time for reading: and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> generally employ it to good purpose; {{for many of them}} can converse upon historical, scientific, and theological points so as to astonish a stranger; and even on political questions, they express their opinions with great acuteness and accuracy.|$|E

My house is not {{complete}} without an American Moonman, and I would say 'Touch My Body' deserves one. Brett Ratner directed it, I have a unicorn in there, I have [...] in there — who else has that?" ...|$|E

500|$|For Voodoos sessions, D'Angelo {{appropriated}} most of {{the instruments}} on the album's songs, contributing with drums, electric guitar, keyboards, and percussion. During its recording, he employed amplifiers, microphones, a Fender Rhodes keyboards and organ originally used by musician Stevie Wonder for Talking Book (1972), and a recording board originally used by Jimi Hendrix. On Voodoos recording atmosphere, D'Angelo stated [...] "I believe Jimi was there. Jimi, Marvin Gaye, all the folks we were gravitating to. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> blessed the project".|$|E
500|$|The {{area was}} named after Scarborough, Yorkshire, England by Elizabeth Simcoe, the wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first {{lieutenant}} governor of Upper Canada. The bluffs along Scarborough's Lake Ontario shores {{reminded her of the}} limestone cliffs in Scarborough, England. On August 4, 1793, she wrote in her diary, [...] "The shore is extremely bold, and has the appearance of chalk cliffs, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> are only white sand. They appeared so well that we talked of building a summer residence there and calling it Scarborough." [...] Before that, the area was named Glasgow, after the Scottish city.|$|E
500|$|After such criticism, Linnaeus felt {{he needed}} to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of [...] {{introduced}} new terms, including Mammalia and Primates, the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens. The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place of ruling over nature and not {{being a part of}} it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it. In his book , he said, [...] "One should not vent one's wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere 'aoutomata mechanica,' but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility." ...|$|E

500|$|Galatasaray manager Fatih Terim {{expressed}} his delight following his side's victory. He {{was interviewed by}} the Turkish press and dedicated the cup to Turkey and its public, particularly to those {{who lost their lives}} during the 1999 İzmit earthquake: [...] "Many people suffered terribly in the earthquake in Turkey last year and if this victory brings some happiness back into their lives then I am delighted and so are all the players. We are very proud if we are able to help the Turkish people in some small way and this victory is for the whole country and all of the soccer fans in Turkey. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> were all united behind us." [...] Terim also praised his own players and Taffarel: [...] "I am proud and delighted he is in my team. He was magnificent and thoroughly deserved to be man of the match". Popescu, a former defender of Tottenham Hotspur, also indulged in the triumph and said: [...] "I am sure the fans at my old club are delighted as well!" ...|$|E

Ansari in return, thanked them.|$|E
2500|$|The role of {{the passage}} of time and its impact on Tyler’s {{characters}} is always present. [...] The stories in many of her novels span decades, if only by flashbacks. [...] Joyce Carol Oates emphasized the role of time in this manner: “ move at times as if plotless in the meandering drift of actual life, it is time itself that constitutes “plot”: meaning is revealed through a doubling-back upon time in ﬂashes of accumulated memory, those heightened moments which James Joyce aptly called epiphanies. The minutiae of family life can yield a startling signiﬁcance seen from the right perspective, as Tyler shows us.” [...] With regard to those minutiae, Tyler herself comments: “As for huge events vs. small events: <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> all count. [...] They all reveal character, which is the factor that most concerns me….It does fascinate me, though, that small details can be so meaningful.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon his {{recovery}} from the bout of illness and associated treatment, Reed resumed his education at Syracuse University in 1960, studying journalism, film directing, and creative writing. He was a platoon leader in ROTC and was later expelled from the program for holding an unloaded gun to his superior's head. In 1961, he began hosting a late-night radio program on WAER called Excursions On A Wobbly Rail. Named after a song by pianist Cecil Taylor, the program typically featured doo wop, rhythm and blues, and jazz, particularly the free jazz developed in the mid-1950s. Many of Reed's guitar techniques, such as the guitar-drum roll, were inspired by jazz saxophonists, such as Ornette Coleman. Reed's sister Merrill offered the following recollection of her brother's time spent at Syracuse: [...] " [...] started a band, {{he had his own}} radio show. [...] He reportedly libeled some student on his radio show; the kid's family tried to sue my father. And there were other extracurricular possibly illegal activities of which the university didn't approve. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>they</b> tried to kick him out. But he was a genius; what could they do? [...] He stayed and he graduated." [...] Reed graduated with honors from Syracuse University's College of Arts and Sciences with a B.A. in English in June 1964.|$|E
