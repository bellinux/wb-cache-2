All of these stages are imbued with religious symbolism, adding a Christianizing layer to an essentially secular ceremony.|$|R

40|$|Polyketone fiber is {{considered}} as a reinforcement of the mechanical rubber goods (MRG) such as tires, automobile <b>hoses,</b> and <b>belts</b> because of its high strength and modulus. In order to apply it to those purposes, the high adhesion of fiber/rubber interface and good sustainability to aging conditions are very important. In this study, polyketone fiber reinforced natural rubber composites were prepared and they were subjected to thermal and humidity aging, to assess the changes of the interfacial adhesion and material properties. Also, the effect of adhesive primer treatment, based on the resorcinol formaldehyde resin and latex (RFL), of polyketone fiber for high interfacial adhesion was evaluated. Morphological and property changes of the rubber composites were analyzed by using various instrumental analyses. As a result, the rubber composite was aged largely by thermal aging at high temperature rather than humidity aging condition. Interfacial adhesion of the polyketone/NR composites was improved by the primer treatment and its effect was maintained in aging conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cords have {{commonly}} {{been used}} as reinforcing materials in rubber composites. To improve cord/rubber interfacial adhesion, the cords are usually coated with an adhesive (typically based on Resorcinol-Formaldehyde-Latex (RFL)). These cord/rubber composites {{have been used in}} many sectors such as the tire, <b>hose</b> and <b>belt</b> industries. Inter-facial adhesion between cord and rubber is an important determinant of the durability of the composite system. In this study, newly developed polyketone cord was coated by dipping in various RFL-based adhesive primers and then bonded to natural rubber by a compression molding method. The resin/latex ratio in the RFL adhesive primer was var-ied in order to achieve the optimal mixing ratio. Polyketone cord was treated with primers at various heating tempera-tures and dipping times. To measure the adhesion strength between the polyketone cord and the natural rubber, and the fatigue resistance of the composite system, the H-test and the tension-compression test were performed. The surface of the polyketone cord treated with primer was examined by attenuated total reflectance (ATR) spectroscopy and othe...|$|R

30|$|A handbag design {{slated for}} re-birth can follow a similar {{collaboration}} {{process and the}} entire life cycle of the product is vital in both instances (Lee and DeLong 2016 c, 2018). However, there are some important differences from the apparel previously slated for re-birth. For example, the materials of the fashion handbag are harder to redesign {{because they are more}} rigid in structure and sometimes less resilient and thus more difficult to reuse. Fashion handbags going through re-birth design are one type of bag used for upcycling. Wang (2014) characterised the types of waste materials used in upcycling for various types of bags: (1) textiles such as truck covers, placards, signboards, remnants of cloth, clothes, military uniforms, blankets, tents, parachutes, fire <b>hoses,</b> seat <b>belts,</b> car sheets, plane seats, and coffee sacks; (2) plastic including doggie bags and plastic bags; (3) leather such as old leather garments, remnants of leather shoes, a belt, car sheets, waste furniture, and gymnastic gear; (4) paper such as magazines, catalogues, and coated newspapers; (5) tires such as inner tubes that are developed into glossy high quality leather-like fabrics (Wang 2014).|$|R
40|$|Issue: In the {{production}} of virgin rubber compounds and new products it is often necessary to adhere or bond the rubber to another rubber piece, fabric, or metal. This best practice describes the materials used in these applications. Best Practice: Bonding Agents – This type is commonly used to adhere rubber to metal, plastic, and other rubber compounds. These agents are specialty prepared solvent and water based adhesives that are commonly applied to the bonding substrate. A primer is usually applied. Little is disclosed about {{the composition of the}} bonding agents. Internal Adhesives, Bonding Agents, Binders – For metal and fiber reinforcement, such as steel belts and fabric in tires, <b>hoses,</b> and <b>belts,</b> a HRH (Hexa, Resourcinol, Hi-Sil) system is employed. This system involves adding Hexamethylene tetramine (HMT) or HMMM, resourcinol and precipitated silica into the rubber compound. This increases the stiffness of the unvulcanized rubber and the modulus of the cured rubber. The adhesion, or pull-out, force of steel or fabric from rubber is greatly enhanced with this method.

40|$|Issue: In {{producing}} recycled rubber, {{one has to}} {{be aware}} of the possibility of experiencing objects and materials that may cause contamination. This includes both objects that are foreign as well as materials that are included in the product being recycled that would be objectionable in the final product. In many instances, various types or grades of rubber may be incompatible when blended together. Incompatibility can lead to poor processing and performance characteristics. Best Practice: In the recycling of tires the obvious concern is over dirt, mud, and foreign matter that might be contained on or in the tire. These materials would lower the quality of a recyclate into which they are incorporated. Stones are an area of primary concern since they can do damage to processing equipment as well as contaminate the final product. Therefore, it is necessary to use general sanitary conditions that eliminate extraneous matter from the process. Within some OE and specialty tires there is a layer of tire sealant for puncture resistance. This layer (Gen-Seal, Royseal, etc.) is usually soft, composed of low molecular weight polymer, resin, and filler, and is partially cured. This layer should be avoided if possible because it can cause downstream problems when working with small particle size materials. Other contaminants of concern in tire, <b>hose,</b> and <b>belt</b> recycling and grinding are the textile and stee...|$|R
