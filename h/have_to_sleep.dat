25|$|Freddie's episode {{shows his}} {{difficult}} {{relationship with his}} widower father (Simon Day) and his sister Karen (Klariza Clayton), who has ambitions to be a celebrity. His father converts Freddie's shed—his personal sanctuary—into a dance studio for Karen. He witnesses Effy's parents' break-up, discovers that Cook slept with his sister, gets punched in the face by his father, and {{when he goes to}} tell Effy how he feels about her discovers she is with Cook. In 'Naomi', Naomi runs against Cook for student president on the basis that if he wins she will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with him; when he wins however, he does not force her to take it further than kissing. She and Emily begin a sexual relationship, but Naomi is unwilling to accept the reality of its romantic nature. In 'JJ', Freddie and Cook's feud over Effy negatively affects JJ. At Emily's encouragement, he manages to confront them both about it, and later loses his virginity when Emily decides to have pity sex with him. Thomas discovers that Pandora has been cheating on him, and while high on JJ's medication, Cook reveals to Freddie that Effy loves Freddie and not him. In Effy's episode, she has nothing: her Queen Bee status has been usurped by Katie, sex with Cook means nothing, and her home life is a wreck. She finally feels something when she has sex with Freddie, but after being tormented by Katie, an intoxicated Effy hits her with a rock. Katie is recovering in 'Katie and Emily' but her relationship with her sister is falling apart. However, at the college ball, Emily is able to assert herself and Naomi confesses she loves Emily back. Thomas and Pandora also reunite. The finale episode sees Cook and Effy hiding out with Cook's father (Matt King). JJ tracks them down however, and forces Effy to confess it is Freddie that she loves, but Cook is adamant he loves her too. Freddie closes the series, asking 'What do we do now?'.|$|E

500|$|By 1904 the War Office had {{concluded}} that Walmer had no remaining military value and agreed to transfer the castle to the Office of Works, who accepted it {{on the condition that}} they were paid £2,400 in order to carry out repairs. The Office's survey noted that [...] "the lower floor ... is very inconvenient, dark and not conducive to health while the women servants <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in a sort of dormitory in the slopes of the roof... The principal floor is, generally speaking, badly arranged and badly lighted and the Dining Room is very small"; the report suggested that {{it would be best to}} demolish the building and rebuild it.|$|E

[...] Complexs Knight wrote that Taki's knowledge of mastery of ninjutsu and ninja magic {{that must be}} reason how {{she is able to}} do all her acrobatic moves with such a chest, adding that [...] "most women with a cup size that big would have back pains and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> on their side at night" [...] yet Taki [...] "takes it all in stride, moving around the stage of history like the most athletic girl on the volleyball court." [...] UGO commented: [...] "To be honest we don't really care, but there must be some kind of ninja-magic that supports those behemoths." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{her stay}} at Yaddo, Highsmith met writer Marc Brandel, son of author J.D. Beresford. Even though {{she told him}} about her homosexuality, they soon entered into a {{short-lived}} relationship. He convinced her to visit him in Provincetown, Massachusetts, where he introduced her to Ann Smith, a painter and designer with a previous métier as a Vogue fashion model, and the two became involved. After Smith left Provincetown, Highsmith felt she was [...] "in prison" [...] with Brandel and told him she was leaving. [...] "ecause of that I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> with him, and only {{the fact that it is}} the last night strengthens me to bear it." [...] Highsmith, who had [...] never been sexually exclusive with Brandel, resented having sex with him. Highsmith temporarily broke off the relationship with Brandel and continued to be involved with several women; reuniting after the well-received publication of his new novel. Beginning November 30, 1948, and continuing for the next six months, Highsmith underwent psychoanalysis in an effort [...] "to regularize herself sexually" [...] so she could marry Brandel. The analysis was brought to a stop by Highsmith, after which she ended her relationship with him.|$|E
2500|$|Walker and Stickgold {{hypothesized}} that after initial memory acquisition, sleep reorganizes memory representation at a macro-brain systems level. Their experiment {{consisted of two}} groups; the night-sleep group was taught a motor sequence block tapping task at night, put to sleep and then retested 12 hours later. The day-wake group was taught the same task {{in the morning and}} tested 12 hours later with no intervening sleep. FMRI was used to measure brain activity during retest. Results indicated significantly fewer errors/sequence in the night-sleep group compared to the day wake group. FMRI output for the night-sleep group indicated increased activation in the right primary motor cortex/M1/Prefrontal Gyrus (contra lateral to the hand they were block tapping with), right anterior medial prefrontal lobe, right hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial memory), right ventral striatum (olfactory tubercle, nucleus accumbens), as well as regions of the cerebellum (lobules V1, V11). In the day-wake group, fMRI showed [...] "decreased" [...] signal activation bilaterally in the parietal cortices (integrates multiple modalities), in addition to the left insular cortex (regulation of homeostasis), left temporal pole (most anterior of temporal cortex), and the left inferior fronto-polar cortex. Previous investigations have shown that signal increases indicate brain plasticity. The increased signal activity seen in M1 after sleep corresponds to increased activity in this area seen during practice; however, an individual must practice for longer periods than they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep</b> in order to obtain the same level of M1 signal increases. Therefore, it is suggested that sleep enhances the cortical representation of motor tasks by brain system expansion, as seen by increased signal activity.|$|E
