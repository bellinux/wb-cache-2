5000|$|Larkin {{remained}} with Perry Mason until its final episode {{at the end}} of the year and was almost immediately offered a continuation of the role on television. Procter & Gamble could not, however, come to terms with Erle Stanley Gardner regarding Perry Masons position as a <b>daytime</b> TV <b>character</b> and the defense attorney, while remaining with CBS, returned in twenty-one months, on September 21, 1957, as a primetime show, starring Raymond Burr. Daytimes biggest advertiser, however, had another solution, which still permitted Larkin to portray afternoon TVs [...] "Perry Mason" [...] in all but name. Irving Vendig, having scripted the radio Perry Mason for the past nine years, proposed the creation of a late-afternoon daytime drama with basically the same Perry Mason-type scripts, except for the name of the lead criminal lawyer, who would be called Mike Karr. John Larkin thus had his first television leading role, and The Edge of Night, premiering, along with As the World Turns, on Monday, April 2, 1956, ushered in a new era of half-hour soaps to TV, with other daytime dramas eventually expanding to a 30 minutes, then an hour and, ultimately, in one unsuccessful experiment (NBCs Another World) to 90 minutes. The Edge of Nights title was derived from the fact that it aired {{at the end of}} the afternoon period, 4:30, a late time slot which had never previously been occupied by a soap.|$|R
50|$|All My Children (often {{shortened}} to AMC) is an American television {{soap opera}} that aired on ABC for 41 years, from January 5, 1970, to September 23, 2011, and on The Online Network (TOLN) from April 29 to September 2, 2013, via Hulu, Hulu Plus, and iTunes. Created by Agnes Nixon, All My Children {{is set in}} Pine Valley, Pennsylvania, a fictional suburb of Philadelphia, which is modeled on the actual Philadelphia suburb of Rosemont. The original series featured Susan Lucci as Erica Kane, one of <b>daytime's</b> most popular <b>characters.</b> The title of the series refers to the bonds of humanity. All My Children was the first new network daytime drama to debut in the 1970s. Originally owned by Creative Horizons, Inc., the company created by Nixon and her husband, Bob, the show was sold to ABC in January 1975. The series started at a half-hour in per-installment length, then was expanded to a full hour on April 25, 1977. Earlier, the show had experimented with the full-hour format for one week starting on June 30, 1975, after which Ryan's Hope premiered.|$|R
5000|$|Fulton's {{portrayal}} of Lisa created the strongest prototype {{of its time}} for the <b>daytime</b> vixen. The <b>character</b> and actress were, in Fulton's first decades on As the World Turns, very popular (to the point where, in the late 1960s, Fulton had to hire a publicist, the first soap actress to do so). The character became hated after a simple sequence where Lisa hires a maid to clean the house and went gallivanting about town. When mother-in-law Nancy complimented Lisa on what a nice home she made for her son Bob, the audience became furious, stopping Fulton {{on the street and}} slapping her. CBS had to hire a bodyguard to escort her to and from the studio. Despite her popularity, Fulton's run has not been without controversy. During the late 1960s, after her onscreen son was aged from age 12 to 19, Fulton insisted it be written into her contract that her character could not become a grandmother. She feared that the perception of her as a grandmother, instead of a glamorous and vital woman, would cause the writers to kill off her character. (This had been done when Barbara Berjer, who was playing one of Lisa's Rivals, Claire Shea, became a grandmother.) Fans, believing that the [...] "granny clause" [...] as it became known, was still in effect (which it was not), sent Fulton so much threatening [...] "hate mail" [...] when Lisa's onscreen daughter-in-law, Margo, had a miscarriage in 1986, that she had to hire a bodyguard.|$|R

This 130 hectares of land is intended to meet a future demand of medium-rated space for containers. The surrounding processing industries are also forecast to grow in capacity and size. (City of Johannesburg Transportation Department, 2009, 14). What lacks amongst these expansive terrains, is any form of supporting facility, that which aids the labour force, the drivers of massive machinery, those which keep containers moving, the modern-day slave to globalization. The labour force will in the future, increase with the additional container depot space. The number of container trucks which transport these containers will consequently increase. A pinnacle ‘cog’ in the mechanism that is container transportation via road in Southern Africa, is City Deep and Kazerne, yet neither area yields any place regarding trucking maintenance. The road conditions of the area are subsequently threadbare and dilapidated with a great lack of coherence, signage, systematic movement and communication. Transnet previously had sole rights to freight transport from Durban, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth into Johannesburg. Currently local road haul activity is now controlled {{by a variety of}} logistics companies. As a result, To make use of the undeveloped spaces of City Deep would be to ‘infill’ vacancies, assisting in the promotion of the idea of a compact city. (Jenks, Burton & Williams, 1996) The compact city draws parallels to the notion of the ‘resilient city’ in that transportation and overall infrastructure costs decrease. (South African Cities Network, 2011) The proposals of industrial or commercial activity in this area would result in the promotion of the economic growth of Johannesburg.

The facilities’ importance reveals itself in that it acts as a catalytic point in this “terrain vague’, in moving towards positive future transformations of the natural landscape each container terminal acts independently as a smaller-scale operation. The loss of coherence and depot communication within City Deep prevails. Instead of one large container terminal, City Deep and Spoornet’s Kazerne are both made up of various components which work independently from each other. This document serves to investigate the feasibility of restoring use into this terrain, a use which is simultaneously beneficial to surrounding communities, an expanding container terminal and the environment in which it wildly lies...|$|E

But of course, she wasn't abandoned, she was given up for adoption, and the network and producers were rightly concerned that we might be 'sending the message' (that phrase that soap writers dread) either that adopted children were hateful and full of rage, or that their adoptive parents were neglectful or otherwise inadequate enough to instill this smoldering resentment of being adopted in their kids... I need not go on." [...] Patrick Mulcahey on Carly (1999). [...] Officially, former head writers Claire Labine (1993-96) and Robert Guza, Jr. (1996-2000, 2002-11), along with script writers Karen Harris and Patrick Mulcahey, are said to have created the character of Carly. In 1999, writer Patrick Mulcahey noted that the character had been somewhat of a work in progress at first. Mulchey explained that she was different from most characters because [...] "We were afraid of her." [...] The character was quite a big deal and very important to the series—so important that one writer even quit over it. [...] "The pitfalls are obvious," [...] Mulcahey said and [...] "I imagine Bob the headwriter promised Wendy the executive producer and ABC that we had no intention of falling into them" [...] the scribe continued. However, the writers themselves had no clue who the character was supposed to be. [...] "That may sound like a horrifying confession, but in <b>daytime,</b> a successful <b>character</b> is always a collaboration between the writers and the actor." [...] Mulcahey said the writers discussed who they felt Carly, as a character, is and that [...] "the actor finds certain other decisions have to be made and makes them, sparks fly between the actor and another actor, we see what's happening on-screen and start playing around with it in the writing- that's how a character takes shape". The variety of actresses that auditioned for the role implied that there was not any set direction for the character.

According to her backstory, the character was scripted as being born on November 5, 1973 in Jacksonville, Florida to the 16 year old prostitute Bobbie (Jacklyn Zeman) and immediately placed up for adoption because Bobbie could not care for her. The child is adopted by Virginia (Lois Nettleton) and her husband Frank Benson in Pensacola, Florida as Caroline Leigh Benson. Frank eventually walks out on his family and Virginia works so much that Caroline barely has a chance to develop a relationship with her. According to Brown, Virginia is always a bit cold and bitter toward Caroline. In her teen years, Caroline becomes best friends with Charlotte [...] "Carly" [...] Roberts (Kari Wührer).
