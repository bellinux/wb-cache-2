By challenging the standard interpretation of the secularisation thesis, the text {{opens the door to}} a new kind of postmodern ordering of the sacred, which includes our ever developing perception of the environment and our ongoing usage of technology. In my dialogue with the text, I suggest that Szerszynskiâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s argument could have been furthered by exploring the role played by both imagination and myth in creating the postmodern sacred which he describes in the text. I argue that by giving consideration to Friedrich Dessauerâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 s Christian theology of technology and the mythical imagination of contemporary science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>film,</b> a more explicitly religious dimension of technology can be allowed to emerge, {{in the form of the}} technological imaginary...|$|E

5000|$|Plans {{to create}} a film based on Christopher Paolini's best-selling novel were first {{announced}} in February 2004. 20th Century Fox purchased the rights to Eragon. Screenwriter Peter Buchman, whose credits included Jurassic Park III, wrote the screenplay. Buchman, a fan of fantasy <b>and</b> science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films,</b> says he was [...] "blown away" [...] by the author's precociousness, his mastery of plot lines and characters, {{and his ability to}} create several completely imaginary worlds.|$|R

5000|$|Roboethics as {{a science}} or {{philosophical}} topic has not made any strong cultural impact, but is a common theme in science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films.</b> One {{of the most popular}} films depicting the potential misuse of robotic and AI technology is The Matrix, depicting a future where the lack of roboethics brought about the destruction of the human race. An animated film based on The Matrix, the Animatrix, focused heavily on the potential ethical issues between humans and robots. Many of the Animatrix's animated shorts are also named after Isaac Asimov's fictional stories.|$|R
25|$|Three-dimensional GUIs {{appeared}} in science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> {{before they were}} technically feasible or in common use. For example; the 1993 American film Jurassic Park features Silicon Graphics' three-dimensional file manager File System Navigator, a real-life file manager for Unix operating systems. The film Minority Report has scenes of police officers using specialized 3d data systems. In prose fiction, three-dimensional user interfaces have been portrayed as immersible environments like William Gibson's Cyberspace or Neal Stephenson's Metaverse. Many futuristic imaginings of user interfaces rely heavily on object-oriented user interface (OOUI) style and especially object-oriented graphical user interface (OOGUI) style.|$|R

30|$|Regarding item 3, the {{societal}} dimension {{can be described}} as being relatively unagitated. Reports about service robots can be found frequently on the science pages of newspapers. The tenor of the reporting {{can be described as}} balanced to critical, or even as positive whenever concrete technological systems are presented. 2 There are no major social controversies about service robots, and initial studies of their acceptance have been conducted (Sect. 2). For example, a museum robot that guides visitors meets with more interested curiosity than with surprise or anxiety. Science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films</b> appear to have prepared society for robots although robots are still a very infrequent manifestation in our life world (Christaller et al. 2001 : 28).|$|R
40|$|This thesis problematizes early cyberfeminist {{claims that}} heralded the Internet as a {{liberating}} space for women. Cyberfeminism {{emerged in the}} early 1990 s, {{at the dawn of}} the “Internet Age,” and is heavily influenced by Donna Haraway’s 1985 “A Cyborg Manifesto. ” Haraway theorized a new way of looking at the nature of female identity, using the figure of the cyborg found in science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films.</b> Traditionally, women have been explained in terms of sexual difference and have been forced to uphold a gender binary that privileges men. By contrast, Haraway argues that the cyborg, a hybrid of human and machine, escapes binary logic, thereby resisting categories and hierarchies, and embraces a more fluid understanding of identity. This model contains powerful ramifications for women. Every day, we become more like Haraway’s cyborgs as our physical bodies become increasingly intertwined with modern technologies, specifically in our ever-growing relationship with the Internet. In online interactions, users are no longer confined to their physical bodies and are free to play with identity. Early cyberfeminists believe that this leads to a more fluid understanding of identity and, more importantly, allows for the deconstruction of gender. These claims, however, do not apply in practice as well as they do in theory. From the anonymous text-based spaces that early cyberfeminists describe to social networking sites like Facebook, Internet spaces tend to polarize the gender binary rather than blur it, and women are now colonized on a new front. This becomes increasingly dangerous as the boundaries between our virtual and real lives continue to blur...|$|R
5|$|Tiberius {{has been}} {{represented}} in <b>fiction,</b> in <b>literature,</b> <b>film</b> <b>and</b> television, and in video games, {{often as a}} peripheral character in the central storyline. One such modern representation is in the novel I, Claudius by Robert Graves, and the consequent BBC television series adaptation, where he is portrayed by George Baker. George R. R. Martin, the author of The Song of Ice and Fire series, has stated that central character Stannis Baratheon is partially inspired by Tiberius Caesar, and particularly the portrayal by Baker.|$|R
40|$|Breath has {{a realist}} {{function}} in most artistic media. It serves {{to remind the}} reader, the viewer or the spectator of the exigencies of the body. In science <b>fiction</b> (SF) <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films,</b> breath is often a plot device for human encounters with otherness, either with alien peoples, who may not breathe oxygen, or environments, where {{there may not be}} oxygen to breathe. But while there is a technoscientific quality to breath in SF, especially in its attention to physiological systems, concentrating on the technoscientific threatens to occlude other, more affective aspects raised by the literature. In order to supplement the tendency to read SF as a succession of technoscientific accounts of bodily experience, this paper recalls how SF texts draw attention to the affective, non-scientific qualities of breath, both as a metonym for life and as a metaphor for anticipation. Through an engagement with diverse examples from SF <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>films,</b> this article considers the tension between technoscientific and affective responses to breath in order to demonstrate breath's co-determinacy in SF's blending of scientific and artistic discourses...|$|R
50|$|Supersoldiers {{are common}} in science <b>fiction</b> <b>literature,</b> <b>films</b> <b>and</b> video games. In 2012, DARPA was {{reported}} to be developing an externally powered XOS exoskeleton design for greatly increased strength and endurance. Fictional supersoldiers are usually heavily augmented, either through eugenics, genetic engineering, cybernetic implants, drugs, brainwashing, traumatic events, an extreme training regimen or other scientific and pseudoscientific means. Occasionally, some instances also use paranormal methods, such as black magic or technology and science of extraterrestrial origin. In entertainment, the creators of such programs are viewed often as mad scientists or stern military personnel depending on the emphasis, as their programs would typically go past ethical boundaries in the pursuit of science or military might.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{taken for granted}} that <b>fictions,</b> {{including}} both <b>literature</b> <b>and</b> <b>film,</b> influence our attitudes toward real people, events, and situations. Philosophers who defend claims about the cognitive value of fiction view this influence in a positive light, while others worry about the potential moral danger of fiction. Marketers hope that visual and aural references to their products in movies will {{have an effect on}} people‟s buying patterns. Psychologists study the persuasive impact of media. Educational books <b>and</b> <b>films</b> are created in the hopes of guiding children‟s and adult‟s preferences toward socially acceptable norms. The influences discussed by marketers, psychologists, educators, and philosophers tend to be both cognitive and affective. It seems that we can be “emotionally persuaded”: our preferences can be changed, our feelings about particular people or events can be influenced, and so forth. It takes but a little reflection, however, to motivate concern about these kinds of influences, not just their potentially negative effects, but the processes by which these effects occur. If we are persuaded by fictions, how can the resulting beliefs or preferences or attitudes be warranted? It would be implausibly extreme to think that acquiring beliefs or attitudes from fiction is always a mistake. So when is it appropriate? I have argued elsewhere for an approach to this question concerning th...|$|R
