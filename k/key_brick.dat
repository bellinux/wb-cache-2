However, even if Canetti speaks actually seldom about right and let it tacit coincide with power, according to us {{it is possible to}} demonstrate as the concept of Law, even if in a twilight zone, permeate the entire Canetti’s narration and constitute the <b>key</b> <b>brick</b> to support and interpret the whole architecture of his thought. In fact, Canetti’s intense keenness on Kafka, allows him to inherit his vision of power and law, but even to elaborate on i...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, the {{explosive}} advances in sequencing and genotyping technologies fueled by major financial investments in basic science, have evidenced {{that hundreds of}} genes harboring variations contribute to human cancers and that genetic variability may influence patients' responses to post-surgical treatments (Hamburg and Collins, N Engl J Med 363 (4) : 301 - 304, 2010). Several studies have reported the association between one or multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in multiple pathways linked to prostate cancer onset and progression (Sfanos and De Marzo, Histopathology (1) : 199 - 215, 2012). For instance, a SNP (GG genotype) in the promoter region of alpha- 1 -antichymotrypsin (ACT), an acute-phase protein up-regulated in inflammatory conditions, has been reported as linked to the increased risk of prostate cancer (Licastro et al., Anticancer Res 28 : 395 - 399, 2008). Moreover, a correlation between circulating levels of PSA and the ACT GG genotype was reported in younger prostate cancer patients too. ACT {{is of particular interest}} because is bound, in men, to most of circulating PSA. As well, the association between increased risk for prostate cancer or aggressive prostate cancer and the IL 10 - 1082 GG variant of IL- 10 has been recently reported (Zabaleta et al., Carcinogenesis 29 : 573 - 578, 2008; Zabaleta et al., Carcinogenesis 30 : 1358 - 1362, 2009). In addition, SNPs between multiple different cytokines have been investigated as a potential source of increased risk of prostate cancer (Zabaleta et al., Carcinogenesis 29 : 573 - 578, 2008; Zabaleta et al., Carcinogenesis 30 : 1358 - 1362, 2009; Kwon et al., Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 20 : 923 - 933, 2011). 143 SNPs in 16 inflammation-related genes [CXC ligand 12 (CXCL 12), IL- 4, IL- 6, IL- 6 ST, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS 2), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3), TNF, protein kinase B (AKT 1), CXCR 4, IL- 6 R, IL- 8, IL- 10, nuclear factor kappa B (NFκb), phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PIK 3) R 1, PTGS 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ] have been examined in a case-control study of African American versus Caucasian men (Kwon et al., Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 20 : 923 - 933, 2011). SNPs in IL- 4, IL- 6 ST, PTGS 2 and STAT 3 resulted independently associated with prostate cancer susceptibility, while SNPs in AKT 1, PIK 3 R 1 and STAT 3 were associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Overall, men carrying multiple 'high-risk' alleles have been found at an elevated risk for prostate cancer development. These studies strongly support the importance of inflammatory pathways in conferring prostate cancer risk. A multitude of emerging findings support the increasing efforts of the scientific community to look at the molecular background of prostate cancer as the <b>key</b> <b>brick</b> to develop new therapies targeted to the patient, for its molecularly unique tumor. Obviously, the ultimate goal of this exciting line of research will be to develop genetic tests readily and safely transferable to clinical use for the diagnosis and prediction of patients' responses to therapy. The way to reach this objective is sprinkled by many obstacles. We are still unaware of the real clinical significance of several genetic markers and the available data concerning the side-effects of the existing gene-based therapies are far away to be conclusive. Nevertheless, the endlessly mounting reports on this topic are very encouraging, for their promising relevance in prostate cancer patients therapeutic management. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Embedded SRAM are <b>key</b> <b>bricks</b> for {{system on}} chip performances. The {{competition}} is keen for IP providers. Thus, the timing margins must be reduced in order to release extra performances to the customers. Today, the verification is mainly based on spice simulations which are very accurate, but very slow and with a limited coverage. Our strategy is then to combine transistor abstraction with timings and parametric formal verification techniques. We illustrate our methodology on {{a portion of a}} commercial embedded memory and show how {{it can be used to}} improve the product datasheet.

40|$|Abstract. Protection and {{revitalization}} of building {{heritage of the}} territory of contemporary Serbia includes numerous late classical archaeological sites. In spite of the efforts oriented to their adequate protection and presentation, the up-to-date conservation practice has faced various problems, particularly those related to the conservation of the brickwork. Problems especially emerge when {{the need for the}} new bricks arises, due to their different quality in comparison with those of historical ones. The problem is emphasized {{by the fact that the}} recent conservation process, practiced in this region, has not been followed by any qualitative analysis, either of historical or contemporary bricks.

40|$|Two {{schemes for}} {{processing}} mixtures of soil, cement, and {{sugar cane bagasse}} have been investigated {{to determine the best}} way of processing house construction bricks for rural Africa. In one case, bagasse fibers were treated for removing sugar while untreated bagasse fibers were used in the other one.

50|$|In the prologue, Lucy and Paul are {{traveling}} back from watching Hamlet the play in 1602 when they witness a murder. In the present, Gideon has just kissed Gwen {{when they are}} disturbed by a gargoyle demon named Xemerius, whom only Gwen can see. They {{go back to their}} own time and travel by taxi back to the Lodge. Along the way, Gideon reveals that he lives alone in an apartment and after his father died, his mother remarried a rich French man, and the two moved to France and had another child named Raphael, Gideon's younger brother. He also reveals that he finds the time travel gene {{to be more of a}} curse, since it means he cannot travel outside England unless in the company of the Guardians and the chronograph. Xemerius, follows them back to the Temple, where Gwen allows him to follow her around, believing that he will come in useful for information. Gideon and Gwen meet with the members of the Inner Circle to discuss how Lucy and Paul knew about their visit to Lady Tilney. All the members, aside from Mr. George and Gideon, suspect Gwen told them, though there is no proof. Gwen is sent to elapse to the year 1948, the same year as the London Olympic Games, in order to fulfill her quota of time travel for the day. After landing in 1948, despite Mr. George's assurance that no one would be there, Gwen meets Lord Lucas Montrose, her grandfather in the alchemical laboratory. Lucas explains that Gwen gave him a note to meet in that room. While talking, Gwen explains that she is his granddaughter, that Lucy and Paul stole the chronograph and went to the year 1912, and about her current predicament of being the Ruby in the time traveling circle, her suspicions about Count-Saint Germain, her confusion over the secret of the chronograph, and her feelings towards Gideon. The two promise to meet again, at the later time of 1956, and Lucas promises to store a <b>key</b> in the <b>bricks,</b> as well as the password. The next day at breakfast, Lady Arista tells Gwen that Charlotte will from now on be teaching her how to be a proper time traveler, much to Gwen's dismay. After school, Gwen and Charlotte are taken by Mr. Marley to the Temple where Gwen meets Giordano, who has an immediate dislike for her. Gwen is taught dance while at the same time being quizzed on history, all in preparation for a soiree that Gwen must attend on orders of Count-Saint Germain. After lessons, she is taken back home by Gideon who is distraught that Raphael has run away from home, though the next day at school, Lesley, Cynthia, and Gwen discover that he would be attending St. Lennox High with them. On their way to the Temple, Gwen is given shocking news from Xemerius that Gideon, having elapsed earlier in the day, was knocked in the head by someone and left unconscious, though later on, she finds out that he is okay. After dance and history lessons, she is sent to elapse to 1956 where she meets Lucas under the disguise of being his cousin, Hazel, and the two go to a cafe. Lucas tells her that he found out that elapsing to the past, then using the chronograph to elapse further back into the past was entirely possible, and Lucas sent Lucy and Paul to 1602 to see Hamlet. When they traveled back, they told Lucas of the murder they witnessed, and are shocked to find it was Count-Saint Germain who murdered Lancelot de Villiers, the first time traveler, and his ancestor. The two head back to the Temple, and before Gwen disappears, he tells her that the Count had enemies in the Florentine Alliance, that he had private documents not recorded in the Annals, and that reading all twelve of the time traveler's blood into the chronograph was not the only thing that had to be done in order to reveal its secret. After traveling back to the past, Gideon is there, who questions why Gwen smelled of smoke, though she tries to play it off that she smoked. Gwen invites Lesley over, and Mr. Bernard brings Lord Montrose's copy of The Green Rider, which has a series of numbers on a paper; a code that Lesley breaks, but can't make out the meaning of the decoded message. The next day, Gwen and Gideon elapse, and Gideon reveals he believed he was hit in the head by Gwen, but knows that she wouldn't do anything to harm him. The next day is the soiree, and after traveling to the church and elapsing, they meet Rakoczy, who takes them to the soiree hosted by Lord and Lady Brompton. Gideon is led away by Lavinia Rutland and Gwen befriends Lady Brompton and another woman, while having an immediate dislike for Mr. Merchant, who groped her, and Lady Lavinia, who flirts with Gideon. After accidentally drinking punch tinged with liquor, Gwen sings the song Memory from the musical Cats, with Gideon on the piano. Afterward, she meets the Count again, and also Lord Alastair, a man who descended from Conte di Madrone who founded the Florentine Alliance as a means of ridding the earth of demons, whom he believes are the time travelers. The ghost of Conte di Madrone behind Lord Alastair shouts curses at the travelers, along with making several threats. Gideon and Gwen leave the soiree to go to the church and back to the present, though Gideon is mad that Gwen had drunken the punch. Lesley sleeps over and the two search for clues to the Green Rider, with no results. The next day, Raphael correctly guesses the series of numbers and letters is a sort of GPS code, and while they are left to figure it out, Gwen heads to the Temple to elapse to the day before the soiree to meet with the Count. After Gideon is sent away with Lady Lavinia, the Count is delighted to see that Gwen has fallen for Gideon, stating that women in love were much easier to control, and congratulates Gideon for his work. Shocked, angry, and sad, Gwen confronts Gideon about it after they elapse to the present again, to which he denies pretending to fall in love with her, but doesn't deny tricking her. Gwen leaves the Temple, angry and heartbroken. In the epilogue, Paul meets with Lord Alastair, who gives him the Count's secret papers in exchange for the family trees of the male and female line of time travelers. Paul refuses to give the papers, claiming Alastair broke their promise by not coming alone and bringing his men. The three duel, but Paul is badly injured in his arm, and Gideon suddenly shows up, saving Paul, but not the documents about the family trees. Before Paul disappears, he urges Gideon, who truly does love Gwen, to read the secret documents and keep the circle from being closed in order to keep Gwen from dying.|$|R
