In fact, even though researchers have found that psychotherapy with homework is generally more effective than psychotherapy without homework, there have not been many efforts to research if specific types of homework are better at effecting positive treatment outcomes than others, or if certain environments help promote the positive effects of homework. For example, Helbig-Lang and colleagues found that, in an environment where systematic homework assignment procedures were rare but where overall homework compliance remained high, homework compliance was not positively related to treatment outcomes. Another group of researchers looked at patients with depression who were in remission and undergoing maintenance therapy and found that homework compliance did not correlate with treatment outcomes in this sample, either.

The effect is more pronounced as the energy threshold becomes more restrictive.

40|$|Christoph Willibald Gluck {{composed}} 6 one-act {{works in}} Vienna, which are occasional works praising the Imperial family. These works {{belong to the}} genre of serenata; however, {{they do not have}} the same designation at all. Actually, these designations are 'festa teatrale', 'azione teatrale', 'componimento drammatico', and 'serenata'. This thesis discusses these differrent designations. Did the contemporary librettists, the composer (Gluck), and the audience recognize the difference among the designations? The court poet Metastasio who wrote 4 works changed at least the style of the serenata according to its designation. On the whole, the audience perceived that these serenatas were 'little operas'. On the other hand, Gluck's autographs of 6 works have been lost entirely. Therefore, we are unable to know Gluck understood the designations as a composer, when he delivered his works from the librettists to the audience. The stylistic study will clear up this problem.
