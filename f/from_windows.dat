5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to disassembled binaries <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed disassembled and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E

5|$|According to StatCounter {{market share}} {{statistics}} (based on web use proxy), Iceland {{was the first}} country where Windows 10 was ranked first (not only on the desktop, it also holds across all platforms), with several bigger European countries following (a British Crown dependency Isle of Man got there first ahead of any country, late in 2015) and others such as Canada (most popular on desktops; iOS still more popular, ranked first). For one week late in November 2016, Windows 10 overtook first rank <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> 7 in the United States, before losing it again; it becomes more popular every weekend.|$|E

Soldiers and militiamen quickly entered the city, as militants were reportedly retreating, and seized the city's hospital. Following this, the Iraqi government was preparing to declare victory {{in the battle for}} the city. However, ISIL militants sprung an ambush, with suicide bombers reportedly leaping <b>from</b> <b>windows</b> into groups of soldiers. Government troops retreated from the city before sunset four kilometers to the south under constant mortar and sniper fire. Several security force vehicles were seen abandoned, with {{at least one of them}} burnt out. 52 soldiers and 40 militants were killed in the fighting.|$|E

Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft, longtime organist of St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. Of the 57 people who were injured, 21 had severe injuries.

An observation deck providing views of the incline, the city, and the valley is located {{on the opposite side of}} the station from the visitor center. Two hiking trails allow visitors to walk the slope. One is a sculpture trail, with works created in 1989 by local artist James Wolfe, who used remnants of the Bethlehem Steel factory in Johnstown.|$|E
5|$|Windows 10 {{incorporates}} Microsoft's intelligent personal assistant, Cortana, {{which was}} first introduced with Windows Phone 8.1 in 2014. Cortana replaced Windows' embedded search feature, supporting both text and voice input. Many of its features are a direct carryover <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> Phone, including integration with Bing, setting reminders, a Notebook feature for managing personal information, as well as searching for files, playing music, launching applications and setting reminders or sending emails. Cortana is implemented as a universal search box located alongside the Start and Task View buttons, which can be hidden or condensed to a single button.|$|E
5|$|Windows Mobile {{is based}} on the Windows CE kernel and first {{appeared}} as the Pocket PC 2000 operating system.

It allowed third party developers to develop software for Windows Mobile with no restrictions imposed by Microsoft. Software applications were purchasable <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> Marketplace for Mobile during the service's lifespan.|$|E

5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as human interface devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E
25|$|Although Windows {{does not}} {{natively}} support HFS+, an HFS+ volume on an AirPort Disk {{can be easily}} accessed <b>from</b> <b>Windows.</b> This is because the SMB/CIFS protocol used to access the disk, and hence access <b>from</b> <b>Windows</b> is filesystem-independent. Therefore, HFS+ is a viable option for Windows as well as OS X users, and more flexible than FAT32 as the latter has a 4GiB file size limit.|$|E
