5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's wheel, but was dropped on the flat. Quinziato soon had half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles, they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> spare. This was the second professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
5|$|The player {{does not}} receive any {{explicit}} guidance {{on how to}} play and is left to decipher the game's objectives through trial and error. Sabre Wulf graphics fill the screen with a minimal user interface consisting of the current game score, number of lives left and a high score meter on the top row. Sabreman can eat orchid power-ups, which bloom for only a <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> <b>to</b> turn the colour of the orchid and receive a temporary character effect. Some effects empower (e.g. invulnerability, increased speed) while others impair (e.g. reversing the player's controls). Sabreman can also collect treasure and extra lives scattered throughout the maze. The Spectrum and Commodore 64 releases include a two-player mode in which players take turns controlling their own Sabreman.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of geysers: {{fountain}} geysers which erupt from pools of water, typically in a series of intense, even violent, bursts; and cone geysers which erupt from cones or mounds of siliceous sinter (including geyserite), usually in steady jets that last anywhere from a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> several minutes. Old Faithful, perhaps the best-known geyser at Yellowstone National Park, {{is an example of a}} cone geyser. Grand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser on earth, (although Geysir in Iceland is taller, it is not predictable), also at Yellowstone National Park, is an example of a fountain geyser.|$|E

5|$|While a grind, lip, or manual {{trick is}} underway, a balance meter appears: unless the player {{prevents}} this meter from {{falling to the}} left or right, the character will bail and need a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> recover. Bailing can also be caused by falling without one's board facing downward. Completing tricks in succession without bailing is called a combo. Comboing raises the player's score and fills up the Special Meter; when it is full, the player is granted access to more elaborate tricks worth more points, such as the McTwist and 540 Flip. Underground introduces the ability to dismount one's skateboard, which allows the player to explore levels more carefully and reach new areas. Each level features at least one vehicle, usually a car, that the player can drive.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{paralysis}} is {{the temporary}} inability to talk or move when waking (or less often, when falling asleep). It may last a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> minutes. This is often frightening {{but is not}} dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The Judge Rotenberg Educational Center uses aversion therapy, notably {{contingent}} shock (electric shock {{delivered to}} the skin for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds),</b> <b>to</b> control the behavior of its patients, {{many of whom are}} autistic. The practice is controversial and has not been popular or used elsewhere since the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|The {{spinning}} sensation experienced from BPPV {{is usually}} triggered by {{movement of the}} head, will have a sudden onset, and can last anywhere from a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> several minutes. The most common movements patients report triggering a spinning sensation are tilting their heads upwards in order to look at something, and rolling over in bed.|$|E
25|$|Hemifacial {{sensorimotor}} seizures {{are often}} entirely localised {{in the lower}} lip or spread to the ipsilateral hand. Motor manifestations are sudden, continuous or bursts of clonic contractions, usually lasting from a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> a minute. Ipsilateral tonic deviation of the mouth is also common. Hemifacial sensory symptoms consist of unilateral numbness mainly {{in the corner of}} the mouth.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} practice in implementing name resolution in applications {{is to reduce}} the load on the Domain Name System servers by caching results locally, or in intermediate resolver hosts. Results obtained from a DNS request are always associated with the time to live (TTL), an expiration time after which the results must be discarded or refreshed. The TTL is set by the administrator of the authoritative DNS server. The period of validity may vary from a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> days or even weeks.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} the {{previous}} examples, {{the combination of a}} relatively large PRT and an immediate response may result in an unstable operation. Introducing a ramping profile of a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> leads <b>to</b> the damping of the power oscillations caused by the sudden disturbance.|$|R

25|$|Stretches and {{isometric}} exercises {{will aid}} in prevention for persons at risk. Stretching before the activity and during breaks will aid in alleviating tension at the wrist. Place the hand firmly {{on a flat}} surface and gently press for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> stretch the wrist and fingers. An example for an isometric exercise of the wrist is done by clenching the fist tightly, releasing and fanning out fingers. None of these stretches or exercises should cause pain or discomfort.|$|E
25|$|No pilot error or {{aircraft}} deficiency was found. Flight {{mass and}} centering were within norms. Owing to poor visibility, the crew could not detect the obstructions on the runway. While {{they did have}} some reasonable doubts {{as to whether or}} not the runway was occupied, these were allayed by the approach controller's reassurances. The crew had only a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> avoid the collision on the ground; they took evasive action, but could not possibly save the aircraft. They were thus absolved of any blame.|$|E
25|$|When {{people are}} healthy, the veins below their heart quickly constrict {{and the heart}} rate {{increases}} to minimize and compensate for the gravity effect. This is carried out involuntarily by the autonomic nervous system. The system usually requires a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> fully adjust and if the compensations are too slow or inadequate, the individual will suffer reduced {{blood flow to the}} brain, dizziness and potential blackout. Increases in G-loading, such as routinely experienced by aerobatic or combat pilots 'pulling Gs', greatly increases this effect. Repositioning the body horizontally largely eliminates the problem.|$|E

25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} due to focal seizures differ {{depending on}} {{the region of the}} brain where the seizure occurs. For example, visual hallucinations during occipital lobe seizures are typically visions of brightly colored, geometric shapes that may move across the visual field, multiply, or form concentric rings and generally persist from a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> a few minutes. They are usually unilateral and localized to one part of the visual field on the contralateral side of the seizure focus, typically the temporal field. However, unilateral visions moving horizontally across the visual field begin on the contralateral side and move toward the ipsilateral side.|$|E
25|$|The most {{frequent}} neurological origin of micropsia {{is a result}} of temporal lobe seizures. These seizures affect the entire visual field of the patient. More rarely, micropsia can be part of purely visual seizures. This in turn only affects one half of the visual field and is accompanied by other cerebral visual disturbances. The most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is medial temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex. Micropsia often occurs as an aura signalling a seizure in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Most auras last for a very short period, ranging from a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> a few minutes.|$|E
25|$|After twelve minutes, {{the first}} goal was scored by the Wanderers' Moose Johnson to {{increase}} the goal lead to nine. Ottawa's Frank McGee, Harry Smith, and McGee again scored before half-time, cutting the deficit to 10–4. Harry Smith would score to open the second half, followed by Rat Westwick. Then Westwick scored again to make it 10–7 before Harry Smith scored three straight goals to make the score 9–1, evening the series with ten minutes to play to tie the series, causing a five-minute standing ovation. With seven minutes to play Smith was sent off {{for the rest of}} the game and Lester Patrick would score with ninety seconds to play to put the Wanderers back in the lead. Patrick would ice the game with a goal with a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> play. The Silver Seven reign was over.|$|E
60|$|Just as {{the troop}} trotted past an {{incident}} occurred which disconcerted the hiders not a little.

The troop halted at once and challenged.|$|R

25|$|Exhibiting his {{trademark}} poise {{in front of}} an unfriendly crowd during a tough second-round game against Louisville, Law again provided a number of big shots. Hitting 13 of his 15 free-throw attempts, he ended the game with 26 points, including the final two points of the game. The Aggie's 72–69 victory earned them a berth in the Sweet 16 {{for the first time since}} 1980. In a show of good sportsmanship, Law spent time after the game consoling disappointed Louisville freshman Edgar Sosa, complimenting him on his performance. On March 22, however, Law and his teammates faced the #2 seed Memphis Tigers. The score was close throughout and Law had a chance to put A up by three on a break away lay up that he missed with just a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> play. The Aggies lost in a narrow contest 65–64, ending his collegiate career.|$|E
25|$|The cars, as built, {{featured}} an old {{style of}} WABCO passenger braking equipment previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule {{was known as}} AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore {{for the purposes of}} this notation, the P has been included in parentheses – as in Braking Schedule AM(P) – to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a braking effort took a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his braking effort so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the brakes). The AM(P) setup required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to.|$|E
25|$|Another {{behavior}} {{observed in}} D. media workers is gastral vibration. This is observed in workers of many Dolichovespula and Vespula species. Workers tap their gaster rapidly {{up and down}} onto the comb of the nest and this is associated with feeding of larvae. The behavior typically occurs while wasps are walking on the comb and ceases after feeding each larvae {{a small amount of}} flesh and then resumes before feeding the next larvae. A behavior that appears to be homologous to this is observed in the foundresses queen and is called tapping. Queens have been observed tapping mid or hind legs on the comb after returning with prey. These taps can last a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>to</b> a couple minutes and are loud enough to be heard outside of the nest. This signal is believed to function {{in the same way as}} gastral vibration in workers and is to signal to the larvae when it is time to feed. Sometimes this tapping or vibration occurs even when there is no pellet to feed the larvae and it is speculated that this corresponds to the feeding of liquids, but this has not been confirmed. Tapping continues in the queen even after she has ceased foraging when she feeding larvae pellets that she receives from the workers. This supports the idea that it is involved in signaling larvae during feeding.|$|E
