40|$|A {{wind wheel}} turbine (WWT) is studied. Evaluation of the {{probable}} performance, possible practical applications, and economic viability {{as compared to}} other conventional wind energy systems is discussed. The WWT apparatus is essentially a bladed wheel which is directly exposed to the wind on the upper half and exposed to wind through multiple ducting on the lower half. The multiple ducts consist of a forward duct (front concentrator) and two <b>side</b> <b>ducts</b> (<b>side</b> concentrators). The forced rotation of the wheel is then converted to power through appropriate subsystems. Test results on two simple models, a paper model and a stainless steel model, are reported. Measured values of power coefficients over wind speeds ranging from 4 to 16 m/s are given. An analytical model of a four bladed wheel is also developed.

50|$|As fire {{fighting}} arrangement, {{the building has}} one 15-cm diameter riser feeding first-aid hose reels as well as fire extinguishers. For feeding the hose reels, there are two overhead tanks. Connected to the air-conditioning plant is two large vertical shafts located {{at one end of}} the building going up to the roof—one meant for the supply of conditioned air and the other for return air. These shafts are closed at the top except for a small vent. All the floors have false ceilings made of Sitatex boards on wooden frames. The space above the false ceilings is utilised as plenum with three horizontal ducts running through the length of the building acting as supply air ducts. The central duct is of galvanised iron sheets. The side walls, above which the glass facings are fitted, has several openings on the window sills, through grills which communicate with the <b>side</b> <b>ducts</b> in the floor just below. These openings are also for the supply of conditioned air.

The requirement for compactness {{has led to the}} need for zigzag heat exchanger arrangement where the heat exchanger matrices are inclined to the cooling flows approaching them, but such an arrangement creates non-uniform mass flows through the cold fluid <b>side</b> intercooler <b>ducting</b> and the intercooler heat exchanger matrices. Design guidelines aimed at minimizing aerodynamic losses caused by the flow mal-distribution in such ducting is reported. Minimising the loss has the effect of optimising the heat transfer performance. Flow velocities and pressure distributions were measured experimentally in a simplified model of a heat exchanger and simulated in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Good agreement was found between measurement and predictions of the flow distribution in the cold fluid <b>side</b> intercooler <b>ducting</b> downstream of the heat exchanger matrices. A dominant jetting flow in the centre of each exit passage was identified as a source of aerodynamic loss. The CFD simulation has also shown that the main source of aerodynamic loss arises from the severe flow mal-distribution within the heat exchanger matrices. From these results, design guidelines are presented in this paper for the ducting, based on CFD studies on a series of simplified heat exchanger arrangement geometries...|$|R

The design and optimization of the structures and materials of AIS contributes to producing a quality reliable system, reducing noise, cost and weight at the same time, which are significant to improve the performance of engine and vehicle. Fresh air hoses/pipes are intended to transport, in air cleaner purified, air from the air cleaner to the throttle fitted on the inlet manifold or to the compressor fitted to the exhaust manifold. Air cleaner box is responsible for filtering out the dust and impurities in the air. The charge air pipes are intended to transport purified compressed air from the compressor to the charge air cooler and then to the throttle fitted on the inlet pipe. For the air cleaner box optimization, through the benchmarking and the innovation ideas from the daily life, two alternative optimized designs were introduced to reduce the cost and weight.

40|$|Renewed {{interest}} in hypersonic propulsion systems {{has led to}} research programs investigating combined cycle engines {{that are designed to}} operate efficiently across the flight regime. The Rocket-Based Combined Cycle Engine is a propulsion system under development at the NASA Lewis Research Center. This engine integrates a high specific impulse, low thrust-to-weight, airbreathing engine with a low-impulse, high thrust-to-weight rocket. From takeoff to Mach 2. 5, the engine operates as an air-augmented rocket. At Mach 2. 5, the engine becomes a dual-mode ramjet; and beyond Mach 8, the rocket is turned back on. One Rocket-Based Combined Cycle Engine variation known as the "Strut-Jet" concept is being investigated jointly by NASA Lewis, the U. S. Air Force, Gencorp Aerojet, General Applied Science Labs (GASL), and Lockheed Martin Corporation. Work thus far has included wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigations with the NPARC code. The CFD method was initiated by modeling the geometry of the Strut-Jet with the GRIDGEN structured grid generator. Grids representing a subscale inlet model and the full-scale demonstrator geometry were constructed. These grids modeled one-half of the symmetric inlet flow path, including the precompression plate, diverter, center <b>duct,</b> <b>side</b> <b>duct,</b> and combustor. After the grid generation, full Navier-Stokes flow simulations were conducted with the NPARC Navier-Stokes code. The Chien low-Reynolds-number k-e turbulence model was employed to simulate the high-speed turbulent flow. Finally, the CFD solutions were postprocessed with a Fortran code. This code provided wall static pressure distributions, pitot pressure distributions, mass flow rates, and internal drag. These results were compared with experimental data from a subscale inlet test for code validation; then they were used to help evaluate the demonstrator engine net thrust...|$|R

40|$|The low {{frequency}} sound interactions between coupled narrow sidebranch arrays installed in an infinitely long rectangular duct are investigated numerically using the finite-element method {{in the present}} study. The corresponding transmission losses achieved these coupled sidebranch arrays are also examined. The interactions between the coupled sidebranch arrays result in both dipole-like and quadrupole-like radiations into the main duct. Results show that the coupling of two sidebranch arrays of different sidebranch length series side-by-side on one <b>side</b> of the <b>duct</b> wall can improve the performance in term of spectral uniformity of sound transmission loss compared with the cases where only one array covers the whole spanwise width of the duct.

We present long‐term results of patients operated with duodenum‐preserving pancreatic head resection (DPPHR) combined with a Partington‐Rochelle duct drainage in cases of chronic pancreatitis with multiple stenosis and dilatation of the <b>side</b> <b>ducts.</b> Methods and patientsFrom April 1982 to September 2001, in 55 out of 538 patients with chronic pancreatitis, a DPPHR with additionally Partington‐Rochelle duct drainage was performed (44 male, 11 female, mean age 45. 8 years). Ninety‐two percent of the patients suffered from alcoholic pancreatitis. Medical respective pain treatment for chronic pancreatitis was in median 64. 5 months prior to surgery. The indications for surgery were in 87 % pain, 59 % of the patients had an inflammatory mass in the head of the pancreas, 36 % a common bile duct stenosis and 5 % a severe stenosis of the duodenum. The endocrine function (OGGT) was impaired in 79 % of the patients preoperatively. ResultsHospital mortality was 0 %, postoperative complications occurred in 11 patients. Follow‐up: All except 2 patients were followed up in the outpatient clinic with the mean follow‐up time of 69. 7 months (8 – 105 months), the late mortality was 9 %.

40|$|Lobatostoma manteri sp. nov. is described. It {{differs from}} {{other species of}} this genus {{in the number of}} {{marginal}} alveoli (usually 56 – 62), the location of the testis near the posterior end and the large size of the cirrus pouch. Mature worms occur in the intestine of the fish Trachinotus blochi. Eggs containing fully developed larvae are laid. The eggs are eaten by snails and hatch in the stomach. Larvae have an oral sucker, pharynx, simple caecum, ventro-terminal acetabulum, two dorsal excretory bladder cells in front of the acetabulum, and a caudal appendage. They migrate into the digestive gland and differentiate to pre-adults with fully developed genital organs and the full number of alveoli on the adhesive disk; young spermatozoa and egg cells develop but do not mature. Pre-adults have a minimum number of 8500 sensory papillae on the surface. The worms are usually found in a cavity formed by enlargement of the main duct and one or more (?) <b>side</b> <b>ducts</b> of the digestive gland near the stomach in Cerithium moniliferum, or in the stomach and main ducts of the digestive gland of Peristernia australiensis. They may creep from the ducts into the stomach and back into the ducts. Fish become infected by eating snails. Worms from fish die soon after transfer into sea water but can be kept alive for up to 13 days in frog 2 ̆ 7 s Ringer solution or dilute sea water (1 : 5), in which they lay eggs containing larvae infective to snails. Worms from snails remain alive in sea water, dilute sea water, frog 2 ̆ 7 s Ringer or Tyrode solution. Eggs of worms from single infections have the haploid chromosome number of 7; there is normally no self-fertilization and development does not reach the blastula stage.
