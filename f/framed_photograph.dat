He also asked all police corporations to continue fighting organized crime. Solorio Aréchiga read the names of all the officers killed, but had to stop momentarily to sob.

Sue's table had a moderate show, two men in their filigree and velvet frames standing together beside her looking-glass.|$|R

60|$|He {{then went}} into lodgings at Alfredston, and saw in a shopwindow the little handbill announcing the sale of his father-in-law's furniture. He noted its date, which came and passed without Jude's going near the place, or perceiving that the traffic out of Alfredston by the {{southern}} road was materially increased by the auction. A few days later he entered a dingy broker's shop in {{the main street of}} the town, and amid a heterogeneous collection of saucepans, a clothes-horse, rolling-pin, brass candlestick, swing looking-glass, and other things {{at the back of the}} shop, evidently just brought in from a sale, he perceived a <b>framed</b> <b>photograph,</b> which turned out to be his own portrait.|$|E
6000|$|That {{night he}} went into her room. She {{received}} him in the most matter-of-fact way, as {{if there had been}} no scene between them. And he returned to his own room with a curious sense of peace. If one didn't choose to see, one needn't. And he did not choose--in future he did not choose. There was nothing to be gained by it--nothing! Opening the drawer he took from the sachet a handkerchief, and the <b>framed</b> <b>photograph</b> of Fleur. When he had looked at it a little he slipped it down, and there was that other one--that old one of Irene. An owl hooted while he stood in his window gazing at it. The owl hooted, the red climbing roses seemed to deepen in colour, there came a scent of lime-blossom. God! That had been a different thing! Passion--Memory! Dust! ...|$|E

60|$|Sitting-room in Paramore's {{apartments in}} Savile Row. The darkly respectable {{furniture}} is, so to speak, en suite with Paramore's frock coat and cuffs.

Another door, a light, noiseless partition one covered with a green baize, is in the right hand wall toward the back, leading to Paramore's consulting room. The fireplace is on the left. At the nearest corner of it a couch is placed at right angles to the wall, settlewise. On the right the wall is occupied by a bookcase, further forward than the green baize door.

6000|$|There {{was nothing}} very {{peculiar}} about Jane's little sitting-room: just the ordinary English landlady's parlour. You know the type:--square {{table in the}} middle; bright blue vases on the mantelpiece; chromo-lithograph from the Illustrated London News on the wall; rickety whatnot with glass-shaded wax-flowers in the recess by the window. But over in one corner I chanced to observe a <b>framed</b> <b>photograph</b> of early execution, which hung faded and dim there. Perhaps it was because my father was such a scientific amateur; but photography, I found out in time, struck the key-note of my history in every chapter. I didn't know why, but this particular picture attracted me strangely. It came from The Grange, Jane told me: she'd hunted {{it out in the}} attic over the front bedroom after the house was shut up. It belonged to a lot of my father's early attempts that were locked in a box there. [...] "He'd always been trying experiments and things," [...] she said, [...] "with photography, poor gentleman." ...|$|E

His age is about thirty-five his [...] figure thin and very upright and his clean-shorn face thin, [...] upright, narrow, with long and rather pointed ears; his dark [...] hair is brushed in a coxcomb off his forehead. A faint smile [...] hovers about his lips that Nature has made rather full and he [...] has made thin, as though keeping a hard secret; but his bright [...] grey eyes, dark round the rim, look out and upwards almost as if [...] he were being crucified. There is something about the whole of [...] him that makes him seen not quite present. A gentle creature, [...] burnt within.|$|E
