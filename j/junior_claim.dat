50|$|The House of York was a cadet {{branch of}} the English royal House of Plantagenet. Three of its members became Kings of England in the late 15th century. The House of York was descended in the male line from Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, the fourth {{surviving}} son of Edward III, but also represented Edward's senior line, being cognatic descendants of Lionel, Duke of Clarence, Edward III's second surviving son. It is based on these descents that they claimed the English crown. Compared with the House of Lancaster, it had a senior claim to the throne of England according to cognatic primogeniture but <b>junior</b> <b>claim</b> according to the agnatic primogeniture. The reign of this dynasty ended {{with the death of}} Richard III of England in 1485. It became extinct in the male line with the death of Edward Plantagenet, 17th Earl of Warwick in 1499.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{focuses on}} the (contractual) subordination of claims in Belgian insolvency law. Based on the functional comparative law method (The Netherlands, France, UK and US), the research aims to qualify the subordination of claims and to analyse its validity and enforceability vis-à-vis third parties. The research has demonstrated that: 1. A basic distinction {{needs to be made}} between subordination agreements that aim to modify the rank of the <b>junior</b> <b>claim</b> in insolvency proceedings and subordination agreements that create an order of payment outside insolvency proceedings without affectingthe rank of the <b>junior</b> <b>claim.</b> 2. The effects of subordination depend upon the structure of the subordination agreement. 3. Contractual subordination is valid and does not infringe the pari passu or paritas creditorum rule. 4. Third parties, i. e. other creditors who do not benefit from the subordination areheld to recognise the effects of the subordination between the junior and the senior; 5. In insolvency proceedings such as bankruptcy proceedings, the trustee or administrator is held to give effect to contractual subordination agreements. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Many {{financial}} claims specify fixed maximum payments, varying seniority, and absolute priority for more senior investors. These features are motivated {{in a model}} where a firm’s manager contracts with several investors and firm output can only be verified privately at a cost. Debt-like contracts of varying seniority generally dominate symmetric contracts, and, when investors are risk neutral, it is optimal to use debtlike contracts where more senior claims have absolute priority over more <b>junior</b> <b>claims.</b> In addition to motivating severalfeatures of debt and preferred stock, the model offers an explanation for structures used in leveraged buyouts, assetbacked securitizations, and reinsurance contracts. Although firms issue many different {{financial claims}}, three features are quite common.

40|$|We examine 971 pure {{leverage}} decreases {{consisting of}} junior-for-senior transactions. This sample [...] which {{is unique in}} size and in the variety of junior and senior forms of borrowing that are included [...] enables us to extend the junior-for-senior research by testing for a wealth effect linked to adverse selection theory. This theory argues that the market penalizes firms when more <b>junior</b> <b>claims</b> are increased over more senior claims. Consistent with this theory, we find that common-for-nonconvertible debt transactions have significantly more negative announcement period returns than other less extreme junior-for-senior transactions. Regression tests further support an adverse selection effect by indicating that an observation's location within the common-for-nonconvertible debt group is a key explanatory variable in accounting for stock price behavior. In support of an adverse selection interpretation, we cannot link {{the significance of this}} variable to signaling effects premised on changes in fractional insider shareholdings or in relative debt levels...|$|R
40|$|Subject to {{the usual}} disclaimer, {{the authors would like}} to thank an {{anonymous}} referee of this journal for helpful comments and suggestions. 2 The literature on interlinkage is inconclusive regarding the strict superiority of this arrangement. We analyze a landlord and a moneylender as two players making non-cooperative decisions regarding the terms of their respective contracts with a tenant. In the sequential game where the landlord moves first and the tenant has limited liability, we demonstrate that there exist circumstances in which interlinkage is superior, even with nonlinear loan contracts, a result that carries over when there is moral hazard. The incorporation of risk aversion yields strict superiority in general. The main result is unaffected by changes in the seniority of claims, but is sensitive to changes in the order of moves: limited liability ceases to ensure the strict superiority of interlinked contracts if the principal who provides the variable factor of production moves first, even if he has <b>junior</b> <b>claims</b> to the output. 3 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide new {{evidence}} on the value-creation process taking place in bankruptcy procedures that belong to different legal systems (French civil law, German civil law, and common law) : to do so, we assess to which extent the debtor’s value can be preserved under bankruptcy by analyzing the recovery rates in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We use a unique European sample of 900 corporate bankruptcy files that were manually collected in commercial courts on the period 1993 - 2005. We also contribute to the literature by considering the recovery rates on the various classes of claimants (senior <b>claims,</b> <b>junior</b> <b>claims,</b> and new money) for each bankruptcy procedure. Our main conclusions are: (a) France and Germany show quite similar global recovery rates which are greater than in the UK, (b) when controlling for the quality of assets at the beginning of the procedure and for the structure of claims, we observe that recovery rates are not significantly different between France and the UK, while they remain greater for German companies, (c) Germany has the greatest recovery rates for senior and junior creditors, (d) the reorganization procedure and the liquidation procedure leading to the highest global recovery rate are, respectively, the French continuation and the German liquidation.
