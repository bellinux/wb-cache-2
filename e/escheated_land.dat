However, the jail and courthouse were built in Desertmartin, the middle of the Barony of Loughinsholin, which then lay in neighbouring County Tyrone.

40|$|The subject {{concerns}} {{the settlement of}} English families in southern Ireland after the death in rebellion of the last earl of Desmond. The survey commission of 1584 reveals the fragmented extent of <b>escheated</b> <b>land</b> and the haphazard nature of confiscation. The decision to colonise from England was not taken until consideration {{had been made of}} several alternative schemes. It is shown that the questions of moral legitimacy for the plantation and the general thrust of government policy - much worried over by historians today - did not preoccupy those planning the Munster venture. Brief mention is made over the background of the settlers and their recruitment and grouping. It is shown that a proportion of leading colonists were army men or administrators on the Irish establishment, many of whom with insufficient wealth or influence in England to promote their stipulated settlement. Because of faulty direction and the practical difficulties of such a vast project, assigning land and settling the newcomers took several years. Land claims from local inhabitants further slowed events. The English settlers in the 1590 s numbered 3, 500 and invested about 20, 000 in the plantation. This sum and the small population proved inadequate faced with the rising in 1598. Re-establishment of the plantation in the 17 th century was at a much higher level, the English population becoming four times greater in the 1620 s than the 1590 s, and powerful enough to control a considerable area after the 1641 rebellion. Motives for this increased emigration to Munster are then examined. The traditional reasons - land, new jobs, religious freedom, social advancement, escape from authority - are paraded and found wanting. The final, geographical explanation comes in the last chapter which also establishes {{the extent to which the}} English modified Munster and in turn were changed by local conditions. In an appendix are included brief biographical entries of the 35 chief settlers and the fate of their portions up to 1641. <p...|$|E

In August 1608, he went with Chichester to view the <b>escheated</b> <b>lands,</b> reporting that the people, [...] "wondered as much to see the king's deputy as the ghosts in Vurgil wondered to see AEneas alive in hellsic".

On 17 April 1613 he was named a privy councillor, and the same year he was chosen knight of the shire for Armagh. in the Irish Parliament. On 19 February 1615 he was made master of the ordnance, and on 10 May of the same year one of the council for the province of Munster.

He passed them on to his cousin, Sir Henry Mervyn of Hampshire, who in turn passed them on to his son, Captain James Mervyn. He arrived here around 1620, began building a castle which was completed in 1628 and the new town of Trillick was completed in the 1630s. The castle was described {{as one of the best}} of its kind and was occupied up until the 19th century, being vacant in 1814. It had then passed to General Mervyn Archdale, who built the hunting lodge at Glengeen. The Mervyns were noted parliamentarians, holding the Tyrone seat in Parliament from 1639 to 1747 and Captain Audley Mervyn being Speaker of the Irish Parliament from 1661-66.|$|R

5000|$|Escheat {{could also}} take place if a tenant was outlawed or {{convicted of a}} felony, when the King could {{exercise}} the ancient right of wasting the criminal's land {{for a year and}} a day, and after that the land would return to the lord. (However, one guilty of treason (rather than felony) forfeited all lands to the King. John and his heirs frequently insisted on seizing terrae Normannorum, [...] "lands of the Normans", the English land of those who preferred to be Normans rather than Englishmen when the victories of Philip Augustus forced a proclamation of allegiance.) Since disavowal of a feudal bond was considered a felony, lords could <b>escheat</b> <b>land</b> from those who refused to be true to their feudal services. On the other hand, there were tenants who were sluggish in performing their duties, while not being outright rebellious against the lord. Remedies in the courts against this sort of thing, even in Bracton's day, were available, but were considered laborious and frequently ineffectual in compelling the desired performance. The commonest mechanism would be distraint, also called distress (districtio): the lord would seize some chattel, and hold it until performance was achieved. This practice had been dealt with in the 1267 Statute of Marlborough. Even so, it remained the most common extrajudicial method applied by the lords at the time of Quia Emptores.|$|R
5000|$|Acquinsicke {{takes its}} name from a 1,000 acre tract of <b>escheat</b> <b>land</b> {{patented}} by Anthony Neale in 1704. Originally known as White's Ford and renamed Acquinsicke by Neale, the 1,000 acre had formerly been granted to Jerome White in 1669. White had immigrated to Maryland from England as a free adult about 1661. A Catholic, apparently well educated, he held a number of important and influential positions, including that of deputy governor in 1669 and the colony's Surveyor General, 1661-1671. White received land grants totaling more than 1,000 acre — most of which reverted to the Lords Baltimore [...] when White died in England intestate and without heirs in 1677. The White's Ford grc: of 1,000 acre was one of those that es cheated to the proprietor. When the tract was resurveyed for Anthony Neale the boundaries were found to embrace 572 acre more than the 1,000 acre stipulated in White's grant. To correct this discrepancy. Neale was requested to [...] " ... leave out the surplus age where he should think convenient [...] [...].

It is known to have derived from a word or descriptive term used by Native Americans who continued to occupy this section of Charles County at the time that Neale patented the property. It may even have been the name of a small village that once existed on or near the land.|$|R

This meant that when Llywelyn rebelled, the English interpreted it {{as an act of}} treason. Accordingly, his <b>lands</b> <b>escheated</b> to the king of England, and Edward I took possession of the Principality of Wales by military conquest from 1282 to 1283.

25|$|In {{response}} to these tactics, the 1920 version of the California Alien Land Law included more stringent rules designed {{to put a stop}} to such circumvention. Among other changes, it introduced a provision that would prove to be crucial in the Oyama case – namely, it stated that if a person purchased land in another person’s name, it would be presumed that this was done with intent to bypass the Alien Land Law. This was a significant shift in the rules regarding burden of proof in state <b>escheat</b> cases involving <b>land.</b> Whereas before the State would have to prove its case, this was no longer the situation – it was now incumbent upon the defendant to prove that the purchased land was a bona fide gift rather than an attempt at getting around the land ownership restrictions.|$|R
50|$|In the {{language}} of English law of landlord and tenant {{the concept of the}} feudal overlord persists.

In Cornwall today land is still in theory held from the Duke of Cornwall as lord paramount. In the case of English <b>land</b> <b>escheating</b> situated within the Duchy of Lancaster or the Duchy of Cornwall, it reverts to the overlords the Duke of Lancaster (the monarch) and the Duke of Cornwall (the monarch's eldest son), possibly the only two surviving quasi-paramount feudal lords surviving in England other than the monarch.|$|R

40|$|Professor Gray, in {{the first}} edition of his great work, 2 ̆ 2 The Rule Against Perpetuities, 2 ̆ 2 Section 31 and following, contended that the Statute Quia Emptores by putting an end to tenure between feoffor and feoffee of an estate in fee simple, {{incidentally}} put an end to possibility of reverter to the feoffer on failure of the condition in a determihable fee. Specifically he says that upon dissolution of an eleemosynary corporation a terminable gift to such corporation does not revert to the donor, as is said by Lord Coke, Co. LITT. 13 b, but escheats. For reversion depends on tenure, and the Statute by destroying tenure ends possibility of reverter.

25|$|Bracton {{considered}} {{the case of}} when a tenant made a gift of frankalmoin - a gift of land to the Church. A wardship would be of no value at all. An <b>escheat</b> of the <b>land</b> (a reclamation of the land by the overlord) would allow the owner {{to take control of}} the land. But the act of placing the land in frankalmoin left it in the hands of a group of lawyers or others who allowed the use of the land by a Church organization. The overlord would have nominal control of the corporation which had never entered into a feudal homage arrangement. The corporation owed nothing to the overlord. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him the lord is not really injured. His rights to the land remain unscathed. It is true they have been significantly diminished. He had suffered damnum, but there had been no iniuria. Bracton was of the opinion that a gift of land to the Church could be voided by the heirs, but not the lord.|$|R

50|$|Escheat {{can still}} occur in England and Wales, {{if a person}} is made {{bankrupt}} or a corporation is liquidated. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in' (transferred to) the Official Receiver or Trustee in Bankruptcy. However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by disclaiming it. It is relatively common for a trustee in bankruptcy to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt's legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate, so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively <b>escheats</b> to become <b>land</b> held by the Crown in demesne. This situation affects a few hundred properties each year.|$|R
