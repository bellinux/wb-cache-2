5|$|Kalimpong {{is a major}} ginger {{growing area}} of India. Kalimpong {{and the state of}} Sikkim {{together}} contribute 15 percent of ginger produced in India. The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region is internationally famous for its tea industry. However, most of the tea gardens are on the western side of Teesta river (towards the town of Darjeeling) and so tea gardens near Kalimpong contribute only 4percent of total tea production of the region. In Kalimpong division, 90percent of land is cultivable but only 10percent is used for tea production. Kalimpong is well known for its flower export industry—especially for its wide array of indigenous orchids and <b>gladioli.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tempe bongkrèk is {{a variety}} of tempeh from Central Java, notably Banyumas regency, that is {{prepared}} with coconut. This type of tempeh occasionally gets contaminated with the bacterium Burkholderia <b>gladioli,</b> and the unwanted organism produces toxins (bongkrek acid and toxoflavin) from the coconut, besides killing off the Rhizopus fungus due to the antibiotic activity of bongkrek acid.|$|E
25|$|Like her ever-present {{bunches of}} <b>gladioli,</b> {{one of the}} most popular and {{distinctive}} features of Edna's stage and TV appearances has been her extravagant wardrobe, with gaudy, custom-made gowns that satirically outdo the most outrageous creations of Hollywood showbiz designers such as Bob Mackie. Her costumes, most of which were created for her by Australian designer Bill Goodwin, routinely incorporate Aussie kitsch icons such as the flag, Australian native animals and flowers, the Sydney Opera House and the boxing kangaroo.|$|E
25|$|Fatalities from {{contaminated}} tempe bongkrèk {{were once}} {{common in the}} area where it was produced. Thus, its sale is now prohibited by law; clandestine manufacture continues, however, due to the popular flavor. The problem of contamination is not encountered with bean and grain tempehs, which have a different composition of fatty acids that is not favorable for the growth of B. <b>gladioli,</b> but encourages growth of Rhizopus instead. When bean or grain tempeh has the proper color, texture and smell, it is a very strong indication the product is safe. Yellow tempe bongkrèk is always highly toxic due to toxoflavin, but tempe bongkrèk with a normal coloration may still contain lethal amounts of bongkrek acid.|$|E
25|$|He named Stark Bro’s Nurseries & Orchards Co. {{to carry}} on the work. Considerable {{argument}} has been spent upon whether the plants were technically willed to Stark Bro’s; they were not. He left everything to Elizabeth: money, personal property, real estate, dozens of municipal utility bonds — and the plants and precious seeds. Elizabeth had first approached both Stanford and Berkeley to have either or both universities take over the experimental farm, but sold to Stark when those proffers didn’t materialize. Mrs. Burbank entered into an agreement with Stark Bro’s on Aug 23, 1927 to take the material they wanted from Burbank’s properties. The contract included ownership of the business name and all of the customer information. A September 6, 1927 contract provided exclusive rights to sell uncompleted experiments with fruits at Sebastopol (except the Royal and Paradox) for 10 years. Stark Bro’s had right of renewal. Tax receipts indicate payments of $27,000 to Mrs. Burbank. Exciting new kinds of fruits and flowers Burbank had developed (but never marketed) included 120 types of plums, 18 peaches, 28 apples, 500 hybrid roses, 30 cherries, 34 pears, 52 <b>gladioli</b> and many more. Stark Bro’s subsequently introduced many of these varieties in their catalog.|$|E
500|$|The Netherlands, {{which is}} the most {{important}} source of flower bulbs worldwide is also a major centre of narcissus production. Of 16,700 hectares (ha) under cultivation for flower bulbs, narcissi account for about 1,800 hectares. In the 1990s narcissus bulb production was at 260 million, sixth in size after tulips, <b>gladioli,</b> irises, crocuses and lilies and in 2012 it was ranked third. About two-thirds of the area under cultivation is dedicated to about 20 of the most popular varieties. In the 2009/2010 season 470 cultivars were produced on 1578ha.

500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving <b>gladioli.</b> A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates liked them — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, did you see that poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{reason behind}} McMahon's sacking {{did not become}} public {{knowledge}} for many years. In its obituary of him in 2002, McMahon was described by Wisden as [...] "a man who embraced the antipodean virtues of candour and conviviality". It went on: [...] "Legend tells of {{a night at the}} Flying Horse Inn in Nottingham when he beheaded the <b>gladioli</b> with an ornamental sword, crying: 'When Mac drinks, everybody drinks!'" [...] The obituary recounts a further escapade in second eleven match at Midsomer Norton where a curfew imposed on the team was circumvented by [...] "a POW-type loop" [...] organised by McMahon, [...] "with his team-mates escaping through a ground-storey window and then presenting themselves again". As the only Somerset second eleven match that McMahon played in at Midsomer Norton was right {{at the end of the}} 1957 season, this may have been the final straw. But in any case there had been [...] "an embarrassing episode at Swansea's Grand Hotel" [...] earlier in the season, also involving Jim Hilton, who was also dismissed at the end of the season. Team-mates and club members petitioned for McMahon to be reinstated, but the county club was not to be moved.|$|E
60|$|She {{went down}} to Ciccio where he was weeding armfuls of rose-red <b>gladioli</b> from the half-grown wheat, and cutting the lushness of the first weedy herbage. He threw down his sheaves of <b>gladioli,</b> and with his sickle began to cut the forest of bright yellow corn-marigolds. He looked intent, he seemed to work feverishly.|$|E
60|$|We {{climbed up}} the water-course in the mountain-side, up to a smooth little lawn under the olive trees, where daisies were {{flowering}} and <b>gladioli</b> were in bud. It was a tiny little lawn of grass in a level crevice, and sitting there we had the world below us--the lake, the distant island, the far-off low Verona shore.|$|E
60|$|TWO {{or three}} weeks had passed since the concert on the Low Wood lawn, and Thérèse Clavier had gone back into the obscurity she came from, when Nettie Harding once more stood beside the effigy in Northrop church. It was then late in the afternoon, and the little ancient {{building}} was growing shadowy. Hester Earle and Violet Wayne were moving about the aisle with bundles of wheat‐ears and streamers of ivy, for the harvest thanksgiving was shortly to be celebrated, while the vicar stood waiting their directions on the chancel steps with a great handful of crimson <b>gladioli.</b>|$|E
60|$|So the sailor-man got {{upon the}} raft again and paddled {{over to the}} Magic Isle, landing {{as close to the}} golden flower-pot as he could. They watched him walk across the land, put both arms around the flower-pot and lift it easily from its place. Then he carried it to the raft and set it down very gently. The removal did not seem to affect the Magic Flower in any way, for it was growing daffodils when Cap'n Bill picked it up and {{on the way to the}} raft it grew tulips and <b>gladioli.</b> During the time the sailor was {{paddling}} across the river to where his friends awaited him, seven different varieties of flowers bloomed in succession on the plant.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile the {{declaration}} of war drew nearer, and became inevitable. She knew Ciccio would go. And with him went the chance of her escape. She steeled herself to bear the agony of the knowledge that he would go, {{and she would be}} left alone in this place, which sometimes she hated with a hatred unspeakable. After a spell of hot, intensely dry weather she felt she would die in this valley, wither and go to powder as some exposed April roses withered and dried into dust against a hot wall. Then the cool wind came in a storm, the next day there was grey sky and soft air. The rose-coloured wild <b>gladioli</b> among the young green corn were a dream of beauty, the morning of the world. The lovely, pristine morning of the world, before our epoch began. Rose-red <b>gladioli</b> among corn, in among the rocks, and small irises, black-purple and yellow blotched with brown, like a wasp, standing low in little desert places, that would seem forlorn but for this weird, dark-lustrous magnificence. Then there were the tiny irises, only one finger tall, growing in dry places, frail as crocuses, and much tinier, and blue, blue as the eye of the morning heaven, which was a morning earlier, more pristine than ours. The lovely translucent pale irises, tiny and morning-blue, they lasted only a few hours. But nothing could be more exquisite, like gods on earth. It was the flowers that brought back to Alvina the passionate nostalgia for the place. The human influence was a bit horrible to her. But the flowers that came out and uttered the earth in magical expression, they cast a spell on her, bewitched her and stole her own soul away from her.|$|E
60|$|When {{he called}} {{the next morning at}} an old country house, he was told that Miss Massie was in the garden, and going there, he stopped {{abruptly}} at a gap in a shrubbery. Beyond the opening there was a stretch of smooth grass, checkered by moving shadow, and at one side a row of <b>gladioli</b> glowed against the paler bloom of yellow dahlias. Helen Massie held a bunch of the tall crimson spikes, and Dick thought as he watched her with a beating heart that she was like the flowers. They were splendid in form and color, but there was nothing soft or delicate in their aggressive beauty. Helen's hair was dark and her color high, her black eyes were bright, and her yellow dress showed a finely outlined form. Dick knew that she was proud, resolute, and self-confident.|$|E
60|$|Honora {{put on a}} linen hat {{and they}} took the gravelled path to the stables, where the horses, one by one, were brought out into the {{courtyard}} for their inspection. In anticipation of this hour there was a blood bay for Honora, which Chiltern had bought in New York. She gave a little cry of delight {{when she saw the}} horse shining in the sunlight, his nostrils in the air, his brown eyes clear, his tapering neck patterned with veins. And then there was the dairy, with the fawn-coloured cows and calves; and the hillside pastures that ran down to the river, and the farm lands where the stubbled grain was yellowing. They came back by the path that wound through the trees and shrubbery bordering the lake to the walled garden, ablaze in the mellow sunlight with reds and purples, salvias and zinnias, dahlias, <b>gladioli,</b> and asters.|$|E
