Even the smallest adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if they'd seen [...] "the" [...] <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> rather than [...] "a" [...] <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> provided the respondent with a presupposition {{that there was a}} <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> in the scene. This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had indeed seen the <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Vandalism, {{in written}} form, {{is very common}} in urban centres. Public {{property}} is a common target of vandals. In this study, the language of vandalism on <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> in Montreal was examined. The language of the vandalism (English, French and Hebrew) was compared to the official language of the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> (English: <b>STOP,</b> French: ARRET). A statistically {{significant difference was found}} in comparing the prevalence of English and French vandalism and the language of the <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> on which the vandalism was found. English vandalism was very common on ARRET signs, whereas French vandalism was very rare on <b>STOP</b> <b>signs...</b>|$|R
50|$|Some {{drivers have}} {{complained about the}} {{installation}} of the new <b>stop</b> <b>signs,</b> due to concerns about traffic jams. Many drivers have also driven past the <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> and the crosswalks without stopping, which could be a safety issue for pedestrians.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviewed}} over 70 {{technical papers}} covering all-way stops (or multi-way stops) and their {{success and failure}} as traffic control devices in residential areas. This study is the most comprehensive found on multi-way <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> The study looked at how multi-way <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> {{have been used as}} traffic calming measures to control speed. There have been 23 hypotheses studied using multi-way stop as speed control. The research found an additional 9 hypotheses studied showing the effect multi way stops have on other traffic engineering problems. The research found that, overwhelmingly, multi-way <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> do NOT control speed except under very limited conditions. The research shows that the concerns about unwarranted <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> are well founded...|$|R
40|$|A {{computer}} based choice reaction time task {{was used to}} investigate the knowledge and the association strength of n= 57 participants {{with regard to the}} St. Andrew’s cross. Within three conditions, it was compared to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and a combination <b>sign</b> (<b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> + St. Andrew’s cross) as second and third target sign. Participants had to react as fast and correctly as possible to three series of traffic signs that were presented to them on a computer screen. In each of three conditions, participants showed significantly more incorrect judgments with regard to the meaning of the St. Andrew’s cross compared to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> as well as the combination sign. With regard to the choice reaction time, participants reacted significantly slower to the St Andrews cross compared to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and the combination sign {{in the second and third}} condition. The retrieval of the correct schemata in case of the St. Andrew’s cross appeared to be more difficult than in the case of the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and the combination sign. These results support the use of the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> at passive railway level crossings in addition to the St. Andrew’s cross...|$|R
25|$|A <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is {{a traffic}} sign, usually erected at road {{junctions}} {{such as a}} four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised {{the first set of}} traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver. However, the first use of <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.|$|R
25|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>signs</b> {{are often}} used in North America to control {{conflicting}} traffic movements at intersections that are not busy enough to justify the installation of a traffic signal or roundabout. In the United States, the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is not intended {{for use as a}} traffic calming device; it is intended to be installed mainly for safety and/or to assign right-of-way for a certain direction. Nevertheless, in the United States, Mexico and Canada, <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> are commonly deployed as supposed safety measures in residential areas and near places where children play or walk (such as schoolyards), or that experience frequent automobile collisions, making extra precautions necessary. <b>Stop</b> <b>signs</b> may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in three- and four-way stops. However, studies have confirmed that <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> do not offer measurable safety benefits over the Yield approach adopted in the countries listed above based on original European research dating back many decades.|$|R

2500|$|A {{pivoting}} arm {{equipped with}} a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> {{is a piece of}} equipment required by law on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat {{on the left side of}} the bus, and is deployed by the driver while picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the [...] legend, or with a [...] legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> this sign requires other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain <b>stopped</b> until the <b>sign</b> is retracted.|$|R

25|$|Laws and {{regulations}} regarding how drivers {{must comply with}} a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled by <b>stop</b> <b>signs,</b> generally the driver who arrives and stops first continues first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled by <b>stop</b> <b>signs,</b> generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right.|$|R
25|$|The already-widespread {{use of the}} MUTCD <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> {{became law}} in the United States in 1966. In 1968, this sign {{was adopted by the}} Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals as part of United Nations Economic Commission for Europe's effort to {{standardize}} road travel across borders. The Convention specifies that 'stop' be written in English or the national language and allows an alternative circular yellow sign. Many European countries are party to the Convention. English-speaking countries, the exception being India, are not party to the Convention but usually use the red octagonal <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> per their own standards, like the MUTCD. Even in countries not associated with either standard mentioned above, the red octagonal <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is often used. Unique types of <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> may still be observed in countries like Japan.|$|R
40|$|Many {{automobile}} accidents {{occur at}} intersections, {{which are often}} controlled by <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> and traffic lights. Understanding how a driver interprets, anticipates, and responds to <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> and traffic lights could help increase the safety and usability of these devices. How drivers brake when approaching traffic control devices of differing levels of uncertainty was examined and compared. The uncertainty associated with the variable message presented in a traffic light was compared to a <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b> A series of videos depicting these scenarios were shown to drivers, and their brake onset times were recorded. It was discovered that drivers began braking sooner when approaching a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> compared to approaching a traffic light. Several other interactions were also investigated, but found to be of no significance. Faculty Mentor: Dr. Gregory Cors...|$|R
