Waste glass can be utilized in construction materials, and understanding its effects on material properties is crucial in developing advanced materials. In this study, recycled crushed and <b>expanded</b> <b>glasses</b> are used as lightweight aggregates for concrete, and their relation to the material characteristics and properties is investigated using several approaches. Lightweight concrete specimens containing only crushed and <b>expanded</b> waste <b>glass</b> as fine aggregates are produced, and their pore and structural characteristics are examined using image-based methods, such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray computed tomography (CT), and automated image analysis (RapidAir). The thermal properties of the materials are measured using both Hot Disk and ISOMET devices to enhance measurement accuracy. Mechanical properties are also evaluated, and the correlation between material characteristics and properties is evaluated. As a control group, a concrete specimen with natural fine sand is prepared, and its characteristics are {{compared with those of}} the specimens containing crushed and <b>expanded</b> waste <b>glass</b> aggregates. The obtained results support the usability of crushed and <b>expanded</b> waste <b>glass</b> aggregates as alternative lightweight aggregates...|$|R

40|$|The {{progressive}} {{increase of}} concrete {{production in the}} last decades has lead to a substantial exploitation of resources {{and an increase in}} pollutant emissions. However, if on the one hand the concrete has {{a significant impact on the}} environment, on the other hand it offers interesting opportunities towards a sustainable development. In fact, since the 1940 s, different residues of industrial processes were recycled in the concrete (for example, carbon fly ash, blast furnace slag and silica fume as a partial replacement of Portland cement). Other waste materials are compatible with the concrete technology; in particular, glass is potentially usable in the form of expanded aggregates in order to reduce the density of concrete. However, the use of <b>expanded</b> <b>glass</b> in the concretes poses some concern about durability, because of its poor stability in alkaline environments.

The crushing strength of particles could be doubled by shrinking them for 20 min at 700 °C. Owing to the low density of EG (0. 20 – 0. 26 g/cm 3), the resulting foam exhibits a low density (1. 03 – 1. 19 g/cm 3) that increases slightly due to particle shrinkage. Chemical and physical analyses of EG particles and the resulting foams were conducted. Furthermore, metal syntactic foam samples were tested in uni-axial compression tests. The stress-strain curves obtained exhibit three distinct regions: elastic deformation followed by a stress plateau and densification commencing at 70 – 80 % macroscopic strain.
