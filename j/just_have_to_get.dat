One of six Republicans in the primary, he finished third in the race with Bill Witt winning the party’s nomination.

Death may be tragic but it is commonplace, the eternal Truth. Let's not trumpet it, but place it simply before the public and let them make up their own minds. I would so like the feeling that we generate on the air to reflect the reality of death in life: {{most of the time it}} is a very quiet, private affair, generates little public attention: we grieve, and then somehow or other we <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on with things. I suppose at the risk of sounding squirmingly precious, I would like Victor to die with dignity.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} {{her visit}} in England, Marie {{returned}} to Paris, where the people were just as excited for her arrival as they had been a few weeks before. Crowds gathered around her frequently, waiting to see the [...] "exotic" [...] Queen of Romania. American President Woodrow Wilson remained unimpressed by Marie, and her comments on Russian laws dealing with sexual relations, which were considered inappropriate, did not help. Marie shocked many officials by waving all her ministers aside and leading negotiations herself. On this, she would later comment, [...] "Never mind, you'll all <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to accepting me with the faults of my virtues." [...] Marie left Paris with numerous supplies for Romania's relief and later that year, the conference resulted in the international recognition of Greater Romania, thus doubling Ferdinand and Marie's kingdom to [...] and increasing the population by ten million. This led Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna of Russia, who briefly lived in Bucharest, to conclude that [...] "by her charm, beauty, and ready wit, [...] could obtain anything she desired".|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury is still out on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E

2500|$|During {{this time}} Adams {{continued}} {{to write and}} submit sketches, though few were accepted. In 1976 his career had a brief improvement when he wrote and performed Unpleasantness at Brodie's Close at the Edinburgh Fringe festival. By Christmas, work had dried up again, and a depressed Adams moved {{to live with his}} mother. The lack of writing work hit him hard and low confidence became a feature of Adams's life; [...] "I have terrible periods of lack of confidence [...] I briefly did therapy, but after a while I realised it was like a farmer complaining about the weather. You can't fix the weather– you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on with it".|$|E

2500|$|In a 1999 New York Times story, [...] "C.E.O. Round Table- Online Pioneers: The Buzz Never Stops", Espuelas {{explained}} his approach: [...] "I {{spent a lot}} of time learning how Winston Churchill ran the Second World War. I bring that up as a metaphor—not having information, not having clarity, the stakes being very high. Of course, the stakes he had to deal with were somewhat higher than what we have to do. But that was part of the encouragement—to think that something so important could be managed, and all the mistakes that were made and the chaos of the moment. And the other thing, which he said, which I love as a philosophy, is: You don't have to get it right all the time. You <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right 51 percent of the time, and that will carry you through. And that's a very, very liberating philosophy." ...|$|E

After a 1–0 defeat at Nottingham Forest, with the club having won only once in the last six matches, having failed to win at home, and lying in 14th place, manager Nigel Clough was sacked. Bryson was saddened by the move, saying it came as a [...] "shock", adding that Clough [...] "has been excellent for me, he brought me down from Scotland and gave me my chance in England. So obviously I was sad to see him go. But it happens in football and you <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on with it." [...] Clough was replaced by Steve McClaren and Bryson said that he was looking forward to working with the new manager.|$|E
