5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, northern flicker, Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers do {{not have}} such {{a wide range of}} songs and calls as do {{passerine}} birds, and the sounds they make tend to be simpler in structure. Calls produced include brief high-pitched notes, trills, rattles, twittering, whistling, chattering, nasal churrs, screams and wails. These calls are used by both sexes in communication and are related to the circumstances of the occasion; these include courtship, territorial disputes and alarm calls. Each species has its own range of calls, which tend to be in the 1 to 2.5 kHz range for efficient transmission through forested environments. Mated couples may exchange muted, low-pitched calls, and nestlings often issue noisy begging-calls from inside their nest cavity. The wrynecks have a more musical song and in some areas, the song of the newly arrived <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> is considered to be the harbinger of spring. The piculets either have a song consisting of a long descending trill, or a descending series of two to six (sometimes more) individual notes, and this song alerts ornithologists to the presence of the birds, as they are easily overlooked.|$|E

50|$|On {{returning}} to the breeding area after migration, the birds set up territories. On farmland in Switzerland {{it has been found}} that old pear orchards with large numbers of ant nests are preferentially selected over other habitats. Areas used for vegetable cultivation provided useful habitat when they include areas of bare ground on which the birds can forage. Territories are not chosen at random as arriving birds favoured certain areas over others with the same territories being colonised first year after year. The presence of other <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wrynecks</b> in the vicinity is also a positive influence. Orchards in general, and older ones in particular, provide favoured territories, probably because the dense foliage is more likely to support high numbers of aphids and the ground beneath has scant vegetation cover, both of which factors increase the availability of ants, the birds' main prey. Despite some territories being consistently chosen over others, reproductive success in these territories was no higher than in others. Limiting factors for such crevice-nesting species as <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wrynecks</b> are both the availability of nesting sites and the number of ants and their ease of discovery. Modern farming practices such as the removal of hedges, forest patches and isolated trees and the increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides are disadvantageous to such birds.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eurasian</b> <b>wrynecks</b> measure about 16.5 cm {{in length}} and have bills shorter and less dagger-like than those of other woodpeckers. Their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. Their underparts are cream {{speckled}} and spotted with brown. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or on the ground. The eggs are white {{as is the case}} with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during May and June.|$|R
50|$|The wrynecks (genus Jynx) are a {{small but}} {{distinctive}} group of small Old World woodpeckers. Jynx is from the Ancient Greek iunx, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The birds sighted less frequently, {{called the}} 'specialists' were ortolan bunting, desert warbler, pied tit, white-browed fantail, lesser spotted eagle, sirkeer malkoha, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> and yellow-crowned woodpecker.|$|E
50|$|The {{island has}} a rich bird-life. Species include the European honey buzzard, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> and ortolan bunting. The nature reserve also {{supports}} a rich variety of insects.|$|E
5000|$|Jynginae {{includes}} one genus (Jynx) and two species, the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> and the red-throated wryneck (Jynx ruficollis), {{resident in}} sub-Saharan Africa. There are six subspecies of Jynx torquilla: ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{call of the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> is {{a series}} of {{repeated}} harsh, shrill notes quee-quee-quee-quee lasting for several seconds and is reminiscent of the voice of the lesser spotted woodpecker. Its alarm call is a short series of staccato [...] "tuck"s and when disturbed on the nest it hisses.|$|E
50|$|In Greek mythology, Iynx was an Arkadian Oreiad nymph; a {{daughter}} of the god Pan and either Peitho or Echo. She cast a spell on Zeus which caused him {{to fall in love}} with Io. In consequence of this, Hera metamorphosed her into the bird called iynx (<b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck,</b> jynx torquilla).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> (Jynx torquilla) is {{a species}} of wryneck in the {{woodpecker}} family. This species mainly breeds in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and in southern Asia from Iran to the Indian Subcontinent, but some are resident in northwestern Africa. It is a bird of open countryside, woodland and orchards.|$|E
50|$|Other birds {{found in}} Järveküla Nature Reserve include: the Barn swallow (the {{national}} bird of Estonia), <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck,</b> Eurasian golden oriole, Icterine warbler, River warbler, Spotted flycatcher, Eurasian tree sparrow, Common chaffinch, European greenfinch, European pied flycatcher, Eurasian skylark, Fieldfare, White wagtail, Yellowhammer, Hooded crow, Garden warbler, Grey heron, Eurasian blue tit, Eurasian blackcap, Common rosefinch, European goldfinch and Common chiffchaff among others.|$|E
50|$|The red-throated wryneck (Jynx ruficollis) is {{a species}} of wryneck in the {{woodpecker}} family. It {{is also known as}} the rufous-necked wryneck, red-breasted wryneck, African wryneck or rufous-throated wryneck.http://www.mangoverde.com/wbg/spec/spec104-2.htmlThis species is resident in sub-Saharan Africa, and is the non-migratory counterpart of the Eurasian <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck.</b> This is a savannah bird, which requires trees with old woodpecker or barbet holes for nesting.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the nature reserve is to {{preserve}} an area of mixed broadleaf forest dominated by birch, aspen, linden and common hazel. The flora contains species such as unspotted lungwort, Viola mirabilis, common toothwort and giant bellflower. The nature reserve also has a rich bird-life, rich in Old World warblers but the nature reserve {{also serves as a}} habitat for species such as nightingale, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> and different kinds of woodpeckers. Sörmlandsleden passes through the nature reserve.|$|E
5000|$|The campus {{also has}} a rich {{diversity}} of animal species. Among reptiles, there are 23 species of snakes in four families, including Boiga cyanea, Elaphe porphyracea, Gonyosoma prasina, Pareas monticola, Rhabdops bicolor, Trachischium tenuiceps, Rhabdophis subminiatus, Trimerusurus erythrurus, Bungarus niger, Naja kaouthia, and Ophiophagus hannah. [...] The campus is noted as an eBird hotspot with about 50 species listed at present including species such as <b>Eurasian</b> <b>Wryneck,</b> Black-crested Bulbul and many others. Mammals such as Hoary-bellied Squirrel and Pallas's Squirrel also occur.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> is {{the only}} European {{woodpecker}} to undertake long distance migrations. The wintering area of European species is located south of the Sahara, in a wide strip across Africa extending from Senegal, Gambia and Sierra Leone {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Its southern limit extends to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The populations from West Asia use the same wintering areas. The Central and East Asian breeding birds winter in the Indian subcontinent or southern East Asia including southern Japan.|$|E
50|$|There {{are a dozen}} couples of {{northern}} lapwing and eastern yellow wagtail, together with couples of meadow pipit, whinchat, red-backed shrike, bearded reedling, goshawk, spotted nutcracker, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck,</b> European honey buzzard, thrush nightingale, long-tailed tit, lesser spotted woodpecker, wood warbler, hawfinch, and Eurasian hobby. In the night time sedge warbler and reed warbler are regularly heard, while grasshopper warbler, river warbler, marsh warbler, and great reed warbler are reported now and then. Osprey are regularly seen fishing in the lake. Uncountable numbers of resting species are reported by the lake, including various swans, hawks, eagles, cormorants, and sparrows.|$|E
50|$|The Riserva naturale Bosco Fontana {{is a state}} {{nature reserve}} with an area of about 23,300 hectares. It is a wooded area that is a remnant of the natural forests that covered the Po valley in ancient times. It is a dense marshy forest {{composed}} mainly of Turkey oaks, pedunculate oaks, hornbeams, limes, poplars, elms and alders, which are accompanied by numerous species of shrubby undergrowth. There are glades with abundant wildflowers and fungi flourish among the trees, an important factor being {{the richness of the}} groundwater. Among the mammals found in the reserve are the least weasel, beech marten and European polecat, and the birds include the common buzzard, the great spotted woodpecker and the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck.</b>|$|E
50|$|The diet of the <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> {{consists}} chiefly of ants but beetles {{and their}} larvae, moths, spiders and woodlice are also eaten. Although much {{time is spent}} in the upper branches of trees, the bird sometimes perches in low bushes and mostly forages on the ground, moving around with short hops with its tail held in a raised position. It can cling to tree trunks, often moving obliquely, and sometimes pressing its tail against the surface as a prop. It does not make holes in bark with its beak but picks up prey with a rapid extension and retraction of its tongue and it sometimes catches insects while on the wing. Its flight is rather slow and undulating.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> {{sometimes}} forms {{small groups}} during migration {{and in its}} winter quarters but in the summer is usually found in pairs. It characteristically holds its head high with its beak pointing slightly upwards. A mutual display that occurs {{at any time of}} year involves two birds perched facing each other with their heads far back and beaks wide open, bobbing their heads up and down. Sometimes the head is allowed to slump sideways and hang limply. On other occasions, when excited, the head is shaken and twisted about violently. When disturbed on the nest or held in the hand, the neck contorts and twists in all directions. The bird sometimes feigns death and hangs limply with eyes closed.|$|E

50|$|The type {{forests are}} made up of laurel-leaved {{evergreen}} hardwood trees, reaching up to 40 m in height when older. Many of the species are endemic to islands, and harbour a rich biota of understorey plants, invertebrates, some species of lizards (Lacerta lepida, Podarcis bocagei, Chalcides striatus), slowworms (Anguis fragilis), and snakes, (Elaphe scalaris, Coronella girondica, Natrix maura). The island has some goats and wild boars (Sus scrofa), wild horses lived there until recently (Crocidura russula, Erinaceus europaeus, Talpa occidentalis), bats (Pipistrellus pipistrellus, Eptesicus serotinus, Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), feral cats (Felix catus), feral mink (Mustela vison), rabbits, mice, rats and birds such as Iberian chiffchaff, the coal tit, the great tit, woodpecker, <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck,</b> collared dove, common wood pigeon, blackbird, Scolopax rusticola, greenfinch, warbler, finch, saithe, stonechat, robin, goldfinch, wagtail, black redstart, buzzard, goshawk, and peregrine falcon. Besides many seabirds species such as cormorants and shorebirds take refuge on the island and several species of gulls nest in the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> has a palearctic distribution. The {{breeding}} {{range of the}} nominate subspecies includes all of Europe from Britain to the Urals. In the north it reaches the Arctic Circle and the range includes Spain in the southwest. In {{the south and east}} it intergrades with J. t. tschusii (smaller and more reddish brown) which is found in Corsica, Italy, Dalmatia and parts of the Balkans. J. t. mauretanica (also smaller than the nominate form, light, with whitish throat and breast) is resident in Algeria and Morocco and possibly also the Balearic Islands, Sardinia and parts of Sicily. J. t. sarudnyi (considerably paler than the nominate with fainter markings) occurs in the Urals and then in a wide strip of Asia through southern Siberia, Central Asia, including the north-western Himalayas to the Pacific coast. J. t. chinensis breeds in eastern Siberia and northeastern and central China while J. t. himalayana breeds in Pakistan and the northwestern Himalayas. Eurasian wrynecks also inhabit the island of Sakhalin, Japan and the coastal areas of southern China.|$|E

5000|$|The IUCN {{lists the}} <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> as being of [...] "Least Concern" [...] in its Red List of Threatened Species. This {{is because it}} has a world {{population}} estimated at up to fifteen million individual birds and a very wide geographical range. The population may be decreasing to a certain extent but not at such a rate as to make the bird reach the threshold for a more threatened category. In continental Europe, the largest populations are in Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Belarus and Ukraine, and only in Romania is the population trend believed to be upward. In Russia, where there are believed to be 300,000 to 800,000 individuals, the population trend is unknown. In the United Kingdom the numbers of bird are on the decrease and it is protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention. It is protected as a migratory species under the Birds Directive in the European Union. In Switzerland, the population has also been decreasing, but the species has reacted positively to conservation measures such as the addition of nestboxes in suitable habitats.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Eurasian</b> <b>wryneck</b> {{grows to}} about 17 cm in length. The {{subspecies}} Jynx torquilla tschusii weighs 26 to 50 g. It is a slim, elongated-looking bird {{with a body}} shape more like a thrush than a woodpecker. The upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. The rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles and irregular bands of brown. The rounded tail is grey, speckled with brown, with faint bands of greyish-brown {{and a few more}} clearly defined bands of brownish-black. The cheeks and throat are buff barred with brown. The underparts are creamy white with brown markings shaped like arrow-heads which are reduced to spots on the lower breast and belly. The flanks are buff with similar markings and the under-tail coverts are buff with narrow brown bars. The primaries and secondaries are brown with rufous-buff markings. The beak is brown, long and slender with a broad base and sharp tip. The irises are hazel and the slender legs and feet are pale brown. The first and second toes are shorter than the others. The first and fourth toes point backwards and the second and third point forwards, a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces.|$|E
