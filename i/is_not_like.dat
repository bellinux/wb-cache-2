5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and her writing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson {{was the only other}} lesbian author they could recall.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Number 18 {{was one of}} the girls in the storage truck, but that she escaped and ended up at The Pearl. Traumatized, she does not understand what Jason wants. She knows that every girl who has talked about the storage truck incident has been killed and is therefore reluctant to testify. One night Number 18 is injured in a party at the brothel and can barely walk when Jason visits. When he tells Ali about his experiences, she begs him to come home, but Jason believes he is in Bangkok by divine providence. Number 18 comes to understand that Jason <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> the other men who frequent The Pearl, and agrees to trust him and testify against the brothel ring if he can rescue her.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its absorption spectrum <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E

25|$|Othering plays a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} history and continuation of racism. To objectify a culture as something different, exotic or underdeveloped is to generalize that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> 'normal' society. Europe's colonial attitude towards the Orient exemplifies this as it was thought that the East was the opposite of the West; feminine where the West was masculine, weak where the West was strong and traditional where the West was progressive. By making these generalizations and othering the East, Europe was simultaneously defining herself as the norm, further entrenching the gap.|$|E
25|$|The bird the {{children}} have found has died, and {{the children}}, assisted by the adults, hold a funeral for it. Virginia is aware that she {{and the little girl}} are far more invested in the funeral than Vanessa's boys, who are probably laughing at the females behind their backs. As Virginia stares longingly at the dead bird she has an epiphany: her character, Clarissa Dalloway, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Virginia, and would not commit suicide. Like the bird's funeral bed, Clarissa represents -to Virginia- an uncaring, even foolish thing. As such, Clarissa will represent the death bed (the counterpoint) to the character who Virginia will have commit suicide.|$|E

25|$|In their book, The Fourth Turning, however, Strauss and Howe {{say that}} the precise {{boundaries}} of generations and turnings are erratic. The generational rhythm <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> certain simple, inorganic cycles in physics or astronomy, where time and periodicity can be predicted to the second. Instead, it resembles the complex, organic cycles of biology, where basic intervals endure but precise timing is difficult to predict. Strauss and Howe compare the saecular rhythm to the four seasons, which they say similarly occur in the same order, but with slightly varying timing. Just as winter may come sooner or later, and {{be more or less}} severe in any given year, {{the same is true of}} a Fourth Turning in any given saeculum.|$|E
25|$|On November 1, 2005, Germany {{enacted the}} “Act on Model Case Proceedings in Disputes under Capital Markets Law (Capital Markets Model Case Act)” {{allowing}} sample proceedings {{to be brought}} before the courts in litigation arising from mass capital markets transactions. It {{does not apply to}} any other civil law proceeding. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> class actions in the United Statesit only applies to parties who have already filed suit and does not allow a claim to be brought in the name of an unknown group of claimants. The effects of the new law will be monitored over the next five years. It contains a ‘sunset clause’, and it will automatically cease to have effect on November 1, 2010, unless the legislature decides to prolong the law, or extend it to other mass civil case proceedings.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} stock a member bank must own {{is equal to}} 3% of its {{combined}} capital and surplus. However, holding stock in a Federal Reserve bank <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> owning stock in a publicly traded company. These stocks cannot be sold or traded, and member banks do not control the Federal Reserve Bank {{as a result of}} owning this stock. From the profits of the Regional Bank of which it is a member, a member bank receives a dividend equal to 6% of their purchased stock. The remainder of the regional Federal Reserve Banks' profits is given over to the United States Treasury Department. In 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks made a profit of $100.2 billion and distributed $2.5 billion in dividends to member banks as well as returning $97.7 billion to the U.S. Treasury.|$|E

25|$|The trio then confronts Paradox, who {{reveals that}} {{he comes from}} a future beyond Yusei's in which the world lies in ruins, and claims {{that the only way to}} fix it is to {{eliminate}} Duel Monsters from history. However, the three heroes protest that by doing so all the future events and people will be erased as well, and challenge him to a duel. By combining the powers of their key monsters, Yugi, Jaden and Yusei defeat Paradox, who disappears. After the duel, Yusei, Jaden and Yugi say that they will do what they can to make sure the future <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>like</b> Paradox's, and say goodbye and the latter two return to their respective time periods. New Domino City returns to normal, and Yusei finally can let go of the past and focus on the future.|$|E
