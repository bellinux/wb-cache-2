[...] Then you put it back into perspective and ask yourself how much that or any award really matters.|$|E

In the letter he wrote that he had an idea that he would like to share, and asked Roberts for 15 minutes of his time. Roberts agreed to a meeting in early February and halfway through Edmondson's presentation, Roberts stopped the {{conversation}} and offered him a job by asking [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to get you to join this company?" [...] When Edmondson expressed his lack of interest in joining RadioShack, Roberts let the subject drop, but remained intrigued with Edmondson's idea.

[...] Robertson {{had also}} produced Diamond's album Beautiful Noise {{the same year}} and co-wrote [...] "Dry Your Eyes", which during the concert he hailed as a [...] "great song". Diamond's appearance was not popular {{with all of the}} other performers. In his autobiography, Levon Helm was critical of the inclusion of Diamond, not discerning any musical connection to the Band. A persistent rumor claims that when Diamond came off stage he remarked to Dylan, [...] "Follow that," [...] to which Dylan responded, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> go on stage and fall asleep?" [...] However, Diamond claims that they were just joking around with each other before either of them performed, and Diamond never said anything like [...] "follow that!"

[...] He also referred to commentator Bill O'Reilly's criticism of [...] "Shoot 'Em Up", a song from Nas's fourth album Nastradamus (1999), as he stated [...] "If I didn't have a microphone, I could never talk about 'Shoot 'Em Up', and I was talking about Queens, New York, being shot up. What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to get somebody to turn around and hear what I'm saying and take it serious? I'm not here just to be in your face talking nonsense, we're talking about reality. For him to be upset or people like him to be upset is insane to me. It just shows how ignorant people are."

5000|$|The Panthers {{came away}} with a 36-33, four-{{overtime}} victory after falling behind Notre Dame by two touchdowns, 17-3, at halftime. Conor Lee made the game-winning field goal, one of four overtime fields goals, during his perfect, 5-for-5 day to help lead the Panthers. His five field goals and 18 points are both Pitt records for a kicker; he also extended his school record of consecutive extra points without a miss to 100. LeSean McCoy lead the way on offense with 32 rushing attempts for 169 yards, his 5th straight 100-yard game, and one touchdown as he surpassed 1,000 yards rushing for the season; he also had two catches for 23 yards. The Panthers fell behind {{in the first half}} when Notre Dame controlled the clock and took advantage of poor play by Pitt on offense. Quarterbacks Kevan Smith and Pat Bostick, who were playing in place of the injured started Bill Stull, who suffered a concussion in the previous game, were ineffective in the first half, and the running game couldn't get going as McCoy had only 5 yards on 3 carries. In total, the offense only had 71 yards and five first downs in the entire first half. The offense got back on track in the 2nd half as the Panthers scored 10 straight points to tie the game at 17. The Panthers first possession of the 3rd quarter went eight plays and 71 yards, including a converted fourth-and-one pass that Oderick Turner turned into a 37-yard gain. The Panthers next touchdown came on a 15-play, 70-yard drive that used 8:28 of time during the end of the 3rd and beginning of the 4th quarters. Pat Bostick, although he was intercepted three times in the game, persevered and stepped up his play in the second half, leading the Panthers on three critical scoring drives. After the game Bostick, speaking of his own performance, said, [...] ""I came out and made some mistakes out there, forced a couple of things, made a couple of plays. We made enough plays to win though and this was a total team win... But the bottom line is we are here to win a football game and when you throw picks, it is not about you, you can't say 'Woe is me.' It is all about, 'What <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> on the next drive to take this team down the field to win the game?'" [...] The Panthers defense, led again by linebacker Scott McKillop with 15 tackles, played significantly better than in the week before, allowing only one big play versus the Irish's offense, a 47-yard pass from Jimmy Clausen to Golden Tate. They also held Notre Dame to only 146 yards in the second half and all four overtimes, including just seven yards on three three-and-out possessions in the third quarter. (Game report) ...|$|E
