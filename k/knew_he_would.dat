5|$|In {{voting against}} the Force Bill, Tyler <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{permanently}} alienate the pro-Jackson {{faction of the}} Virginia legislature, even those who had tolerated his irregularity up to this point. This jeopardized his re-election in February 1833, in which he faced the pro-administration Democrat James McDowell; however, with Clay's endorsement, Tyler was re-elected {{by a margin of}} 12 votes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{initially}} {{skeptical about}} the role, Perrineau took it after Lost creator J. J. Abrams told him more about it. Much of the first season arc for Michael was rewritten; he was originally {{going to be part}} of a love triangle with Korean couple Sun (Yunjin Kim) and Jin (Daniel Dae Kim), but positive fan reaction to the couple meant this storyline was dropped. After Michael leaves the Island in season two, Perrineau <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> return to Lost at some point; he felt there was more to tell of Michael's story. Reception for the character was mixed. However, Perrineau's acting was praised.|$|E
5|$|Between {{chapters}} in which Penelope is narrating, the twelve maids speak on topics from their point-of-view. They lament their childhood as slaves with no parents or playtime, sing of freedom, and {{dream of being}} princesses. They contrast their lives to Telemachus' and wonder {{if they would have}} killed him as a child if they <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> kill them as a young man. They blame Penelope and Eurycleia for allowing them to unjustly die. In Hades, they haunt both Penelope and Odysseus.|$|E

5|$|Cannon had {{a modest}} 1968 {{season in which}} he caught six {{touchdown}} passes—including one of 48 yards {{in the second quarter}} of the famous Heidi Game—but <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not be in Oakland much longer. Head coach John Madden had relegated him to running decoy routes by 1969 and he had only two touchdowns. Nevertheless, he was invited as a replacement to play in his second All-Star game. Cannon was released by the Raiders during the 1970 preseason.|$|E
5|$|In Tondon Tiku began {{preparations}} for his mother's funeral, preparations which, in Torajan culture, took several months. While {{taking care of}} the preparations, he had an advisor collect weapons secretly while another went to his fortresses in Alla' and Ambeso. Tiku then made preparations to escape Dutch custody; he also returned all property that he had taken as a lord, as he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> no longer use it. While in Tondon, Dutch forces may have harassed the Torajan leader. The night before his mother's funeral, in January 1907, Tiku and 300 of his followers escaped Tondon, heading south.|$|E
5|$|Cecil {{decided the}} game would start {{a day before}} the Parisian cafe {{explosion}} in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. To this end, Cecil also drafted in the acclaimed comic book artist Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky. In addition to working on the visual references for the game, Gibbons also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. Gibbons stated {{that he decided to}} return to video game work on this game because he knew producing character shots with a range of expressions would be challenging, and he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> enjoy it, based upon past experience.|$|E

5|$|Curtis, {{inspired}} {{by the fact that}} Van Gogh never <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be famous, had the idea for an episode centred on him. He left the script open to criticism from the crew and made many revisions as a result. Curtis wanted to portray Van Gogh truthfully, rather than being cruel by writing jokes about his mental illness. Most of the episode was filmed in Trogir, Croatia, and many of the sets were modelled after Van Gogh paintings. The episode was watched by 6.76 million viewers on BBC One and BBC HD. Reception to the episode varied, ranging from very positive to mixed to very negative. While the amount of emotion in the episode was debated, many reviewers agreed that Curran's performance as Van Gogh was excellent, but that the Krafayis was not a threatening monster.|$|E
5|$|Joss Whedon {{had wanted}} to make a musical episode {{since the start of the}} series. This was {{heightened}} during the fifth season when he hosted a Shakespeare reading at his house, to which the cast was invited. They began drinking and singing, demonstrating to Whedon that certain cast members had musical talents. Whedon <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to write an entire score, which would take weeks or months. During the first three seasons of Buffy, he was unable to take more than two weeks off at a time, and the constraints of writing and directing the show precluded him from putting forth the effort of preparing a musical. Whedon spoke to the show's producer, Gareth Davies, about his idea; they agreed that a musical episode would be written.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to go to him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E

5|$|When Larry Schmittou {{decided to}} bring {{professional}} baseball back to Nashville in the late 1970s, he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{have to build a}} new ballpark for his team. He negotiated a lease with the city for a plot of land at the foot of St. Cloud Hill on the grounds of Fort Negley, an American Civil War fortification, approximately two miles (three km) south of downtown. At the time, this was the site of a city-owned softball complex that the city planned to relocate. The city was prepared to lease him the land, but Schmittou would be responsible for building the stadium, paying the property taxes, and paying the city a portion of the team's total revenue.|$|E
5|$|Headley states {{he gained}} {{approval}} to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup {{money for the}} organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for doing this. In 2005, when he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be faced with {{being sent to the}} organization's prison-like program the Rehabilitation Project Force, Headley decided to leave. Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire, to whom he had been married for 13 years, and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of disconnection. Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards, which resulted in Headley falling off his bike {{by the side of the}} road. Riverside County, California Sheriff's arrived, and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound. From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City. He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base. Prior to his wife's departure from Gold Base, she was monitored closely day and night by the organization.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, {{which had}} been garrisoned at Debrecen. He {{replaced}} General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist Arrow Cross Party. During that month, Farkas' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a Red Army attack across the Carpathian mountains. On 15 October 1944, Farkas was named commander of the Pest bridgehead and Government Commissioner for Evacuation. In early November 1944, the first Russian units appeared on the southeastern edge of Budapest. As an associate of Farkas, Bánáthy likely had advance notice of the Russian advance. He also <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> likely be executed if captured. Bánáthy {{was able to get}} his wife Eva, one-year-old son Béla and two-week-old son László out of Budapest. Bánáthy's family, along with other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches.|$|E

5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief Fund Committee was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E

Byrd's key allies—in 1964 as an Independent and in 1968 as a Republican. Though Tucker <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{never win}} more than 30% {{of the vote}} against the powerful incumbent, he believed the battles important to register the protests as well as aspirations of black voters in the district.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, a young scrumhalf by {{the name}} of Joost van der Westhuizen partnered Naas Botha as the Bulls' halfback combination. Everyone <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> become {{something}} very special, and with time he did. He is {{one of only a handful}} of players that have won a World Cup winners medal (1995), and Tri-Nations winners medal (1998) and a Currie Cup winners medals (1998 and 2002). He captained his side in both the Currie Cup finals he played and was later also awarded the captaincy of the Springboks in the 1999 World Cup.|$|E
25|$|From 1911 until 1915, Curtin was {{employed}} as Secretary of the Timberworkers' Union, and during World War I {{he was a}} militant anti-conscriptionist; he was briefly imprisoned for refusing to attend a compulsory medical examination, even though he <b>knew</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> fail the exam due to his very poor eyesight. He also at this time stood as the Labor candidate for Balaclava in 1914. The strain of this period led him to drink heavily and regularly, a vice which blighted his career for many years. In 1917, he married Elsie Needham, the sister of Labor Senator Ted Needham.|$|E

After the murders, police found the family dog locked up; Rusty advised Welner that it had normally been allowed to run free, and was so when {{he had left the}} house that morning, leading the psychiatrist to allege that she locked it in a cage to prevent it from interfering with her killing the children one by one. Rusty got a family friend, George Parnham, to act as her attorney.|$|E
