5|$|If the {{contestant}} has the Million Dollar Wedge, the $100,000 envelope {{is replaced}} with a $1,000,000 envelope. The $1,000,000 prize has been awarded three times: to Michelle Loewenstein (on the episode that aired October 14, 2008), to Autumn Erhard (May 30, 2013), and to Sarah Manchester (September 17, 2014). Contestants who win the $1,000,000 may receive it in installments over 20 years, or in a lump sum of that amount's present value. When the contestant fails {{to land on the}} $1,000,000 wedge, Sajak will reveal where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> prize wheel.|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Gerard Olivier, a habitually frugal man, {{told his}} son {{that not only}} must he gain {{admission}} to the Central School of Speech Training and Dramatic Art, but he must also gain a scholarship with a bursary to cover his tuition fees and living expenses. Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of Elsie Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the bursary.|$|E

5|$|Surface level {{humidity}} is {{less than}} 0.1%. Venus's sulfuric acid rain never reaches the ground, but is evaporated by the heat before reaching the surface in a phenomenon known as virga. It is theorized that early volcanic activity released sulfur into the atmosphere and the high temperatures prevented it from being trapped into solid compounds on the surface as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish embassy he {{eventually}} collected at Norham had been delayed, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> return journey that the Duke of Somerset with Lords Roos and Hungerford, Sir Richard Turnstall, and Sir Thomas Findern and {{the bulk of}} the Lancastrian army (approximately 5,000 men) ambushed Montagu at the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April 1464. The assault failed, and left Sir Ralph Percy dead on the field.|$|E
5|$|The album did not chart {{until it}} was {{physically}} releasedâ€”a development which surprised Byrne.

5|$|The {{bald eagle}} {{is both the}} {{national}} bird and national animal of the United States of America. The bald eagle appears on its seal. In the late 20th century <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brink of extirpation in the contiguous United States. Populations have since recovered and the species {{was removed from the}} U.S. government's list of endangered species on July 12, 1995 and transferred to the list of threatened species. It was removed from the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in the Lower 48 States on June 28, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The {{head was}} {{conclusively}} seen on Westminster Hall {{as late as}} 1684, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{south side of the}} Hall. Archaeological evidence also disproved its authenticity. The skull was pierced from the top, not from the bottom; and the skull had no trace of skin or hair, showing it had never been embalmed.|$|E
5|$|The name King was {{not used}} again after the season, {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> naming list for 1951 and 1952 due to {{being part of the}} Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet. The Phonetic Alphabet was decommissioned in 1953 in favor of using female names. Based on population growth in south Florida, it is estimated that a storm identical to Hurricane King would cause $2.8billion in insured damage if it struck in 2001, with the total roughly split between Broward and Miami-Dade counties.|$|E

5|$|This bucentaur was {{frequently}} {{referred to in}} Venetian chronicles. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ship that on 15 July 1547 Henry II of France was conveyed with the doge down the Grand Canal to the Ca' Foscari where he stayed {{during his visit to}} Venice. The ship was also used to transport the newly crowned Dogaressa Morosina Morosini-Grimani to the Doge's Palace on 4 May 1597. This event was the subject of numerous etchings and paintings by Giacomo Franco, Andrea Vicentino, Sebastian Vrancx and anonymous artists.|$|E

5|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in September 1939, the Norwegian government declared the country neutral in the conflict. Both warring sides subsequently stated that they would respect Norway's neutrality, provided that she protect her neutrality against trespasses by the other side. Koht was clear from early on that Norway should remain neutral, but also that in the event of her being forced to enter the war it was critical that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> side of the British.|$|E
5|$|After {{scouting}} Vancouver for a {{place to}} film scenes that involved the Swan house, {{the decision was made to}} recreate the house on an empty lot with a tree line and approaching road. The production team was able to rearrange the exterior of the house to match that in the first movie. When faced with creating the interior, the team measured the house in Portland, and built various pieces of the house on the lot and on a stage in Vancouver. The second film also attempted to clarify the location of Bella's room, which, as seen in the first film, seemed to be located in the front of the house, when in reality <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right-hand side. Complications arose when the Portland house was repainted after Twilights release, which took away the aging the house had come to depict in the film. When recreating the house, the production team referenced the first film on high-definition Blu-ray Disc.|$|E

5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of the Negev, halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, the {{congregation}} had increased {{in size to}} approximately 300 families, and had outgrown its original facilities. The congregation moved to a more suburban location at Eleventh and Flower in 1949, and formalized {{its relationship with the}} Reform movement by joining the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (now the Union for Reform Judaism). The Central Avenue and Culver Street building was sold to the Southern Baptist Convention, and housed the First Chinese Baptist Church until 1981, and then the Iglesia Bautista Central. By 2001 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> market again, and the Jewish community raised $540,000 (today $) to purchase it in 2002. The building is listed on both the cityâ€™s historic property register and the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|For system {{efficacy}} and reliability, aircraft transmissions made {{in response to}} a signal from a satellite are sent in timed slots referenced to the time the signal from the satellite arrived, using the slotted ALOHA protocol. The time that the signal is sent from the ground station begins the time slot. The burst timing offset (BTO) is the time difference between the start of the time slot and the start of the transmission received from the aircraft; it equals twice the distance (for the ground station's signal then aircraft's response) from the ground station to the satellite to the aircraft plus the time the aircraft's SDU takes between receiving the signal and responding (the SDU bias) and the delay between the time the signal arrives at the ground station and the time it is processed (when the BTO value is logged; the ground station bias). The satellite's location is known, thus the distance from the satellite to the ground station can be calculated, while the combined bias of the SDU and ground station is relatively constant and can be calculated from signals exchanged earlier in the flight while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground at KLIA, thus leaving the distance between the aircraft and satellite as the only variable.|$|E
