40|$|Abstract: The {{circadian}} {{rhythm of the}} locomotor activity is regulated by at least 2 <b>external</b> <b>pacemakers,</b> environmental photoperiod and food availability. In the present study, the effects of short-term (2 weeks) food restriction on locomotor activity rhythm in adult male and female Mongolian gerbils were investigated. Animals were fed ad libitum with no restriction {{during the first week}} of the experiment and their daily ad libitum food consumptions were determined. Then the food was restricted 40 % of ad libitum for the next 2 weeks. At constant temperature, locomotor activity was monitored by running wheel in animals exposed to a long photoperiod (14 L) for 3 weeks. A significant phase advance was recorded in the locomotor activity rhythm in both male and female animals. The shift was bigger in males (12 – 1. 1 h) than in females (6 – 0. 5 h) (P < 0. 05). Activity levels and body weights decreased in males (P < 0. 01) and females (P < 0. 012) compared with the first week values. The gerbilsÕ locomotor activity was significantly affected by the food restriction. These results indicate that the rhythm and the level of the locomotor activity in the Mongolian gerbil can be entrained by food restriction...|$|R

50|$|Lightwood was {{a medical}} engineer, {{researcher}} and technician in the Department of Surgery at Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham from 1958 to 1987.

Lightwood used electrodes {{attached to the}} heart coupled to an <b>external</b> <b>pacemaker,</b> so all the electronic components were kept outside the body, and could be replace {{in the event of}} failure. This was the first patient controlled permanent pacemaker as the primary circuit consisted of an inducing coil supplied by a portable transistor which produced short pulses at adjustable intervals and intensity.|$|E
50|$|In 1956 he was {{recruited}} back to Auckland, New Zealand by Sir Douglas Robb, and pioneered {{the development of}} cardiopulmonary bypass in that country, the first patient being operated on in 1958. While this task must have been made more difficult by New Zealand's relative remoteness and small population, the Greenlane Hospital surgical team quickly achieved an international reputation for innovative excellence. Indeed, he suggested that Auckland's isolation conferred an advantage comparable to that enjoyed by the Mayo Clinic in small-town Rochester, Minnesota, making it less likely that day-to-day interruptions would interfere with the real purpose of their work. Much of the original equipment had to be fashioned or modified locally. Sid Yarrow, an engineer on the team, built an early <b>external</b> <b>pacemaker</b> for intra-operative use. The first permanent unit, from Medtronic, was implanted in 1961.|$|E

A pacemaker-dependent paediatric patient of Lillehei died because of the blackout. The next day, Lillehei spoke with Bakken about developing some form of battery-powered pacemaker.
