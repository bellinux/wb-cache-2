He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows, became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open, Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface (<b>hard,</b> <b>clay</b> and grass). The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E
5|$|The camas {{pocket gopher}} (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known as}} the camas rat or Willamette Valley gopher, is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous gopher forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the <b>hard</b> <b>clay</b> soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E
5|$|The German missionary Plebot set up {{the first}} tile factory at Mangalore in 1860. It was called the Basel Mission tile factory. Mangalorean Catholics learnt the {{technique}} of preparing Mangalore tiles. The Albuquerque tile factory, the first Indian Mangalore tile factory, was started in South Canara by Pascal Albuquerque at Panemangalore in 1868. Since then, Mangalorean Catholics have been actively involved in manufacturing the tiles. The Alvares tile factory was established in Mangalore by Simon Alvares, a Mangalorean Catholic from Bombay, in 1878. In 1991–1992, out of twelve Mangalore tile manufacturing factories in Mangalore, six were owned by Christians. These tiles, prepared from <b>hard</b> <b>clay,</b> were in great demand throughout India, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka, and were even shipped to East Africa, the Middle East, Europe, and Australia. These were the only tiles to be recommended for Government buildings in India, and still define Mangalore's skyline and characterise its urban setting. Urban and rural housing follows the traditional variety of laterite brick structures with Mangalore tile roofing on steeply sloped roofs. Inside the house, a spacious hall is present while a large verandah is present {{in front of the}} house. The traditional houses tend to have spacious porticos, red cement or terracotta floors, and have fruit trees outside the house. The old Catholic houses of South Canara bear traces of Portuguese influence. The tall windows, pointed roofs, and verandahs are some of the Portuguese influenced architectural features of the century-old houses.|$|E

500|$|The gopher {{spends most}} of its time {{excavating}} tunnels in search of food, and the <b>hard</b> <b>clay</b> soils of the Willamette Valley pose a challenge. Although the gopher's front claws are too weak to dig through the clay (particularly during dry seasons), its large incisors and strongly protuberant orientation are well-adapted for this purpose. Tunnel systems constructed by the camas pocket gopher can be complex, with some tunnels exceeding [...] in length. About [...] in diameter, the tunnels are up to [...] deep. When soils are damp the gopher constructs ventilation ducts or chimney mounds (possibly unique to the species), to increase ventilation. The chimney mounds rise vertically , are open {{at the top and}} are thought to ventilate the burrows in accordance with Bernoulli's principle. It is not known if adjacent gopher burrowing systems interconnect. Reports differ {{about whether or not the}} ranges of the camas pocket gopher and the Mazama pocket gopher overlap; if so, this refutes the previous belief that Oregon gopher ranges do not overlap.|$|E

Since then they had endured constant bombing, all the while being expanded. By 1965 they formed an underground maze of passages, fighting tunnels, meeting rooms and food caches, stretching from Saigon to the Cambodian border. Given their headquarters function, the tunnels were equipped {{with an array of}} communications and medical facilities and were defended by interlocking arcs of fire and connecting fire tunnels.

50|$|The pressuremeter {{is used to}} test <b>hard</b> <b>clays,</b> dense sands and {{weathered}} rock which cannot be tested with push equipment.

The self-boring pressuremeter has a probe that is self-bored into the ground to prevent disturbance. The third pressuremeter is called a cone pressuremeter. The cone pressuremeter has a cone shaped probe that is inserted into the base of the borehole, it then displaces the soil into the cone of the probe which causes less disturbance to the soil to get a more accurate reading. Different soil types sometimes require different types of pressuremeter tests.|$|R

A method of taking large (300 mm diameter) samples using a thin walled tube pushed by a CPT truck, is described. Then, the procedure of testing these samples under a load of 25 kPa using a large scale oedometer arrangement is described. The results indicate that contrary to expectation, resin injected samples generally seemed to swell less than non injected samples. The trends were not as clear as might be expected due to the inherent variability of the clay soils, but because of the large samples and large number of samples tested, a reliable conclusion can be drawn. Reasons for this unexpected outcome are discussed, and it is generally concluded that the process of injecting <b>hard</b> <b>clays</b> with an expanding resin may create more cracks than it fills...|$|R
