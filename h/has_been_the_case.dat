5|$|The river has a {{long history}} of {{improvements}} to facilitate navigation from Bridgwater to Taunton, and has also been used to power mills along its length. These two objectives are often antagonistic, and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> on the River Tone.|$|E
5|$|The {{health risks}} {{associated}} with nuclear materials have also featured prominently in Australian anti-nuclear campaigns. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> worldwide because of accidents like the Chernobyl disaster, but Australian concerns have also involved specific local factors such as controversy over {{the health effects of}} nuclear testing in Australia and the South Pacific, and the emergence of prominent anti-nuclear campaigners Helen Caldicott and Tilman Ruff, who are medical practitioners.|$|E
5|$|The {{pattern of}} {{political}} affiliation in the Senate {{in the most}} recent era is distinct in several key respects from what <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> historically. Since November 4, 2015, there has been no government caucus in the Senate because the Senate Liberal Caucus is not affiliated with the governing Liberal Party of Canada. On December 6, 2016, {{for the first time in}} Canadian history the number of senators without a partisan affiliation exceeded that of the largest caucus of senators with a partisan affiliation.|$|E
50|$|Higher local {{government}} revenues than otherwise would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> possibly in <b>the</b> {{billions of dollars}} annually over time.|$|R

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek {{is continuing}} to become more developed, but at a slower rate than {{it has in the}} past. The lower reaches of the watershed are the most heavily urbanized, while the upper reaches are still largely rural. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> as early 1893. The upper reaches of the watershed have a dendritic drainage system.|$|E
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It {{is highly unlikely}} that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
25|$|More than a {{third of}} nurses in {{training}} fail to complete the training course, and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for more than a century.|$|E
50|$|Gordon Brown had {{to retract}} {{his claim that}} {{spending}} on defence rose every year during the Iraq war, as this was found not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Some {{died after}} being {{severely}} beaten in {{an imitation of}} street crime. This seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in 2006 of journalist [...] Nikolai Andruschenko, who covered Chechnya.|$|R
50|$|As <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> from 1920 to 1935, {{postage stamps}} were issued {{specially}} for the territory from 1947 to 1959 (see postage stamps and postal {{history of the}} Saar).|$|R
25|$|Generally speaking, the {{consumption}} of dog meat is taboo in Europe. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for many centuries, although exceptions have occurred in times of scarcity such as sieges or famines.|$|E
25|$|The {{trial began}} on 11 March 2008, and {{concluded}} in September 2010 with {{the delivery of}} closing arguments. Misetic said he expected a verdict in two to 10 months' time, as <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with the tribunal's decisions to date.|$|E
25|$|Mayor Joseph P. Ganim was {{involved}} in a corruption scandal, as <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Mayor Eddie Perez of Hartford in 2010. In June 2006, Mayor John M. Fabrizi admitted that he had used cocaine while in office.|$|E
50|$|All coins had {{the title}} of Queen Elizabeth II in English, rather than in Latin, as <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> on <b>the</b> coins of Rhodesia and Nyasaland and Southern Rhodesia.|$|R
50|$|After Germany’s capitulation, the American troops, as <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> after <b>the</b> last war, <b>were</b> {{replaced}} by French ones {{as the whole}} region found itself in the French Zone of Occupation.|$|R
500|$|Quite the {{opposite}} mentality seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Emperor Claudius (r.41 – 54 CE) For example, Emperor Neros mentor, Seneca the Younger sighed about {{the times of}} Claudius as follows: ...|$|R
25|$|Footballers {{who play}} for these teams {{and are also}} born in the city tend to become {{especially}} popular, as <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with players such as Francesco Totti and Daniele De Rossi (both for A.S. Roma), and Alessandro Nesta (for S.S. Lazio).|$|E
25|$|In October 2003, the Polisario Front {{held its}} XI General Popular Congress here, electing {{officials}} to its executive National Secretariat, the exile parliament of the Sahrawi National Council, {{as well as}} reelecting (92%) Mohamed Abdelaziz as Secretary General, as <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> since 1976.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} year's game, Super Bowl II was televised live {{on only one}} network, which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> for all subsequent Super Bowl games. While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the NFL's unconditional blackout rules prevented the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area.|$|E
2500|$|... (b) Second, {{although}} {{this was not}} explicitly codified, it seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> that <b>the</b> heir must <b>be</b> of age (around 27 or 28 years old) to qualify as an edling.|$|R
50|$|All 60 council {{seats were}} up for election. <b>The</b> {{previous}} council <b>was</b> controlled by Independents as <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> since <b>the</b> authority <b>was</b> formed in 1995. The Independents retained control in 2012.|$|R
50|$|For {{most of the}} history, Vietnamese kings {{sometimes}} {{recognized the}} Chinese Emperor as their feudal lord, while ruling independently in their own land. This <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> throughout <b>the</b> reign of the Later Lê dynasty.|$|R
25|$|The hall is {{surrounded}} by 114tents, which are occupied from May to September, as <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> since 1869. Each tent is connected to a shed containing a kitchen and bathroom; the sheds are also used to store the tents during the winter. They are in such demand {{that there is a}} waiting list of some ten years for summer rentals.|$|E
25|$|Claims {{have arisen}} that {{a result of}} the Embassy Act, {{official}} U.S. documents and web sites refer to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, although this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in many instances before the Act became law. The CIA World Factbook has carried the typical Federal citation concerning Israel's capital and the absence of the usual concentration of foreign embassies being within its boundaries or proximity.|$|E
25|$|After the 9th {{century the}} Roman Mass, now quite fixed {{in all its}} {{essential}} parts (though the Proper Masses for various feasts constantly change), quickly became the universal use throughout the Western patriarchate. Except for three small exceptions, the Ambrosian Rite at Milan, the Mozarabic Rite at Toledo, and the Byzantine Rite among the Italo-Greeks in Calabria and Sicily, this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> ever since.|$|E
50|$|Early in 2013, Medical Mutual {{issued an}} apology to its {{customers}} {{for a computer}} problem that caused prescriptions completed {{on the last day}} of 2012 to incur a higher charge than should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
5|$|Royal {{artisans}} {{were sometimes}} responsible for sculpting stelae; {{in some cases}} these sculptors <b>were</b> actually <b>the</b> sons of kings. In other cases {{it is likely that}} captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors, as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat. This appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in Piedras Negras where Stela12 depicting war captives submitting to <b>the</b> victorious king <b>is</b> carved in <b>the</b> style of Pomoná, the defeated city. Archaeologists believe that this may also <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán.|$|R
25|$|According to a 2008 {{analysis}} by Iowa State University, {{the growth in}} US ethanol production has caused retail gasoline prices to be US $0.29 to US $0.40 per gallon lower than would otherwise <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b>|$|R
25|$|Neighborhoods in New York do {{not have}} {{official}} boundaries; informal boundaries are often contested, and this <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with Bushwick. However, the boundaries of Bushwick are often given as those of Brooklyn Community Board 4, which is delineated by Flushing Avenue on the north, Broadway on the southwest, the border with Queens to the northeast, and the Cemetery of the Evergreens on the southeast.|$|E
25|$|Embrun is {{a bedroom}} community: a {{majority}} of the population works in nearby Ottawa and commutes into the city on a daily basis. A large proportion of these people are people with post-secondary education who work in the Canadian civil service or Ottawa's large high-tech sector. This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> since the mid-20th century. Prior to then, agriculture employed the majority of the community's population.|$|E
25|$|The {{regulation}} of gas storage, transportation and sale is overseen by Ofgem (a government regulator). This <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> since the gas industry was privatised in 1986. Most forms of gas storage were owned by Transco (now part of National Grid plc), however the national network has now largely been {{broken down into}} regional networks, owned by different companies, they are however all still answerable to Ofgem.|$|E
25|$|Bodyline was {{specially}} prepared, nutured for and expended on him and, in consequence, {{his technique}} underwent a change quicker than might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> with <b>the</b> passage of time. Bodyline plucked something vibrant from his art.|$|R
