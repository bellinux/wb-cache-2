Descriptive cross-sectional hospital based study. The study was done at oral and maxillofacial surgery firm and emergency medicine department of Muhimbili National Hospital (MNH). All patients who attended the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery firm and Emergency Medicine departments of MNH for treatment of oral and maxillofacial injuries {{during the period of}} the study and consented were included in the study. An interview of the patients with oral and maxillofacial injuries was done through structured questionnaire to obtain relevant information from the patient. Social-demographic information (age, sex, address, education level and marital status), patient’s main complaint, type of injury, place where injury took place, cause of injury, general condition of patient immediately after injury and afterwards and the time interval from injury to reporting to hospital were recorded. Clinical findings were recorded as follows: type of injury, site of injury, single or multiple, soft tissue or hard tissue injury. Soft tissue injuries were categorized as bruises, abrasions, cut wound, contusion, lacerations, avulsions, and burn. Hard tissue injury was categorized as fracture of facial bones such as nasal bone, maxilla, mandible, zygoma, frontal palatal and orbital bones. Accompanying injuries to the TMJ were also recorded. Radiological investigations including plain skull radiography (posterior anterior view, Water’s view, submental vertex view), orthopantomograph and where necessary a computed tomography (CT) were ordered. The interpretation of the radiological investigations was done by the principal investigator with the assistance of an experienced clinician and was recorded in a special form as fracture or no fracture, site and type of fracture. Treatment offered and treatment outcomes were also recorded. For admitted patients the number of days spent in hospital was recorded against the type of injury and treatment done. The data was entered into computer and analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences programme (SPSS) Version 15. Association of maxillofacial injury parameters vii (demographic factors, aetiology, treatment and complications) and type of injuries was evaluated using Chi –square test (X 2). Significant level p< 0. 05 was used to draw out conclusion. A total of 137 patients, 123 (89. 8 %) males and 14 (10. 2 %) females with the male- female ratio of 9 : 1 were included in this study. The age range was from 4 to 70 years {{with a mean age of}} 30. 13 years. The 21 - 30 and 31 - 40 years age groups were the most affected.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} skeletal stability after mandibular advancement with bilateral sagittal split osteotomy. Material and Methods: Twenty-six patients underwent single-jaw bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) to correct skeletal Class II malocclusion. One group (n = 13) were treated postoperatively with skeletal elastic <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation</b> (IMF) while the other group (n = 13) where threated without skeletal elastic IMF. Results: The mean advancement at B-point and Pog in the skeletal elastic IMF group was 6. 44 mm and 7. 22 mm, respectively. Relapse at follow-up at B-point was - 0. 74 mm and - 0. 29 mm at Pog. The mean advancement at B-point and Pog in the no skeletal elastic IMF group was 6. 30 mm and 6. 45 mm, respectively. Relapse at follow-up at B-point was - 0. 97 mm and - 0. 86 mm at Pog. There was no statistical significant (P > 0. 05) difference between the skeletal IMF group and the no skeletal group regarding advancement nor relapse at B-point or Pog. Conclusions: Bilateral sagittal split osteotomy is characterized as a stable treatment to correct Class II malocclusion. This study demonstrated no difference of relapse between the skeletal <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation</b> group and the no skeletal <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation</b> group.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to assess the {{skeletal}} stability after large mandibular advancement (> 10 mm) with bilateral sagittal split osteotomy and skeletal elastic <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation</b> and to correlate the skeletal stability with the vertical facial type. Material and Methods: A total of 33 consecutive patients underwent bimaxillary surgery to correct skeletal Class II malocclusion with a mandibular advancement (> 10 mm) measured at B-point and postoperative skeletal elastic <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation</b> for 16 weeks. Skeletal stability was evaluated using lateral cephalometric radiographs obtained preoperative (T 1), 8 weeks postoperatively (T 2), and 18 month postoperatively (T 3). B-point and pogonion (Pog) was used to measure the skeletal relapse and the mandibular plane angle (MP-angle) was used to determine the vertical facial type. Results: The mean advancement from T 1 to T 2 were 11. 6 mm and 13. 5 mm at B-point and Pog, respectively. The mean skeletal relapse from T 2 to T 3 was - 1. 3 mm at B-point and - 1. 6 mm at Pog. The nineteen patients characterized as long facial types, showed the highest amount of skeletal relapse (- 1. 5 mm at B-point and - 1. 9 mm at Pog).

3000|$|Surgical cricothyroidotomy (SCT) {{has become}} known as a {{suitable}} procedure for emergency surgical airway management, and elective use of SCT is currently rare. In anesthetic management for open reduction and fixation surgery (ORF) of maxillofacial fracture with <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation,</b> the nasotracheal intubation technique is often used, as oral intubation may need to be avoided for particular reasons. For instance, the surgeon may require <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation</b> to inspect fracture reduction and maintenance of the reduction during surgery, and it is not desirable to fumble with a tracheal tube during surgery that requires an intraoral approach.

Absolute postoperative skeletal instability was not significantly different between resorbable and titanium plating systems for osteofixation in bimaxillary orthognathic surgery [57 - 59]. In contrast, Landes et al. reported compromised segmental stability in maxillary elongation and in mandibular setback with u-HA/PLLA composite osteosynthesis. They applied one 1.4 -mm 4 -hole plate and 8 -mm monocortical screws at a mandibular SSRO site and recommended longer <b>intermaxillary</b> <b>fixation,</b> double osteosynthesis or use of larger plates [30]. However, in most studies the groups were not matched for the magnitude or direction of fragment movement. Prospective studies with larger patient numbers are needed.|$|E
