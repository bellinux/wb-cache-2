This has been implicated in the increasing frequency and severity of diseases such as cancer, chronic inflammatory disorders, breakthrough infections and autoimmunity.

Ultimately, this provides problems in diagnosis and subsequently, treatment.|$|E
50|$|The {{development}} of communicative language teaching was bolstered by new academic ideas. Before {{the growth of}} communicative language teaching, the primary method of language teaching was situational language teaching. This method was much more clinical in nature and relied less on direct communication. In Britain, applied linguists began to doubt the efficacy of situational language teaching. This was partly in response to Chomsky's insights {{into the nature of}} language. Chomsky had shown that the structural theories of language prevalent at the time could not explain the variety found in real communication. In addition, applied linguists such as Christopher Candlin and Henry Widdowson observed that the current model of language learning was ineffective in classrooms. They saw a need for students to develop communicative skill and <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> in addition to mastering language structures.|$|E
40|$|Measures of <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> {{have been}} {{introduced}} to supplement standard cognitive and neuropsychological evaluations in schizophrenia research and practice. Func-tional competence comprises skills and abilities that are more relevant to daily life and community adjustment. However, {{it is unclear whether}} relevance translates into sig-nificantly enhanced prediction of real-world outcomes. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess the specific contribution of <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> in predicting a key aspect of real-world outcome in schizophrenia: community independence. Demographic, clinical, cognitive, and functional compe-tence data were obtained from 127 patients with schizo-phrenia or schizoaffective disorder and used to predict community independence concurrently and longitudinally after 10 months. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that demographic, clinical, and cognitive predictors accounted jointly for 35 %– 38 % of the variance in commu-nity independence across assessment points. <b>Functional</b> <b>competence</b> data failed to add significantly to this validity. Considered separately from demographic and clinical pre-dictors, cognitive and <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> data accounted for significant amounts of outcome variance. However, the addition of <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> to stan-dard cognitive test data yielded a significant increase in val-idity only for concurrent and not for longitudinal prediction of community independence. The specific real-world valid-ity of <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> is modest, yielding informa-tion that is largely redundant with standard cognitive performance.

In particular it addresses {{the question of whether}} dynamic capabilities impact directly or indirectly on performance. Using data from manufacturing firms, the paper articulates and measures dynamic capabilities as a multi-dimensional construct with three underlying factors: coordination, learning and strategic competitive response. Then, structural equation modelling is employed to explore the relationships among dynamic capabilities, <b>functional</b> <b>competences</b> and firm performance. Empirical findings suggest that dynamic capabilities are antecedents to <b>functional</b> <b>competences</b> which in turn {{have a significant effect on}} performance.

The primary aim {{of this study was to}} identify the number of days older adults should participate in the activities of social groups to maintain their health for 4 years. This study also aimed to examine whether the effective frequency differs by the type of social group activity. We examined a prospective cohort of 1, 320 community-dwelling older adults over 65 years of age, who responded to both a baseline and a follow-up mail survey, in a suburban city of Tokyo, Japan. The dependent variable was the change in <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> during 4 years. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to examine the effects of participation in the activities of the 5 most common social groups among older Japanese on maintaining <b>functional</b> <b>competence.</b> Nine hundred and ninety-four participants (76. 5 %) maintained their <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> for 4 years. The results of the logistic regression analyses showed that participating in alumni groups less than once a month and being an inactive member were associated with higher odds of maintaining <b>functional</b> <b>competence,</b> after controlling for socioeconomic, demographic and baseline health status. Additionally, the odds of maintaining <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> for 4 years increased upon participating in volunteer groups once a month or more. These results were also confirmed using logistic regression analysis, even after adjustment for the effects of participation in other social groups. The results indicated the effectiveness of volunteer activities that fulfill a social role in maintaining health. Therefore, older adults should be encouraged to participate in activities of volunteer groups at least once a month. Additionally, older adults can obtain positive health outcomes through less frequent participation in alumni groups, compared with the activities of volunteer groups...|$|E

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Scores achieved in tests of cognitive function and <b>functional</b> <b>competence.</b> RESULTS [...] 72 Patients were allocated to receive general anaesthesia and 74 regional anaesthesia. Anaesthetic technique did not influence the duration of the operation, time to mobilisation postoperatively, requirements for analgesia after the operation, or duration of stay in hospital. Three months after the operation there was an improvement in the score for the recognition component (76 ms, 95 % confidence interval 9 to 144) and the response component (82 ms, 5 to 158) of the choice reaction time in the group receiving general anaesthesia compared with the group receiving regional anaesthesia.

40|$|Since XIX century, it {{has been}} {{assessed}} that complex functions are controlled by cortical areas. Sperimental studies have proved a large diffusion of functional lateralization in animals. During the neurogenesis the cell death mechanism (subjected to several inputs as availability of trophic materials or sex hormones) is an important moment for subsequent functional-anatomical organization. About anatomy, {{it has been}} observed that cortical areas and anatomic structures functionally connected with language have an asymmetric development or a specific biochemical activity. For example, the planum temporale is larger on the left side; the activity of choline acetyltransferase is more intensive in area 22 of the left hemisphere; the thalamic lateralis posterior nucleus is larger on the left side; norepinephrine, then, is concentrated on the pulvinar. The statement that each hemisphere shows specific skills has been confirmed by neuropsychological, neurophysiological and functional neuroimaging studies. The left hemisphere would seem to be wired for verbal tasks, whereas the right one would be superior in solving perceptive-spatial problems. The speech function uses different circuits with consequent activation-inactivation of numerous cortical areas and subcortical structures, with particular <b>functional</b> <b>competences.</b> The conception of cerebral "dominance" have been replaced by "lateralization" of some functions, partly genetically predetermined, partly subsequent to environmental influence...|$|R

The present study discusses the existence of a legal basis for such an optional instrument. The European Community only has the power to take any measures, including an optional instrument relating to contract law, insofar as a power is attributed to it by the founding Treaties. The EC Treaty does not provide a specific competence to create private law instruments nor does it provide any general competence to harmonize private law. Therefore, recourse is sought to the <b>functional</b> <b>competences</b> laid down in the Treaty. The potentially relevant competences include the ones following from Articles 61 - 67, 94, 95, and 308 of the EC Treaty. Considering the relevant EC Treaty provisions and ECJ case law concerning legal bases, the study suggests that Article 308 EC seems to be the most likely provision to provide a legal base for enacting one or more optional instruments concerning European contract law. However, even Article 308 EC cannot serve as a legal basis for enacting the entire CFR; any optional instrument will have to be limited to rules on the subjects that are particularly relevant to the internal market...|$|R

While an increasing number of studies have recently attempted to investigate questions about the ecological validity of neuropsychological tests, numerous methodological problems, such as poor choice of predictor and outcome variables, have prevented a clear understanding of the relationships between neuropsychological performance and everyday functioning. The present study was designed to assess the utility of a battery of commonly used neuropsychological measures which tap a broad range of cognitive skills in predicting <b>functional</b> <b>competence</b> and vocational functioning in a sample of 25 individuals with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). A secondary goal {{of this study was to}} investigate the relative utility of neuropsychological measures when compared with other well-described predictors of outcome, including demographic, biomedical, and emotional variables. Results indicated that participants were severely impaired, performing at approximately one to two standard deviations below the mean on most measures of neuropsychological, vocational, and functional performance. Analyses revealed that neuropsychological measures were generally poor predictors of vocational functioning, and that they did not provide significantly greater predictive utility than demographic variables such as prior occupational level. In contrast, neuropsychological measures of arithmetic and attention/speed of information processing accounted for approximately 46 % of the variance in measures of overall <b>functional</b> <b>competence,</b> and provided a greater degree of predictive utility than demographic, emotional, or biomedical variables. Limitations of the study include small sample size and homogeneity of injury severity and suggest that these findings may be applicable to only a severe TBI sample.

40|$|The role of competency-based {{performance}} management {{is growing in}} significance in many industries and sectors. Unlike <b>functional</b> <b>competences,</b> which measure performance against predetermined minimum occupational standards, competency-based systems are founded on the key behavioural competencies that underlie superior levels of performance. In order to identify the key behaviours leading to performance excellence amongst construction project managers, in-depth behavioural event interviews were used in which managers were asked to recount critical management incidents, decisions and actions from which their behavioural competencies could be identified. By delineating the sample according to their performance against a range of role-based criteria, the competencies defining superior management performance were determined. Statistical techniques were then used to develop a model {{that can be used}} to predict likely employee performance, which was subsequently validated on a second criterion sample. The research identifies 12 core behavioural competencies that underpin effective project management performance, of which two - 'composure' and 'team leadership' - were the most predictive. The paper explores the potential role and application of the framework in the drive for performance excellence within the industry, such as in selection, management development, succession planning, {{performance management}} and team deployment. It is argued that it offers an innovative alternative to normative micro-competence-based approaches that do little to engender performance excellence amongst the industry's key managers and professionals. ...|$|R
