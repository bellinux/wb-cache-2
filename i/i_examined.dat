5|$|<b>I</b> <b>examined</b> Mr. Andrew Wilson on Feb. 15 & 16, 1982. He had {{multiple}} bruises, swellings and abrasions {{on his face}} and head. His right eye was battered and had a superficial laceration. Andrew Wilson had several linear blisters on his right thigh, right cheek and anterior chest which were consistent with radiator burns. He stated he'd been cuffed to a radiator and pushed into it. He also stated that electrical shocks had been administered to his gums, lips and genitals. All these injuries occurred prior to his arrival at the Jail. There must be a thorough investigation of this alleged brutality.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the case}} of Harvey Lillard, Palmer stated: [...] "I had a case of heart trouble which was not improving. <b>I</b> <b>examined</b> the spine and found a {{displaced}} vertebra pressing against the nerves which innervate the heart. I adjusted the vertebra and gave immediate relief– nothing [...] "accidental" [...] or [...] "crude" [...] about this. Then I began to reason if two diseases, so dissimilar as deafness and heart trouble, came from impingement, a pressure on nerves, were not other disease due to a similar cause? Thus the science (knowledge) and art (adjusting) of Chiropractic were formed at that time." ...|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> three {{important}} questions regarding how political institutions have shaped {{the course of}} economic development in the Pacific Northwest. Specifically, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> how immigration policy altered who migrated to frontier regions in the Pacific Northwest, how western settlement and institutions affected indigenous peoples, and how these indigenous groups ultimately perform relative to other racial groups in the contemporary U. S. economy. <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> these questions empirically in three papers that span {{the course of the}} 20 th century and utilize two new sources of hand-collected data. First, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> whether the 1921 Emergency Immigration Act affected the skills of incoming migrants using ship manifest data from ports in the Pacific Northwest. Under the 1921 act, entry was restricted to 3...|$|R

One variable that has been identified extensively as a contributor to peer outcomes is children's family environment. In the present investigation, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the relation between adolescents' family environment and peer relationships. Specifically, I study how family conflict, including both parent-child conflict and marital conflict, is linked to social acceptance and social behavior. <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> whether adolescents' depressive symptoms act as a mediator of the links between family conflict and social acceptance and behavior. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the moderating role of gender...|$|R

Contrary to popular belief, the results are often disastrous, with more harm than good resulting from celebrities??? efforts. Using a relational discourse module, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> parings between different agents. With celebrities {{in the center of the}} network, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> their shared knowledge, discourse, and interaction with governments, NGOs, and their audience.

40|$|In this dissertation, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> {{the role}} of CEOs and {{corporate}} diversification on corporate social performance (CSP). In the first essay of the dissertation, I evaluate the financial implications of corporate social performance and assess the validity of a widely used measure of social performance, the KLD social ratings. In {{the first part of}} this essay, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the relationship between CSP and financial performance. The results show that CSP has a negative relationship with short-term financial performance, but a positive relationship with long-term financial performance. In addition, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> whether introducing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act had a substantial impact on the relationship between CSP and financial performance. The results show that enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may have caused changes in social perceptions about the importance of corporate social responsibility (CSR). In the second part of this essay, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the validity of the KLD social ratings. The analysis shows that the KLD social ratings effectively summarize the past CSP information of firms, but they predict future CSP less effectively. In the second essay of the dissertation, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> how CEO retirement may influence CSP. I propose that CEOs reduce investment in social issues when they are approaching retirement, resulting in a negativ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> {{workforce}} intermediation {{as a tool}} for regional economic transition. While most studies of workforce intermediation in the United States focus on targeted programs that work with less-advantaged socioeconomic groups, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> strategies adopted by state-funded community colleges that have a more encompassing or universalistic mandate. Through a case study of North Carolina’s BioWork initiative <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> college-level strategies for assisting two distinct groups of job seekers in biopharmaceuticals—those with less education and traditional manufacturing backgrounds and those with college degrees and considerable technology experience. In documenting these strategies I suggest lessons for other regions seeking to influence local labor-market conditions and, in turn, balance the employment needs of diverse socioeconomic groups. ...|$|R

40|$|Among {{the various}} theses in the {{philosophy}} of mathematics, intuitionism is the thesis that numbers are constructs of the human mind. In this thesis, a historical account of intuitionism will be exposited- - from its beginnings in Kant's classic work, Critique of Pure Reason, to contemporary treatments by Brouwer and other intuitionists who have developed his position further. In chapter II, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the ontology of Kant's philosophy of arithmetic. The issue at hand is to explore how Kant, using intuition and time, argues for numbers as mental constructs. In chapter III, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> how mathematics for Kant yields synthetic a priori truth, which is to say an informative statement about the world whose truth can be known independently of observation. In chapter IV, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> how intuitionism developed under the care of Brouwer and others (e. g. Dummett) and how Hilbert sought to address issues in Kantian philosophy of mathematics with his finitist approach. In conclusion, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> briefly what intuitionism resolves and what it leaves to be desired...|$|R
40|$|The {{reign of}} Napoleon Bonaparte {{was one of}} {{military}} glory, both real and imagined. In this thesis, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the promotion of Napoleon’s Egyptian campaign (1798 - 1801), perhaps the most disastrous episode of his military career. Nonetheless, he commissioned paintings {{in honor of the}} expedition. <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> some of them, focusing on the propaganda tactics deployed. I then consider how these strategies were applied to the Description de l’Égypte, the publication dedicated to the Egyptian campaign. I then explore the promotion of the expedition in the areas of architecture, interior furnishings and the decorative arts. <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the selection of sources from ancient Rome and Egypt, exploring in particular interiors by Napoleon’s lead architects Charles Percier and Pierre Fontaine. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the decorative arts commemorating the Egyptian campaign, analyzing the influence of the publication Description de l’Égypte. My contribution to this thesis is the expansion of the realm of inquiry to include paintings, architecture, iv urbanism, interior décor and decorative arts providing new insights into a project o...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> how {{language}} universals reveal {{information about}} the relationship between culture and language. To further understand this connection, I conduct a survey with non-native English speakers. I present universal idioms and ask each participant to write down an equivalent idiom in English, translated from their native language. <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> which expressions are cross-cultural, noticing which languages express the figurative speech in ways different from English and other languages. I identify the varieties of expressions of universal ideas, specifically in relation to the culture of each language. I also address the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis through my research, agreeing that language affects society. Through my research and experiment, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> how universal human experiences are conveyed based on culture...|$|R

First, <b>I</b> <b>examine</b> the impact of the independent variables on sentence length using regression analysis to determine influences on sentencing for judges and juries.
