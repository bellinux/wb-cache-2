This PCR technique utilizes the 5' nuclease activity of Taq DNA polymerase to cleave a nonextendible, fluorescence-labeled <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> during the extension phase of PCR. A second fluorescent dye, e.g., 6-carboxy-tetramethyl-rhodamine, quenches the fluorescence of the intact probe. The nuclease cleavage of the <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> during the PCR releases the effect of quenching resulting in an increase of fluorescence proportional {{to the amount of}} PCR product, which can be monitored by a sequence detector.|$|E

50|$|Southern {{transfer}} may be {{used for}} homology-based cloning on the basis of amino acid sequence of the protein product of the target gene. Oligonucleotides are designed that are similar to the target sequence.

50|$|Molecular beacons are {{oligonucleotide}} <b>hybridization</b> <b>probes</b> {{that can}} report {{the presence of}} specific nucleic acids in homogenous solutions. The term more often used is molecular beacon probes. Molecular beacons are hairpin shaped molecules with an internally quenched fluorophore whose fluorescence is restored when they bind to a target nucleic acid sequence. This is a novel non-radioactive method for detecting specific sequences of nucleic acids.

5000|$|Primer {{extension}} {{offers an}} alternative to a nuclease protection assay (S1 nuclease mapping) for quantifying and mapping RNA transcripts. The <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> for primer extension is a synthesized oligonucleotide, whereas S1 mapping requires isolation of a DNA fragment. Both methods provide information where a mRNA starts and provide {{an estimate of the}} concentration of a transcript by the intensity of the transcript band on the resulting autoradiograph. Unlike S1 mapping, however, primer extension can only be used to locate the 5’-end of an mRNA transcript because the DNA synthesis required for the assay relies on reverse transcriptase (only polymerizes in the 5’ → 3’ direction).|$|E
5000|$|The {{membrane}} is then {{exposed to}} a hybridization probe—a single DNA fragment with a specific sequence whose presence in the target DNA is to be determined. The probe DNA is labelled {{so that it can}} be detected, usually by incorporating radioactivity or tagging the molecule with a fluorescent or chromogenic dye. In some cases, the <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> may be made from RNA, rather than DNA. To ensure the specificity of the binding of the probe to the sample DNA, most common hybridization methods use salmon or herring sperm DNA for blocking of the membrane surface and target DNA, deionized formamide, and detergents such as SDS to reduce non-specific binding of the probe.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Due {{to their}} high {{sensitivity}} and selectivity, minimum interference with living biological systems, {{and ease of}} design and synthesis, fluorescent <b>hybridization</b> <b>probes</b> {{have been widely used}} to detect nucleic acids both in vivo and in vitro. Molecular beacons (MBs) and binary probes (BPs) are two very important <b>hybridization</b> <b>probes</b> that are designed based on well-established photophysical principles. These probes have shown particular applicability in a variety of studies, such as mRNA tracking, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) monitoring, and microorganism identification. Molecular beacons are hairpin oligonucleo-tide probes that present distinctive fluorescent signatures in the presence and absence of their target. Binary probes consist of two fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide strands that can hybridize to adjacent regions of their target and generate distinctive fluorescence signals. These probes have been extensively studied and modified for different appli-cations by modulating their structures or using various combinations of fluorophores, excimer-forming molecules, and metal complexes.

Briefly, about 20  μg DNA from chickens that PCR amplified positive were digested by Hind III, and conducted slow electrophoresis under a low voltage about 40  V for 12  h. Southern blot analysis was implemented with specific <b>hybridization</b> <b>probes</b> which had been labelled with digoxigenin (DIG) using the PCR DIG Probe Synthesis Kit (Roche) after target fragments transferred to a Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, USA). <b>Hybridization</b> <b>probes</b> were amplified using the primers hLZ-S and hLZ-A (Table  1).|$|R
40|$|Novel amino-reactive {{derivatives}} of lanthanide-based luminescent labels of enhanced {{brightness and}} metal retention were synthesized {{and used for}} the detection of cDNA oligonucleotides by molecular beacons. Time-resolved acquisition of the luminescent signal that occurs upon <b>hybridization</b> of the <b>probe</b> to the target enabled the avoidance of short-lived background fluorescence, markedly enhancing the sensitivity of detection, which was less than 1 pM. This value is about 50 to 100 times more sensitive than the level achieved with conventional fluorescence-based molecular beacons, and is 10 to 60 times more sensitive than previously reported for other lanthanide-based <b>hybridization</b> <b>probes.</b> These novel luminescent labels should significantly enhance the sensitivity of all type of nucleic acid <b>hybridization</b> <b>probes,</b> and could dramatically improve the detection limit of other biopolymers and small compounds that are used in a variety of biological applications...|$|R

5000|$|The {{techniques}} used for its detection can be immunohistochemistry, immunocytochemistry, methods that utilize transcriptional modulators and site-specific recombinases to label specific neuronal population, {{in situ hybridization}} or {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH). [...] A neuronal lineage marker can be a neuronal antigen that is recognized by an autoantibody for example Hu, which is highly restricted to neuronal nuclei. By immunohistochemistry, anti-Hu stains the nuclei of neurons. To localize mRNA in brain tissue, one can use a fragment of DNA or RNA as a neuronal lineage marker, a <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> that detects the presence of nucleotide sequences that are complementary to the sequence in the probe. This technique is known as in situ hybridization. Its application have been carried out in all different tissues, but particularly useful in neuroscience. Using this technique, it is possible to locate gene expression to specific cell types in specific regions and observe how changes in this distribution occur throughout the development and correlate with the behavioral manipulations.|$|E
5000|$|With {{northern}} blotting {{it is possible}} to observe cellular control over structure and function by determining the particular gene expression rates during differentiation and morphogenesis, as well as in abnormal or diseased conditions. [...] Northern blotting involves the use of electrophoresis to separate RNA samples by size, and detection with a <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> complementary to part of or the entire target sequence. The term 'northern blot' actually refers specifically to the capillary transfer of RNA from the electrophoresis gel to the blotting membrane. However, the entire process is commonly referred to as {{northern blotting}}. [...] The northern blot technique was developed in 1977 by James Alwine, David Kemp, and George Stark at Stanford University. [...] Northern blotting takes its name from its similarity to the first blotting technique, the Southern blot, named for biologist Edwin Southern. [...] The major difference is that RNA, rather than DNA, is analyzed in the northern blot.|$|E

50|$|Hybridization of {{the probe}} to a {{specific}} DNA fragment on the filter membrane indicates that this fragment contains DNA sequence that is complementary to the probe.The transfer step of the DNA from the electrophoresis gel to a membrane permits easy binding of the labeled <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> to the size-fractionated DNA. It also allows for the fixation of the target-probe hybrids, required for analysis by autoradiography or other detection methods.Southern blots performed with restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA {{may be used to}} determine the number of sequences (e.g., gene copies) in a genome. A probe that hybridizes only to a single DNA segment that has not been cut by the restriction enzyme will produce a single band on a Southern blot, whereas multiple bands will likely be observed when the probe hybridizes to several highly similar sequences (e.g., those that {{may be the result of}} sequence duplication). Modification of the hybridization conditions (for example, increasing the hybridization temperature or decreasing salt concentration) may be used to increase specificity and decrease hybridization of the probe to sequences that are less than 100% similar.|$|E
5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology, a <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> is {{a fragment}} of DNA or RNA of variable length (usually 100-1000 bases long) which can be radioactively labeled. It can then be used in DNA or RNA samples to detect the presence of nucleotide sequences (the DNA target) that are complementary to the sequence in the probe. The probe thereby hybridizes to single-stranded nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) whose base sequence allows probe-target base pairing due to complementarity between the probe and target. The labeled probe is first denatured (by heating or under alkaline conditions such as exposure to sodium hydroxide) into single stranded DNA (ssDNA) and then hybridized to the target ssDNA (Southern blotting) or RNA (northern blotting) immobilized on a membrane or in situ.To detect hybridization of the probe to its target sequence, the probe is tagged (or [...] "labeled") with a molecular marker of either radioactive or (more recently) fluorescent molecules; commonly used markers are 32P (a radioactive isotope of phosphorus incorporated into the phosphodiester bond in the probe DNA) or Digoxigenin, which is a non-radioactive, antibody-based marker. DNA sequences or RNA transcripts that have moderate to high sequence similarity to the probe are then detected by visualizing the hybridized probe via autoradiography or other imaging techniques. Normally, either X-ray pictures are taken of the filter, or the filter is placed under UV light. Detection of sequences with moderate or high similarity depends on how stringent the hybridization conditions were applied — high stringency, such as high hybridization temperature and low salt in hybridization buffers, permits only hybridization between nucleic acid sequences that are highly similar, whereas low stringency, such as lower temperature and high salt, allows hybridization when the sequences are less similar. Hybridization probes used in DNA microarrays refer to DNA covalently attached to an inert surface, such as coated glass slides or gene chips, to which a mobile cDNA target is hybridized.|$|E

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to microscopic identification of Entamoeba histolytica parasites isolated from stool, a sensitive and species-specific DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> was made for rapid diagnosis of E. histolytica parasites in clinical samples directly applied to nylon membranes. The DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> was made by screening a genomic library of a virulent HM- 1 :IMSS strain of E. histolytica to detect recombinant plasmids containing highly repeated parasite DNA sequences. Four plasmid clones that reacted across Entamoeba species coded for highly repeated rRNA genes of E. histolytica. Four other plasmid clones were E. histolytica specific in that they bound to four axenized and nine xenic strains of E. histolytica but did not recognize closely related E. histolytica-like Laredo, Entamoeba moshkovskii, or Entamoeba invadens parasites. The diagnostic clones detected as few as eight cultured amoebae and did not distinguish between pathogenic and nonpathogenic zymodemes of E. histolytica. The diagnostic clones were sequenced and contained 145 -base-pair sequences which appear to be tandemly repeated in the genome. No stable transcript which is homologous to the diagnostic DNA was detected. In a study of stool samples from Mexico City shown by microscopy to contain E. histolytica, Entamoeba coli, Giardia lamblia, Endolimax nana, Trichuris trichiuria, and Chilomastix mesnili parasites, the DNA <b>hybridization</b> <b>probe</b> demonstrated a sensitivity of 1. 0 and a specificity of 0. 93.
