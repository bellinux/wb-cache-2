5|$|With {{over one}} million units in sales, John Madden Football '93 was a {{commercial}} success. Critics awarded the game high scores and praised its updated graphics; but several reviewers complained that little <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> John Madden Football '92. Royalties from the game funded the expansion of Blue Sky Productions, and the company's director, Paul Neurath, later commented {{that the size of}} these royalties led Electronic Arts to develop future Madden titles in-house.|$|E
5|$|The {{resulting}} reforms {{helped shape}} the cavalry's contribution to the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), which was established with one cavalry division supported by two brigades of horse artillery. All would be trained for the mounted charge but would also be armed with rifles, the only major power to do so. The cavalry regiments were armed with Maxim Machine Guns, although these were replaced by Vickers Machine Guns from 1912. More than anything else, the issue of entrenching tools that were carried on the troop packhorses demonstrated how much the cavalry's doctrine <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the Boer Wars.|$|E
5|$|The seventh episode {{features}} Stéphane Quême, {{otherwise known}} as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album Homework. Quême noted that the group's sound <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of Random Access Memories was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from {{it in the same}} way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.|$|E

5|$|When the {{war ended}} in 1945, the ACLU was 25 years old, and had {{accumulated}} an impressive set of legal victories. President Harry S. Truman sent a congratulatory telegram to the ACLU {{on the occasion of}} their 25th anniversary. American attitudes <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> World War I, and dissent by minorities was tolerated with more willingness. The Bill of Rights was more respected, and minority rights were becoming more commonly championed. During their 1945 annual conference, the ACLU leaders composed a list of important civil rights issues to focus on in the future, and the list included racial discrimination and separation of church and state.|$|E
5|$|James J. Murakami {{supervised}} the production design. Location scouting revealed {{that many of}} the older buildings in Los Angeles had been torn down, including the entire neighborhood where Collins lived. Suburban areas in San Dimas, San Bernardino and Pasadena doubled for 1920s Los Angeles instead. The Old Town district of San Dimas stood in for Collins' neighborhood and some adjacent locales. Murakami said Old Town was chosen because very little <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 1920s. It was used for interiors and exteriors; the crew decorated the area with a subdued color palette to evoke feelings of comfort. For some exterior shots they renovated derelict properties in neighborhoods of Los Angeles that still possessed 1920s architecture. The crew staged {{the third floor of the}} Park Plaza Hotel in Los Angeles into a replica of the 1920s Los Angeles City Council chambers.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} Canada's role in the Afghanistan War, {{concerns}} were raised about the stringency of the criteria {{that needed to be}} met to receive the Victoria Cross. Other countries with a Victoria Cross had awarded it numerous times {{since the end of the}} Second World War, some members of the Australian, New Zealand, and British armed forces receiving the decoration for their actions during the Afghan and Iraq wars of the 2000s. Members of the Canadian Armed Forces questioned why some actions by Canadians were deemed worthy only of the Star of Military Valour; citations for individuals who'd received the imperial Victoria Cross during the First World War were very similar to those for Canadians who were presented with the Star of Military Valour during the war in Afghanistan. This led then Chief of the Defence Staff, Walter Natynczyk, to create a special committee to review the matter. The Department of National Defence's Directorate of Honours and Recognition explained concepts of war <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the mid-20th century and Canada had also developed a more elaborate honours system.|$|E

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu enjoyed the {{tactical}} gameplay and new elements, along with appreciating the thrill {{induced by the}} permanent death mechanic. A minor criticism was issues with the pacing. Harris enjoyed the gameplay despite noting that little <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the release of Fire Emblem, saying that players would not find any notable changes from their original experience. Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of Fire Emblem, along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy gameplay, and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels. Foster called the gameplay the game's biggest feature and greatest strength despite not having changed much since the previous game. Knight enjoyed the gameplay experience, but was mixed to negative {{about the lack of}} true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier Fire Emblem games. Bramwell enjoyed the gameplay despite getting frustrated at the permanent death mechanic, and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large amounts of time creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.|$|E

25|$|The Land Commission of 1920 {{sought to}} address {{increasing}} African landlessness and recommended strict observance of the “non-disturbance” clauses {{contained in the}} Certificates of Claim. However, these clauses were largely ineffective, because landowners routinely ignored them and because the practice of shifting cultivation meant that the land occupied by tenants <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the time the certificate were issued.|$|E

25|$|In September, Proposition 8 proponents filed {{a motion}} for summary judgment. Running more than 100 pages, the motion {{asked the court to}} rule that Proposition 8 did not offend the U.S. Constitution without the need to find facts at a trial. The motion {{asserted}} that Baker v. Nelson foreclosed any further review by the court. Failing that, the motion argued that all of the couples' claims failed as a matter of law. After a two-hour hearing on October 13, Walker denied the motion. He noted that the Supreme Court doctrine on sexual orientation and gender discrimination <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> 1972. Resolving the amendment's validity, Walker noted, required hearing testimony at trial.|$|E
25|$|The Book of the Eparch, {{which dates}} to the 10th century, gives a {{detailed}} picture of the city's commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament {{to the strength of}} tradition how little these arrangements <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome.|$|E
25|$|These women covered {{topics such}} as their lives before the uprising, what <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since,</b> and how women {{have participated in the}} EZLN. Also, the Zapatista women talked about the terrible {{conditions}} that women suffered which the Zapatistas sought to fix, including: the mistreatment from working for landowners, violence at home, discrimination faced in their own communities, and lack of access to health care and education. Then, the women went on to discuss how the Zapatista movement changed their lives such as decreasing domestic violence, more freedom in regards to marriage and children, and more rights in general. One way that women achieved these changes is through the women’s collectives which allowed the women to be more independent which led to increased participation in the Zapatista movement.|$|E

25|$|The {{format of}} Eirodziesma <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 2008 contest. Three semi finals {{were to have}} taken place during January and February 2009. Three songs from each {{selection}} out of nine were to qualify for the final through a mixture of jury and televoting. A 10th song was to be chosen at a Second Chance heat during the last semi final, and the public would have decided the final song to qualify through 100% televote. The final of Eirodziesma 2009 was {{to have taken place}} on 28 February 2009. Due to financial difficulties, LTV were forced to cut down the number of semi-finals to be held from three to just one. The semi-final will take place on 27 February, with the final a day later on 28 February.|$|E
25|$|In an {{announcement}} on June 28, 2004, Cassini program scientists described {{the measurement of}} the rotational period of Saturn. Because there are no fixed features on the surface {{that can be used}} to obtain this period, the repetition of radio emissions was used. This new data agreed with the latest values measured from Earth, and constituted a puzzle to the scientists. It turns out that the radio rotational period <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> it was first measured in 1980 by Voyager 1, and it was now 6 minutes longer. This, however, does not indicate a change in the overall spin of the planet, but is thought to be due to movement of the source of the radio emissions to a different latitude, at which the rotation rate is different.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to those numbers being far apart, much <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> the 2004 deal expired. The Hiawatha Light Rail (later Blue Line) had opened and become a huge success. Funding for the Northstar commuter rail line had been approved. As anticipated, these two lines would eventually converge on {{the northwest corner of}} the Rapid Park Site, now the likely location for a future multi-modal transportation hub. The site itself had been rezoned in 2005, allowing its development into high end commercial and residential space. Land Partners II had entered into a development agreement with Hines Corporation for this purpose, as a backup in the event that the land was not chosen as home for the Twins. Given the scarcity of land available in downtown Minneapolis, the land owners had multiple reasons to believe that the land’s value had, in fact, increased substantially since 2004, with or without a ballpark.|$|E

500|$|The {{elections}} that followed {{were marked by}} violence and charges of fraud. Asked whether he thought Nigerian politics <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> A Man of the People, Achebe replied: [...] "I think, if anything, the Nigerian politician has deteriorated." [...] After the elections, he engaged in a heated argument– which almost became a fistfight– with Bakin Zuwo, the newly elected governor of Kano State. He left the PRP and afterwards kept his distance from political parties, expressing his sadness at the dishonesty and weakness of the people involved.|$|E
500|$|As David remarked in this section, her {{approach}} to measuring out ingredients <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> her early days: [...] "By temperament a non-measurer, I have myself, first through {{the wish to}} communicate recipes and now by force of habit, become the reverse. I find that the discipline of weighing and measuring does one's cooking nothing but good, provided that one does not waste time messing about with quarter-saltspoons and five-eighths of pints, nor, above all, expect that precision will eliminate the necessity to keep one's head or train one's eye and palate." [...] The author does not conceal her dislike for some much-used herbs: sage [...] "deadens the food with its musty dried blood scent" [...] and rosemary [...] "acrid taste … the spiky little leaves get stuck between your teeth." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the shoot}} at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his {{experience}} there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, [...] "The first day, I {{was in a}} cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water's churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don't want to remember it." [...] The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish Deep Blue Sea from Jaws, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>since</b> then.|$|E
