5|$|The mediastinal {{surface of}} the right lung is {{indented}} {{by a number of}} nearby structures. The heart sits in an impression called the cardiac impression. Above the <b>hilum</b> of the lung is an arched groove for the azygos vein, and above this is a wide groove for the superior vena cava and right brachiocephalic vein; behind this, and close {{to the top of the}} lung is a groove for the brachiocephalic artery. There is a groove for the esophagus behind the <b>hilum</b> and the pulmonary ligament, and near the lower part of the esophageal groove is a deeper groove for the inferior vena cava before it enters the heart.|$|E
5|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{may occur}} when the chest is suddenly decelerated, as occurs in vehicle accidents, producing a shearing force. The lungs are mobile in the chest cavity but their movement is more restricted near the <b>hilum.</b> Areas near the cricoid cartilage and carina are fixed to the thyroid cartilage and the pericardium respectively; thus if the airways move, they can tear at these points of fixation.|$|E
5|$|The right lung {{has both}} more lobes and {{segments}} than the left. It {{is divided into}} three lobes, an upper, middle, and a lower, by two fissures, one oblique and one horizontal. The upper, horizontal fissure, separates the upper from the middle lobe. It begins in the lower oblique fissure near the posterior border of the lung, and, running horizontally forward, cuts the anterior border on a level with the sternal end of the fourth costal cartilage; on the mediastinal surface it may be traced backward to the <b>hilum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main or primary bronchi {{enter the}} lungs at the <b>hilum</b> and {{initially}} branch into secondary bronchi {{also known as}} lobar bronchi that supply air to each lobe of the lung. The lobar bronchi branch into tertiary bronchi also known as segmental bronchi and these supply air to the further divisions of the lobes known as bronchopulmonary segments. Each bronchopulmonary segment has its own (segmental) bronchus and arterial supply. Segments for {{the left and right}} lung are shown in the table. The segmental anatomy is useful clinically for localising disease processes in the lungs. A segment is a discrete unit that can be surgically removed without seriously affecting surrounding tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white, and the oval to oblong spores are 7.5–9.5μm long by 5.0–7.0μm wide. Spores are smooth, hyaline (translucent), nonamyloid, {{and have a}} {{prominent}} <b>hilum.</b> The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are cylindrical to club shaped, four spored, and measure 39–50 by 8.0–9.6μm. The cystidia present on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are thin walled, hyaline, have a short stalk and a spherical apical portion, and measure 29–41 by 12–21μm; cystidia are absent from the gill face. The cap cuticle ranges in cellular form from a cutis (in which the hyphae are bent over, running parallel to the cap surface) to a trichoderm (with hyphae emerging roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface); the hyphae comprising the cuticle are cylindrical, and measure 2.0–9.0μm wide with a club-shaped tip up to 11μm wide.|$|E
5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or roughened, with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The <b>hilum</b> (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of a lymph node consists of lymphoid follicles in an outer portion called the cortex. The inner {{portion of the}} node is called the medulla, which is surrounded by the cortex on all sides except for a portion known as the <b>hilum.</b> The <b>hilum</b> presents as a depression {{on the surface of}} the lymph node, causing the otherwise spherical lymph node to be bean-shaped or ovoid. The efferent lymph vessel directly emerges from the lymph node at the <b>hilum.</b> The arteries and veins supplying the lymph node with blood enter and exit through the <b>hilum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Near {{the middle}} of the spleen lies a long fissure, the splenic <b>hilum.</b> The <b>hilum</b> is the point of {{attachment}} for the gastrosplenic ligament, and the point of insertion for the splenic artery and splenic vein. There are other openings present for lymphatic vessels and nerves.|$|E
25|$|The gland is {{internally}} {{divided into}} lobules. Blood vessels and nerves enter the glands at the <b>hilum</b> and gradually branch {{out into the}} lobules.|$|E
25|$|A scar {{also may}} {{remain on the}} seed coat, called the <b>hilum,</b> where the seed was {{attached}} to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the ovule.|$|E
25|$|Setosphaeria rostrata produce mature conidia with a {{distinct}} protruding <b>hilum.</b> The conidia are either straight, curved or bent and the septum above the <b>hilum</b> is thickened and dark. The walls are typically roughened and brown to olive in colour and there are typically 7–9 septa, however, some have 4–14. Exserohilum species typically exhibit rapid growth producing darkly pigmented colonies. Two other closely related species, E. longirostratum, and E. mcginnisii display a high homology with E. rostratum; however these can be differentiated by conidial morphology.Exserohilum ongirostratum is characterized by larger conidia (up to 228 x 12–19μm), with 6–16 distosepta centrally curved. In contrast, E. mcginnisii has slightly clavate conidia, which are smooth-walled and brown and measure 44–76 x 11–18μm with 4–8 distosepta lacking darkened bands.|$|E
25|$|Sesame {{seeds are}} small. Their size, form, and colours {{vary with the}} {{thousands}} of varieties now known. Typically, the seeds are about 3 to 4mm long by 2mm wide and 1mm thick. The seeds are ovate, slightly flattened, and somewhat thinner at {{the eye of the}} seed (<b>hilum)</b> than at the opposite end. The weight of the seeds is between 20 and 40mg. The seed coat (testa) may be smooth or ribbed.|$|E
25|$|The first bronchi {{to branch}} from the trachea {{are the right}} and left main bronchi. Second only in {{diameter}} to the trachea (1.8cm), these bronchi (1 -1.4cm in diameter) enter the lungs at each <b>hilum,</b> where they branch into narrower secondary bronchi known as lobar bronchi, and these branch into narrower tertiary bronchi known as segmental bronchi. Further divisions of the segmental bronchi (1 to 6mm in diameter) are known as 4th order, 5th order, and 6th order segmental bronchi, or grouped together as subsegmental bronchi.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of terms are used to {{describe}} seed shapes, {{many of which are}} largely self-explanatory such as Bean-shaped (reniform) – resembling a kidney, with lobed ends {{on either side of the}} <b>hilum,</b> Square or Oblong – angular with all sides more or less equal or longer than wide, Triangular – three sided, broadest below middle, Elliptic or Ovate or Obovate – rounded at both ends, or egg shaped (ovate or obovate, broader at one end), being rounded but either symmetrical about the middle or broader below the middle or broader above the middle.|$|E
25|$|The tip, or papilla, of each pyramid empties urine into a minor calyx; minor calyces empty into major calyces, {{and major}} calyces empty into the renal pelvis. This becomes the ureter. At the <b>hilum,</b> the ureter and renal vein exit the kidney and the renal artery enters. Hilar fat and lymphatic tissue with lymph nodes {{surrounds}} these structures. The hilar fat is contiguous with a fat-filled cavity called the renal sinus. The renal sinus collectively contains the renal pelvis and calyces and separates these structures from the renal medullary tissue.|$|E
25|$|Localization of lesions or {{inflammatory}} {{and infectious}} processes {{can be difficult}} to discern on chest radiograph, but can be inferenced by silhouetting and the <b>hilum</b> overlay sign with adjacent structures. If either hemidiaphragm is blurred, for example, this suggests the lesion to be from the corresponding lower lobe. If the right heart border is blurred, than the pathology is likely in the right middle lobe, though a cavum deformity can also blur the right heard border due to indentation of the adjacent sternum. If the left heart border is blurred, this implies a process at the lingula.|$|E
500|$|Both lungs have {{a central}} {{recession}} called the [...] <b>hilum</b> {{at the root}} of the lung, where the blood vessels and airways pass into the lungs. There are also bronchopulmonary lymph nodes on the <b>hilum.</b>|$|E
500|$|Inocybe cookei {{leaves a}} snuff-brown spore print. The spores {{themselves}} are bean-shaped, measuring from [...] by [...] The {{walls of the}} spores (which are around [...] thick) can be smooth or slightly wrinkled, {{and there is a}} distinct depression just above the <b>hilum</b> (the scar where the spore was once attached to the basidium). The basidia are four-spored, and the thin-walled, gill-edge cheilocystidia are pear-shaped.|$|E
500|$|On {{the same}} surface, {{immediately}} above the <b>hilum,</b> is a well-marked curved groove for [...] the aortic arch, and a groove below {{it for the}} descending aorta. The left subclavian artery, a branch off the aortic arch, sits in a groove from the arch to near {{the apex of the}} lung. A shallower groove in front of the artery and {{near the edge of the}} lung, lodges the left brachiocephalic vein. The esophagus may sit in a wider shallow impression at the base of the lung.|$|E
500|$|The left lung {{is divided}} into two lobes, an upper and a lower, by the oblique fissure, which extends from the costal to the mediastinal surface of the lung both above and below the <b>hilum.</b> The left lung, unlike the right, does not have a middle lobe, though it does have a {{homologous}} feature, a projection of the upper lobe termed the [...] "lingula". [...] Its name means [...] "little tongue". The lingula on the left serves as an anatomic parallel to the right middle lobe, with both areas being predisposed to similar infections and anatomic complications. There are two bronchopulmonary segments of the lingula: superior and inferior.|$|E
500|$|The first written {{reference}} of {{the word}} 'cowpea' appeared in 1798 in the United States. The name was most likely acquired due to their use as a fodder crop for cows. Black-eyed pea, a common name used for the unguiculata cultivar group, describes {{the presence of a}} distinctive black spot at the <b>hilum</b> of the seed. Black-eyed peas were first introduced to the southern states in the United States and some early varieties had peas squashed closely together in their pods, leading to the other common names of southern pea and crowder-pea. Sesquipedalis in Latin means [...] "foot and a half long", and this subspecies which arrived in the United States via Asia is characterised by unusually long pods, leading to the common names of yardlong bean, asparagus bean and Chinese long-bean.|$|E
500|$|Gymnopilus maritimus {{leaves a}} rusty-brown spore print. The basidiospores can measure [...] in length, though the typical range is [...] In width, they {{typically}} measure , {{but they can}} be up to 8μm wide. In shape, they are ellipsoid or sometimes broadly ellipsoid. The top of the spore (the side where it was once attached to the sterigma, the connection between the basidium and the spore) is rounded and blunt. The spores are covered with fairly large warts, measuring from [...] from the main spore in height. There is no germ pore or plage, and there is no clear depression around the <b>hilum</b> (the area where the spore was attached to the sterigma). The spores turn an orange-yellow to orange-brown colour in potassium hydroxide, and turn reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent and in Lugol's iodine, but they are not metachromatic.|$|E
500|$|Chest trauma, a {{major cause}} of {{subcutaneous}} emphysema, can cause air to enter the skin of the chest wall from the neck or lung. When the pleural membranes are punctured, as occurs in penetrating trauma of the chest, air may travel from the lung to the muscles and subcutaneous tissue of the chest wall. [...] When the alveoli of the lung are ruptured, as occurs in pulmonary laceration, air may travel beneath the visceral pleura (the membrane lining the lung), to the <b>hilum</b> of the lung, up to the trachea, to the neck and then to the chest wall. The condition may also occur when a fractured rib punctures a lung; in fact, 27% of patients who have rib fractures also have subcutaneous emphysema. [...] Rib fractures may tear the parietal pleura, the membrane lining the inside of chest wall, allowing air to escape into the subcutaneous tissues.|$|E
500|$|The {{size of the}} {{pneumothorax}} (i.e. {{the volume}} of air in the pleural space) can be determined with a reasonable degree of accuracy by measuring {{the distance between the}} chest wall and the lung. This is relevant to treatment, as smaller pneumothoraces may be managed differently. An air rim of 2cm means that the pneumothorax occupies about 50% of the hemithorax. British professional guidelines have traditionally stated that the measurement should be performed {{at the level of the}} <b>hilum</b> (where blood vessels and airways enter the lung) with 2cm as the cutoff, while American guidelines state that the measurement should be done at the apex (top) of the lung with 3cm differentiating between a [...] "small" [...] and a [...] "large" [...] pneumothorax. The latter method may overestimate the size of a pneumothorax if it is located mainly at the apex, which is a common occurrence. The various methods correlate poorly, but are the best easily available ways of estimating pneumothorax size. CT scanning (see below) can provide a more accurate determination of the size of the pneumothorax, but its routine use in this setting is not recommended.|$|E
2500|$|The hull of {{the mature}} bean is hard, water-resistant, and protects the {{cotyledon}} and hypocotyl (or [...] "germ") from damage. If the seed coat is cracked, the seed will not germinate. The scar, visible on the seed coat, is called the <b>hilum</b> (colors include black, brown, buff, gray and yellow) and {{at one end of}} the <b>hilum</b> is the micropyle, or small opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water for sprouting.|$|E
2500|$|The kidney is a bean-shaped {{structure}} with a [...] and a [...] border. A recessed {{area on the}} concave border is the renal <b>hilum,</b> where the renal artery enters the kidney and the renal vein and ureter leave. The kidney is surrounded by tough fibrous tissue, the renal capsule, which is itself surrounded by perirenal fat, renal fascia, and pararenal fat. The anterior (front) surface of these tissues is the peritoneum, while the posterior (rear) surface is the transversalis fascia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{maturing}} ovule undergoes marked {{changes in}} the integuments, generally a reduction and disorganisation but occasionally a thickening. The seed coat forms from the two integuments or outer layers of cells of the ovule, which derive from tissue from the mother plant, the inner integument forms the tegmen and the outer forms the testa. [...] (The seed coats of some mononocotyledon plants, such as the grasses, are not distinct structures, but are fused with the fruit wall to form a pericarp.) The testae of both monocots and dicots are often marked with patterns and textured markings, or have wings or tufts of hair. When the seed coat forms from only one layer, it is also called the testa, though not all such testae are homologous from one species to the next. The funiculus abscises (detaches at fixed point – abscission zone), the scar forming an oval depression, the <b>hilum.</b> Anatropous ovules have {{a portion of the}} funiculus that is adnate (fused to the seed coat), and which forms a longitudinal ridge, or raphe, just above the <b>hilum.</b> In bitegmic ovules (e.g. Gossypium described here) both inner and outer integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. With continuing maturation the cells enlarge in the outer integument. While the inner epidermis may remain a single layer, it may also divide to produce two to three layers and accumulates starch, and {{is referred to as the}} colourless layer. By contrast the outer epidermis becomes tanniferous. The inner integument may consist of eight to fifteen layers. (Kozlowski 1972) ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{uncomplicated}} silicosis, {{chest x-ray}} will confirm {{the presence of}} small (< 10nbsp&mm) nodules in the lungs, especially in the upper lung zones. [...] Using the ILO classification system, these are of profusion 1/0 or greater and shape/size [...] "p", [...] "q", or [...] "r". Lung zone involvement and profusion increases with disease progression. In advanced cases of silicosis, large opacity (> 1nbsp&cm) occurs from coalescence of small opacities, particularly in the upper lung zones. With retraction of the lung tissue, there is compensatory emphysema. Enlargement of the <b>hilum</b> is common with chronic and accelerated silicosis. In about 5–10% of cases, the nodes will calcify circumferentially, producing so-called [...] "eggshell" [...] calcification. [...] This finding is not pathognomonic (diagnostic) of silicosis. In some cases, the pulmonary nodules may also become calcified.|$|E

50|$|The renal <b>hilum</b> (Latin: <b>hilum</b> renale) or renal pedicle is the <b>hilum</b> of the kidney, that is, its {{recessed}} central fissure {{where its}} vessels, nerves and ureter pass. The medial {{border of the}} kidney is concave {{in the center and}} convex toward either extremity; it is directed forward and a little downward. Its central part presents a deep longitudinal fissure, bounded by prominent overhanging anterior and posterior lips. This fissure is a <b>hilum</b> that transmits the vessels, nerves, and ureter. From anterior to posterior, the renal vein exits, the renal artery enters, and the renal pelvis exits the kidney.|$|E

50|$|The radicle {{emerges from}} a seed through the Radicles in {{seedlings}} are classified into two main types. Those pointing away from the seed coat scar or <b>hilum</b> are classified as antitropous, and those pointing towards the <b>hilum</b> are syntropous.|$|E

5000|$|In botany, a <b>hilum</b> (pronounced [...] ) is a scar or mark {{left on a}} seed coat by {{the former}} {{attachment}} to the ovary wall or to the funiculus (which in turn attaches to the ovary wall). On a bean seed, the <b>hilum</b> is called the [...] "eye".|$|E
50|$|The <b>hilum</b> overlay sign is an imaging {{appearance}} on chest radiographs {{in which the}} outline of the <b>hilum</b> can be seen at the level of a mass or collection in the mid chest.
