40|$|Life {{and health}} {{represent}} {{the most precious}} values of each human being. Unlawful encroachment upon these values, which can occur {{in the health care}} service, is connected with civil liability. Monetary compensation for <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> has been a neglected legal institute for a long time under Czech law. It is divided into two systems now, a protection of personal rights and reimbursement of the damage. This legal area is not easily understandable to legal professionals, let alone to lay men. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the up to date state of assessment of <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> and to evaluate its pros and cons. It deals with the types of infridgement of personal rights which can occur in the health care service, and subsequently, it describes the systems under which the <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> is reimbursed. Concurrently, I focus on the way of determination of the monetary compensation of the <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage,</b> the amount of monetary compensation actually awarded under Czech law and I evaluate adequacy of such compensation.

40|$|The {{valuation}} of casualties saved; Memorandum with the PhD thesis ‘The {{value of a}} statistical life in road safety'. Crashes cause all kinds of social costs, among which <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage.</b> <b>Immaterial</b> <b>damage,</b> also called ‘human losses', {{is defined by the}} loss of quality of life for victims and their next of kin. They are costs in the form of pain, sorrow and a diminished joy of living. It is important for policy and research in support of policy {{to be able to put}} a monetary value on this kind of damage. In this manner the total cost of road crashes can be determined, and cost-benefit analyses of road safety measures can be made. Until recently the Netherlands did not have well-founded values, but Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VU) in cooperation with SWOV, did extensive research into the value of <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> of fatal crashes for car drivers. This report attempts to make the result of this research available for policy makers. It also includes recommendations about which new values for <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> of fatal crashes can be used in policy. The VU research estimated what is known as ‘Value of a Statistical Life' (VOSL). This concept was developed to standardize the {{valuation of}} safety, including the valuation of <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage.</b> This concept is also often used in other fields than road safety. The concept ‘Willingness to Pay', the amount people are willing to pay for a certain reduction of the crash rate, is used to determine the VOSL. This concept originates from welfare economics, and makes it possible to put a price tag on a risk reduction and thus on the saving of ‘statististical' human lives. To make an estimate of the VOSL in the Netherlands, car drivers were directly or indirectly asked in a questionnaire what they are willing to pay for safety measures. They were asked to weigh safety, travelling time, and money. First they were given a choice between two toll roads which differed in price, safety, and travelling time. This question resulted in a VOSL of 2. 2 million euro with a confidence interval of 1. 9 to 2. 5 million euro. Next, drivers were also asked to choose between three different types of one car, which only differed in price and safety. They were also asked for the maximum amount which they would be prepared to pay for one of the types. This question resulted in a higher VOSL of 5 million euro. The research indicates that the VOSL depends, amongst others, on the road safety measure (for instance its public or private nature) and the target group of the measure (car drivers, cyclists, pedestrians, etc.). However, it is undesirable, but also unfeasible to use a different VOSL in each case. SWOV recommends using the lowest of the two values found, a VOSL of 2. 2 ± 0. 3 million euro (price level 2001), as a standard in cost-benefit analyses and in research into the costs of road crashes. Beside the ‘human losses' (<b>immaterial</b> <b>damage)</b> of a traffic fatality, this amount also comprises a material component: the value of the loss of consumption in the lost years of life. If the VOSL is corrected for this loss of consumption, the result is a value of 1. 8 ± 0. 3 million euro for the ‘human losses' of a traffic fatality. If required, a second, larger margin can be used for the VOSL: 1. 6 to 3. 0 million euro (price level 2001). These values are based on some international studies which, amongst others, also determine a VOSL for the Netherlands. The amount of 1. 6 million euro is used in a European recommendation for the use of the VOSL in policy, which uses a conservative approach. The amount of 3. 0 million euro is a scientifically sound upper margin. The VOSL depends on several circumstances which can change in the course of time, like socio-economic features and preferences of the population. That's why the recommendation is to update the VOSL periodically, for instance once every five years, as is also done for the valuation of travelling time. The VU research has only determined the VOSL of traffic fatalities. Due to the much higher number of hospital injuries, <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> of non-fatal injuries also is a substantial part of the cost of road crashes. However, a thorough basis for the valuation of 'human losses' for injuries is as yet not available in the Netherlands. That is why research into the 'human losses' for injuries in the Netherlands is also recommended...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to simulate household choice behavior under varying climate change scenarios using choice experiments. Economic welfare measures are derived for society’s willingness to pay (WTP) to reduce climate change induced flood risks through private insurance and willingness to accept compensation (WTAC) for controlled flooding under varying future risk exposure levels. Material flood damage and loss of life are covered in the insurance policy experiment, while the WTAC experiment also captures the economic value of <b>immaterial</b> flood <b>damage</b> such as feelings of discomfort, fear and social disruption. The results show that WTP and WTAC are substantial, suggesting a more prominent role of external social damage costs in cost-benefit analysis of climate change and flood mitigation policies...|$|R
40|$|On 1 January 2014 the new Civil Code, {{the most}} {{important}} piece of legislation, has come into effect. It {{is a part of}} large recodification of the Czech civil law. This thesis, "The impact of the new Civil Code on liability insurance", points out the most significant changes and the implications which effects, among others, the insurance sector. The first part of the thesis addresses mostly the theoretical concept of liability, the elemental preconditions of liability and methods of compensation for material and <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage,</b> including comparison of claim rights under former legal norm and the current legal norm. It also mentions the ambiguity in law in case of compensation for work-related injuries and occupational diseases.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{describe}} Czech approach towards pecuniary compensation in connection with <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> arising from providing medical care. Protection of patient's personality rights and eventually that of his relatives is stressed out. Over the last few decades, the issue of compensation for immaterial harm has become more significant, whereas {{the same could be}} said about the role of patient in the system of providing medical care. Regarding the fact that there is currently a period of recodification of Czech private law, it is opportunity to have hindsight of where theory, respectively judicial practice, has reached regarding <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> compensations.

This thesis describes the basic principles and trends in the vast areas of this institute, points out differences in the amount of awarded compensation and refers to the relevant case law. Of course, the basic point of view on this issue is a comparison of the "new" and "old" Civil Code. My intention is to describe the new Civil Code focusing on differences from the old one.

40|$|This paper enriches {{existing}} valuation {{literature in}} a number of ways by presenting context-specific estimates of <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage.</b> First, it offers an estimation of value of statistical life (VOSL) in the context of a natural hazard (flooding). Next, as one of the contributions, alongside with less biased estimate of VOSL (euro 6. 8 mln) it also provides estimates of the value of statistical injury (VOSI, euro 92, 000), and of the value of statistical evacuation (VOSE, euro 2, 400). Our estimated indicators are plausible and stay robust throughout various estimations. For flood protection policy in the Netherlands, a higher value of VOSL forthcoming from this research would imply 'underprotection' under current conditions. Another important finding concerns the composition of the total value of immaterial damages, where value of fatalities or value of evacuation may dominate depending on the prevailing floor risk circumstances. This implies that, first, VOSL is not an adequate proxy for immaterial damages since it understates prospective benefits of designated protective measures. Second, spatially differentiated composition of immaterial damages should be explicitly considered to guide policy decisions...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concentrated}} on the liability for damages caused by unlawful inactivity of the public administrative authority in the administrative process.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to describe}} and analyse individual stages of a civil process {{for the protection of}} personal integrity. The civil process is a unique stream, within which there is a protection of personal rights offered to individuals. <b>Immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> caused by unauthorized interference in such important personal right such as rights of personal integrity without doubt are, is often correctly replaced only by the judicial decision. For this reason, it requires knowledge of both the substantive civil law, which underlines the protection of the rights of personal integrity, as well as civil procedure law, in which the substantive law is being implemented. The content of this dissertation is the analysis of the various parts of the judicial process from filing an action for protection of personal integrity to the court's decision, enforcement and execution in matters of protection of personal integrity. The dissertation illustrates the complex picture into the issues of civil proceedings in the matters of protection of personal integrity and quotes directly from court decisions in each of the stages of the proceedings. Given the general arrangements for the protection of personal integrity the report of judgment and decisions {{is one of the main}} sources of knowledge during the civil [...] ...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{problems}} addressed by the EU Directive on Package Travel (1990) is that of travellers who find themselves stranded in their holiday destination when their tour operator suddenly goes bankrupt. The recent insolvency of Austrian and German tour operators illustrates the relevance of this question. This paper argues that travellers should be protected against the risk of insolvency of tour operators. The paper sets out the reasons for this, the various ways of insolvency protection, and {{the implementation of the}} Package Travel Directive. It then sets out what is secured by the guarantee, the obligations of the organizer and retailer, the cross-border implications, the possibility to choose freely the means of security, guarantee funds, insurance and social security, bonds and guarantees, trusts, and EC implications. It is argued that Member States should provide a higher standard of protection than the minimum standard of the Directive. A traveller should be entitled to compensation not only for <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> but also for pure economic loss, such as the higher costs of an equivalent trip. The paper also argues that refund of prepayments should not be limited to the period before the trip has started. The traveller should also be reimbursed for extra costs incurred if he decides to stay at his destination. Finally, a traveller should be entitled {{to take care of his}} own repatriation, should he wish to do so. The paper finally argues that Member States should be held liable for late implementation of the Directive...|$|E
40|$|In 1995, SWOV {{calculated}} {{road safety}} costs for 1997 (See ITRD 882425). Since then, new {{data from the}} Transport Research Centre (AVV) of the Ministry of Transport have become available. Furthermore, new methods for calculating costs have been developed. As {{a result of all}} this, this report has updated and supplemented the data for 1997. In addition, a number of the 1993 figures have been recalculated using new methods. The total material and immaterial road safety costs for 1993 and 1997 are presented. This study also contains the costs per individual victim and accident. To do this, the actual numbers of victims and accidents were used (not those numbers registered by the police). Using these costs per victim and/or accident, it is possible to carry out a cost-benefit analysis. The benefits of measures should then be expressed in terms of the actual numbers of victims and/or accidents prevented by them. The study also takes into account the so-called 1 -million-Euro-test proposed by the European Commission (EC). According to this rough rule-of-thumb, every measure that costs less than 1 million Euro's (2. 2 million guilders) per prevented road death, is considered to be economically justified. The measure should, therefore, be introduced. This sum of money also takes the other damage (those injured and material damage) into account. The Dutch equivalent of the 1 -million-Euro-test used the 1997 data, and it resulted in 9 million guilders per prevented road death. If the tailback costs and <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> are also included - the EC has not taken these into account - it results in 14 million guilders. A number of possible explanations are given for the difference between the European and the Dutch sums...|$|E
40|$|Disasters cause {{tremendous}} {{material and}} <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> {{to people and}} their habitat. During the first days after the disaster the victims have to be provided with food, shelter, security, health care and registration. For sheltering, depending on the local circumstances, tents are often used {{for a short period}} of time but often we often see them used for a longer time. However tents are not always the best solution. Although industries have developed new materials and building systems, not all of them are suitable to provide for an appropriate response as desirabIe for application in shelters. In order to improve this situation, various aspects were presented and discussed during an International Symposium held at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in November 2007 under the auspices of Red Cross organizations, universities, NGO's and private companies. As a result the TU/e has embarked on a research project on various approaches for sheltering in close cooperation with the Netherlands Red Cross. 1. Development of a collective center. The center has been worked out in detail and a test model of 3 bays will be erected shortly. 2. Development of card board housing i. s. o. tents. After detailed studies of other shelters and the material of cardboard, a model of a cardboard housing was produced. The model has undergone physical tests, which has led to changes in the concept. 3. Development of a steel frame transitional shelter. The frame has to be optimized in the light of the varying weather conditions. A full scale model of the frame is built and needs optimization from the point of view of providing solutions in state of guidelines. 4. Development of a manual for the design of shelters. Apart from carrying out model tests, a full scale test in a local situation will ultimately prove the validity of the developed concepts. These tests are under development...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} annuity, as a periodical obligation, {{which can}} emanate either from a contract, {{as in the}} case of maintainance or life annuity contract, or from tort. In the latter case, it has the function to provide compensation for future loss, but not in a single payment, which is regularly the consequence of liability for torts. The justification for such successive means of compensation is that by certain types of torts, such {{as in the case}} of disability or decreased ability to work, damage does not appear in one given moment, but accrues periodically, as successive future loss. An employee, for example, suffering personal injury, may become disabled to work or their ability to work may decrease, thereby they may earn less than previously. Damage in this case accrues each month in the amount of the difference between the wages earned before and after the injury. The author differentiates between successive annuity, as a rule, and cumulative annuity (lump sump), as an exception, justified by special considerations on the side of the injured, such as the need to bear the costs of professional retraining, for example. Regarding the determination of the amount of monthly annuity, the subject of analysis was the method of actuarial calculation, which takes into account both present damage and future loss. Due to the hypothetical nature of some elements of such determination, the law allows a subsequent revision of judgment on the amount of annuity, which has become conclusive, if the circumstances concerning the injured person's ability to work has changed substantially in the meantime. For instance, due to the subsequent deterioration of injured person's ability to work, they may earn less or may not earn at all. Such subsequent revision of the judgment does not break through the rules on legal finality of judgments, since the effect of legal finality does not comprise new circumstances of the case. The author supports the standpoint that annuity is an adequate form of compensation for disability or decreased ability to work, since in such case the future loss accrues successively, in monthly differences of wages before and after the injury. Contrarily, by the overall decrease of viability, causing mental suffering due to impossibility of accomplishing former capabilities (such as the sense of sight, disability of movement), annuity is not a proper form of compensation, since <b>immaterial</b> <b>damage</b> does not emerge periodically, but in a single moment and lasts uninterruptedly...|$|E
