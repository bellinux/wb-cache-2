5|$|For decades Haitians {{have been}} {{crossing}} the Haitian-Dominican border for various reasons, including voluntary and involuntary migration, long- and short-term {{residence in the}} Dominican Republic, legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>entry,</b> smuggling, and human trafficking. Haitians move across the Haitian-Dominican border in search of opportunities and they are highly vulnerable to exploitation. In fact, the Dominican Republic {{has one of the}} worst records of human rights abuses, including human trafficking, against migrant workers in all of the Caribbean. Haitians in the Dominican Republic are widely disparaged as a migrant minority because of the countries' proximity. During the dictatorial reign of Jean-Claude Duvalier in the 1970s and 80s, he sold Haitians at bulk rates to work on sugar plantations in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with <b>illegal</b> <b>entry</b> and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that the militants had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E

5000|$|El Paso Sector Chief Patrol Agent Silvestre Reyes {{started a}} program called [...] "Operation Hold the Line". In this program, Border Patrol agents would no longer react to <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> {{resulting}} in apprehensions, but would instead be forward deployed to the border, immediately detecting any attempted entries or deterring crossing at a more remote location. The idea {{was that it would}} be easier to capture illegal entrants in the wide open deserts than through the urban alleyways. Chief Reyes deployed his agents along the Rio Grande, within eyesight of other agents. The program significantly reduced <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> in the urban part of El Paso, however, the operation merely shifted the <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> to other areas.|$|R

50|$|There are an {{estimated}} half a million <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> into the United States each year. Border Patrol activity is concentrated around border cities such as San Diego and El Paso which have extensive border fencing. This means that the flow of illegal aliens is diverted into rural mountainous and desert areas, leading to several hundred migrant deaths along the Mexico-U.S. border of those attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico illegally and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|The United States {{border is}} a barely {{discernible}} line in uninhabited deserts, canyons, or mountains. The Border Patrol utilizes {{a variety of}} equipment and methods, such as electronic sensors placed at strategic locations along the border, to detect people or vehicles entering the country illegally. Video monitors and night vision scopes are also used to detect <b>illegal</b> <b>entries.</b> Agents patrol the border in vehicles, boats, aircraft, and afoot. In some areas, the Border Patrol employs horses, all-terrain motorcycles, bicycles, and snowmobiles. Air surveillance capabilities are provided by unmanned aerial vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Border Patrol {{agents were}} meant to carry PDAs with GPS capabilities, to allow the command center to track the {{location}} of agents interdicting <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> and watch the encounter in real time on the common operating picture. Additionally, the PDAs {{were supposed to have}} advanced finger print identification technology, to allow Border Patrol agents to identify an individual at the interdiction site immediately and the ability to view and control tower cameras from their PDA. In addition, Border Patrol agents will be given laptops in the patrol car that will provide them the information necessary to effectively and safely approach a given threat.|$|R

40|$|Increasing Passenger flow at Border Crossing Points is an {{important}} issue at today’s border crossing points (BCPs) of land, sea and airport. Group Access Control and utilizing biometrics information will help increase passenger throughput and reduce human error in handling passengers erroneously. Using multi modal information for (biometric) group id can provide more robust handling of passengers. On the other hand, connecting various BCPs will help solve some problems related to <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> from non-Schengen to Schengen space, laws and health.

40|$|International migration, {{with its}} complex web of economic, social, demographic, and {{political}} consequences, is {{a theme that}} dominates national and international interests. This thesis explores a connection between illegal African immigration to Spain and a recent phenomenon of Senegalese immigration to Argentina through an examination of historical trajectories of immigration, legal and <b>illegal</b> <b>entries,</b> and migration legislation. In particular the {{focus will be on}} the role of Spanish national migration law and border control as a deterrent against illegal African immigration and a resultant wave of Senegalese immigrants representing a new phenomenon of ecologically pushed migration from Sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R
50|$|An {{increase}} of Islamophobia in Russia follows the growing {{influence of the}} strongly conservative sect of Wahhabism, according to Nikolai Sintsov of the National Anti-Terrorist Committee.Various translations of the Qur'an have been banned by the Russian government for promoting extremism and Muslim supremacy. Anti-Muslim rhetoric {{is on the rise}} in Georgia. In Greece, Islamophobia accompanies anti-immigrant sentiment, as immigrants are now 15% of the country's population and 90% of the EU's <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> are through Greece. In France Islamophobia is tied, in part, to the nation's long-standing tradition of secularism. In Burma the 969 Movement has been accused of events such as the 2012 Rakhine State riots.|$|R

50|$|After the September 11 {{attacks of}} 2001, the Department of Homeland Security created two {{immigration}} enforcement agencies {{out of the}} defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service: U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). ICE was tasked with investigations, detention and removal of illegal aliens, and interior enforcement. CBP was tasked with inspections at U.S. ports of entry and with preventing <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> between the port of entry, transportation check, and entries on U.S. coastal borders. DHS management decided to align the Border Patrol with CBP. CBP's Office of Field Operations is solely responsible for the nation's ports of entry, while Border Patrol maintains jurisdiction over all locations between ports of entry, giving Border Patrol agents federal arrest authority nationwide.|$|R

5000|$|San Diego Sector tried Silvestre Reyes' {{approach}} of forward deploying agents to deter <b>illegal</b> <b>entries</b> into the country. Congress authorized {{the hiring of}} thousands of new agents, and many were sent to San Diego Sector. In addition, Congressman Duncan Hunter became a major proponent of border fencing; surplus military landing mats were obtained to use as an initial border fence. [...] Stadium lighting, ground sensors and infra-red cameras were also placed in the area. Eventually the primitive landing mat fence was replaced with a modern triple fence line that begins over one hundred yards into the Pacific Ocean at Imperial Beach, CA and ends more than 13 miles (19 km) inland on Otay Mesa where the mountains begin. Apprehensions decreased dramatically in that area as the illegal entrant alien traffic was pushed further east into the mountains and desert in eastern San Diego County and beyond.|$|R
