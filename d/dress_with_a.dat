5|$|Another {{work from}} this time is The Green Feather, which Knight painted, and {{reworked}} due {{to a change in}} the weather, outdoors in a single day and shows the model Dolly Snell in an emerald evening <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hat and a large feather. Knight sent the painting to an international exhibition held at the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh and it was purchased by the National Gallery of Canada for £400. Knight started the vast painting Lamorna Birch and his Daughters in 1913, painting in a wood in the Lamorna Valley but then kept the painting unfinished in her studio until finally completing it in 1934, the same year Birch was elected a full member of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|Gaga did not preview {{the costumes}} {{for the tour}} until the opening night. There were seven outfits created for the show, all {{throughout}} the different segments. The first was a bejeweled leotard which had the Jeff Koons blue gazing ball attached in the middle; the ball was previously used in the album cover art for Artpop. Gaga accessorized the <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of feathered wings while wearing a blond bob wig reminiscent of her looks from The Fame era. A rave inspired outfit was worn for the last segment and consisted of colorful dreadlocks and legwarmers made of fur. She added a shirt consisting of straps and plastic sleeves with it. One of the complex outfits was made of latex and consisted of a polka dotted leotard {{and a number of}} tentacles attached to the dress as well as a headpiece with two tentacles from it.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a dark shadow on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E

5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping tears from her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
5|$|The {{engagement}} {{was declared}} on 5 December 1865, {{and despite the}} Prince of Wales's initial refusal to attend, Princess Alice intervened, and the wedding was a happy occasion. The Queen allowed the ceremony to take place at Windsor Castle, albeit in the Private Chapel rather than the grander St George's Chapel on 5 July 1866. The Queen relieved her black mourning <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> white mourning cap which draped over her back. The main participants filed into the chapel {{to the sound of}} Beethoven's , creating a spectacle only marred by the sudden disappearance of Prince George, the Duke of Cambridge, who had a sudden gout attack. Christian filed into the chapel with his two supporters, Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar and Prince Frederic of Schleswig-Holstein, and Helena was given away by her mother, who escorted her up the aisle with the Prince of Wales and eight bridesmaids. Christian looked older than he was, and one guest commented that Helena looked as if she was marrying an aged uncle. Indeed, when he was first summoned to Britain, he assumed that the widowed Queen was inspecting him as a new husband for herself rather than as a candidate for one of her daughters. The couple spent the first night of their married life at Osborne House, before honeymooning in Paris, Interlaken and Genoa.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then the waiter (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> thin belt around the waist.|$|E

A group of eyes <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> petroleum jelly mesh, gauze pad, and cartella shield were compared <b>with</b> <b>a</b> group <b>dressed</b> only <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cartella shield. Study of the eyes and lids before and after operation, including the taking of lid margin and fornix swabs for culture, suggested {{that there was no}} significant difference in the bacterial presence between the two groups. The eyes <b>dressed</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cartella shield alone appeared less prone to discharge. The relative merits of different types of dressing are discussed...|$|R
25|$|At 5:15 am on October 21, 1938, Hale {{threw herself}} out of the window of her apartment. She was found still wearing her {{favorite}} Madame X femme-fatale black velvet <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> corsage of small yellow roses, given to her by Noguchi.|$|E

25|$|In both cases, the effigies wore real clothing, {{similar to}} that which is {{typically}} used in marriage ceremonies. This includes a pair of trousers, a white skirt, a red <b>dress,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> lace outer dress.> Additionally, they were adorned with jewelry; though similar in fashion {{to that of a}} typical bride's, it was not made of real gold. If a living groom is marrying a ghost bride, he will wear black gloves instead of the typical white.|$|E

A week later, Erin Lavery is found dead on the roof of the Fusion building with a white ribbon and gardenias attached to her hands. It is then decided by Derek Frye that there is a serial killer on the loose.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} their clothing, angels, {{especially}} the Archangel Michael, were depicted as military-style agents of God and came to be shown wearing Late Antique military uniform. This uniform could be the normal military <b>dress,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tunic to about the knees, an armour breastplate and pteruges, but was often the specific dress of the bodyguard of the Byzantine Emperor, with a long tunic and the loros, the long gold and jewelled pallium restricted to the Imperial family and their closest guards.|$|E
25|$|Many Japanese {{media reports}} on the film also {{mentioned}} Jiang's past visits to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine, where spirits of Japanese soldiers, including some convicted of war crimes, are housed. The news sparked {{a new round of}} debate in China, where criticism of famous actress Zhao Wei for appearing on the cover of Bazaar in a <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Japanese military flag design had newly subsided. Jiang responded that he visited the shrine several times to collect resources for Devils on the Doorstep.|$|E

25|$|Biba's {{early years}} were rather humble, {{with many of}} the outfits being cheap and {{available}} to the public by mail order. Biba’s postal boutique had its first significant success in May 1964 when it offered a pink gingham <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hole cut {{out of the back of}} the neck with a matching triangular kerchief to readers of the Daily Mirror. The dress had celebrity appeal, as a similar dress had been worn by Brigitte Bardot. By the morning after the dress was advertised in the Daily Mirror, over 4,000 orders had been received. Ultimately, some 17,000 outfits were sold.|$|E
25|$|The 1937 Lobster Dress was {{a simple}} white silk evening <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crimson {{waistband}} featuring a large lobster painted (by Dalí) onto the skirt. From 1934, Dalí had started incorporating lobsters into his work, including New York Dream-Man Finds Lobster in Place of Phone shown in the magazine American Weekly in 1935, and the mixed-media Lobster Telephone (1936). His design for Schiaparelli was interpreted into a fabric print by the leading silk designer Sache. It was famously worn by Wallis Simpson {{in a series of}} photographs by Cecil Beaton taken at the Château de Candé shortly before her marriage to Edward VIII.|$|E
25|$|The {{designs for}} all three dresses were {{entrusted}} by Siti to the duo. For the first dress, they used a red net cloth that comes with motifs sewn into it. For the second dress, inspired {{from the first time}} Siti worked with them, they used red lace and net to make the dress. For the final dress, which was a striped sequin gold <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> red base and side panels, they used fabrics that are full of sequins to make it. Few adjustments were done to the designs after they saw her during the full rehearsals of the concert, including changing the colours of her tudungs. All three dresses were made from imported fabrics and materials. It took them three weeks to finish designing and creating all the dresses.|$|E

25|$|The {{subjects}} of later paintings impersonating Circe {{have a history}} of sexual experience behind them, starting with “Mary Spencer in the character of Circe” by William Caddick, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1780. The subject here was the mistress of the painter George Stubbs. A portrait of “Mrs Nesbitt as Circe” by Joshua Reynolds followed in 1781. Though this lady’s past was ambiguous, she had connections with those in power and was used by the Government as a secret agent. In the painting she is seated sideways, wearing a white, loose-fitting <b>dress,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wand in her right hand and a gilded goblet near her left. A monkey is crouching above her in the branches of a tree and a panther fraternizes with the kitten on her knee. While the painting undoubtedly alludes to her reputation, it also places itself within the tradition of dressing up in character.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed {{breasts were}} common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and {{emulated}} by all classes. Anne of Brittany {{has also been}} painted wearing a <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even Queen Mary II and Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I of England, were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect Inigo Jones designed a masque costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts. During the fashions of the period 1795–1820, many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. Anne of Austria was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight bodice and corsets that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the areola and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.|$|E
500|$|Designed by Donatella Versace, it {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "jungle green", [...] "sea green" [...] or [...] "tropical" [...] green, a green dress with touches of blue to give an exotic appearance. It is a see-through silk chiffon <b>dress</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tropical leaf and bamboo pattern, with a citrine-studded crotch. The dress [...] "had a low-cut neck that extended several inches below her navel, where it was loosely fastened with a sparkly brooch and then opened out again," [...] exposing her midriff and then cut along the front of the legs like a bath robe. The dress then drooped behind her on the floor, open at the back.|$|E
