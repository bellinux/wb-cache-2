2500|$|This engine has {{electronic}} hydraulic activation {{in order}} to increase flexibility with regard to fuel injection and exhaust valve activation. These two factors are adjusted {{in order to}} match operating conditions that a ship may be under. This electronic control of the start to finish of the combustion process is known as the Engine Control System. [...] Fuel injection controls the speed in which the engine will be operating at, while the exhaust valves control the exit of combustion gases from the cylinder. The actuators for fuel injection and the exhaust valves are electronically controlled by the Engine Control System. For fuel injection, a plunger powered by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>piston</b> is started with oil pressure. Oil pressure is regulated by a valve that is electronically controlled through the Engine Control System. Exhaust valves are opened by a two-stage exhaust valve actuator which is activated by oil delivered from an electronically controlled valve. By controlling these valves electronically, the combustion process is fully controlled by the Engine Control System.|$|E

50|$|Riders then {{continue}} {{on through the}} tunnels, passing a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>piston</b> {{in a pool of}} water and human bones. The piston suddenly discharges a blast of air from beneath the water, creating a loud noise and splash designed to startle the exiting riders. A staircase is then ascended, another tunnel passed during which sound effects of dinosaur roars and groans play and the surface is reached.|$|E
50|$|Swing gates can use {{three types}} of operators. A swing arm operator, which is a box, that sits {{off to the side}} and has an arm {{extending}} to the gate. A ram arm is located on the gate and post and uses either a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>piston</b> or a jackscrew-operated piston. Underground operators are located by the hinge and operate the gate via a link arm.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{is notable}} {{for having a}} moving seat, also used in Sega's {{previous}} 1991 light gun shooter Rail Chase. The seat is powered by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pistons</b> to move the seat according to action on the screen.

50|$|Most of {{the water}} diverters are natural {{boulders}} cemented in place, {{but there is some}} use of moveable plastic bollards attached to the bottom. There are five barn door diverters hinged to the channel sides and positioned by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pistons,</b> two above the M-Wave on the long channel, and three in the slalom competition channel. The M-Wave is designed to replicate the famous M-Wave in an irrigation channel near Montrose, Colorado.|$|R
50|$|There are two {{specialized}} {{types of}} hydraulic intensifier used for water jet cutting. The {{first and most}} common is the inline hydraulic intensifier. Oscillating <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pistons</b> are used to compress water to the required pressure levels. The water jet system's cutting head restricts the water flow to generate pressure and direct it onto the workpiece. A holding tank, called a hydraulic accumulator, is used to reduce pressure vibrations at the output end.|$|R
50|$|The vang {{typically}} {{runs from}} the base of the mast to a point about a third of the way out the boom. Due to the great force necessary to change the height of the boom while a boat is under sail, a line-based boom vang usually includes some sort of a pulley system. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>piston</b> vangs are used on larger sailboats and controlled by manual or electric hydraulic pumps.|$|E
50|$|The engine {{combines}} an Astazou-derived {{centrifugal compressor}} {{with up to}} three axial compressor stages (depending on the version of the engine), driven by a common driveshaft. The fan section is composed of a unique variable pitch fan and fixed stator blades mounted {{at the front of}} the engine. Blade pitch is varied by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>piston</b> mounted in the fan hub, while the fan itself is powered via a reduction gear from the main driveshaft.|$|E
5000|$|One major {{technological}} advance was the extended {{use of the}} holes after drilling. Geophysical and geochemical measurements were made during and after drilling, and occasionally long-term seismic monitoring devices were installed in the holes. This extended understanding of the dynamic processes involved in plate tectonics. Another {{technological advance}} involved {{the introduction of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>piston</b> corer (HPC) in 1979, which permitted the recovery of virtually undisturbed cores of sediment.This greatly enhanced the ability of scientists to study ancient ocean environments.|$|E
5000|$|The 1995 bicycle {{bridge is}} linked to the 1953 road bridge so that when the road bridge opens, the bicycle bridge also opens; however, the bicycle bridge can be {{operated}} manually to open independently of the road bridge. The bicycle bridge is operated using two <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pistons</b> and two [...] motors; the other drawbridges linking Alameda to the mainland operate using gearboxes and gears. It is the only pedestrian bascule bridge in the United States.|$|R
50|$|At low speeds, The T-lever's wing section floats freely, {{enabling}} the low-lift cams {{to operate the}} valves. The intake rocker arms contain internal pistons, which are retained by springs in a lowered position while the engine speed is below the MIVEC switchover point, to avoid contacting the high-lift T-shaped levers. At high speeds, hydraulic pressure elevates the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pistons,</b> causing the T-lever to push against the rocker arm, which in turn makes the high-lift cam operate the valves.|$|R
