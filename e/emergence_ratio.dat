500|$|All {{sea turtles}} have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at {{intervals}} of 12–17 days during the nesting season, {{on or near}} the beach where they hatched. They exit the water, climb the beach, and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited. [...] The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea. This process takes one to two hours, and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes, preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest. The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, <b>emergence</b> <b>ratio,</b> and vulnerability to nest predators. Loggerheads have an average clutch size of 112.4 eggs.|$|E
40|$|Bolting and scaly leaf {{emergence}} of Easter lily bulblets were investigated in the scaling fields for commercial bulb production. Leaf <b>emergence</b> <b>ratio</b> and bolting one were presented as {{the ratio of}} scale bulblets with leaves to the whole ones belonging to the investigated plot and as the ratio of bolted bulblets to scale bulblets provided with leaves, respectively. Findings are as follows; 1) Bolitng ratio was over 80 % with most of plots. 2) There could not be observed any differences at all among cultivars, scaling localities, dates of scaling as well as among kinds of soil texture. 3) In a few plots there was a tendency that a low leaf <b>emergence</b> <b>ratio</b> accompanied a low bolting ratio, and in other plots, the higher one the higher bolting ratio. 4) Scaly leaves appeared quite abundantly in cases where scales or bulblets had been half and/or fully exposed to the air in nursery beds. From these facts it is duly suggested that the scaly leaf emergence will occur comparatively earlier than the bolting, and also that the darkness can promote the bolting, and the light will, in turn, hasten the scaly leaf emergence. りん片繁殖によるテッポウユリの球根生産を目的とした圃場を対象とし,仔球の抽台およびりん片葉発生の実態を調査し,これらの発生と外的条件との関係を調べた. ほとんどの圃場で 80 %以上の抽台率がみられ,品種,調査地,植付け期,土性による差異は認められなかつた. 出葉率の低い区では抽台率が低く,出葉率の高い区では逆にそれが高くなる傾向がみられた. また,りん片葉の発生は仔球や母りん片が地表に露出している場合に多い傾向が認められた. これらの事実から,りん片葉の発生は相対的に抽台より早くおこること,母りん片を浅植えして地表に露出させることによつて,りん片葉の発生が促進され,またりん片葉の割合も多くなるのに対し,深植えすることによつて抽台が期待されることが明らかである...|$|E

Deep {{understanding of the relationship}} between tillering dynamics and yield formation in a particular agrosystem is crucial to boost rice productivity. Research on rice tillering is mainly focused on tropical agrosystems whereas less is done in the Mediterranean, with direct water-seeding and Japonica cultivars. This study aims at characterizing tillering dynamics and identifying the main explanatory tillering traits of yield in a Mediterranean rice agrosystem, Ebro Delta (Northern Spain). A temperate Japonica cultivar grown in Spain, Gleva, was utilized. Plants and tillers were tagged to assess <b>emergence</b> and fertility <b>ratios</b> and grain yield; while changes in tillering number over time, yield and yield components for unit area were measured. Plant and tillering dynamics in the Ebro Delta rice fields can be accurately predicted through equations herein provided, which are based either on thermal time or leaf development. Plants grown under regional standard agricultural practices produced up to eight primary tillers of which two or three become productive. Maximum tiller number was the main explanatory variable of yield while high-yielding tillers within a plant are located on nodes with the highest <b>emergence</b> <b>ratios</b> and, after the main stem, they are the major contributors to yield. The decisive role of tiller development on yield along with the predictability of tiller dynamics raises options to optimize grain yield through tillering modulation. In this sense, results from this study suggests the promotion of early tillering followed by inhibition of late tillering as a strategy of tillering regulation...|$|R

However, {{little research has been}} conducted regarding their surface function in redistributing organic carbon and nutrient fluxes to soils nearby. Water that fell on and ran off 10 individual rock outcrops was collected in three 100 × 100 m plots within a rock desertification ecosystem, an anthropogenic forest ecosystem, and a secondary forest ecosystem between June 2013 and June 2014 in Shilin, SW China. The concentrations of total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) in the water samples were determined during three seasons, and the total amounts received by and flowing out from the outcrops were calculated. In all three ecosystems, TOC and N, P, and K were found throughout the year in both the water received by and delivered to nearby soil patches. Their concentrations and amounts were generally greater in forested ecosystems than in the rock desertification ecosystem. When rock outcrops constituted a high percentage (≥ 30 %) of the ground surface, the annual export of rock outcrop runoff contributed a large amount of organic carbon and N, P, and K nutrients to soil patches nearby by comparison to the amount soil patches received via atmospheric deposition. These contributions may increase the spatial heterogeneity of soil fertility within patches, as rock outcrops of different sizes, morphologies, and <b>emergence</b> <b>ratios</b> may surround each soil patch...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 1. When host quality varies, optimal {{foraging}} theory {{assumes that}} parasitic wasps select hosts {{in a manner}} that increases their individual ®tness. In koinobiont parasitoids, where the hosts continue developing for {{a certain period of time}} after parasitisation, host selection may not re¯ect current host quality but may be based on an assessment of future growth rates and resources available for the developing larvae. 2. When presented with hosts of uniform quality, the koinobiont parasitoid Leptomastix dactylopii exhibits a characteristic host-selection behaviour: some hosts are accepted for oviposition on ®rst encounter, while others are rejected several times before an egg is laid in them, a behaviour that is commonly associated with a changing host acceptance threshold during the course of a foraging bout. 3. The ®tness of the offspring that emerged from hosts accepted immediately upon encounter was compared with the ®tness of offspring emerged from hosts rejected several times before being accepted for oviposition. 4. The pattern of host acceptance and rejection was not related to any of the measured ®tness parameters of the offspring emerging from these hosts (development time, size at <b>emergence,</b> sex <b>ratio</b> at <b>emergence,</b> and female offspring egg load). 5. While complex post facto adaptive explanations can be devised to explain the nature of such a time and energy consuming host selection process, it is suggested that physiological constraints on egg production or oviposition may provide an alternative, purely mechanistic, explanation for the results obtained.

Periodical release of non-viable cold-stored eggs of Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae) {{has been found to}} enhance parasitism of this pest in soybean fields. To find the optimum environmental conditions for cold storage of these host eggs, we evaluated nine different combinations of temperature (2, 6, and 10 °C) and relative humidity (high 90 – 95 %, medium 70 – 75 %, and low 30 – 35 %). After 30 d of cold-storage, eggs were weighed and held at 26. 6 °C and 75 % relative humidity for 8 d before testing. To test the eggs’ suitability as hosts following cold storage, females of Ooencyrtus nezarae Ishii (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae) were released individually onto batches of eggs, and parasitization rates and the development, <b>emergence,</b> sex <b>ratio,</b> adult longevity, and size of parasitoid progeny were examined. Eggs stored at high relative humidity showed less weight loss than those stored at low relative humidity. The number of eggs parasitized was highest (5. 9 / 15) on eggs stored at 6 °C and high relative humidity. Developmental times and adult emergence were optimal on host eggs stored at 2 °C and high relative humidity. A significantly lower proportion of eggs produced male parasitoids when eggs were stored at 2 or 6 °C. Adult longevity was not affected by egg storage conditions, but adult size of progeny decreased in eggs stored at 10 °C.

The population was protandrous and the sex ratio was balanced in three of the four observation years. The date of first emergence varied even though the sum of temperatures before emergence was similar across years. Adults of both sexes fed on the pollen of Lysimachia punctata host plants. Females additionally visited flowers to collect oil for the nest-cell lining, as well as oil and pollen for larval provisions. Duration of collecting trips, flower visits, and nest stays were influenced by the reward collected. Bees required 12 collecting trips and 460 visitations to flowers to complete a single cell. Therefore, to sustain a viable population of 50 - 500 individuals, 20, 000 - 200, 000 flowers are required. Our study shows that observations in a closed system can provide new insights into the bionomics of bees...|$|R
40|$|Aims. We {{study the}} {{visibility}} of sunspots and its influence on observed values of sunspot region parameters. Methods. We use Virtual Observatory tools provided by AstroGrid to analyse a sample of 6862 sunspot regions. By studying the distributions of locations where sunspots were first and last observed on the solar disk, we derive the visibility function of sunspots, the rate of magnetic flux <b>emergence</b> and the <b>ratio</b> between the durations of growth and decay phases of solar active regions. Results. We demonstrate that {{the visibility of}} small sunspots has a strong centre-to-limb variation, far larger than would be expected from geometrical (projection) effects. This results in {{a large number of}} young spots being invisible: 44 % of new regions emerging in the west of the Sun go undetected. For sunspot regions that are detected, large differences exist between actual locations and times of flux emergence, and the apparent ones derived from sunspot data. The duration of the growth phase of solar regions has been, up to now, underestimated...|$|R
40|$|Lectins {{extracted}} from chickpea, pigeonpea, garlic and field bean were bioassayed along with snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis) lectin against the neonate larvae of Helicoverpa armigera. The {{surface of the}} artificial diet in a glass vial (2 cm diameter and 3. 5 cm height) was treated with 100 ml of different lectins, and one neonate larva was released in each vial. Data were recorded for larval weight, pupal weight, larval and pupal period, pupation, adult <b>emergence</b> and sex <b>ratio.</b> Larval weights were slightly greater in diets treated with snowdrop, chickpea and field bean lectins. Percentage pupation was low (< 60 %) in diets treated with pigeonpea, chickpea (in 60 % ammonium sulfate solution) and garlic lectins, whereas adult emergence was low in diets treated with pigeonpea and garlic lectins. Garlic lectin had an adverse effect on the larval and pupal weights of H. armigera {{but not on the}} duration of larval and pupal development. Lectins from garlic and pigeonpea can possibly be deployed in transgenic plants in combination with Bt genes to increase the level of plant resistance to H. armigera...|$|R
40|$|The {{mass rearing}} of the {{screwworm}} fly, Cochliomyia hominivorax (Diptera: Calliphoridae), for programs that integrate the Sterile Insect Technique in the Americas {{is part of}} one of the largest insect mass rearing programs in the world. Most of the cost and labor required in mass rearing systems is related to the larval diet, what enhances the relevance of the constant development of novel diets taking into account their effectiveness, cost and practicability. In this research, two bioassays with alternative diets made using local products were performed in order to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of these diets for screwworm rearing in Brazil. Two liquid diets (having sugarcane bagasse or coconut fiber as bulking agents), a meat diet, and a gelled diet were tested. The biological parameters evaluated (larval weight, larval viability, pupal weight, adult <b>emergence,</b> and sex <b>ratio)</b> were satisfactory according to mass rearing standards and the diets did not differ statistically (P > 0. 05). Due to its higher number of advantages, as high larval viability and lower cost, the gelled diet developed is recommended for screwworm larvae rearing in Brazil...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} was mainly restricted to morphpogical response of four wheat genotypes to water deficit conditions. The seeds of four genotypes were sown in two wooden trays at normal laboratory conditions. These genotypes were evaluated for seedling traits under four moiture regimes viz. control tap water 100, 70, 50 and 30 % tap water of control. Analysis of variances revealed {{significant differences in}} most of the seedling traits, indicating the notable genetic variability among wheat genotypes at different moisture levels. Significant genetic variability and heritability existed for all seedling and emegence traits. The estimates of genetic variances were smaller than their respective phenotypic variances for all the traits evaluated. The correlation of most of the seedling traits were positive and significant with each other. Root/shoot ratio and dry root weight show significant negative correlation. Non significant correlation was also observed in emergence rate index and root/shoot ratio. The estimates of coefficient of variability (CV %) indicated that the maximum variation for root/shoot <b>ratio,</b> <b>emergence</b> rate index, fresh shoot weight, dry shoot weight and fresh shoot length...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} in biological control of thrips in the Mediterranean area is that Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande) does not undergo diapause. Therefore, finding a non-diapausing species or strain of the genus Orius would be very useful for sea-sonal inoculative releases to control this species of thrips. Both the palearctic O. majusculus (Reuter) and the nearctic O. insidio-sus (Say) show a reproductive diapause that is induced by photoperiod. No data were available about the occurrence of diapause in O. laevigatus (Fieber). The possibility of inducing a reproductive diapause in this palearctic species was therefore investigated in the laboratory using two strains: strain N collected in northern Italy (Po Valley; ca. 44 ° N latitude) and strain S collected in southern Italy (Sicily; ca. 37 ° N latitude). The influence of photoperiod on eggs at 18 ± 1 °C, RH= 75 ± 10 % and at several light re-gimes varying between 16 L: 8 D and 8 L: 16 D (experiment 1) and between 13 L: 11 D and 11 L: 13 D (experiment 2) was studied. O. laevigatus were fed on Ephestia kuehniella (Zeller) frozen eggs. Development time, adult <b>emergence,</b> sex <b>ratio,</b> pre-oviposition period, fecundity up to day 29 of adult life, {{and the presence of}} mature oocytes were recorded. Photoperiods of 11. 5 L: 12. 5 D and 12 L: 12 D induced a longer development time, a longer pre-oviposition period and a lower oviposition rate than the other photoperiods for both populations. The percentage of egg-laying females at 18 °C was higher for strain S (70 %) than for strain N (44 %). Termination of diapause was investigated by exposing the Orius strains to an higher temperature (26 °C) and a longer day-length (16 L: 8 D). The females of both strains supposedly i...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of invasive plant populations {{is controlled by}} seed input, survival in the soil seed bank, and effects of soil surface disturbance on emergence, growth, and survival. We studied the invasive vine Celastrus orbiculatus Thunb. (Oriental bittersweet) to determine if seedlings in forest understory germinate from the seed bank or from seed rain. We also conducted a greenhouse experiment to investigate the role of leaf litter mass and physical texture on seedling survival, growth, and allocation. In the understory of an invaded mixed hardwood forest, we measured seed input, seedling emergence with seed rain, and seedling emergence without seed rain. Mean seed rain was 168 seeds m 2 : mean seedling emergence was 107 m 2, {{and there was a}} strong correlation between seed rain and seedling <b>emergence.</b> The <b>ratio</b> of seedlings to seed input (0. 61) was close to the seed viability (0. 66) leaving very few seeds to enter the seed bank. Seed bank germination under field conditions was low (1 seedling m 2). Soil cores were incubated in a greenhouse to determine seed bank viability, and germination from these soil cores did not occur. To determine how litter affects seedling establishment and growth, we measured seedling emergence and biomass allocation in a greenhouse experiment. Seeds were placed below intact and fragmented deciduous leaf litter in amounts ranging from zero to the equivalent of 16 Mg ha 1. Seedling emergence was not affected by fragmented litter, but decreased to < 20 % as intact litter increased to 16 Mg ha 1. Increasing litter resulted in greater allocation to hypocotyl and less to cotyledon and radicle, and this effect was greater in intact litter. C. orbiculatus seedlings achieve emergence through forest floor litte...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of {{nitrogen}} form (nitrate and ammonium in the molar ratio of 1 : 1 or 1 : 0), supplied to the plant or NaCl salinity (up to a concentration of 50 mol m 3) of the feeding solution, {{on the content of}} selected caffeic acid derivatives and the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL; EC. 4. 3. 1. 5) and shikimate dehydrogenase (SKDH; EC 1. 1. 1. 25) were investigated in the leaves and the roots of Echinacea angustifolia DC, grown hydroponically. Two experiments were conducted under glasshouse conditions with seedlings transplanted in aerated stagnant nutrient solution (floating raft system) four weeks after <b>emergence.</b> The nitrate/ammonium <b>ratio</b> in the nutrient solution did not affect plant growth or dry matter partitioning, but it influenced the concentration of determined metabolites; in particular, the root concentrations of chlorogenic acid, echinacoside and caffeic acid were significantly higher in the plants grown with nitrate as sole source of nitrogen. NaCl salinity reduced plant growth, by reducing the biomass allocated to the inflorescences, and enhanced the accumulation of chlorogenic acid and cichoric acids, at least in the roots...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the quality of the}} aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer), Lipaphis erysimi (Kaltenbach) and Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) as hosts for the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae (McIntosh). Parasitization by D. rapae was higher on M. persicae than on L. erysimi and B. brassicae. The time of development of D. rapae from egg to mummy or egg to adult male or female were shorter on M. persicae than on L. erysimi and B. brassicae. Moreover, D. rapae showed no significant differences in the <b>emergence</b> rate, sex <b>ratio</b> and longevity when reared on the three aphid species. Myzus persicae was the largest aphid host, with B. brassicae and L. erysimi being of intermediate and of small size, respectively. Diaeretiella rapae reared on M. persicae was larger than when reared on L. erysimi and B. brassicae, and females of D. rapae were significantly larger than males on M. persicae, but males of D. rapae were larger than females when reared on L. erysimi. No difference in size was detected between males and females in parasitoids reared on B. brassicae. Among the aphid species studied, M. persicae was found to be the most suitable to D. rapae...|$|R
