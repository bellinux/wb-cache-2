25|$|The {{university}} {{agreed to}} lease 43 acres on the STAR campus to The Data Centers (TDC) {{for the construction}} of the data center. The data center plan included a combined heat cycle natural <b>gas-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> capable of generating 279 megawatts of energy. TDC claimed that the power plant was critical to ensuring an uninterrupted electrical power supply to the facility, which is critical for data integrity. The TDC business plan also called for sale of excess electricity. Portions of the Newark community questioned the business plan, claiming that the power plant is not an auxiliary part of the data center but a separate industrial use, which would violate the zoning of the STAR campus.|$|E
500|$|For {{comparison}} (of weighted averages), {{a combined}} cycle <b>gas-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> emits some 400–599g/kWh, an oil-fired power plant 893g/kWh, a {{coal-fired power plant}} 915–994g/kWh or with {{carbon capture and storage}} some 200g/kWh, and a geothermal high-temp. power plant 91–122g/kWh. The life cycle emission intensity of hydro, wind and nuclear power are lower than solar's as of 2011 as published by the IPCC, and discussed in the article Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources. Similar to all energy sources were their total life cycle emissions primarily lay in the construction and transportation phase, the switch to low carbon power in the manufacturing and transportation of solar devices would further reduce carbon emissions. [...] BP Solar owns two factories built by Solarex (one in Maryland, the other in Virginia) in which all of the energy used to manufacture solar panels is produced by solar panels. A 1-kilowatt system eliminates the burning of approximately 170 pounds of coal, 300 pounds of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere, and saves up to 105 gallons of water consumption monthly.|$|E

40|$|Thermal <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> are {{increasingly}} required to balance power grids by compensating for the intermittent electricity supply from renewable energy resources. As CO 2 capture and storage is integrated with both coal- and <b>gas-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> {{it is vital}} that the emission mitigation technology does not compromise their ability to provide this high-value service. Therefore, developing optimal process operation strategies is vital to maximise both the value provided by and the profitability of these important assets. In this work, we present models of coal- and <b>gas-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> integrated with a post-combustion CO 2 capture process using a 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent. With the aim to decoupling the <b>power</b> and capture <b>plants</b> in order to facilitate profit maximising behaviour, a multi-period dynamic optimisation problem was formulated and solved using these models. Four distinct scenarios were evaluated: load following, solvent storage, exhaust gas by-pass and variable solvent regeneration (VSR). It was found that for both coal- and <b>gas-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> the VSR strategy is consistently the most profitable option. The performance of the exhaust by-pass scenario is a strong function of the carbon prices and is only selected at very low carbon prices. The viability of the solvent storage strategy was found to be a strong function of the capital cost associated with the solvent storage infrastructure. When the cost of the solvent tanks has been paid off, then the solvent storage scenario is 3. 3 % and 8 % more profitable than the baseline for the pulverised coal and <b>gas-fired</b> <b>power</b> <b>plants,</b> respectively. Sensitivity analyses showed that, for all strategies, the flexibility benefit declined with reduced carbon and fuel prices, while a “peakier” electricity market, characteristic of one with significant quantities of intermittent renewables deployment, more significantly rewarded flexible operation...|$|R
