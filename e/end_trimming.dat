40|$|We have {{surveyed}} intron-containing RNAs of {{the yeast}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae by filter hybridization with pre-tRNA intron-specific oligonucleotide probes. We have classified various RNAs as pre-tRNAs, splicing intermediates, or excised intron products according to apparent size and structure. Linear, excised intron products were detected, and one example was isolated and sequenced directly. Additional probes designed to detect other precursor sequences {{were used to}} verify the identification of several intermediates. Pre-tRNA species with both 5 ' leader and 3 ' extension, with 3 ' extension only, and with mature ends were distinguished. From these results, we conclude that the processing reactions used to remove the 5 ' leader and 3 ' extension from the transcript are ordered 5 ' <b>end</b> <b>trimming</b> before 3 ' <b>end</b> <b>trimming.</b> Splicing intermediates containing the 5 ' exon plus the intron were detected. The splice site cleavage reactions are probably ordered 3 ' splice site cleavage before 5 ' splice site cleavage.

40|$|Small {{nucleolar}} {{and small}} Cajal body RNAs (snoRNAs and scaRNAs) of the H/ACA box and C/D box type are generated by exonucleolytic shortening of longer precursors.

We report that, in human cells, knock-down of the poly(A) specific ribonuclease (PARN), previously implicated only in mRNA metabolism, causes the accumulation of oligoadenylated processing intermediates of H/ACA box but not C/D box RNAs. In agreement with a role of PARN in snoRNA and scaRNA processing, the enzyme is concentrated in nucleoli and Cajal bodies. Oligo(A) tails are attached to a short stub of intron sequence remaining beyond the mature 3 ' end of the snoRNAs.

The Rrp 44 C-terminal body part containing an RNase II-type active site is anchored to the exosome through a conserved set of interactions mainly to the Rrp 45 and Rrp 43 subunit, whereas the Rrp 44 N-terminal head part is anchored to the Rrp 41 subunit and may function as a roadblock to restrict access of RNA to the active site in the body region.

The only known example of non-organellar C to U editing of tRNAs occurs in trypanosomatids. In this system, editing at position 32 of the anticodon loop of tRNAThr(AGU) stimulates, but is not required for, the subsequent formation of inosine at position 34. In the present work, we expand the number of C to U edited tRNAs to include all the threonyl tRNA isoacceptors. Notably, the absence of a naturally encoded adenosine, at position 34, in two of these isoacceptors demonstrates that A to I is not required for C to U editing. We also show that C to U editing is a nuclear event while A to I is cytoplasmic, where C to U editing at position 32 occurs in the precursor tRNA prior to 5 ′ leader removal. Our data supports the view that C to U editing is more widespread than previously thought and is part of a stepwise process in the maturation of tRNAs in these organisms...|$|E

Ten samples with 13 known unique variants (“singleton variants” within the pool) and seven common changes were amplified and then equimolar-pooled before sequencing on a single flow cell lane, generating 36 base reads. For comparison, a single “control” sample was run in a different lane.

40|$|Ribosomal RNAs are {{generally}} stable in growing Escherichia coli cells. However, their degradation increases dramatically under conditions {{that lead to}} slow cell growth. In addition, incomplete RNA molecules and molecules with defects in processing, folding, or assembly are also eliminated in growing cells in a process termed quality control. Here, we show that there are {{significant differences between the}} pathways of ribosomal RNA degradation during glucose starvation and quality control during steady-state growth. In both processes, endonucleolytic cleavage of rRNA in ribosome subunits is an early step, resulting in accumulation of large rRNA fragments when the processive exoribonucleases, RNase II, RNase R, and PNPase are absent. For 23 S rRNA, cleavage is in the region of helix 71, but the exact position can differ in the two degradative processes. For 16 S rRNA, degradation during starvation begins with shortening of its 3 ′ end in a reaction catalyzed by RNase PH. In the absence of this RNase, there is no 3 ′ <b>end</b> <b>trimming</b> of 16 S rRNA and no accumulation of rRNA fragments, and total RNA degradation is greatly reduced. In contrast, the degradation pattern in quality control remains unchanged when RNase PH is absent. During starvation, the exoribonucleases RNase II and RNase R are important for fragment removal, whereas for quality control, RNase R and PNPase are more important. These data highlight the similarities and differences between rRNA degradation during starvation and quality control during steady-state growth and describe a role for RNase PH in the starvation degradative pathway...|$|E
40|$|DNA reads {{generated}} by large-scale sequencing projects {{have to be}} processed before further analyses in order to perform vector/primer masking, low-quality trimming and contaminant removal. This sequential processing involves several steps {{and the use of}} different computer programs, each one following its own calling convention and input/output formats. As a consequence, building a sequence processing pipeline is generally a tedious and exhaustive task. In addition, the currently available pipelines are often poorly documented, requiring careful examination of Perl, Python or shellscript codes before they can be properly configured. Some others are more specialized to perform determined functions [1, 2], not allowing the incorporation of new modules in an integrated way. This paper reports the development of E-Gene, an integrated system that makes pipeline construction a modular job. We have created a unified view of the building blocks of the pipeline and of the integration pattern of the various processing steps.

40|$|Small RNAs are single-stranded, 18 – 36 {{nucleotide}} RNAs {{that can}} be categorized as miRNA, siRNA, and piRNA. miRNA are expressed ubiquitously in tissues and at particular developmental stages. They fine-tune gene expression by regulating the stability and translation of mRNAs. piRNAs are mainly expressed in the animal gonads and their major function is repressing transposable elements to ensure the faithful transfer of genetic information from generation to generation. My thesis research focused on the biogenesis of miRNAs and piRNAs using both experimental and computational strategies. The biogenesis of miRNAs involves sequential processing of their precursors by the RNase III enzymes Drosha and Dicer to generate miRNA/miRNA* duplexes, which are subsequently loaded into Argonaute proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We discovered that, after assembled into Ago 1, {{more than a quarter}} of Drosophila miRNAs undergo 3 ′ <b>end</b> <b>trimming</b> by the 3 ′-to- 5 ′ exoribonuclease Nibbler. Such trimming occurs after removal of the miRNA* strand from pre-RISC and may be the final step in RISC assembly, ultimately enhancing target messenger RNA repression. Moreover, by developing a specialized Burrow-Wheeler Transform based short reads aligner, we discovered that in the absence of Nibbler a subgroup of miRNAs undergoes increased tailing—non-templated nucleotide addition to their 3 ′ ends, which are usually associated with miRNA degradation. Therefore, the 3 ′ trimming by Nibbler might increase miRNA stability by protecting them from degradation. In Drosophila germ line, piRNAs associate with three PIWI-clade Argonaute proteins, Piwi, Aub, and Ago 3. piRNAs bound by Aub and Ago 3 are generated by reciprocal cleavages of sense and antisense transposon transcripts (a. k. a., the “Ping-Pong” cycle), which amplifies piRNA abundance and degrades transposon transcripts in the cytoplasm. On the other hand, Piwi and its associated piRNA repress the transcription of transposons in the nucleus. We discovered that Aub- and Ago 3 -mediated transposon RNA cleavage not only generates piRNAs bound to each other, but also produces substrates for the endonuclease Zucchini, which processively cleaves those substrates in a periodicity of ~ 26 nt and generates piRNAs that predominantly load into Piwi. Without Aub or Ago 3, the abundance of Piwi-bound piRNAs drops and transcriptional silencing is compromised. Our discovery revises the current model of piRNA biogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{topic of}} this thesis is aging, that was studied through the {{analysis}} of transcriptomic and miRNomic data {{with the aim of}} finding molecular features and potential regulators conserved across species. A specific focus was set on brain and mechanisms causing neurogenesis decline. Base of the study was Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) JenAge dataset (cf. 1. 5. 1), comprising several species (C. elegans, N. furzeri, D rerio, M. musculus) and tissues (brain, liver, blood, skin) at different time points during aging (at least 5 ages with 5 replicates for each organism). The work was developed on three lines: transcriptome, miRNome and IsomiR analysis, often combined and converging in the investigation of causes and consequences of microRNAs regulation. Transcriptome was studied in N. furzeri brain, where, expanding a previous work (Baumgart et al., submitted), Gene Ontology enrichment analysis on differentially expressed genes and correlation networks led to the identification of several genes regulated with age and specifically expressed in neurogenic niches. Among others was the uncharacterized zinc finger ZNF 367, central hub of the network, which can thus be considered an interesting candidate for further studies in neurogenesis regulation. MiRNome was analysed starting from raw NGS data that were hence quantified and annotated to find evolutionarily conserved differentially expressed microRNAs in the brain. Independently, microRNAs potentially regulating gene expression in N. furzeri brain were identified comparing microRNAs and their predicted targets’ expression profiles. These analyses converged on two microRNAs, miR- 29 a and miR- 101 a, previously shown to be onco-suppressors. These microRNAs were assayed by in situ hybridization in N. furzeri brain cryosection, revealing their specific expression in differentiated neurons, and overexpression experiments via injections into zebrafish embryos, showing their role in cell cycle escape. Finally, they were shown to alter the transcriptome (in overexpression experiments) in a way that resembles physiological aging. IsomiR analysis revealed the existence of a remarkable variability in microRNA sequences, which were studied in their general features (position along the precursor, length, mismatches number, type and position) and in their variation with age. Specifically, microRNAs were found being shortened with age via 3 ’ <b>end</b> <b>trimming</b> in the brain of all the analysed organisms and being subject to an increase in mismatches at their 3 ’ end in all tissues and organisms. Moreover, several internally edited forms, differentially expressed with age, were identified and studied more deeply in mouse brain where they were implicated in neurogenesis and plasticity decline. Surprisingly, loops deriving from microRNA precursor hairpins were discovered being negatively correlated with their predicted targets and hence potentially physiologically active in gene expression regulation. A few enzymes potentially causing microRNA sequence variability (Nibbler, Hen 1 and ADAR – Adenosine Deaminase Acting on RNA) were studied and shown to be probably implicated in the observed features and their change with age. In conclusion, this thesis led to identification of several regulators of aging, such as ZNF 367, miR- 29 a and miR- 101 a, and molecular mechanisms of aging, such as microRNA shortening and editing, worth further investigations...|$|E
