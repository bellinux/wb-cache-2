5|$|Of Thomas Quiney's fate {{the records}} show little. It is speculated {{that he may}} have died in 1662 or 1663 when the parish burial records are incomplete. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> had a nephew in London, who by this time held the lease to The Cage.|$|E
5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as documents from that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Richard and Gloucester's {{campaign}} of 1392 never happened, but Richard did leave for Ireland in 1394 {{with a large}} army, accompanied by John Othelake, who had succeeded Chandos as Ireland King of Arms in 1393. No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> had a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381. The historical evidence does not even make clear how long Othelake served in the position.|$|E

5|$|The normal {{progress}} for an able Magister {{was to go}} on to further study in one of the four faculties at Leuven: Theology, Medicine, Canon Law and Roman Law. Gisbert might have hoped that Mercator would go further in theology and train for the priesthood but Mercator did not: like many twenty year old young men he was having his first serious doubts. The problem was the contradiction between the authority of Aristotle and his own biblical study and scientific observations, particularly in relation to the creation and description of the world. Such doubt was heresy at the University and {{it is quite possible that}} he had already said enough in classroom disputations to come to the notice of the authorities: fortunately he did not put his sentiments into print. He left Leuven for Antwerp, there to devote his time to contemplation of philosophy. This period of his life is clouded in uncertainty. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> read widely but only succeeded in uncovering more contradictions between the world of the Bible and the world of geography, a hiatus which would occupy him for the rest of his life. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> could not effect a reconciliation between his studies and the world of Aristotle.|$|E
5|$|After George's abdication in 1292, Aldimir had to flee into exile. He {{may have}} {{followed}} his brother as a refugee in the Byzantine Empire, though <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> {{settled in the}} Golden Horde not long thereafter. Perhaps with Tatar approval, Aldimir returned to Bulgaria in 1298, after the reign of Smilets (r. 1292–1298) was over and the empire was {{in the hands of}} the child Tsar Ivan II and his mother, the widow of Smilets tentatively known as Smiltsena. Aldimir pledged his loyalty to Smiltsena, who either granted him the domain south of the Balkan Mountains or restored him to his former appanage. To consolidate that union, Aldimir married Smiltsena's daughter, the princess Maria, possibly in late 1298.|$|E
5|$|Sultan did not {{initially}} have any male heirs {{and it is}} possible that Usama expected to succeed him. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> singled him out among his brothers by teaching him, tutoring him in the ways of war and hunting. He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative. However, after Sultan had his own son, he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid's other sons. According to Usama, Sultan was jealous after a particularly successful lion-hunt in 1131 when he entered the town with a large lion head in his arms as a hunting trophy. When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect this could have on his uncle. However, despite this he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions. Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129 and after his father died in 1137 his exile became permanent.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing of}} Wheelwright's Brief and Plain Apology may have {{commenced}} {{as early as}} 1644 when Short Story was published, but based on datable events the last part was written after his vindication by the Massachusetts court in 1654. In {{the first half of}} this work, Wheelwright refers to the author of Short Story as a singular person, clearly thinking that Thomas Weld had written the entire piece. Later in his Apology, however, Wheelwright refers to the authors (plural) of Short Story, realizing that Weld was not alone in writing the material. Though Wheelwright mentions no author of Short Story by name other than Thomas Weld, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> had come to realize that the other author was John Winthrop, since the 1648 books by both Cotton and Rutherford mentioned this fact as an aside. Winthrop had died in 1649 with a reputation as an effective colonial leader, respected in both England and the colonies, and there was no rational reason for Wheelwright to impugn his good name.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on {{the morning}} of 7 April, Pedro, his wife, and others, {{including}} his daughter MariaII and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship HMS Warspite. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard HMS Volage. He arrived in Cherbourg-Octeville, France, on 10 June. During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed by, but received no actual support from, either government. Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of Duke of Braganza on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to MariaII's heir, which <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> was not, his claim was met with general recognition. On 1 December, his only daughter by Amélie, Maria Amélia, was born in Paris.|$|E
5|$|Not {{long after}} his {{intrusion}} into the Islesperhaps in 1113 or 1114Domnall {{appears to have}} been either driven out by force, or drawn back to Ireland in an attempt to capitalise on Muirchertach's failing health. This would appear to have been about the point when Amlaíb mac Gofraid began his own forty-year reign in the Isles. The latter, who apparently spent a considerable part of his childhood at the court of Henry I, King of England (died 1135), may well have enjoyed the English king's assistance in assuming control of the Isles, and perhaps precipitated Domnall's departure. Whatever the cause for Domnall's return to Ireland, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> predeceased his rival uncle, and was killed by Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht (died 1156), as the Annals of Inisfallen, the sixteenth-century Annals of Loch Cé, the Annals of the Four Masters, the fourteenth-century Annals of Tigernach, and the Annals of Ulster, all report Domnall's death {{at the hands of the}} Connachta in 1115. In fact, Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair had invaded Thomond earlier that year, and the Annals of Tigernach elaborates that he had installed Domnall as King of Thomond at that point. This source further reveals that Domnall had afterwards turned against Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, who in turn invaded Thomond and had Domnall eliminated.|$|E

2500|$|Bloom's {{association}} with the Western canon has provoked a substantial interest in his opinion concerning {{the relative importance of}} contemporary writers.

25|$|The general {{positioning}} {{of the field and}} the blocking of the batsmen's known strokes was admirable, and his placing was responsible for at least three of the catches made. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> has the knack of keeping his men equable and happy.

25|$|Raphaël {{embarked}} on a policy of trying to convince Jacques {{of the need to}} win more races as <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> had the ability to do so... Anquetil had a very strong personality so he was not easily dominated but Géminiani had an even stronger one. He never gave up the task of trying to convince Jacques of the need for more panache, how a man of his talent should have an even bigger list of important wins.|$|E

25|$|Details of his {{subsequent}} career are spotty, {{and he may}} have remained in Chartres or the general area.

Johannes Tinctoris and Johannes Ockeghem are two <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> knew personally, as the former was also associated with Chartres, and Ockeghem was at Tours, the church of which was closely connected with Chartres. An obituary for Mureau is recorded in Chartres in July 1512.|$|E
25|$|These {{positions}} were ideal for funding a university education. Andrew was incorporated at the University of Glasgow in 1456, {{and he is}} found as a determinant, i.e. having completed his Bachelor's Degree, at the University of St Andrews in 1462 x 1463. He appears to have entered the University of Paris ad eundem in 1465. By 1460, he had become Dean of Moray, while retaining the Glasgow sub-deanery. In 1470, {{he may have been}} given the position of Provost of the Collegiate church of Lincluden, a position <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> did hold in 1477.|$|E
25|$|Bernard's {{name was}} {{certainly}} on the Declaration of Arbroath, and as chancellor <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> had some role.

He {{would have had a}} significant role in royal government and the issue of charters, and many royal acts are dated by Bernard's whereabouts. His role as chancellor appears to have been used for the benefit of his abbey with nine of the sixteen royal charters extant from the period 13123 having the abbey as the beneficiary.|$|E
