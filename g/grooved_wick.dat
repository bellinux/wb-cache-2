40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed for predicting the thermal {{performance of a}} flat micro heat pipe with a rectangular <b>grooved</b> <b>wick</b> structure. The effects of the liquid-vapor interfacial shear stress, the contact angle, {{and the amount of}} liquid charge are accounted for in the present model. In particular, the axial variations of the wall temperature and the evaporation and condensation rates are considered by solving the one-dimensional conduction equation for the wall and the augmented Young-Laplace equation, respectively. The results obtained from the proposed model are in close agreement with several existing experimental data in terms of the wall temperatures and the maximum heat transport rate. From the validated model, it is found that the assumptions employed in previous studies may lead to significant errors for predicting the thermal performance of the heat pipe. Finally, the maximum heat transport rate of a micro heat pipe with a <b>grooved</b> <b>wick</b> structure is optimized with respect to the width and the height o...|$|E

40|$|A {{novel and}} new thermal {{management}} technology for advanced ceramic microelectronic packages {{has been developed}} incorporating miniature heat pipes embedded in the ceramic substrate. The heat pipes use an axially <b>grooved</b> <b>wick</b> structure and water as the working fluid. Prototype substrate/heat pipe systems were fabricated using high temperature co-fired ceramic (alumina). The heat pipes were nominally 81 mm in length, 10 mm in width, and 4 mm in height, and were charged with approximately 50 - 80 mL of water. Platinum thick film heaters were fabricated {{on the surface of}} the substrate to simulate heat dissipating electronic components. Several thermocouples were affixed to the substrate to monitor temperature. One end of the substrate was affixed to a heat sink maintained at constant temperature. The prototypes were tested and shown to successful and reliably operate with thermal loads over 20 Watts, with thermal input from single and multiple sources along the surface of the substrate. Temperature distributions are discussed for the various configurations and the effective thermal resistance of the substrate/heat pipe system is calculated.

50|$|<b>Grooved</b> <b>wicks</b> {{are used}} in {{spacecraft}} heat pipes, {{as shown in the}} first photograph in this section. The heat pipes are formed by extruding aluminum, and typically have an integral flange to increase the heat transfer area, which lowers the temperature drop. <b>Grooved</b> <b>wicks</b> {{are used in}} spacecraft, instead of the screen or sintered wicks used for terrestrial heat pipes, since the heat pipes don’t have to operate against gravity in space. This allows spacecraft heat pipes to be several meters long, in contrast to the roughly 25 cm maximum length for a water heat pipe operating on Earth. Ammonia is the most common working fluid for spacecraft heat pipes. Ethane is used when the heat pipe must operate at temperatures below the ammonia freezing temperature.|$|R

Specific technical objectives of the program were: (1) Determine the solubility corrosion rates for Nickel 200, Inconel 718, and Udimet 72 OLI in a simulated Stirling engine heat pipe environment, (2) Develop coating processes and techniques for capillary <b>groove</b> and screen <b>wick</b> structures, (3) Evaluate the durability and solubility corrosion rates for capillary <b>groove</b> and screen <b>wick</b> structures coated with an insoluble coating in cylindrical heat pipes operating under Stirling engine conditions, and (4) Design and fabricate a coated full-scale, partial segment of the current Stirling engine heat pipe for the Stirling Space Power Convertor program.

50|$|For {{the heat}} pipe to {{transfer}} heat, it must contain saturated liquid and its vapor (gas phase). The saturated liquid vaporizes and {{travels to the}} condenser, where it is cooled {{and turned back to}} a saturated liquid. In a standard heat pipe, the condensed liquid is returned to the evaporator using a wick structure exerting a capillary action on the liquid phase of the working fluid. Wick structures used in heat pipes include sintered metal powder, screen, and <b>grooved</b> <b>wicks,</b> which have a series of grooves parallel to the pipe axis. When the condenser is located above the evaporator in a gravitational field, gravity can return the liquid. In this case, the heat pipe is a thermosyphon. Finally, rotating heat pipes use centrifugal forces to return liquid from the condenser to the evaporator.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableThe heating of {{household}} water, {{which consists of}} nearly 20 to 30 % of the average household's energy costs, has drastically increased in recent years. Solar water heaters have become popular to lower this cost, and one such system employs a thermosyphon system to collect solar energy and heat the water. Current market designs use a traditional thermosyphon with no wick structure inside. The purpose of this research project is {{to determine whether a}} thermosyphon with a helical-groove wick structure is better suited for a solar water heating system. Advantages for wick structures in thermosyphons include a decreased vapor-liquid interaction (preventing a condition called flooding), an aid to circumferential distribution of liquid in a tilted application, and to enhance condensation heat transfer in the condenser section. For this research, two thermosyphons are constructed; one with a smooth inner wall and one with a helical groove wick structure. Each thermosyphon is 10 mm in diameter, 1. 83 meters long, and constructed of copper tubing. The temperature of the condenser, adiabatic, and evaporator sections are monitored as the thermosyphon is tested under increasing thermal loads. The data collected is used to determine whether the surface area of the thermosyphon is sufficient to collect enough solar energy or if a heat sink is needed to provide sufficient surface area. The overall goal is to determine whether the advantages of the <b>grooved</b> <b>wick</b> structure provide a significant increase in performance over a traditional smooth-wall thermosyphon.

40|$|Heat {{pipes and}} other phase change devices have vast {{application}} to thermal management systems {{due to their}} efficient heat transfer capabilities. Current trends for improving the thermal performance of heat pipes have been focused on optimization of different wick geometries, to give the most efficient liquid transport while lowering the overall thermal resistance of the device. Advances in manufacturing have opened research to high capillarity micro- and nano-structured wicks. The choice of working fluid has been limited in the past. However, recently discovered advanced working fluids can offer several advantages. A novel working fluid for phase change heat transfer devices was investigated at UCLA. The Inorganic Aqueous Solution (IAS) has shown significant thermal performance enhancement due to surface augmentation but the deposition mechanisms of the IAS surface coating haven’t been fully observed or understood. The goal of this work was to observe the deposition and wetting dynamics of the fluid during operation in a heat pipe and use information from those experiments to develop a predictive thermal and hydrodynamic model of flow in a heat pipe. In this work, a background in phase change heat transfer and advanced working fluids is first presented. Three tasks, coating characterization, heat pipe experiment, and heat pipe modeling are outlined. Deposition mechanisms of a new working fluid were examined through accurate flat heat pipe experiments. Surprising observations of the deposition patterns in a <b>grooved</b> <b>wick</b> yielded valuable insight into the fundamental heat transfer concepts in which the fluid enhances heat pipe thermal performance. The role of interesting dynamics of the fluid, including the role of advective flow in a heat pipe, or the creeping nature of salt deposits, in enhancing heat transfer were identified. These observations were then utilized to develop a heat pipe model to {{study the effects of}} the deposition on heat pipe thermal resistance and dry-out limit theoretically. Strategic application of experimental closure to the model lead to even more interesting findings. Important information regarding the dry-out dynamics of flows with and without coatings was learned that will help develop the fluids...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a comprehensive}} study of a novel category of working fluids, referred to as an Inorganic Aqueous Solution (IAS), for use in phase-change heat transfer devices (e. g. capillary heat pipes). The motivation for exploring IAS comes from investigation of an inorganic aqueous solution that was central to the Qu-tube cooling device. Although the tubes performed well, the explanation of their heat transfer mechanism was suspect. This study in part examines the heat transfer mechanisms occurring in an IAS-heat pipe device and leads {{to the introduction of}} a novel wicking mechanism termed Thermo-Hydro-Chemo (THC) wicking. A broad exploratory study was performed to understand what the Qu-fluid (and IAS in the broader sense) is and the role it plays in a phase-change based cooling device. Prior to this dissertation there was no systematic verification of the performance of the Qu-fluid. The most significant outcomes of this exploration are the development and successive improvements of IAS and the introduction to THC mechanism. A custom flat heat pipe (FHP) facility was designed and built to enable systematic comparison of the working fluids with different wick geometries by enabling one to make precise measurements and to visualize the thermophysical processes. Using the FHP facility, the thermal performance of IAS fluids was investigated and compared to the performance of water and to understand how IAS working fluids behave during heat pipe operations. This part of the work is mainly concerned with quantifying the methods and capacity that designer fluids have to enhance heat transfer. Different hypotheses the observed performance were explored using the FHP device and {{it was found that the}} impact of IAS on heat transfer performance and the involved mechanisms were more complex than previously thought. The parameters that could be the reason for the enhanced performance of IAS were determined and investigated. A biporous wick experiment served as a model to determine the corresponding causal variables. To this end, each of the parameters that could contribute were investigated, i. e. the thermophysical properties of the Qu-fluid were measured and compared to those of water. In addition, the chemistry of the Qu-fluid was unraveled, leading to development of an IAS. After in-house formulation of the IAS fluid, the effort to explain the prevalent thermal mechanisms of IAS continued. In particular, a multi-scale study was performed to better understand the IAS thermal performance and micro-scale studies were performed to understand the results of the device-level measurements. These studies are supported by empirical evidence obtained using optical microscopy, SEM/EDS analysis, and theoretical studies using a commercial computing engine developed by OLI Systems, Inc. Finally, an exploratory optimization study of IAS was carried out using rectangular capillary <b>grooved</b> <b>wick</b> geometry. The existence of an optimum molality, and an optimum chemical composition that could maximize the heat removal capability of the copper grooved-capillary heat pipe was established. This study was limited to certain parental chemical constituents, based on which a "family of IAS" was designed and presumed to be the best generation of IAS, which thus far holds valid. The findings presented in this thesis along with the work of other UCLA researchers resulted in a patent for the IAS fluid, which has enabled the use of water in aluminum heat pipes for the first time, a particularly important feature for the aerospace industry. The IAS fluid not only increases the cooling capacity for a broad range of closed evaporative based heat transfer devices, but also opens several research avenues for further exploration of its fundamentals and general applications. In particular, the new THC pumping mechanism requires an interdisciplinary approach to be fully characterized even more improvements...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} {{predictions for}} a fifty foot heat pipe (4 foot evaporator - 46 foot condensor) are discussed. These performance predictions {{are supported by}} experimental data for a four foot heat pipe. Both heat pipes have evaporators with axial <b>groove</b> <b>wick</b> structures and condensers with powder metal external artery wick structures. The predicted performance of a rectangular axial groove/external artery heat pipe operating in space is given. Heat transport versus groove width is plotted for 100, 200 and 300 grooves in the evaporator. The curves show that maximum power is achieved for groove widths from 0. 040 to 0. 053 {{as the number of}} grooves varies from 300 to 100. The corresponding range of maximum power is 3150 to 2400 watts. The relationships between groove width and heat pipe evaporate diameter for 100, 200 and 300 grooves in the evaporator are given. A four foot heat pipe having a three foot condenser and one foot evaporator was built and tested. The evaporator wick structure used axial grooves with rectangular cross sections, and the condenser wick structure used powder metal with an external artery configuration. Fabrication drawings are enclosed. The predicted and measured performance for this heat pipe is shown. The agreement between predicted and measured performance is good and therefore substantiates the predicted performance for a fifty foot heat pipe...|$|R

The experimental and numerical {{studies show that the}} capillary {{performance of the}} micro-post wick can be significantly enhanced, compared with the homogeneous type wick, by employing non-homogeneous configurations: a <b>groove</b> type <b>wick</b> and a square array type wick have 35 % and 31 % higher capillary performances, respectively, compared with the homogeneous type wick having equal post size. The capillary performance is shown to be primarily a function of the solid fraction and increases linearly with decreasing solid fraction, regardless of the wick configuration. However, the capillary performance is found to be significantly reduced when the solid fraction falls below a threshold value. ope...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} model is {{developed for the}} evaporating liquid meniscus in wick microstructures under saturated vapor conditions. Four different wick geometries representing common wicks used in heat pipes, viz., wire mesh, rectangular <b>grooves,</b> sintered <b>wicks</b> and vertical microwires, are modeled and compared for evaporative performance. The solid–liquid combination considered is copper–water. Steady evaporation is modeled and the liquid–vapor interface shape {{is assumed to be}} static during evaporation. Liquid–vapor interface shapes in different geometries are obtained by solving the Young–Laplace equation using Surface Evolver. Mass, momentum and energy equations are solved numerically in the liquid domain, with the vapor assumed to be saturated. Evaporation at the interface is modeled by using heat and mass transfer rates obtained from kinetic theory. Thermocapillary convection due to non-isothermal conditions at the interface is modeled for all geometries and its role in heat transfer enhancement from the interface is quantified for both low and high superheats. More than 80 % of the evaporation heat transfer is noted to occur from the thin-film region of the liquid meniscus. The very small Capillary and Weber numbers resulting from the small fluid velocities near the interface for low superheats validate the assumption of a static liquid meniscus shape during evaporation. Solid–liquid contact angle, wick porosity, solid–vapor superheat and liquid level in the wick pore are varied to study their effects on evaporation from the liquid meniscus...|$|R
