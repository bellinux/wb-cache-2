The United States War Department in October 1941 announced the Remmel Dam Aluminum Plant {{would be one}} of four defense plants built in Arkansas. Reynolds Metals bought the plant after the war.|$|R
50|$|The cable {{plant was}} later sold and {{currently}} {{is owned by}} General Cable Corporation. <b>Hot</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>Rolling</b> Mill is now operated by Reynolds Packaging Group, a unit of Reynolds Group Holdings. The U.S. War Department's reduction plant was named for nearby Remmel Dam, a hydroelectric dam operated by Arkansas Power & Light Co. (now known as Entergy Arkansas.) Reynolds Metals renamed it, using the older spelling of the community's name, Jones Mills. The cable mill was named for the nearby city of Malvern. The rolling mill is named for Hot Spring County.|$|R
