5|$|Finding himself totally {{alone in}} a {{shattered}} world with food to last him a lifetime but no one to share it with, Bemis succumbs to despair. As he prepares to commit suicide using a revolver he has found, Bemis sees {{the ruins of the}} public library in the distance. Investigating, he finds that the books are still intact and readable; all the books he could ever hope for are his for the reading, and (as he gazes upon a huge fallen face of a clock) learns that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> {{the time in the world}} to read them without interruption.|$|E
25|$|Florinda's letter {{contains}} {{instructions for}} Belvile {{to come to}} her garden at ten that night and carry her off. Blunt sneaks off with Lucetta. The other men, who think of Blunt as a foolish provincial, realise that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> their money with him, and hope that he does not come to harm. Frederick informs his friends of a new courtesan in Naples: Angellica Bianca, the former mistress of a dead Spanish general.|$|E
25|$|I am {{sent here}} as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, and I do not control him; and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the {{soldiers}} who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes. Therefore, you must {{go back to your}} country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with him you must make peace.|$|E

25|$|Several {{cities in}} the Buenos Aires Province {{suffered}} big floods during the primary elections, and the following week. The flood affected 10,000 people. Daniel Scioli had left to Italy at that moment, and made a rushed return. Mauricio Macri considered it a result of poor urban planning under Scioli's provincial government, and compared it {{with the lack of}} flooding in Buenos Aires during the same storm, which had undergone flood prevention works under his leadership. Scioli accused users of social networks to plot to damage his public image, and claimed that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> of them identified.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Paul {{starts up}} another con against a {{sensitive}} {{young man named}} Rick and his live-in girlfriend, Elizabeth. The young couple are new to the big city and, based on Paul's con, invite him {{to live with them}} until he gets everything sorted out with his wealthy father—who Paul tells them is Flan Kittredge. The trio become good friends, with Paul spinning a tale of being estranged from his racist father; the girlfriend tells Rick not to lend Paul any money. One night Paul takes Rick out on the town, and seduces him {{in order to get the}} money. Later that night, Rick tells Elizabeth that Paul is gone, that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> their money, and that he and Paul had sex. In a fit of fury, she cruelly suggests that Rick's father had always questioned his son's sexuality. Soon afterwards Rick commits suicide.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the time in the world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin {{is the only one who}} had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of a doubt that Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

500|$|Watts {{announced}} in October {{that he would}} nominate for the 2008 draft, with he, Naitanui and another West Australian, Daniel Rich, touted as the most likely players to be recruited with the first selection in the 2008 AFL draft. He furthered his claim as the potential number one pick when he recorded the second fastest time by a non-Indigenous player in the twenty metre sprint with 2.82 seconds at the AFL draft camp, in addition to placing second in the agility test, fifth in the standing vertical jump and seventh in the repeated sprints. His rise during the year saw The Age journalist, Emma Quayle, describe him as the [...] "most complete prospect in [...] draft, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the athletic qualities you could want in a key forward—he's quick, agile, he's a good kick and he can mark". In {{the weeks leading up}} to the draft, it was widely accepted by the media that he would be the first pick in the draft.|$|E
500|$|In 1856, Bizet {{competed for}} the prestigious Prix de Rome. His entry was not successful, but nor were {{any of the}} others; the musician's prize was not awarded that year. After this rebuff, Bizet entered an opera {{competition}} which Jacques Offenbach had organised for young composers, with a prize of 1,200 francs. The challenge was to set the one-act libretto of Le docteur Miracle by Léon Battu and Ludovic Halévy. The prize was awarded jointly to Bizet and Charles Lecocq, a compromise which years later Lecocq criticised {{on the grounds of}} the jury's manipulation by Fromental Halévy in favour of Bizet. As a result of his success, Bizet became a regular guest at Offenbach's Friday evening parties, where among other musicians he met the aged Gioachino Rossini, who presented the young man with a signed photograph. Bizet was a great admirer of Rossini's music, and wrote not long after their first meeting that [...] "Rossini is the greatest of them all, because like Mozart, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the virtues".|$|E

500|$|On {{the last}} day of the 2013 January {{transfer}} window, Morison signed for Championship side Leeds United as part of a swap deal. The transfer involved Luciano Becchio moving to Norwich, as well as Norwich paying Leeds a [...] "further undisclosed sum". On signing Morison, the then-Leeds manager Neil Warnock said that – [...] "Steve meets all the requirements of the striker we've been looking to bring in. For me, he is a player who has everything. He can score goals from anywhere – whether it's 25 yards or a tap-in – he has pace, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the attributes you want". He made his Leeds debut on 9 February 2013, playing the whole match in the club's 2–2 draw against Wolverhampton Wanderers at Molineux. Morison scored his first goal for the club on his home debut on 20 February, netting the second goal in a 2–0 victory over Blackpool. He scored twice for Leeds in the club's 2–2 draw against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 9 March. The two goals proved to be Morison's last of the season; he scored three goals in 16 appearances during the second half of the 2012–13 campaign.|$|E
500|$|PokerTracker 3 is {{also known}} for its {{integrated}} heads-up display, a transparent video overlay data presentation that makes statistics and notes are readily available during play. The HUD allows an online poker player to focus his attention on the poker table {{he or she is}} playing at, rather than on the PokerTracker application. The HUD provides a vast array of realtime statistics for in-game analysis, customizable to the user's preference. In addition to the statistics available constantly during play on the poker window, detailed statistics are available in a pop-up window, accessible via a single mouse click. Marbella Slim of the Daily Star used the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger's Terminator character in an analogy with the HUD: [...] "In some scenes, you get to see what the robot Terminator is seeing and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> these data streams in front of his vision - it's a HUD or a head-up display." [...] Unlike other poker tracking products, PokerTracker 3 includes a HUD as part of the basic program. [...] The PT3 HUD, which automatically overlays a player's opponents' statistics next to their avatars, is essentially a built-in version of the formerly available PokerAce HUD.|$|E

2500|$|Gullit's {{brilliance}} prompted George Best {{to comment}} in 1990, [...] "Ruud Gullit {{is a great}} player by any standards. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the skills. He's not afraid to do things with the ball. And he looks as if he's enjoying every second of it. By my reckoning that's what makes him an even better player than Maradona. Both have the key quality you will find in all the best players: balance. You just can't knock them off the ball. It was the same with Pelé, Beckenbauer and Cruyff." ...|$|E
2500|$|Buller was {{impressed}} with Findlay's performance, and stated that he considered [...] "Major Findlay {{one of the best}} Officers I met. [...] He was an admirable commander of an Ammunition Column, loaded with ammunition of many different natures. [...] His batteries were complete every night, and he never made a mistake. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the qualifications for the staff and for high command, and I desire to bring his name most prominently to your notice as deserving of all consideration." [...] Shortly after this commendation was published in the London Gazette on 8 February 1901 Findlay was appointed a staff officer (on 5 March).|$|E
2500|$|However, by 20 September, Bellini {{told his}} Neapolitan friend Francesco Florimo {{that he did}} not think the {{performance}} could take place as scheduled due to Romani being ill.

[...] Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as [...] "one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the acting and spirit one could wish for." ...|$|E

2500|$|However, Navarro later {{stated that}} Queen had tricked him, {{and that she}} owed him money from the sales and {{production}} of the album [...] No legal action was taken, however. Navarro was invited by Jorge Guadalupe, Ivy Queen's manager to take legal action, as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the papers stating {{that there was no}} deception with the album. Guadalupe called Navarro [...] "someone who misses the money and the high-life" [...] he had while he was married to Queen. Navarro would also go on national television and accuse Queen of being unfaithful in their relationship on the television program Escándalo TV (Telefutura). He would also mention the accusations that Queen owed him money from the album as well on the program.|$|E

Berardo Calvari (known as Winter) was rejected because audiences had disliked him the previous July when he appeared in both a Pacini and a Donizetti opera at La Scala. Fortunately, having received good reports of the young tenor Domenico Reina, he was able to secure his services, describing him in a letter to Florimo as [...] "one who will want to do himself honour; everyone tells me that his voice is beautiful, and that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the acting and spirit one could wish for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In some cases, the killer's {{arrogance and}} dismissive {{attitude}} allow Columbo to manipulate his suspects into self-incrimination. While the details, {{and eventually the}} motivation(s), of the murderers' actions are shown to the viewer, Columbo's true thoughts and intentions are almost never revealed until {{close to the end}} of the episode. (Often he begins to whistle the tune [...] "This Old Man" [...] once <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>all</b> the loose ends of his case tied up.) Columbo generally maintains a friendly relationship with the murderer until the end. The point at which the detective first begins to suspect the murderer is generally not revealed, although it is often fairly early on. In some instances, such as Ruth Gordon's avenging elderly mystery writer in [...] "Try and Catch Me", Janet Leigh's terminally ill and deluded actress in [...] "Forgotten Lady", Donald Pleasence's elegant vintner in [...] "Any Old Port in a Storm", and Johnny Cash's enserfed singer in [...] "Swan Song", the killer is more sympathetic than the victim.|$|E
