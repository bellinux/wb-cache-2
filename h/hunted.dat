5|$|Bounty Hunter: A new mode {{introduced}} in the game. If an online player creates too much chaos in the world, the mode will be initiated. Police, alongside one to three other players, will join the player's game {{with the hope of}} killing the <b>hunted</b> and claiming the bounty, which gives them experience points. The <b>hunted</b> could either strike back at the hunters by killing them, which gives them greater rewards, or escape from them until the bounty expires. The <b>hunted,</b> meanwhile, also can be assisted by another player if that player chooses to join the <b>hunted.</b> Players can manually place a bounty on themselves using the in-game smartphone.|$|E

5|$|Birds are <b>hunted</b> in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, wigeon, shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are <b>hunted</b> for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been <b>hunted</b> for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional Māori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are <b>hunted</b> in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are <b>hunted</b> this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly <b>hunted</b> for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|The {{birds were}} <b>hunted</b> by {{settlers}} on Réunion, who also kept them as cagebirds. Nineteen specimens exist in museums around the world.

A number of factors have been proposed, including competition and predation by introduced species, disease, deforestation and persecution by humans, who <b>hunted</b> it for food and as an alleged crop pest.|$|E

40|$|This bachelor's thesis {{deals with}} the {{compulsory}} connection of the rights to <b>hunt</b> with the ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. The aim of this work is to divide and describe two kinds of <b>hunting</b> grounds according to the types of ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. There is also an economic analysis of revenues and expenses regarding <b>hunting</b> rights in these <b>hunting</b> grounds. It further analyses the impact of diminishing of the minimum area of the <b>hunting</b> grounds on the economy of <b>hunting.</b> It also tries {{to find out whether}} the diminishing would lead to <b>hunting</b> rights more interwoven with the ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. The conducted research confirmed the existence of two types of <b>hunting</b> grounds that differ by the kind of ownership and also revenues and expenses regarding <b>hunting</b> rights in these <b>hunting</b> lands. It was further found out that the diminishing of the minimum area of the <b>hunting</b> grounds would increase the bindingness of the <b>hunting</b> rights with the ownership of the <b>hunting</b> lands. The economic impact of the diminishing of the minimum area of the <b>hunting</b> ground couldn't be unequivocally determined...|$|R

5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and {{difficult}} to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is <b>hunted</b> for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was <b>hunted</b> by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and dug out its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E

5|$|Commercial whaling was {{historically}} {{important as}} an industry well throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. Whaling {{was at that time}} a sizeable European industry with ships from Britain, France, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany, sometimes collaborating to hunt whales in the Arctic, sometimes in competition leading even to war. By the early 1790s, whalers, namely the Americans and Australians, focused efforts in the South Pacific where they mainly <b>hunted</b> sperm whales and right whales, with catches of up to 39,000 right whales by Americans alone. By 1853, US profits reached US$11,000,000 (UK£6.5m), equivalent to US$348,000,000 (UK£230m) today, the most profitable year for the American whaling industry. Commonly exploited species included North Atlantic right whales, sperm whales, which were mainly <b>hunted</b> by Americans, bowhead whales, which were mainly <b>hunted</b> by the Dutch, common minke whales, blue whales, and grey whales. The scale of whale harvesting decreased substantially after 1982 when the International Whaling Commission (IWC) placed a moratorium which set a catch limit for each country, excluding aboriginal groups until 2004.|$|E
