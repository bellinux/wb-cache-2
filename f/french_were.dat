5|$|Shortland was {{succeeded by}} Captain Charles Inglis in 1808, {{and became the}} {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral George Martin. Canopus {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet under Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood and in October 1809 was part of the fleet that gave chase to a French convoy and their escorts under Rear-Admiral François Baudin in the Gulf of Lyons. The <b>French</b> <b>were</b> chased into the mouth of the Rhone, where the 80-gun Robuste and the 74-gun Lion were driven aground, and after attempts to salvage them had failed, the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> forced to burn them. Canopus became the flagship of Rear-Admiral Charles Boyles between 1811 and 1812, after which she was paid off into ordinary again.|$|E
5|$|Although {{casualties}} appeared even {{in numbers}} for both sides, the Austrians fielded a significantly larger fighting force of nearly 55,000at Ostrach, with another 60,000stretched along {{a line between}} Lake Constance and Ulm. French casualties amounted to more than 12percent of their force, and Austrian, approximately four percent. The <b>French</b> <b>were</b> forced back to Stockach, where on 25March the armies engaged again, this time with greater losses on both sides, and a decisive Austrian victory.|$|E

5000|$|The {{different}} kinds of B were eventually written differently, so as to distinguish them in music theory treatises and in notation. The flat sign [...] derives from a round b that signified the soft hexachord, hexachordum molle, particularly the presence of B. The name of the flat sign in <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bémol from medieval <b>French</b> <b>bé</b> mol, which in modern <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bé mou ("soft b"). The natural sign [...] and the sharp sign [...] derive from variations of a square b that signified the hard hexachord, hexachordum durum, where the note in question is B. The name of the natural sign in <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bécarre from medieval <b>French</b> <b>bé</b> quarre, which in modern <b>French</b> <b>is</b> bé carré ("square b"). In German music notation the letter B or b always designates B while the letter H or h - a deformation of a square b - designates B.|$|R
5|$|At Stockach, the French {{concentrated}} {{their forces}} into shorter lines, creating intense fighting conditions; initially, Charles's line was more extended, {{but he quickly}} pulled additional troops from his reserves to strengthen his front. When a small French force commanded by Dominique Vandamme nearly flanked the Austrian Army, Charles's personal intervention was crucial for the Austrians, buying time for reinforcements to arrive. General Jourdan, while trying to rally his men, was nearly trampled to death. Ultimately, the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> driven back upon the Rhine River.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 25 March, while {{crossing}} the Tyrrhenian Sea, the French squadron was spotted, having {{been reduced to}} ten ships by a storm the previous night. Ganteaume turned his ships to the south-east and Warren gave chase. Gibraltar and Athenienne began to lag behind, and Warren, fearing his force would become fragmented, ordered his faster ships to slow down. The <b>French</b> <b>were</b> thus able to escape into the night, the British continuing on a south-east course while they quietly turned north, back to Toulon.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the Belgians and the British {{concluded}} that the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> beaten and the Allied Armies in the pocket on the Belgian–Franco border would be destroyed if action was not taken.

5|$|Austrian losses {{amounted}} to 12 {{percent of total}} forces engaged, high for an eighteenth-century siege; the losses were due to sorties in which the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> able to inflict heavy damages. Gaston Bodart estimated that of the 40,000 men who participated on the Coalition side, 4,800 were lost. Based on Moreau's Memoirs, John Philippart estimated that the Austrian losses were lower: 3,000 troops killed or wounded and 1,000 taken prisoner.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the French Revolution in 1789 there were eight times as many slaves in the colony as there were white and mixed-race people put together. In 1789 the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> importing 30,000 slaves a year and there were half a million slaves in the French part of the island alone, compared to about 30,000 whites.|$|E
5|$|Guillemin was {{a member}} of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France's first victory in the Five Nations. After all the {{previous}} French losses to the Home Nations teams, the Scottish were favourites to win, and France's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press. It proved a reversal of the defeats, accompanied with humiliating press commentary which suggested that the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents.|$|E

5|$|Leaving {{his family}} behind, {{he was allowed}} to pass into the Austrian-ruled Banat, before moving into self-exile in France while his wife and {{children}} were sent to Ottoman lands.

5|$|Napoleon withdrew {{back into}} France, his army reduced to 70,000 soldiers, and little cavalry; he faced {{more than three}} times as many Allied troops.

Napoleon won a series of victories in the Six Days' Campaign, though these were not significant enough to turn the tide. The leaders of Paris surrendered to the Coalition in March 1814.|$|E

5|$|No {{official}} languages {{were recorded}} in the Constitution of 1992, although Malagasy was identified as the national language. Nonetheless, many sources still claimed that Malagasy and <b>French</b> <b>were</b> official languages, eventually leading a citizen to initiate a legal case against the state in April 2000, {{on the grounds that}} the publication of official documents only in the French language was unconstitutional. The High Constitutional Court observed in its decision that, in the absence of a language law, French still had the character of an official language.|$|E
5|$|On 16 May and 17, {{the main}} Austrian army under Charles {{arrived in the}} Marchfeld, a plain {{northeast}} of Vienna just across the Danube that often served as a training ground for Austrian military forces. Charles kept {{the bulk of his}} forces several miles away from the river bank in hopes of concentrating them at the point where Napoleon decided to cross. On the 20th, Charles learned from his observers on the Bissam hill that the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> building a bridge at Kaiser-Ebersdorf, just southwest of the Lobau island, that led to the Marchfeld. On the 21st, Charles concluded that the <b>French</b> <b>were</b> crossing at Kaiser-Ebersdorf in strength and ordered a general advance for 98,000 troops and the accompanying 292 guns, which were organised into five columns. The French bridgehead rested on two villages: Aspern to the west and Essling to the east. Napoleon had not expected to encounter opposition, and the bridges linking the French troops at Aspern-Essling to Lobau were not protected with palisades, making them highly vulnerable to Austrian barges that had been lighted on fire.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 1941, during World War II, {{when the}} Vichy <b>French</b> <b>were</b> {{in control of}} Syria, Quwatli called for {{immediate}} Syrian independence amid a period of food shortages, high unemployment and widespread nationalist rioting in the country. Vichy troops in the country were defeated by the Allied forces in July and Quwatli left Syria during the campaign. He returned in 1942. France officially recognized Syria's independence on 27 September. However, French troops were not withdrawn and national elections were postponed by the French Mandatory authorities.|$|E

5|$|The French {{intended}} to deport Long to French Guiana, but {{the outbreak of}} World War I in 1914 interrupted their plans.

5|$|The <b>French</b> <b>were</b> infuriated at King Leopold III's open {{declaration}} of neutrality in October 1936. The French Army saw its strategic assumptions undermined; it could no longer expect closer cooperation with the Belgians in defending the latter's eastern borders, enabling a German attack to be checked well forward of the French border. The <b>French</b> <b>were</b> dependent on how much cooperation they could extract from the Belgians. Such a situation deprived the French any prepared defences in Belgium to forestall an attack, a situation which the French had wanted to avoid as it meant engaging the German Panzer Divisions in a mobile battle. The French considered invading Belgium immediately {{in response to a}} German attack on the country. The Belgians, recognising the danger posed by the Germans, secretly made their own defence policies, troop movement information, communications, fixed defence dispositions, intelligence and air reconnaissance arrangements available to the French military attaché in Brussels.|$|E
