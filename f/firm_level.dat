25|$|A {{broad range}} of forces have been {{identified}} as potential contributors to the drop in union density across countries. Sano and Williamson outline quantitative studies that assess the relevance of these factors across countries. The first relevant set of factors relate to the receptiveness of unions' institutional environments. For example, the presence of a Ghent system (where unions are responsible for the distribution of unemployment insurance) and of centralized collective bargaining (organized at a national or industry level as opposed to local or <b>firm</b> <b>level)</b> have both been shown to give unions more bargaining power and to correlate positively to higher rates of union density.|$|E

Despite the promising-sounding nature of the weapon, which at trials in ideal conditions achieved a maximum range of [...] (attempts to increase maximum range to [...] having been abandoned due to excessive recoil and consequent instability), it was generally regarded as a short-range weapon with an accepted maximum range of only [...] and an accepted effective range of between [...] Furthermore, it was [...] heavy and awkward to manhandle, not simply to move around but also to tip over onto the correct wheel on <b>firm</b> <b>level</b> so it lay in, and remained in, the correct firing configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Many slums {{are part}} of economies of {{agglomeration}} {{in which there is}} an emergence of economies of scale at the <b>firm</b> <b>level,</b> transport costs and the mobility of the industrial labour force. [...] The increase in returns of scale will mean that the production of each good will take place in a single location. And even though an agglomerated economy benefits these cities by bringing in specialization and multiple competing suppliers, the conditions of slums continue to lag behind in terms of quality and adequate housing. Alonso-Villar argues that the existence of transport costs implies that the best locations for a firm will be those with easy access to markets, and the best locations for workers, those with easy access to goods. The concentration {{is the result of a}} self-reinforcing process of agglomeration. Concentration is a common trend of the distribution of population. Urban growth is dramatically intense in the less developed countries, where a large number of huge cities have started to appear; which means high poverty rates, crime, pollution and congestion.|$|E

40|$|This paper studies bribery {{between a}} firm and a {{supervisor}} who monitors the firm for regulatory compliance. Bribery occurs preemptively, that is before the supervisor exerts costly effort {{to discover the}} <b>firm's</b> <b>level</b> of noncompliance and collect evidence for successful prosecution. In contrast to previous papers, preemptive bribery is modeled as a Bayesian signaling game because the supervisor is uninformed about the <b>firm's</b> <b>level</b> of noncompliance. We show that under normal informational assumptions, some (possibly all) firms always engage in preemptive bribery. However, if knowledge of the <b>firm's</b> <b>level</b> of noncompliance has implications for the supervisor's ability to collect evidence and prosecute (prior knowledge), preemptive bribery can be completely eliminated. Results which apply to preemptive bribery under complete information do not apply here...|$|R

2500|$|The Auroux laws (1982) {{increased}} {{the rights of}} trade unions and employees in the workplace, covering collective bargaining, representation, information, health and safety, and unfair dismissal. The Auroux Laws included a requirement that half of all overtime worked in excess of 130 hours per year must be compensated by additional time off, while trade union delegates became entitled {{to an increase in}} paid time off for union activities and to increased protection against dismissal. In addition, an Auroux Law of November 1982 established an obligation to negotiate real wages and hours once a year {{at the level of the}} firm, and to negotiate real wages once a year and to revise job classifications once every five years at the national industry level. Mandatory collective bargaining at the <b>firm</b> <b>level</b> of industry was introduced, while the laws also strengthened the rules on health and safety in the workplace, bestowing more rights upon the Comites d’hygiene et securite (though not the right to stop production in case of extreme danger), while also granting working-class representatives release time, training for involvement [...] in the comite d’entreprise and other representative bodies in the firm, recourse to expert consultants. Unions acquired rights to organise, to hold meetings in firms, and to call in outside speakers to address the workers. Worker representation on the comite d’rentreprise was increased and the comite was provided with additional powers, such as the right to obtain confidential economic information from the firm to use in advising it on policy. In spite of these positive changes, however, the comite d'entreprise remained a consultative body with little influence on economic policy, while only large firms were required to provide their comite d’enterprises with economic information. This meant that almost two-thirds of the workers were excluded from exercising this oversight function.|$|E

This Mr. Hardy had intended to have had regularly thatched; but during his last visit to Rosario he had heard that the Indians frequently endeavored in their attacks to set fire to the roofs, and he therefore determined to use tiles. The carts had to make two journeys to Rosario to get sufficient tiles and lath.

40|$|In recent years, the {{importance}} of the environmental agenda for industry has been particularly rising and environmental innovations (EI) are increasingly at the center of policy maker action. Where extant literature has analyzed mainly external factors driving their adoption, in this paper we explore firm-level characteristics that lead to the development of EIs, using data from the community innovation survey (CIS) on Italian manufacturing firms, which, for the first time, address specifically EI. We further contribute to the literature by analyzing <b>firm’s</b> <b>level</b> patterns distinguishing between production-related and product-related EIs. The econometric estimations suggest that size is positively related to the introduction of any kind of EI. Firms exporting are not more likely to introduce EI, whereas foreign ownership is linked with a greater EI propensity. Our results suggest also that firms that perform R&D activities, acquire machineries or knowledge and carries out training {{are more likely to be}} green innovators but that such activities are substitutive. Finally, the analysis suggests that <b>firm’s</b> <b>level</b> characteristics are more important than industry specialization in explaining green innovation propensity and that <b>firm’s</b> <b>level</b> characteristics driving the greening vary consistently among EI types...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between two dimensions of <b>firm’s</b> <b>level</b> cultural intelligence (CQ) namely competitive CQ and structural CQ with five major supply chain issues, which include inventory issues, customer service issues, organisation issues, information/system issues and product flow issues. Data were collected among 60 manufacturers in three northern states of Malaysia via survey questionnaires. Results indicate significant and negative relationships between competitive CQ and customer service issues, inventory issues, information/system issues and product flow issues. The findings also indicate that structural CQ has a significant but negative relationship with customer service issues and organisational issues only. These findings indicate that <b>firm’s</b> <b>level</b> CQ is also important towards firm’s operations and {{the relationship between}} <b>firm’s</b> <b>level</b> cultural intelligence and supply chain issues which did not receive much attention before were also identified. This study provides empirical evidence on the impact of higher cultural intelligence in minimizing the supply chain issues. Managers should give more effort in enhancing cultural intelligence within their firms in order to maximize their supply chain performance. This study also fills the gap in the literature which previously concentrates more on individual cultural intelligence and its effect on firm’s performance. The directions for future research are then discussed...|$|R
