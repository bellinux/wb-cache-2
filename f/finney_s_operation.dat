40|$|Extensive {{analysis}} of flat-plate radiative panels operation using average hourly weather data for a maritime climate region was performed. The panels are integrated {{in the space}} ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. Their primary function is to prepare sufficient quantity of cold water, integrating radiative and convective cooling, that is collected in the cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. That cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime. By small modification during daytime, solar panels could be turned into collectors and used to produce the hot water that is collected in a separate tank. A simulation model for the parametric {{analysis of}} the system in summer operating conditions and influence of its components on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was developed. The model includes the control of the systems 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation,</b> which prevents water circulation in the periods without cooling/heating contributions.

The results were presented in the appropriate charts, where the influence of the main parameters on the system 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> was illustrated.

40|$|In this paper, the {{analysis}} of a flat-plate radiative panels operation, using average hourly weather data, was conducted. Radiative panels, with high-emittance surface cover, were integrated in the space-ventilation system with air-cooling {{by means of a}} cold-water coil. The panels should prepare a sufficient quantity of cold water that is collected in a cold-water tank during the nighttime operation. The collected cold water is used for cooling of the air during daytime.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze and improve the {{transient}} stability of an industrial {{combined heat and power}} (CHP) system in a high-tech science park in Taiwan. The CHP system installed two 161 [*]kV/ 161 [*]kV high-impendence transformers to connect with Taipower System (TPS) for both decreasing the short-circuit fault current and increasing the fault critical clearing time. The transient stabilities of three types of operation modes in CHP units, 3 G 1 S, 2 G 1 S, and 1 G 1 S, are analyzed. Under the 3 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> mode, the system frequency is immediately restored to 60 [*]Hz after tie line tripping with the TPS. Under the 1 G 1 S and 2 G 1 <b>S</b> <b>operation</b> modes, the system frequencies will continuously decrease and eventually become unstable. A novel transient stability improvement approach using load shedding technique based on the change in frequency is proposed to improve the transient stability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{implementation}} of adaptive pricing rules for a typical autonomous microgrid. The proposed rules aim at generating competitive prices based on monitoring the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions, thus maximising the profit from selling electricity to the utility grid throughout the microgrid 2 ̆ 7 s lifetime. A decision tree based linear programming and fuzzy system are developed to generate the proposed rules. Microgrid 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>operation</b> conditions such as electricity demand, generation price and amount of generation are considered in the generated pricing rules. To simulate the behaviour of electronic competition, we have implemented a Multi-Agent System (MAS) to represent the performance of two competitive sellers and one buyer under uniform and discriminatory pricing rules. As a case study, our proposed pricing rules are tested on the power grid of the Joondalup campus of Edith Cowan University in Western Australia. Simulation studies for 30 -minutes operation intervals for the developed virtual market pool with the adaptive microgird pricing strategies have recorded beneficiary sale prices with a reasonable number of electricity trade participations...|$|R
