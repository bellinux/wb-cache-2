5|$|A {{large part}} of the massif is covered by ice fields and is cut by {{numerous}} glaciers, mostly flowing northwestwards on the French side; southeastwards on the Italian side and eastwards on the Swiss side. With much steeper slopes on the Italian side, many glaciers drop very sharply and some, such as the Miage Glacier and the Brenva Glacier, are very heavily covered in rock debris. The massif is itself defined by broad valleys which formed along <b>fault</b> <b>lines</b> and which have subsequently been shaped by ice during the last glacial period of the ice age.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{shortcoming}} of single-phase ground <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> selection {{method in}} the resonant grounded system {{such as the}} uncertainty of its device by fast compensation with the automatic compensation equipment, an arc suppression and residual flow incremental method is proposed to effectively choose the earth <b>fault</b> <b>line.</b> Firstly, when the single-phase ground fault occurs, the arc suppression coil parameters are adjusted to realize compensation and arc suppression. Then the arc suppression coil inductance values are modulated to make the zero-sequence current of <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> changed, at the same time, the zero-sequence current value is detected and its change will be captured to select the <b>fault</b> <b>line.</b> The simulation experiments prove that the arc grounding over voltage damage can be effectively reduced by arc suppression coil full compensation and <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> can be effectively selected by arc suppression and residual flow increment method...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a fault {{location}} method using power quality monitoring data is proposed. The {{fault location}} {{is divided into}} two classes including <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> recognition and <b>fault</b> distance calculation. Along the each power line in the target network some fictitious fault points are set and the fault voltage of each monitoring bus is calculated. The voltage dip calculation results and the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> data are matched to form the learning samples and then train the designed <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> recognition BP artificial neural network. The trained neural network searches the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> when actual <b>fault</b> occurs. After it finishes <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> searching the <b>fault</b> position is calculated using the function of voltage dip amplitude and fault position. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed method is proved by the simulation results in standard IEEE- 14 bus system...|$|R

5000|$|After {{the news}} of the seepage, the dam came under further {{attention}} due to being situated on a <b>fault</b> <b>line.</b> The <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> was thought to be inactive, but in February 2007, a study by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers found evidence of at least one earthquake in the last 5,000 years, and therefore judged the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> as active. With the new information about the <b>fault</b> <b>line,</b> the study said the dam was not likely to be in danger.

5|$|It is {{possible}} that Tehama collapsed along a series of <b>fault</b> <b>lines</b> which criss-crossed it. The trigger for th{{is possible}} collapse {{may have been the}} release of the extensive amounts of lava that formed the dacite domes on its flank. More likely, the volcano weathered away; hot volcanic gases and steam turned hard rock into soft clay that were easily eroded by glacial action. Either way, the largest remnants of Tehama include Brokeoff Mountain, Mount Conard, Mount Diller, and Pilot Pinnacle. Andesites erupted again in the area starting approximately 300,000 years ago and dacite erupted in the area between 250,000 and 200,000 years ago and 100,000 years ago through the present.|$|E
5|$|The Eisenhower–Johnson Memorial Tunnel {{was known}} as the Straight Creek Tunnel during construction, named for the {{waterway}} that runs along the western approach to the tunnel. Before the tunnel was dedicated, it was renamed to honor Dwight D. Eisenhower and Edwin C. Johnson. Construction on the first bore of the tunnel was started on March 15, 1968. Construction efforts suffered many setbacks and the project went well over time and budget. One of the biggest setbacks was the discovery of <b>fault</b> <b>lines</b> {{in the path of the}} tunnel that were not discovered during the pilot bores. These faults began to slip during construction and emergency measures had to be taken to protect the tunnels and workers from cave-ins and collapses. Despite the best efforts of engineers, three workers were killed boring the first tube, and four in boring the second.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all aspects of}} the land that is now Scotland, including physical and human, between the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century from what are now the southern borders of the country, to the adoption of the major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Scotland was defined by its physical geography, with its long coastline of inlets, islands and inland lochs, high proportion of land over 60 metres above sea level and heavy rainfall. It is divided between the Highlands and Islands and Lowland regions, which were subdivided by geological features including <b>fault</b> <b>lines,</b> mountains, hills, bogs and marshes. This made communications by land problematic and raised difficulties for political unification, but also for invading armies.|$|E

30|$|The first signal transmission: {{the zone}} II {{distance}} {{protection of the}} <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> immediately startup, and the adjacent normal line zone II distance protection is blocked. When the fault occurs in the line, the substation zone II distance protection detects the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> and sends the judgement conclusion to the adjacent substation by the inner-substation protection channel: Send the information ‘the fault occurs in this line’ to the opposite station of the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> and sent the information ‘the fault occurs in the other line’ to the other adjacent substations. Only when the substation area protection judges the position of fault in the protection region of the zone-II distance protection and the received the ‘the fault occurs in this line’ information from adjacent substation, the line can be determined as the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> which can be cutoff by the zone II distance protection quickly. For example, when the fault occurs in the line L 3 in Fig.  5, the distance zone-II of the protection 5 and protection 6 on the both sides of L 3 will operate and receive the ‘fault occurs in this line’ information from the neighbor substation. Hence line L 3 is taken for the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> and can be cutoff fast. The distance protection 3 and 8 may also operate during the <b>fault</b> of <b>line</b> L 3 because of the setting method that ensures the sensitivity of terminal protection scope. However, the protection 3 and 8 will receive the information ‘the fault occurs in the other line’ from the opposite substation, the line L 2 and L 4 cannot be judged as <b>fault</b> <b>line.</b> Hence, the <b>fault</b> <b>line</b> can be effectively judged {{based on the information}} between the adjacent stations, which will ensure the fast operation speed and the selectivity of the zone II distance protection.|$|R

Kate Warner's father is forced to aid the terrorists by helping them smuggle the weapons with his customs passes. Jack finally kills Madsen when he tries to escape by shooting his speedboat with an M-80 assault rifle, causing it to explode. He also shoots and kills Max, the man behind the events of Season 2 and The Game, who was holding Kate Warner hostage, saving her life but in doing so Max manages to shoot Jack once in the stomach before dying. As a result, Chase Edmunds takes Jack to the hospital via helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the <b>fault</b> <b>lines</b> between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.|$|E
