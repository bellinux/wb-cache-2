5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, maroons came to live in the Great Dismal Swamp. Most settled on mesic islands, the <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> parts of the swamp. Inhabitants included slaves who had purchased their freedom as well as escaped slaves. Other escaped slaves used the swamp as a route on the Underground Railroad {{as they made their way}} further north. Some slaves lived there in semi-free conditions, but how much independence slaves actually enjoyed there has been a topic of much debate. Nearby whites often left enslaved maroons alone so long as they paid a quota in logs or shingles, and businesses may have ignored the fugitive nature of escaped slaves who provided work in exchange for trade goods.|$|E
25|$|When the SOJAHL {{folded in}} 1977, the Greys were left <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry.</b> They couldn't {{return to the}} Mid-Ontario Junior B league, {{as they had been}} {{replaced}} by another Owen Sound team which was called Owen Sound Grey-Bruce Salvage, popularly known as the Salvagemen.

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the day, all but one of her craft had been crippled, sunk or beached <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry.</b> As the one {{remaining}} assault craft made its way back to Prince David, a charging tank carrier forced her over an obstacle, which tore out her bottom and she sank at once. An outbound lighter ferried her crew back to Prince David. With wounded on board and unable to retrieve any of her landing craft, Prince David sailed to Southampton, ending her D-Day involvement. Both ships made four more reinforcement trips to Normandy, one on 18 June and three in July.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1970s, the Turlock Irrigation District has {{proposed}} damming the Clavey River, a free-flowing {{tributary of the}} Tuolumne, to produce hydroelectricity. The dam would have been 413 ft <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dried</b> {{up most of the}} lower Clavey, a popular whitewater run. In 1994 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission studied the project and determined that the benefits would not justify the financial and environmental costs.|$|R
25|$|The {{drainage}} {{system in the}} area was rearranged and steepened as the Waterpocket Fold was uplifted. Larger streams, such as the Fremont River, {{were more likely to}} keep up with the uplift by downcutting into the Waterpocket Fold faster. Other streams, such as Sand Creek, changed their course by flowing parallel to the fold and cutting into less resistant formations. Yet other streams tried {{to keep up with the}} uplift by carving slot canyons only to later change course, leaving their canyons literally <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry.</b> A total of 7,000feet (2,100m) of overlying Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediment has been removed by erosion in the area.|$|E
25|$|On 26 July 1897, the Advance was {{anchored}} in Botany Bay {{at the entrance}} to Cooks River, when a fierce squall drove her onto Lady Robinsons Beach. An inquiry into the stranding found that the port chain had parted and the other anchor had dragged. The wreck was sold by the insurance companies and repurchased by the former owner. The vessel was described to have been carried away up on the beach and left there <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry</b> by the receding tide. She was found so far away from water that it would be necessary to dig a channel especially for her to be launched by means of towing power.|$|E
25|$|The Ballard Locks {{carry more}} boat traffic {{than any other}} lock in the US, and the Locks, along with the fish ladder and the {{surrounding}} Carl S. English Jr. Botanical Gardens attract {{more than one million}} visitors annually, making it one of Seattle's top tourist attractions. The construction of the locks profoundly reshaped the topography of Seattle and the surrounding area, lowering the water level of Lake Washington and Lake Union by , adding miles of new waterfront land, reversing the flow of rivers, and leaving piers in the eastern half of Salmon Bay <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry.</b> The Locks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the American Society of Civil Engineers Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks.|$|E

50|$|Until {{the late}} 17th century, European {{settlers}} bypassed {{the area where}} Ocean View now lies because of the poor quality of its sandy, salty soil and the salt air that blew in from the Atlantic Ocean; they preferred to settle a few miles farther inland, where the land was <b>higher</b> <b>and</b> <b>drier</b> <b>and</b> the soil richer. Would-be settlers also faced a legal complication in obtaining land {{in what is now}} Ocean View, because Lord Baltimore claimed the area as part of his Maryland colony, while William Penn asserted that the area belonged to the Delaware Colony; settlers opted to look elsewhere for land to which they could receive clear title from an undisputed authority.|$|R
5|$|The {{slightly}} older Two Medicine Formation, home to H. stebingeri, was also populated by another well-known nesting hadrosaur, Maiasaura, {{as well as}} the troodontid Troodon, which is also known from nesting traces.

25|$|The levee {{also saw}} {{significant}} improvement during the 1850s. In {{the first half}} of the 19th century, a second channel developed in the Mississippi River at St. Louis. An island (nicknamed Bloody Island for the duels fought there) formed between the two channels, and a smaller island (Duncan's Island) developed below St. Louis. It was feared that the levee at St. Louis might be left <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry,</b> and federal assistance was sought and obtained with a grant of $50,000 in 1851. Using the engineering planning of Robert E. Lee, levees were constructed in 1852 and 1853 on the Illinois side to direct water toward Missouri and eliminate the second channel, joining Bloody Island to the land on the Illinois side and washing away Duncan's Island by 1855.|$|E
25|$|The {{caves in}} the Bahamas were formed {{during the last}} ice age. With much of the Earth's water held {{in the form of}} glacial ice, the sea level fell {{hundreds}} of feet, leaving most of the Bahama banks, which are now covered in water, <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry.</b> Rain falling on the most porous limestone slowly filtered down to sea level forming a lens where it contacted the denser salt water of the ocean permeating the spongy lime stone. The water at the interface was acidic enough to dissolve away the limestone and form the caves. Then, as more ice formed and the sea level dropped even further, the caves became dry and rainwater dripping through the ceiling over thousands of years created the incredible crystal forests of stalagmites which now decorate the caves. Finally, when the ice melted and the sea level rose, the caves were reclaimed by the sea.|$|E
500|$|Man-made sea {{defenses}} {{include a}} sea wall at Burnham-on-Sea and a [...] section south from Brean Down. There are also sand dune belts which are managed for their protective function {{and as a}} wildlife habitat. There are some concerns that the proposed Severn Barrage could leave some sites <b>high</b> <b>and</b> <b>dry,</b> and others permanently under water. The Steart Peninsula has flooded many times during the last millennium. The most severe recent floods occurred in 1981. By 1997, a combination of coastal erosion, sea level rise and wave action had made some of the defences distinctly fragile and at risk from failure. As a result, in 2002 The Environment Agency produced the Stolford to Combwich Coastal Defence Strategy Study to examine options for the future.|$|E
50|$|From the mid-4th century, new {{development}} at Venta halted. Houses fell into disrepair and the drainage system collapsed. The population concentrated {{itself in the}} <b>higher</b> <b>and</b> <b>drier</b> areas of the town. The defences were however strengthened and the cemeteries remained in use, notably with burials of males wearing so-called military-style mercenary belts. Historian David Nash Ford identifies the community as the Cair Guinntguic ("Fort Venta") listed by Nennius among the 28 cities of Britain in his History of the Britains.|$|R
