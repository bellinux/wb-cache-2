25|$|TOPS-20 (and {{possibly}} TENEX) used a 0 to 2 level {{tree that}} has similarities to a B-tree. A disk block was 512 36-bit words. If the file {{fit in a}} 512 (29) word block, then the <b>file</b> <b>directory</b> would point to that physical disk block. If the file fit in 218 words, then the directory would point to an aux index; the 512 words of that index would either be NULL (the block isn't allocated) or point to the physical address of the block. If the file fit in 227 words, then the directory would point to a block holding an aux-aux index; each entry would either be NULL or point to an aux index. Consequently, the physical disk block for a 227 word file could be located in two disk reads and read on the third.|$|E
