[...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily want to hear about. [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief."

This is based upon an expert system that dynamically updates the user interface design to reflect the developer’s decisions. This is implemented in terms of constraint propagation and search through the design space. An additional benefit is the ease of providing accessible user interfaces in conjunction with assistive technologies...|$|R

2500|$|Traffic {{congestion}} {{problems on the}} roadways, as with elsewhere in Southern California, {{is the result of}} the demand for driving exceeding the available capacity, especially on area freeways. Many of the existing freeways were completed in the late 1970s, with the exception of the segment of the Foothill Freeway, State Route 210 (SR 210) between San Dimas and San Bernardino completed in July 2007. New freeways or highways [...] "fix-ups" [...] are being planned, such as the expansion of the length of the 215 freeway around Inland Center Mall. However, other problems exist, one being the jobs vs. housing imbalance. The Inland Empire population grew as a result of affordable housing, at least relative to the rest of Southern California. But most of the higher paying jobs are located in Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange counties. Thus, many workers must drive daily from the Inland Empire to their jobs in these counties -sometimes up to two hours each direction, and even longer if by public transportation. As the population increases, the problem is most certainly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>worse.</b> Forbes magazine recently ranked the area first in its list of most unhealthy commutes in the United States, beating out every other metropolitan area in the country, as Inland area drivers breathe the unhealthiest air and have the highest rate of fatal auto accidents per capita.|$|E

Following the initial release of the flavor, Baldwin informed the media that [...] "thanks to Ben & Jerry's, the goodness of the Schweddy family recipe won't go with me to the great beyond," [...] as he had previously feared that his association with the SNL episode would remain permanent until his death.|$|R
40|$|Each {{year in the}} United States, tens of {{millions}} of children, disproportionately low-income, go without seeing a dentist. This lack of access to dental care is a complex problem fueled by a number of factors, with two different dentist shortages compounding the issue: An uneven distribution of dentists nationwide means many areas do not have an adequate supply of these practitioners. As a result, access to care is constrained for people in these communities regardless of income or insurance coverage. The relatively small number of dentists who participate in Medicaid means that many low-income people are not receiving dental care. National standards set by dental and pediatric organizations call for children to visit a dentist every six months. The federal government requires state Medicaid programs to enact their own standards after consulting with these organizations, but new data show that more than 14 million children enrolled in Medicaid did not receive any dental service in 2011. According to the most recent comparison, in 2010, privately insured children were almost 30 percent more likely to receive dental care than those who were publicly insured through Medicaid or other government programs, even though low-income children are almost twice as likely as their wealthier peers to develop cavities. 4 In 22 states, fewer than half of Medicaid-enrolled children received dental care in 2011. In 2012, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, {{secretary of health and human}} services under President George H. W. Bush, said, "In a nation obsessed with high-tech medicine, people are not getting preventive care for something as simple as tooth decay. " He pointed to the inadequate dental workforce as a driving factor, stating, "The shortage of dental care is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> only <b>worse.</b> " This issue brief examines the lack of access to dental care, especially for low-income children and families, in the United States. It also explores strategies states are employing [...] particularly expansion of the dental team by licensing additional types of providers [...] to address workforce shortages and better serve low-income children...|$|R
