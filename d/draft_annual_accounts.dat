40|$|Company {{accounts}} are at present drafted in an uneasy compromise between different objectives. It {{is not yet}} generally appreciated that no single figure or set of figures can sum up the whole financial state of an enterprise. The basic tools of financial management are short and long-run cash projections and the reports of actual flows which monitor these. The problem in <b>drafting</b> <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> {{so that they will}} help shareholders and others to make decisions is that financial reality requires a look into the future and this in turn calls for subjective judgement. But the more realistic are the accounts in this sense, the less susceptible are they to objective audit. Inflation adds a further level of distortion, but the effects of this can be brought out in a relatively simple way by making corrections based on movements in a general index of prices. Although there are considerable practical difficulties it seems likely that a more fundamental improvement would be the introduction of a 'current value' or modified 'replacement cost' approach to ordinary accounting in addition to (but not in place of) the general index inflation correction. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{introduction}} of Ias-Ifrs for italian small and medium size enterprises (SME’s) is very significant and quite complex. In fact, {{the small and}} medium size enterprises, in particular the not-listed companies, may choose between the Ias-based accounting rules and the civil code-based ones in making <b>annual</b> <b>accounts.</b> In case of voluntary adoption of Ias-Ifrs by SME’s some critical matters emerge: the transition to Ias-Ifrs seems to point out various advantages, but also some risks and problems; so, <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> will be certainly more comparables in the UE context; otherwise, due to double regulation in Italy – one Ias-based (for listed companies and for companies which can choose this approach), and the other, civil code-based – we’ll probably meet some difficulties in comprehension and comparison of <b>annual</b> <b>accounts.</b> The aim of the paper is to make evident, both by a theoretical and empirical point of view, the main differences, for small and medium size enterprises, between the <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> Ias-based and the <b>annual</b> <b>accounts</b> civil code-based; moreover, it aims to explain if these differences will really cause changes not only in accounting rules and policies, but also in cultural approach for companies, financial community and the whole accounting profession...|$|R
