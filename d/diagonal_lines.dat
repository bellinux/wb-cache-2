5|$|Horizontal frames often {{featured}} in Bacon's 1950s and 1960s paintings. The motif {{may have been}} borrowed from the sculptor Alberto Giacometti, who Bacon greatly admired and often corresponded with. Giacometti had employed the device in The Nose (1947) and The Cage (1950). Bacon's use of frames has suggested imprisonment to many commentators. Writing on their use in Fragment, Zweite mentions that the <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> transform the cross into a guillotine.|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over {{twice as long as}} high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|The club emblem {{features}} a football and a shamrock, {{and has done}} so {{throughout the history of}} the club. Minor alterations to the club badge have included changing the style of the shamrock and the width of the <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines.</b> In 2005, a star was added above the badge to signify the first 10 League of Ireland titles won by the club. After the takeover of the club by the supporters, black became the club's third official colour in recognition of the loss of Glenmalure Park. It was also decided that the number 12 would no longer be worn by any Shamrock Rovers player and instead would represent the club's supporters.|$|E

5|$|In {{line with}} Müller's advice, Jovanović avoided {{creating}} a sentimental work and focused instead on depicting characters and situations he observed {{during his time}} in the Balkans. This differentiates the painting from other Orientalist paintings of the day, which were based on travel accounts rather than first-hand experience. The art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson notes that the grouping of the figures and their interactions with one another are reminiscent of images of the lamentation over the body of Christ. The right half of the scene recedes into shadow while the brightly illuminated left, where the principal figures are located, appears to expand towards the viewer. Jovanović thus directs the viewer's eye from left to right, foreground to background, through the circular pattern of the groupings as well as the <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> of the peasants' swords. In line with Müller's teachings regarding light and colour, Jovanović adds touches of bright red to give warmth and movement to the scene, making it appear as though it is unfolding before the viewer. The brushwork is varied, ranging from the smooth broad strokes that define the solidity of the walls to quick short ones that make it appear like the figures are in motion.|$|E

One cone extends into the future (t>0), the other into the past (t<0).|$|E
25|$|Handbells can {{be played}} as a handbell tree where the handles are {{interlaced}} within each other, allowing multiple bells to be played with mallets to obtain an undamped sound. This performance technique was invented by Louise Frier in the 1980s. It was further developed by Barbara Brocker who developed a standardized bell layout. It is used by many soloists. The notational symbol used for Handbell Tree features a series of interlocking <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines,</b> one for each handbell. The pitch is placed at the lowest point of each diagonal line.|$|E

This was again altered in the mid-1960s to the familiar star shape against a black background and accompanied by a jingle featuring a cacophony of noises. This shape formed from a circle, with the <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> moving out and joining the circle and the horizontal and vertical lines being drawn last, with the name added last.|$|E

25|$|The {{ramping up}} of the pace had split the peloton into echelons on the road, {{with as many as}} five <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> of riders seconds apart from one another. World time trial {{champion}} Martin attacked his companions {{at the bottom of the}} final climb, and took Clarke with him, as the other three riders could not follow the higher pace. As it transpired, Clarke had the stronger finish, and ultimately took his first professional victory on the line. Bazayev finished third, while the peloton came in over a minute behind Clarke; Valverde lost almost a minute beyond that, and surrendered the overall lead to 's Joaquim Rodríguez, who held a one-second advantage over Flecha's team-mate Chris Froome. Clarke assumed the lead of both the points and mountains classifications.|$|E
25|$|Raking {{courses in}} monk bond may—for instance—be {{staggered}} {{in such a}} way as to generate the appearance of <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> of stretchers. One method of achieving this effect relies on the use of a repeating sequence of courses with back-and-forth header staggering. In this grouping, a header appears at a given point in the group's first course. In the next course up, a header is offset one and a half stretcher lengths to the left of the header in the course below, and then in the third course, a header is offset one stretcher length to the right of the header in the middle course. This accented swing of headers, one and a half to the left, and one to the right, generates the appearance of lines of stretchers running from the upper left hand side of the wall down to the lower right. Such an example of a raking monk bond layout is shown in the New Malden Library, Kingston upon Thames, Greater London.|$|E
500|$|The viewer's {{attention}} is first {{drawn to the}} centre of the canvas, then follows the directional flow of the survivors' bodies, viewed from behind and straining to the right.

[...] Two other <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> are used to heighten the dramatic tension. One follows the mast and its rigging and leads the viewer's eye towards an approaching wave that threatens to engulf the raft, while the second, composed of reaching figures, leads to the distant silhouette of the Argus, the ship that eventually rescued the survivors.|$|E

500|$|The shootout was one {{of several}} rule changes made in 2005 as the league {{attempted}} to increase offence following the lockout. [...] The two-line pass rule was eliminated, allowing teams to pass from their defensive zone to anywhere in the neutral zone. [...] Previously, such passes could only be made to their own half of the neutral zone. [...] The rule was intended to encourage long breakout passes and create more breakaways. [...] Teams that commit an icing infraction are no longer allowed to make a line change before a faceoff, and goaltenders are now prohibited from playing the puck in the end-zone corners behind the goal line. [...] They are allowed to play the puck directly behind the net, within the trapezoid marked by <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> from the goal line to the end boards.|$|E
500|$|The {{pavilion}} by Hadid, {{the first}} woman to win the Pritzker Prize, is a tensioned fabric shell fitted over a curving aluminum framework exceeding 7,000 pieces. [...] Although the frame is composed of 7,000 individually bent pieces, no two of which are alike, the shell is made up of a mere 24 custom-made panels of fabric. As expected it accommodates a centennial-themed, audio and video presentation on its interior fabric walls. Its opening was originally expected to be delayed until at least mid-July 2009. [...] The themed presentation that portrays Chicago’s transformation as a result of Burnham's plan is by London-based, Chicago-trained filmmaker Thomas Gray. It is accompanied by a multi-channel soundtrack created by Chicago's Lou Mallozzi of Experimental Sound Studio. The pavilion is described as resembling a [...] "futuristic camping tent". Hadid conceptualized how tension alters appearance as fabric is pulled taut or twisted, which resulted in the elliptical structure and its strategic light-availing gashes and pod-like openings for visitors to experience. The <b>diagonal</b> <b>lines</b> in the structure are a reflection of Burnham’s 1909 city plan, which envisioned a fanned grid of streets emanating diagonally from Chicago’s city center out into the suburbs.|$|E
