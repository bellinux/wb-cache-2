5|$|Braham and Walsh {{scrambled}} {{free of the}} Mosquito and {{hid behind}} a sand dune. As they did so the aircraft's fuel tanks exploded. The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet {{and for a moment}} they believed he was going to fire upon them. To their relief he waved and flew by. They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them. They had crash-landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly. The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them. They were captured and searched. The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber. It was not well received by his captors. Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun, fighting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German guards, finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow. The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee. Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near Esjberg.|$|E
25|$|When {{passing the}} forts, the fleet was to form two columns. The {{starboard}} column would fire on Fort St. Philip, while the port column would fire on Fort Jackson. They {{were not to}} stop and slug <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> forts, however, but to pass by as quickly as possible. Farragut hoped {{that the combination of}} darkness and smoke would obscure the aim of the gunners in the forts, and his vessels could pass by relatively unscathed.|$|E
25|$|This {{version of}} Superboy was later seen {{again during the}} events of Zero Hour. He was time-{{displaced}} in the 30th century where he saw various incarnations of The Legion of Super Heroes before being displaced again in present-day Smallville where he encountered a still young and inexperienced modern day clone Superboy(Kon-El). Thinking he was somehow in his own future he was confused to see another Superboy and fought him until coming to realize that something bigger was going on. After talking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> modern Superboy the Pocket Universe Superboy vanished back to his proper time and reality. This Superboy was later retconned {{to have been the}} Earth-One Superboy.|$|E

25|$|The {{proposal}} {{put forth}} by the two captains was to utilize ships with appropriate characteristics of size and speed, converting them into rams by strengthening their bows with strips of railroad iron. Their machinery was to be protected by internal bulkheads. They would be lightly armed, {{only one or two}} guns apiece according to the wishes of their captains, as they would not be expected to slug <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> armored gunboats then being built for the Union. Instead, they were to rely on ramming, to hit the slow enemy gunboats where they were most vulnerable. The captains would be selected by Montgomery and Townsend from among the experienced rivermen at New Orleans, and each captain would subsequently hire his own crew.|$|E
25|$|Fury {{was joined}} in 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship by Glenn Seton. While Fury had a {{frustrating}} {{first half of}} the championship, Seton would battle <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> BMW M3 of Richards for the title. The series came down to the last race at Sydney's Oran Park Raceway where Richards used the nimble M3 to defeat Seton and win his second ATCC in three years. With Fury finishing third in the championship, this saw Nissan sharing victory with BMW in the 1987 Australian Manufacturers' Championship. The final competitive race for the Peter Jackson Nissan DR30s came in the Group A support race for the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide where Fury again finished second behind the Ford Sierra RS500 of Dick Johnson.|$|E
500|$|Ebert and Roeper {{gave the}} film a [...] "two thumbs up" [...] rating, with Roger Ebert saying, [...] "I liked the action, I liked the absurdity, I liked the incongruous use and misuse of mutant powers, and I {{especially}} {{liked the way}} it introduces all of those political issues and lets them fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> special effects." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.com gave it a mixed review, noting that it was [...] "only half a mess", and that Ratner [...] "could have stuck a bit more closely to the 'Dark Phoenix' narrative than he did." [...] However, Zacharek did note that that third act captured some of the original story's [...] "majesty".|$|E

[...] "Songs For Women" [...] is a song where Ocean can't decide whether to rue or revel in his conflicted feelings about women. The song offers a self-effacing perspective, with a numbed, restrained delivery. Lyrically the track expresses a narrative where he tries to arrange an after-school meeting in his dad's empty house and brags about harmonizing to Otis, Isley and Marvin. He laments that his woman doesn't listen to him or his music: [...] "It's like she never heard of me." [...] In spite of the [...] "suave delivery and the song's inherent tunefulness", the object of Ocean's affection soon ditches his love songs in favor of those sung [...] "by real R big-shots (Drake included)".|$|E
500|$|Hard Target {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} on its initial release praising the film's action scenes but noting the poor story and Jean-Claude Van Damme's acting abilities. On the film review television show Siskel & Ebert, Roger Ebert stated that Hard Target is [...] "not very smart and it's not very original, {{but it is}} well made on a technical level. The stunts are impressive... as an action picture, it's well made, but it never becomes more than competent action and I just can't recommend it for that". Gene Siskel also gave the film a thumbs down on the show stating that [...] "John Woo is a good filmmaker... Van Damme is pretty wooden... You notice the style in the film because {{there is not much}} substance". Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Van Damme has still not broken the habit of his own blank-faced posturing, although Mr. Woo films him in the most aggrandizing style imaginable". In Variety, Emanuel Levy wrote that Hard Target was [...] "a briskly vigorous, occasionally brilliant actioner starring Jean-Claude Van Damme. However, hampered by a B-script with flat, standard characters, and subjected to repeated editing of the violent sequences to win an R rating, pic doesn't bear the unique vision on display in Woo's recent [...] "The Killer" [...] and [...] "Hard-Boiled." [...] Van Damme and the director's reputation should ensure initial commercial kick on the way to solid if not spectacular box office". Desson Thompson of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "When Van Damme isn't duking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> English language, scriptwriter Chuck Pfarrer is filling Henriksen's mouth with villainous pseudo-profundities. Even in a second-rate action picture like this, and despite Henriksen's commendable efforts, they're painful to listen to... Woo's creative presence is practically stifled. There are some flashes of his deliriously wild style—a slow-motion moment here, a well-chosen freeze-frame there. He also introduces American audiences to his taste for unique motorcycle stunts and very, very loud car explosions. But these Wooisms are disappointingly minimal". Lance Henriksen received a Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Emil Fouchon in the film. In 1997, Woo looked back on Hard Target stating that it was [...] "in some ways, quite a troublesome movie to make, but I'm rather happy with the way the action scenes turned out". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of [...] "B" [...] on an A+ to F scale.|$|E

[...] "That's led to some {{confusion}} in the press," [...] he explained in 1984, [...] "Some stories have me shooting <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Commies from a foxhole over in Frozen Chosin.

2500|$|The final {{campaign}} {{the division}} would {{take part in}} during World War II would be the Battle of Okinawa. The strategic importance of Okinawa was that it provided a fleet anchorage, troop staging areas, and airfields {{in close proximity to}} Japan. The division landed on 1 April 1945 as part of the III Amphibious Corps. Its initial mission was, fighting alongside the 6th Marine Division, to clear the northern half of the island – {{that they were able to}} do expeditiously. The Army's XXIV Corps met much stiffer resistance in the south, and on 1 May 1945 the Marine division was moved south where it relieved the Army's 27th Infantry Division. The division was in heavy fighting on Okinawa until 22 June 1945, when the island was declared secure. The 1st Marine Division slugged <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Japanese 32nd Army at such places as Dakeshi Ridge, Wana Ridge, [...] "Sugarloaf Hill" [...] and Shuri Castle. Fighting on Okinawa cost the division 1,655 killed in action.|$|E
2500|$|The Telegraph said, [...] "On {{the opening}} {{night of the}} UK leg of her world tour, US R superstar Rihanna was taking no prisoners. She kicked off with the homicidal pop-rock ballad Russian Roulette to screen imagery of burning naked mannequins and had shed most of her clothes by her second song, which saw her {{straddling}} the gun barrel of a life-size pink tank while a semi-naked, military dance troupe twirled their rifles. Sex, violence and pyrotechnics (including big-screen mushroom clouds to accompany the incendiary Fire Bomb) were the themes of the evening. [...] Rihanna has a set full of hits and each is delivered with maximum bang for the audience's bucks, with revealing costumes, salacious dance routines, eye-catching props and sci-fi screens. [...] Her young, predominantly female fans genuinely adore Rihanna, and were full-throated whenever {{given the chance to}} join in. Sex and violence might make for effective 21st-century blockbuster entertainment but the price has been a loss of innocence, charm and individuality." [...] BBC Radio 1 said, [...] "The 22-year-old star wore a floor-length black dress with red flashing lights on it to kick off the show at The O2 Arena, which began with last year's single, Russian Roulette. [...] Speaking afterwards most of the audience appeared impressed with the show. [...] The gig ended with the star's biggest hit to date, Umbrella, which managed to hold the number one spot for 10 weeks in 2007. The Daily Mirror said, [...] "Kicking off the Last Girl On Earth tour, where the running theme is Rihanna as the last human alive, she launches into a fiery Russian Roulette.
