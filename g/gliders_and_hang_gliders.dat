5000|$|The {{aircraft}} is {{made from}} sheet aluminum. Its 8.20 m span wing has an area of 11.4 m2 leading edge slots and flaps. The wing is supported by V-struts with jury struts. The standard engine available is the [...] Rotax 912UL four-stroke powerplant. The S-STOL can be de-rigged for storage and folding wings are a factory option. The aircraft can be fitted with wheels, skis and floats {{and can be used}} to tow <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Porepunkah Airfield [...] {{is located}} in the Buckland Valley [...] {{southwest}} of the township of Porepunkah, Victoria, Australia. It is home to general aviation, ultralight and weight shift aircraft, <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> occasionally <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2005 the GA fleet {{comprised}} 9,000 fixed-wing aircraft, 4,100 microlights, 1,300 helicopters, 1,800 airships/balloons, 2,500 <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> some 7,000 <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gertrude S. Rogallo (January 13, 1914 - January 28, 2008) {{was one of}} the co-inventors of the {{flexible}} wing. These wings are now known as Rogallo wings. She and her husband, Francis Rogallo, invented the wing and obtained two United States patents on different versions of it in the early 1950s. Rogallo wings are commonly used today in kites, <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> powered <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Francis Rogallo, Barry Palmer, John Dickenson, {{and others}} {{never made any}} money out of their innovations. Profit to {{manufacturers}} of <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> Rogallo-winged <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> came once organized <b>and</b> insured sporting events grew in popularity. Dickenson's adaptation and innovations eventually produced a foldable <b>hang</b> <b>glider</b> that dramatically reduced difficulty in control, storage, transport, assembly and repair. In addition, the flexible wing lends itself to design changes for possible improvements.|$|R
50|$|There are spas {{used for}} {{recreation}} in Vučkovec and around Sveti Martin na Muri, {{both in the}} northern part of the county and near the Mura. There are also more than 200 clubs for various sporting and recreational activities such as mountaineering, fishing, bowling, CB radio, parachuting and flying small aircraft, including unpowered <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> powered <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b> Hunting also attracts numerous hunters in low game and birds.|$|R
50|$|Hall's {{first solo}} flight was at age 15 in a <b>glider,</b> <b>and</b> he gained his {{aircraft}} pilot's licence {{at the age}} of 18. He is licensed in <b>gliders,</b> ultra-lights <b>and</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders,</b> <b>and</b> has had one parachute jump. He has more than 4,000 hours in various aircraft types, including over 700 in light aircraft and over 500 doing aerobatics. As these flights are often only 20-30 minutes, he has many more takeoffs and landings. Hall has over 300 hours in his airshow display aircraft, the Giles G-202.|$|R
5|$|There are an {{estimated}} 27,000 civil aircraft registered in the UK, 96percent of which are engaged in GA activities. In 2005 the GA fleet comprised 9,000 fixed-wing aircraft, 4,100 microlights, 1,300 helicopters, 1,800 airships/balloons, 2,500 <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> some 7,000 <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b> Estimates put the number of foreign-registered GA aircraft based in the UK at 900.|$|R
5000|$|Single-point hang was {{an ancient}} art fully {{demonstrated}} {{at least in}} Breslau in 1908 {{as well as the}} triangle control frame that would later be seen in NASA's John Worth's <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> powered <b>hang</b> <b>gliders.</b> Thomas Purcell <b>and</b> Mike Burns would use the triangle control frame. Much later Dickenson would do similarly as he fashioned an airframe to fit on the by-then standard four boom stiffened Rogallo airfoil. Dickenson's model made use of a single <b>hang</b> point <b>and</b> an A frame: He started with a framed Rogallo wing airfoil with a U-frame (later an A-frame control bar) to it; it was composed of a keel, leading edges, a cross-bar and a fixed control frame. Weight-shift (mass-shift) was also used to control the glider. The flexible wing - called [...] "Ski Wing" [...] - was first flown in public at the Grafton Jacaranda Festival in September 1963 by Rod Fuller while towed behind a motorboat.|$|R
5000|$|There is {{sometimes}} confusion about <b>gliders,</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> <b>and</b> paragliders. In particular, paragliders <b>and</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> are both foot-launched. The main {{differences between the}} types are: ...|$|R

2500|$|There can be {{confusion}} between <b>gliders,</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders,</b> <b>and</b> paragliders. Paragliders <b>and</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders</b> {{are both}} foot-launched <b>glider</b> aircraft <b>and</b> {{in both cases}} the pilot is suspended ("hangs") below the lift surface. [...] "Hang glider" [...] is the term for those where the airframe contains rigid structures, whereas the primary structure of paragliders is supple, consisting mainly of woven material.|$|R

50|$|Just like {{paragliders}} <b>and</b> <b>hang</b> <b>gliders,</b> Sailplanes use thermals {{to extend}} {{the time in the}} air. Air speed, glide ratio and flight distances are superior to the ones achieved by paragliders. Paragliders on the other hand are able to also facilitate thermals that are too small (because of the much larger turn radius) or too weak for gliding.|$|R
