50|$|These {{tools are}} {{primarily}} used to 'set' plugs into locking profiles (nipples) {{located in the}} tubing; however, the term 'running tool' refers to a <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> attached to the wireline toolstring {{that is used to}} 'run' another tool that is meant to be left downhole when the toolstring returns to surface. In general, a running tool is attached to a downhole 'locking tool' that locates and locks into the selected downhole profile (nipple). The 'locking tool', or 'lock' for short, can be attached via threaded connection {{to the top of a}} variety of different tools, including but not limited to, downhole chokes (flow rate restrictors sized according to a pre-determined calculation), one-way check valves (TKX style plugs), instrument hangers, and most commonly, tubing plugs. The lock is fitted onto the running tool and attached using shear pins made of brass or steel. When the target profile is reached the lock can be set by seating the lock into the profile using mechanical jars (spangs) until the locking keys have locked the lock into the profile, whereupon the operator usually 'pull tests' the lock to give an indication it is properly 'set', then shears off the shear pins with his mechanical or hydraulic jars to allow the 'toolstring' to return to surface. There are many different types of running tools, some are mechanically complex and able to be made 'selective' in order to pass through profiles in order to reach one of the same size but a different depth; some are relatively simple, such as an 'F' collarstop running tool, which is essentially a metal rod which fits inside the collarstop <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> which is pinned in place.|$|E

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyThe light well {{intervention}} for subsea wells using riserless method {{has been carried}} out extensively over the last 10 years to increase the oil and gas recovery from depleted wells. Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI) is a relatively new technology {{that can be used to}} replace the majority of the well interventions previously done from semisubmersible rigs. RLWI performs subsea well intervention without using a drilling riser package and a subsea BOP. Alternatively, the Well Control Package (WCP) will be installed on top of subsea Xmas Tree as a barrier replacing BOP and then downhole tools can be deployed into the subsea well utilizing wireline from intervention vessel. The RLWI method is expected to reduce the cost and time in performing well intervention compared to conventional method. But when it comes to lowering down the <b>downhole</b> <b>tool,</b> it has a major issue regarding the accuracy in determining the operational well depth for “in well” work. During RLWI operation in deep water, the environmental conditions will have much influence to the wireline part that is suspended in open water. It is found very difficult to measure part of the cable length that has been submerged into the well since it depends on the “deflection shape” of the cable after it get exposed to the varying sea current from surface to sea bottom. The environmental load from sea current acting along the cable length will be transformed into uplift force on the other end of the cable inside the well. The combination of vertical displacement in upward direction due to uplift force and in downward direction due to cable stretch will affect the accuracy of the well depth measurement and position control of the <b>downhole</b> <b>tool.</b> Depth accuracy is very crucial in performing work inside the well. This project will study the cable behavior under prevailing dynamic sea environment for RLWI wireline operation in North Sea and will present one approach to correct inaccuracy in determining the exact location of the <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> inside the well from marine perspective. The study case was taken from Aasta Hansteen field with 1300 meters water depth in particular. OrcaFlex software will be utilized to perform static and dynamic analysis of the wireline cable under sea current and wave effect. OrcaFlex was developed by Orcina to support a wide range of hydrodynamic and marine structural analysis, including modeling the cable under sea current. During the analysis, the wireline behavior under currents will be observed for different operational well depth cases. The analysis results obtained from OrcaFlex simulations are vertical displacements and forces acting upon the wireline. Then recommended measures are discussed in this thesis to maximize the accuracy during “in well” work with different types of <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> weight. In addition, this thesis will also discuss the latest technologies of light well intervention, such as well control equipments used nowadays in RLWI operations...|$|E

50|$|Slickline {{comes in}} {{different}} sizes and grades. The larger the size, and higher the grade, generally means the higher line tension can be pulled before the line snaps at the weakest spot and causes a costly 'fishing' job.

40|$|Fluid {{pressure}} {{is a crucial}} factor to tubular string strength and deformation in oil and gas wells, {{and it is the}} most difficult factor to deal with. When the string constrained by <b>downhole</b> <b>tools,</b> such as packers, action pattern of fluid on string is changed. Calculation methods of string stress and deformation given by engineering handbooks doesn’t distinguish these issues in detail. So mistakes are often made when these methods are used. Tangled concepts lead to large calculation error. In this paper, the influence of fluid pressure on string axial force and deformation, buoyancy treatment in packed condition, are discussed roundly both in vertical wells and directional wells. Practical calculating method of string axial force through the hook load is presented, and element buoyancy in different borehole trajectory is given. It is found that the traditional simplified buoyancy coefficient method, which is used to calculate string axial force and axial extension, can only be used in vertical wells with tubular string suspended freely, because in this condition buoyancy acts on the bottom of string. If the string is constrained by <b>downhole</b> <b>tools,</b> such as packer or anchor, buoyancy could not be treated as usual. In directional well the buoyancy not only changes string axial force but induces shear stress in string cross section. When calculating the influence of fluid on string, operation sequence and constraints from borehole and <b>downhole</b> <b>tools</b> should be considered comprehensively...|$|R
40|$|The basic {{functionality}} {{and performance of}} a new Schlumberger active wireline heave compensation system on the JOIDES Resolution was evaluated during the sea trial and a 3 -year period of the IODP Phase II operations. A suite of software programs was developed to enable real-time monitoring {{of the dynamics of}} logging tools, and assess the efficiency of wireline heave compensation during downhole operations. The evaluation of the system effectiveness was performed under normal logging conditions as well as during stationary tests. Logging data were analyzed for their overall quality and repeatability, and to assess the reliability of high-resolution data such as formation microscanner (FMS) electrical images. This revealed that the system reduces 65 – 80 % of displacement or 88 – 98 % variance of <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> motion in stationary mode under heave conditions of ± 0. 2 – 1. 5 m and water depths of 300 – 4, 500 m in open holes. Under similar water/heave conditions, the compensator system reduces tool displacement by 50 – 60 %, or 75 – 84 % variance in <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> motion during normal logging operations. Such compensation efficiency (CE) is comparable to previous compensation systems, but using advanced and upgradeable technologies, and provides 50 – 85 % heave motion and heave variance attenuation. Moreover, logging down/up at low speeds (300 – 600 m/h) reduces the system’s CE values by 15 – 20 %, and logging down at higher speeds (1, 000 – 1, 200 m/h) eliminates CE values by 55 – 65 %. Considering the high quality of the logging data collected, it is concluded that the new system can provide an improved level of compensation over previous systems. Also, if practically feasible, future integration of downhole cable dynamics as an input feedback into the current system could further improve its compensation efficiency during logging operations...|$|E

To this end, the new sensor is based on the use of unpolarizable Pb/PbCl 2 electrodes either at the surface or downhole. In situ testing has demonstrated a capacity to identify several subsurface sources of natural electrical potential such as diffusion ones (membrane potential in the presence of clays, Fickian processes due to pore fluid salinity gradients), or else the electrokinetic mechanisms with gradients in pore fluid pressure.

30|$|The {{discarding}} of some measurements resulted {{mainly for}} three reasons. The {{first one was}} highly damaged rock in the borehole. We skipped sites of heavily damaged rock because it is disastrous if the <b>downhole</b> <b>tool</b> is trapped in the borehole. The second reason was a too enlarged borehole diameter. In some cases, {{it was impossible to}} measure the borehole deformation, because its diameter became larger than the maximum focus distance of the laser displacement sensor. This is probably due to the combined effect of the drilling technique and the rock properties. The final reason was muddy water in the borehole—caused by borehole-wall rock dust in the water. The laser beam of the laser sensor cannot be transmitted in very muddy water. Consequently, we analyzed data from 7 sites. Table 1 summarizes the locations of the measurements, the measurement depths at each location, and the reasons for unsuccessful measurements.|$|E

50|$|Hydraulic jars for {{slickline}} {{are generally}} meant to jar up only, because not enough sinker bar {{is able to}} feasibly be lubricated in to jar down on the <b>downhole</b> <b>tools.</b> Hydraulic jars work by the operator pulling up on the line, which puts an upward force {{on the top of}} the hydraulic jars. The bottom of the hydraulic jars is usually attached by threaded connection to the mechanical jars, which are attached to the <b>downhole</b> <b>tools.</b> Depending on how hard the operator pulls on the hydraulic jars will affect how fast they hit, and how hard they hit. When the top is pulled on, the inner mandrel begins to slide upwards. It has a restriction in it that hydraulic fluid has to bypass as it is pulled upwards, until it reaches an area of no restriction, allowing it to slide rapidly. The reason for the initial tighter restriction is to allow the operator to pull his line to the desired hitting range.|$|R
