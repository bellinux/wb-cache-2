5|$|As {{in other}} disciplines, the initial {{emphasis}} of feminist economists was to critique the established theory, methodology, and policy approaches. The critique began in microeconomics {{of the household}} and labor markets and spread to macroeconomics and international trade, ultimately extending to all areas of traditional <b>economic</b> <b>analysis.</b> Feminist economists pushed for and produced gender aware theory and analysis, broadened the focus on economics and sought pluralism of methodology and research methods.|$|E
5|$|Several {{key areas}} have been {{targeted}} for <b>economic</b> <b>analysis</b> and reform: the environmental effects of unconstrained economic growth; the consequences of nature being treated as an economic externality; {{and the possibility of}} an economics that takes greater account of the social and environmental consequences of market behavior.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II and {{the large}} {{adjustment}} as the economy adjusted from wartime to peacetime in 1945, the collection of many economic indicators, such as unemployment and GDP, became standardized. Recessions after World War II may be compared to each other much more easily than previous recessions because of these available data. The listed dates and durations are from the official chronology of the National Bureau of Economic Research. GDP data are from the Bureau of <b>Economic</b> <b>Analysis,</b> unemployment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (after 1948). Note that the unemployment rate often reaches a peak associated with a recession after the recession has officially ended.|$|E

When Socialist Action founded a campaign group, the Anti-Racist Alliance, Livingstone came to be closely associated with it.

5|$|This {{method of}} <b>economic</b> <b>analysis</b> seeks to {{overcome}} gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E

The Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of <b>Economic</b> <b>Analysis</b> (BEA) Economic Area, which includes the Montana Counties of Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government and social services, education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula's fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana's only LevelII Trauma center) and the Community Medical Center already the city's second and third largest employers behind the university. 55% of employment in Missoula {{is made up of}} the service and retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.|$|E

5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to <b>economic</b> <b>analysis.</b> Their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus, for which the maximum–operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in cooperative game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, Hervé Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in public–works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water distribution system of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E
5|$|The Ministry of Transport and Communications {{started an}} {{evaluation}} of the Ringerike Line, carried out by the National Rail Administration, in 2006. The first edition was completed in 2009, but was found to be insufficient, resulting in the process being restarted. A new report was published in June 2011. In September 2012, the ministry concluded that also the second report was insufficient {{and that it would be}} discarded. There were two main concerns with the report. Firstly, it was based on a single-track line which would not be built to the standards of high-speed rail. The ministry stated that all new railway plans in Norway were to have double track and be optimized for high-speed rail. Secondly, the report had a simplified <b>economic</b> <b>analysis</b> which was not sufficient to be used for political evaluation. The result of the discard was that the planning of E16 was no longer tied to the planning of the railway.|$|E

40|$|<b>Economic</b> systems <b>{{analysis}}</b> is {{a systems}} analysis technique of setting out {{the factors that}} have {{to be taken into account}} in making economic systems decisions. The inquiring and operational systems of the technique are almost exclusively designed for well-structured systems. In review of <b>economic</b> systems <b>analysis</b> against systems thinking, there is a growing tendency to discard the analytical approach as inappropriate for dealing with an ill-structured issue. Therefore, <b>economic</b> systems <b>analysis</b> needs both the inquiring and operational systems which are appropriate for ill-structured systems. The foregoing leads to the introduction of an extensive methodology. Mainly, the weakness of <b>economic</b> systems <b>analysis</b> methodology can be traced to the philosophical paradigm upon which the technique is based. In this study, four main aspects of both the inquiring and operational systems of <b>economic</b> systems <b>analysis</b> are being explored: (1) A new philosophical paradigm is proposed as the foundation of general methodology in place of the traditional Newtonian-Kantian inquiring system. (2) The new philosophical paradigm needs new problem formulation and analysis space; therefore, a multidimensional, synergetic, and autopoietic model is proposed for systems synthesis and systems analysis. (3) The new philosophical paradigm is characterized as a Singerian inquiry, and as a result, Marglin 2 ̆ 7 s multiobjective analysis is replaced by a Singerian multiobjective analysis. (4) Markov communication theory and fuzzy sets theory are proposed as tools for handling complexity. Markov communication theory and fuzzy sets theory are introduced for systems design and multiple objective analysis. This study reports on the first application of a Singerian fuzzy multiobjective mathematical algorithm in <b>economic</b> systems <b>analysis,</b> concluding that fuzzy systems theory, especially Markov communication theory, can realize approximate reasoning in <b>economic</b> systems <b>analysis.</b> Fuzzy modeling offers a deeper understanding of complexity and a means of expressing the insights that result from that understanding; moreover, it provides a means of incorporating subjectivity and adaptation. Therefore, fuzzy modeling increases the validity of the systems approach for dealing with ill-structured systems. The proposed method represents an important theoretical improvement of Marglin 2 ̆ 7 s approach. The results, however, also hold practical importance, for they are of practical interest to systems analysts who would improve systems design and multiobjective analysis...|$|R
