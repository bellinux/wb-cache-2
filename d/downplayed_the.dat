5|$|His {{father was}} {{released}} after three months, on 28 May 1824, but the family's financial situation remained poor and Dickens had {{to continue working}} at the factory, something for which he reportedly never forgave his mother. Years later Dickens wrote about the Marshalsea and other debtors' prisons in The Pickwick Papers (1836–1837), David Copperfield (1849–1850), and most extensively in Little Dorrit (1855–1857), whose main character, Amy, is born in the Marshalsea. Trey Philpotts writes that every detail about the Marshalsea in Little Dorrit reflects the real prison of the 1820s. According to Philpotts, Dickens rarely made mistakes and did not exaggerate; if anything, he <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> licentiousness of Marshalsea life, perhaps to protect Victorian sensibilities.|$|E
5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E
5|$|Screenwriter Andrew Davies {{said he was}} {{attracted}} to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica; he compared it to Pride and Prejudice—for which he wrote the BBC screenplay—"with dirty bits".

When news releases told of the BBC featuring swearing and sex toys, the Daily Mail reported that viewers began to protest. BBC representatives <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> gratuitousness of the story, comparing it to Moll Flanders.|$|E

5|$|The 2012 {{season was}} preceded by three test {{sessions}}; one at Jerez de la Frontera and two in Barcelona. These sessions gave the teams and drivers the opportunity to familiarise themselves with their cars, though the teams <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> accuracy of testing times as being representative of the running order for the season. At the second test in Barcelona, Lotus F1 discovered a critical fault in the build of their chassis that forced them to miss four days of running, while both HRT and Marussia were unable to complete any mileage with their 2012 cars after both the HRT F112 and Marussia MR01 failed their crash tests, though both teams were able to complete shakedowns of their cars.|$|E
5|$|The committee's {{investigation}} {{lasted from}} May 1911 to April 1912. At its conclusion, the committee split along party lines. Stanley authored the majority report which condemned alleged price fixing by U.S. Steel and censured President Theodore Roosevelt {{for his role}} in U.S. Steel's purchase of the Tennessee Coal and Iron Company. The minority report, authored by Republican Augustus P. Gardner, absolved Roosevelt and <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> price fixing charges. Stanley's report also recommended a number of changes to strengthen the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Though his recommendations were not enacted into law during his time in the House, many of them were eventually included in the Clayton Antitrust Act.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{these changes}} the {{highlands}} remained very poor and traditional, with few {{connections to the}} uplift of the Scottish Enlightenment and little role in the Industrial Revolution. A handful of powerful families, typified by the dukes of Argyll, Atholl, Buccleuch, and Sutherland, owned the best lands and controlled local political, legal and economic affairs. As late as 1878, 68 families owned nearly half the land in Scotland. Particularly {{after the end of}} the boom created by the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (1790–1815), these landlords needed cash to maintain their position in London society, and had less need of soldiers. They turned to money rents, displaced farmers to raise sheep, and <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> traditional patriarchal relationship that had historically sustained the clans. This was exacerbated after the repeal of the Corn Laws in mid-century, when Britain adopted a free trade policy, and grain imports from America undermined the profitability of crop production.|$|E

5|$|Despite this, and at Godley's urging, {{a further}} attack was planned for 12 October, this time using the New Zealand Division and the Australian 3rd Division. By now {{the ground was}} a sea of mud {{and a lack of}} {{preparation}} on the part of Godley's corps headquarters hampered the preliminary movements of the attacking divisions and supporting artillery. Godley's plans for the attack were overly ambitious and beyond the scale of previous operations that had been mounted earlier in the month in better weather and ground conditions and with more time to prepare. The operation on 12 October proved to be a failure with limited gains and heavy losses in the attacking divisions. After the battle, Godley <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> losses in the New Zealand Division (which amounted to around 2,900 casualties) and overstated the gains made in official correspondence to Allen, and a friend, Clive Wigram, who was the assistant private secretary to King George V.|$|E
5|$|Nepartak {{originated}} {{in a region}} of strong thunderstorm activity, associated with a broad trough of low surface pressure, which was situated around 640km (400mi) southeast of Guam by 0000 UTC on November 11. With weak wind shear and modest divergence of air over the system, it began to mature, although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next several hours, a low-level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it, prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook. At 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands. The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC, and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12. The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines.|$|E
5|$|On November 14, 2001, in The New York Times 150th anniversary issue, former {{executive}} editor Max Frankel wrote that {{before and during}} World War II, the NY Times had maintained a consistent policy to minimize reports on the Holocaust in their news pages. Laurel Leff, associate professor of journalism at Northeastern University, concluded that the newspaper had <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> Third Reich targeting of Jews for genocide. Her 2005 book Buried by the Times documents the paper's tendency before, during and after World War II to place deep inside its daily editions the news stories about the ongoing persecution and extermination of Jews, while obscuring in those stories the special impact of the Nazis' crimes on Jews in particular. Leff attributes this dearth {{in part to the}} complex personal and political views of the newspaper's Jewish publisher, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, concerning Jewishness, antisemitism, and Zionism.|$|E

5|$|VR {{has given}} mixed {{statements}} about the fault-sensitivity of the train. Pentti Kuokkanen, project coordinator of VR Engineering <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> problems when questioned about the reliability of another Fiat Ferroviaria multiple unit, the Sm4, in 1999. According to him, the Pendolino had been VR's most reliable passenger train during winter 1998–1999. In 2006, VR's CEO Henri Kuitunen affirmed that the Pendolino was causing serious image problems to VR Group. In 2010, the company's head of traffic control Mauno Haapala stated that the Sm3 was not more fault-sensitive than their other trains. However during winter 2011, VR Group's head of service and production department Pertti Saarela gave a totally different answer, saying that Pendolinos {{are more prone to}} failures especially during winter. It is impossible to know if the train has more problems than VR's other rolling stock, as the company does not give out punctuality statistics for specific train types.|$|E
5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} February 2011, Al-Wasat and al-Jamri covered {{both sides of}} the conflict. Al-Jamri was involved in reconciliation talks until 15 March when Saudi troops entered Bahrain. That day, Al-Wasat printing facility was destroyed. Its employees which already faced harassment by groups of youths had to work from home. The next month, the newspaper was charged by government to publishing fabricated news about the uprising and was suspended. Al-Jamri acknowledged his mistake, but said he was set up and <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> impact of the false news. He resigned from his position and the newspaper was allowed to publish the next day. He was subsequently charged and convicted of publishing false news. In August, Al-Wasat board of directors reinstated him back to his position.|$|E

As with the other accredited journalists, he was paid by the War Office rather than by his newspaper {{and they were all}} assured that {{they would be able to}} publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist. Beach Thomas filed reports from places such as the Somme in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly <b>downplayed</b> <b>the</b> unpleasant aspects of the conflict such as the nature of death.
