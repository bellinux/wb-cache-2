40|$|The {{necessity}} to certify one's identity for different purposes {{and the evolution}} of mobile technologies have led to the generation of electronic devices such as smart cards, and <b>electronic</b> <b>identities</b> designed to meet daily needs. Nevertheless, these mechanisms have a problem: they don't allow the user to set the scope of the information presented. That problem introduces interesting security and privacy challenges and requires {{the development of a new}} tool that supports user-centrity for the information being handled. This article presents eIDeCert, a tool for the management of <b>electronic</b> <b>identities</b> (eIDs) in a mobile environment with a user-centric approach. Taking advantage of existing eCert technology we will be able to solve a real problem. On the other hand, the application takes us to the boundary of what the technology can cope with: we will assess how close we are to the boundary, and we will present an idea of what the next step should be to enable us to reach the goal...|$|R

The core system has already been running on the German identity card since 2010. We analyze an extension proposed by Bundesdruckerei that enables the protocol to authenticate further transaction data such as phone numbers or PGP keys. In particular we prove cryptographically that the extension provides strong authenticity guarantees. We also discuss privacy aspects of the solution, preventing the card and the service provider of the eIDAS system to learn the actual transaction data...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In the {{networked}} economy, strategic {{partnerships and}} collaboration {{are an important}} way to develop and maintain competitive advantages. At the same time, enterprises also need to reduce costs, increase revenues and seize new business opportunities. This demands enterprises to enable convenient and secure business interactions with internal and external stakeholders, and create relationships to trust the <b>electronic</b> <b>identities</b> to access critical information resources. Federated identity management (FIM) {{is a system that}} enables individuals to use the same credentials or identification data to obtain access to the networks of multiple enterprises to conduct business transactions. FIM has demonstrated huge potential in providing reliable and scalable solutions to problems in systems security and access management. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is the dominant web services standard for FIM. The objective of the paper is to presen...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Payment {{applications}} inside {{social media}} dealing with privacy and security sensitive content require, besides {{trust in the}} involved parts like financial institutions and providers of <b>electronic</b> <b>identities,</b> in particular {{the trust of the}} users. The e-Me project focuses on this trust and aims at providing multimodal, adaptive authentication and autho-rization methods for social media that are usable for all users. In an integrated social-payment application connected to online banking, an OpenID provider has been developed by means of inclusive-identity management methods. The provider is used for both the social-media access control and the embedded payment service. This work describes the design decisions and eventual design made for the prototypes with considerations concerning both e-inclusion and information security and privacy.

40|$|Computer‐mediated {{communication}} {{is a phenomenon}} of post‐industrial society. As {{a consequence of the}} interactivity and persistent textual nature of this form of communication, new spaces of sociality are constructed which can be analysed and interpreted with the epistemologies and methodologies utilised in understanding more conventional places. This approach reveals that electronic spaces are constructions firmly tied to the cultural and social experiences of ‘real‐world’ existences. <b>Electronic</b> <b>identities,</b> then, are built from this wide base of experience and ‘real‐world’ identity rather than, as is sometimes claimed, begun afresh. These connections to understood material culture and the prevalence of the typed word in electronic spaces permits a digital archaeology, inspired by material culture studies, which is both revealing of the users of these spaces as well as the wider social constructions of post‐industrial society...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{electronic}} documents is constantly growing {{and the necessity}} to implement an ad-hoc eCertificate which manages access to private information is not only required but also necessary. This paper presents a protocol {{for the management of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>identities</b> (eIDs), meant as a substitute for the paper-based IDs, in a mobile environment with a user-centric approach. Mobile devices have been chosen because they provide mobility, personal use and high computational complexity. The inherent user-centricity also allows the user to personally manage the ID information and to display only what is required. The chosen path to develop the protocol is to migrate the existing eCert technologies implemented by the Learning Societies Laboratory in Southampton. By comparing this protocol with the analysis of the eID problem domain, a new solution has been derived which is compatible with both systems without loss of features. © 2011 WorldCIS...|$|R
