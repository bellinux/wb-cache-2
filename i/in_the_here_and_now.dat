25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> We are called to love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E
25|$|In Terry Hands' 1977 {{production}} for the Royal Shakespeare Company, Margaret (played by Helen Mirren) {{tried to bring}} Henry {{back from the brink}} of madness by engaging his mind in an elaborate, difficult to follow verbal dance. Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he wants to look into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E

500|$|In {{a session}} of psychodrama, one client {{of the group}} becomes the protagonist, and focuses on a particular, personal, emotionally {{problematic}} situation to enact on stage. A variety of scenes may be enacted, depicting, for example, memories of specific happenings in the client's past, unfinished situations, inner dramas, fantasies, dreams, preparations for future risk-taking situations, or unrehearsed expressions of mental states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now.</b> [...] These scenes either approximate real-life situations or are externalizations of inner mental processes.

500|$|Ursula Franklin {{explains}} in {{a prelude to}} her 2006 collection of papers, interviews and talks that her lifelong interest in structures, in what she terms [...] "the arrangement and interplay of the parts within a whole," [...] {{has been at the}} root of most of her activities. Looking back after almost 40 years, she adds, [...] "I can see how I have tried to wrestle with just one fundamental question: 'How can one live and work as a pacifist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now</b> and help to structure a society in which oppression, violence, and wars would diminish and co-operation, equality, and justice would rise?'" [...] As part of the answer, Franklin turns to the metaphor of mapmaking to explain her intellectual journey. [...] "Increasingly I found the maps of conventional wisdom inadequate for my travels," [...] she writes. [...] "I became unwilling and unable to orient my life according to national maps depicting the realms of 'them' and 'us,' of good guys and bad guys, of winning, defeating, and being defeated; in short, all those maps drawn up for travel towards private gain and personal advancement." [...] Franklin concludes that she has been guided in understanding what she calls [...] "the real world" [...] by [...] "the maps of pacifism and feminism".|$|E

50|$|The SDS {{suffered}} {{the difficulty of}} wanting {{to change the world}} while 'freeing life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now.' This caused confusion between short-term and long-term goals. The sudden growth due to the successful rallies against the Vietnam War meant there were more people wanting action to end the Vietnam war, whereas the original New Left had wanted to focus on critical reflection. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, it was the anti-war sentiment that dominated the SDS.|$|R

2500|$|Others {{also think}} that maybe the two humans are symbols of {{misplaced}} asceticism - perhaps as much [...] "conceptual and imaginative" [...] as [...] "actual denial of the flesh." [...] It {{is quite possible that}} Blake is criticizing the New Testament view of a life of self-denial: the stinting of earthly desires in order to gain entrance to an after-life of bliss.

[...] Essentially, he believed that a good landscape architect should look to the future in order to design sustainable landscapes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> and that landscape architects should speak openly against the destruction of natural landscapes, {{to make sure that they}} would be available for future generations to enjoy.|$|E

5000|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1980s the Muslim Brotherhood cleric Abdullah Azzam, {{sometimes}} called [...] "the {{father of the}} modern global jihad", opened the possibility of successfully waging jihad against unbelievers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now.Azzam issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, declaring it an individual obligation for all able bodied Muslims {{because it was a}} defensive jihad to repel invaders.

2500|$|Klee {{suffered}} from a wasting disease, scleroderma, {{toward the end of}} his life, enduring pain that seems to be reflected in his last works of art. One of his last paintings, Death and Fire, features a skull in the center with the German word for death, [...] "Tod", appearing in the face. He died in Muralto, Locarno, Switzerland, on 29 June 1940 without having obtained Swiss citizenship, despite his birth in that country. His art work was considered too revolutionary, even degenerate, by the Swiss authorities, but eventually they accepted his request six days after his death. His legacy comprises about 9,000 works of art. The words on his tombstone, Klee's credo, placed there by his son Felix, say, [...] "I cannot be grasped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> For my dwelling place is as much among the dead, As the yet unborn, Slightly closer to the heart of creation than usual, But still not close enough." [...] He was buried at Schosshaldenfriedhof, Bern, Switzerland.|$|E
2500|$|Modern humanists, such as Corliss Lamont or Carl Sagan, {{hold that}} {{humanity}} must seek for truth through reason {{and the best}} observable evidence and endorse scientific skepticism and the scientific method. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong {{must be based on}} the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human. The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole. [...] The focus is on doing good and living well <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> and leaving {{the world a better place}} for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned: [...] "The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".|$|E
2500|$|After Maudgalyāyana's death, {{people asked}} why Maudgalyāyana had not {{protected}} himself, and why a great enlightened monk would suffer such a death. The Buddha {{said that because}} Maudgalyāyana had contracted such karma in a previous life (the murder of one's own parents {{is one of the}} five heinous acts that reap the worst karma), so he could not avoid reaping the consequences. He therefore accepted the results. Further, the Buddha stated that even psychic powers will be of no use in avoiding karma, especially when it is serious karma. Shortly after having left Maudgalyāyana for dead, the bandits were all executed. Professor of Religion James McDermott therefore concludes that there must have been [...] "a confluence" [...] of karma between Maudgalyāyana and the bandits, and cites the killing as evidence that in Buddhism the karma of different individuals can interact. Richard Gombrich raises the example of the murder to prove another point: he points out that Maudgalyāyana was able to attain enlightenment, despite his heavy karma from a past life. This, he says, shows that the Buddha taught everyone can attain enlightenment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>now,</b> rather than enlightenment necessarily being a gradual process built up through many lifetimes.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{that same}} year, Worley signed with country singer Neal McCoy's vanity label 903 Music. His first release for 903 was [...] "Nothin' but a Love Thang", which peaked at No. 35.

2500|$|Another British fantasy writer, Neil Gaiman, {{claimed that}} [...] "Garner's fiction is {{something}} special" [...] {{in that it}} was [...] "smart <b>and</b> challenging, based <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> now, <b>in</b> which real English places emerged from the shadows of folklore, and in which people found themselves walking, living and battling their way through the dreams and patterns of myth."

5000|$|... "Maiden Quest" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Les Chappell from The A.V.

Instead, it's a middling episode of Grimm that manages to deliver a serviceable weekly case, but it's without the almost mythological component that's made prior cases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same vein so engaging. And surrounding it are only a few narrative bread crumbs, promising some interesting story lines down the road but failing to introduce enough to make it interesting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now." ...|$|R

5000|$|Economic secession {{has been}} {{variously}} defined by sources. In its narrowest sense, it is abstention from the state's economic system - for instance by replacing {{the use of}} government money with barter, Local Exchange Trading Systems, or commodity money (such as gold). As such [...] "anarchists can often be found advocating for mass refusal and the withdrawal of our participation-sometimes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of general strikes; sometimes as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of <b>the</b> illegalists, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forms of direct expropriations - with the support and participation of social movements or not; sometimes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forms of occupations and the taking of space; and still other times in advocating for creating alternatives to capitalist relations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>here</b> <b>and</b> now; and so on." ...|$|R
