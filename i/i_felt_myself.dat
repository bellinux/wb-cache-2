2500|$|Lulu Terrio-Cameron died {{of breast}} cancer in April 1996. [...] "We had 16 years of blissful happiness," [...] Cameron told a {{journalist}} adding [...] "it was the kind of marriage that every day <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> filled with wonder that I had such a person to share my life with. Every day I said a little prayer of thanks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hooker's [...] "blood boiled, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> a dastard; now I saw my advantage–I {{swore to}} myself I would smite that Amalekite Sam hip and thigh", (he was invited {{up to the}} {{platform}} and) [...] "there and then I smacked him amid rounds of applause... proceeded to demonstrate... that he could never have read your book... {{wound up with a}} very few observations on the...old and new hypotheses... Sam was shut up... and the meeting was dissolved forthwith leaving you [...] master of the field after 4 hours battle." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 7, 1955, Anderson {{became the}} first African-American to perform with the Metropolitan Opera in New York. On that occasion, she sang the part of Ulrica in Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (opposite Zinka Milanov, then Herva Nelli, as Amelia) at the {{invitation}} of director Rudolf Bing. Anderson said later about the evening, [...] "The curtain rose on the second scene and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> tightening into a knot." [...] Although she never appeared with the company again after this production, Anderson was named a permanent member of the Metropolitan Opera company. The following year she published her autobiography, My Lord, What a Morning, which became a bestseller.|$|E
60|$|The {{objection}} struck me, all {{the more}} forcibly that it reflected an objection which <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>myself.</b>|$|R
60|$|When {{from my body}} I {{was free}} <b>I</b> {{straightway}} <b>felt</b> <b>myself,</b> ah me! Sink downward to the life to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't say that, Tom. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>myself</b> so {{much that}} I am sure I could not wish my worst enemy to go through such a thing." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 'And yet,' <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{constrained}} to say, as I {{listened to}} these strange products of a Counter-reformation psychosis working upon a late medieval art form, 'and yet {{it does not}} matter that he's all in bits. The whole is disorganized. But each individual fragment is in order, is a representative of a Higher Order. The Highest Order prevails even in the disintegration. The totality is present even in the broken pieces. More clearly present, perhaps, than in a completely coherent work. At least you aren't lulled into a sense of false security by some merely human, merely fabricated order. You have to rely on your immediate perception of the ultimate order. So in a certain sense disintegration may have its advantages. But of course it's dangerous, horribly dangerous. Suppose you couldn't get back, out of the chaos...' ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
6000|$|... "Glad of it. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> so <b>myself</b> {{and thought}} we 'd have a jolly little party {{all in the}} family," [...] said Tom, looking much gratified at her delight.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you wonder}} now {{that with all}} these things boiling in my head I didn't know where I was putting down my foot that night? <b>I</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> falling--then crash, and all dark.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is odd; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>myself.</b> And when I {{tell you}} what I have come about you will think it more odd. I know I can trust you with a secret." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> growing older. For {{the moment}} my goddess became a child needing help.|$|E
60|$|My head swam, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> stagger.... I did {{not know}} what was happening.|$|E
60|$|I {{shall never}} forget, in that moment, how {{instantly}} conscious I became of my manhood. The primitive deeps of my nature stirred. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> masculine, the {{protector of the}} weak, the fighting male. And, best of all, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> the protector of my loved one. She leaned against me, so light and lily-frail, and as her trembling eased away {{it seemed as though}} I became aware of prodigious strength. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> a match for the most ferocious bull in the herd, and I know, had such a bull charged upon me, that I should have met it unflinchingly and quite coolly, and I know that I should have killed it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am awfully {{sorry to}} wake you," [...] Ryan shouted, [...] "but {{you have had}} two hours of it, and I really cannot keep my eyes open any longer. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> going off, two or three times." ...|$|R
5000|$|Until {{you spoke}} to Estella the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me what <b>I</b> once <b>felt</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> {{did not know what}} I had done. What have I done! What have I done! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She will live," [...] Powers answered, [...] "yes! That is certain. And yet, {{since she}} opened her eyes, since I heard her speak, <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{nothing less than a}} murderer. That is what I am. A murderer, Trowse." ...|$|R
60|$|DOLPHIN. To-night {{was one of}} my {{moments of}} triumph. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{suddenly}} free of all my inhibitions.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> blushing. I {{had been}} {{thinking}} of my conduct to Mr. Sax--and I was heartily ashamed of it, too.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{pulled away}} by the arm, and Mr. Click and I stood alone {{at the corner of}} the next crossing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It isn't. But I {{always thought}} of her as little Elsie--she was a girl when I left home. I can {{understand}} what struck your brother: <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>myself</b> when <b>I</b> first saw her, after I came back." ...|$|R
60|$|That very evening I {{went to see}} Irene. My {{brain was}} {{whirling}} even yet, and I hardly knew what I was doing; but the cool air revived me a little, {{and by the time}} I reached the Lathams' <b>I</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> again.|$|R
60|$|Every {{one must}} feel what <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> since that time, that these {{circumstances}} {{were more than}} unusual--they were! almost suspicious. Let me, however, say again {{that it was impossible}} for me, in my dependent position, to act otherwise than I did.|$|R
60|$|I cannot say {{how this}} story amused me, when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> so {{thoroughly}} ripe {{on both sides}} to be duped in the same way.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{that the}} case did indeed look very black against me. But would a jury venture to convict me on such very {{doubtful}} evidence? ...|$|E
60|$|This {{recalled}} a suspicion awakened by my vision, so suddenly that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> blushing. She {{did not seem}} to notice it, and was perfectly composed.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does that}} matter? It {{seems to me}} that age does not go by years. It is long since <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> to be an old woman. But you are quite young. Everybody is proud of you, and you ought to be happy." ...|$|R
60|$|Though these {{pictures}} confused and puzzled me, I {{could not be}} unmoved by the emotion that was patent in them; and, I knew not why, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in <b>myself</b> a feeling that with regard to Strickland was the last I had ever expected to experience. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> an overwhelming compassion.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for that," [...] said the Duke, almost hesitating; [...] "very sorry. You will understand, I hope, that I should make no inquiry {{in such a}} matter, unless <b>I</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> {{warranted}} in doing so by what you had yourself told me in London." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> paling in my excitement. [...] "There is banishment, Sire--it is {{usual in}} cases of treason that are not {{sufficiently}} flagrant to be punished by death." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are you a doctor?" [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> almost {{smiling as}} I answered; the {{relief from the}} long {{pressure}} of anxiety regarding his life was beginning to tell: ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next thing}} I laid hold of was a brace of pistols, and as I {{already had a}} powder-horn and bullets, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> well {{supplied}} with arms.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no doubt}} that you have the spirit, Bertha, but I {{question}} whether you have the strength; especially after being over three months without any exercise at all. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>myself</b> yesterday, although we did little more than ten miles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not wish}} to complain, sir, but you have made me {{understand}} that you can, and that in certain circumstances you will, at a moment, withdraw what you give me. Since this was said to me, <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>myself</b> to be unsafe in such a house as Cosby Lodge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Until {{you spoke}} to her the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me what <b>I</b> once <b>felt</b> <b>myself,</b> <b>I</b> {{did not know what}} I had done. What have I done! What have I done!" [...] And so again, twenty, fifty times over, What had she done! ...|$|R
