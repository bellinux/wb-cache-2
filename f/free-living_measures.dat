40|$|Fulltext embargoed for: 12 months post date of publicationBACKGROUND: Promotion of {{increased}} physical activity is advocated for survivors of an {{intensive care unit}} (ICU) admission to improve physical function and health-related quality of life. OBJECTIVE: The primary aims of this study were: (1) to <b>measure</b> <b>free-living</b> physical activity levels and (2) to correlate the measurements with scores on a self-reported activity questionnaire. A secondary aim was to explore factors associated with physical activity levels. DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study. METHODS: Nested within a larger randomized controlled trial, participants were block randomized to <b>measure</b> <b>free-living</b> physical activity levels. Included participants wore an accelerometer for 7 days during waking hours at 2 months after ICU discharge. At completion of the 7 days of monitoring, participants were interviewed using the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) questionnaire. Factors associated with physical activity were explored using regression analysis. RESULTS: The ICU survivors (median age= 59 years, interquartile range= 49 - 66; mean Acute Physiologic Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE II] score= 18, interquartile range= 16 - 21) were inactive when quantitatively measured at 2 months after hospital discharge. Participants spent an average of 90 % of the time inactive and only 3 % of the time walking. Only 37 % of the sample spent 30 minutes or more per day in the locomotion category (more than 20 steps in a row). Activity reported using the PASE questionnaire was lower than that reported in adults who were healthy. The PASE scores correlated only fairly with activity measured by steps per day. The presence of comorbidities explained {{one third of the}} variance in physical activity levels. LIMITATIONS: Accelerometer overreading, patient heterogeneity, selection bias, and sample size not reached were limitations of the study. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of an ICU admission greater than 5 days demonstrated high levels of inactivity for prolonged periods at 2 months after ICU discharge, and the majority did not meet international recommendations regarding physical activity.

We postulated that <b>measuring</b> <b>free-living</b> gait can provide further information about walking ability in complement to clinical evaluations. We sought to validate a method that characterizes free gaits with a wearable sensor. Over one week, 81 healthy controls (HC) and 66 chronic lower limb pain patients (CLLPP) hospitalized for multidisciplinary rehabilitation wore a simple accelerometer (Actigraph). In the acceleration signals, steady 1 -min walks detected numbered 7, 835 (5, 085 in CLLPP and 2, 750 in HC). Five gait quality measures were assessed: movement intensity, cadence, stride regularity, and short-term and long-term local dynamic stability. Gait quality variables differed significantly between CLLPP and HC (4 %- 26 %). Intraclass correlation coefficients revealed moderate to high repeatability (0. 71 - 0. 91), which suggests that seven days of measurement are sufficient to assess average gait patterns. Regression analyses showed significant association (R(2) = 0. 44) between the gait quality variables and a clinical evaluation of walking ability, i. e., the 6 -min walk test.

This study validates a portable multisensor array for <b>measuring</b> <b>free-living</b> total energy expenditure compared with a gold standard method (doubly labeled water) in individuals with stroke. Methods—Daily energy expenditure was measured in 9 participants with stroke (738 years) over a 10 -day period with 2 techniques: a portable multisensor array and doubly labeled water. Results—Bland-Altman analysis revealed a mean difference of 94 kcal/day (3. 8 %) in total energy expenditure measures given by the multisensor array in comparison to doubly labeled water with lower and upper limits of agreement of 276 to 463. 8 kcal/day (2473468 versus 2380551, P 0. 167). There was strong agreement between the multisensor array and labeled water methods of capturing total daily energy expenditure (r 0. 850, P 0. 004).

We <b>measured</b> seasonal field metabolic rates (FMR) and water fluxes in the three species of free-living wombat using the doubly labelled water technique, to further investigate the extent of energy conservation in the Vombatidae. Measurements were taken during the wet and dry annual extremes of their characteristically harsh environments, which corresponded to seasonal extremes {{of food and water}} availability. Seasonal FMRs for all wombat species were lower than that recorded for other marsupials and well below that predicted for herbivorous mammals. Dry-season FMR of Lasiorhinus kreftii was 40 % of that predicted for a mammal. Wombats maintained energy balance during the poor season by reducing FMR to about half that of the good season. Water flux rates during the dry season for the arid-adapted Lasiorhinus are amongst the lowest recorded for mammals, being only 25 % of that predicted for a similarly sized herbivorous mammal. These low water flux rates enable wombats in semi-arid areas to maintain water balance without drinking. Estimated food and nitrogen intake rates were also low. We conclude that the energetically frugal lifestyle of the Vombatidae is amongst the most extreme for mammals. Murray Evans, Brian Green, Keith Newgrai...|$|R

Methods—Forty people with stroke wore one Actical accelerometer on each hip for 3 consecutive days at home and during the 6 -minute walk test in the laboratory. The accelerometer measured physical activity using total activity counts per day and energy expenditure (kcal/d). Results—Excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for the activity counts (paretic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 95, nonparetic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 94) and for the energy expenditure (paretic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 95, nonparetic hip ICC[1, 3] 0. 95) were found across the 3 consecutive days at home.

40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} were {{to explore the}} {{accuracy}} in <b>measuring</b> <b>free-living</b> total daily energy expenditure (TDEE), by examining existing indirect measures of energy expenditure (EE) measurement and further, developing new techniques, for improved accuracy and application, in population-based studies. In {{a number of the}} studies, the research focus is the heart rate (HR) monitoring technique, for TDEE estimation {{as a result of its}} low cost and ease of implementation in large population-based studies. This thesis represents a progression from the application of the HR monitoring technique for estimating EE in response to training, or as a means to validate a physical activity recall instrument. However, what is highlighted are the limitations of the existing methodology for estimated TDEE in this way. Therefore, this thesis introduces a novel concept in the HR monitoring technique, incorporating group-based EE equations, and further, by including the effects of the previous minutes HR response on the estimation of EE from HR. Finally, this thesis validates these modifications, using a respiration chamber, purpose-built as a part of this dissertation. It should be noted, however, that in some instances, the thesis was constrained by opportunistic sampling, or the fact that in the case of Chapter 4, the study sample was part of a larger study designed for another purpose. Nevertheless, the outcomes of this research, in particular, the group-based HR-EE prediction equations, have important implications for large population-based epidemiological research concerning physical activity dose-response.

Current {{recommendations}} are based on extrapolations from adult studies. Research is needed to provide science based evidence to determine how DF impacts the gut of children. Two studies were conducted to investigate the interactions of DF in the child large intestine. In the first study, the dose response of DF on breath hydrogen, methane, and total hydrogen content was investigated relative to Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended intakes in free-living preschool children. Only four of the 18 participants were able to comply with the treatment protocol. Although, no significant differences were noted in breath measures of fermentation across fiber consumption levels, there was a numerical pattern for increasing levels of DF to evolved increased gas production in the four compliers. In <b>free-living</b> individuals <b>measures</b> of acute fiber fermentation through breath was not sensitive enough over 6 hours to distinguish a difference in fermentative rate. Children, parents, and child care centers found this approach apparently acceptable. In study two, the impact of DF (10 g) fed over three weeks in children and their parents on metabolic markers of fermentation were evaluated. The body was able to adapt to 10 g/day DF consumption as bloating (p < 0. 05) and flatulence (p = 0. 06) decreased each week of the study. Fecal propionic acid was significantly increased over three weeks of DF supplementation. There was also an interaction (p= 0. 05) between time and age for butyric acid. Dietary fiber supplementation (10 g/day) over three weeks via a commercially available extruded cereal was well-tolerated by the participants, with no disturbances in bowel habit in children or adults. Alternatively, there were no improved bowel habit measures with increased DF consumption. This study provides evidence that this tolerable dose of DF supplementation over three weeks had similar impacts in free-living children and adults. However, the presence of increased butyric acid only in children may be reflective of different production or absorptive capacities between children and adults. Although not presented here, the bacterial ecological analysis may shed further insight into the interactions occurring in the large intestine. These are the first studies to my knowledge to have investigated these outcomes in young children. In addition to the gut health outcomes, this research provided a framework into the apparent feasibility of studying children in a gentle, non-invasive, and cost-effective manner...|$|R

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS — PAEE {{was measured in}} 34 volunteers using the doubly labeled water method and indirect calorimetry (resting). Fasting blood glucose and 2 -h postload blood glucose were measured during a standard 75 -g oral glucose tolerance test. RESULTS — There was a significant negative correlation between PAEE and 2 -h glucose (r � � 0. 43; P � 0. 01) but not fasting glucose (r � 0. 1; P � 0. 57). The inverse association between PAEE and 2 -h glucose remained after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI (� �� 0. 017 [95 % CI � 0. 033 to � 0. 002]) and was unchanged after further adjustment for waist circumference, body fat percentage, or aerobic fitness.

Purpose: To determine whether energy expenditure can be estimated from heart rate monitoring without individual calibration in epidemiological studies. Methods: Our previously validated heart rate monitoring method relies on measuring individual calibration parameters obtained from resting energy expenditure and the regression line between energy expenditure and heart rate during exercise. We developed prediction equations for these parameters using easily measured variables in a population-based study of 789 individuals. The predictive ability of these parameters was tested in a separate population-based sample (N = 97). Results: Physical activity level (PAL = total energy expenditure/basal metabolic rate) using the four estimated parameters was correlated with PAL using the measured parameters (r = 0. 82, P < 0. 01). Comparison of measured and estimated PAL showed that 97. 9 % of the scores were placed in the same or adjacent quartile. Conclusion: A combination of simple measurements and heart rate monitoring produces estimates of energy expenditure that are highly correlated with those obtained using full individual calibration.

Heart rate variability (HRV) monitoring is emerging as a means for estimating EE and other physiological measures. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of HRV-derived EE across a range of physical intensities and during free-living. Participants (n= 30) completed two treadmill tests (walk and VO 2 max) measuring EE via Indirect Calorimetry (IC) and with the FirstBeat Bodyguard HRV monitor. Participants also wore the HRV monitors continuously for four consecutive days under free-living conditions. During the walk test, HRV-EE estimates across analysis conditions correlated moderately with IC estimates of EE (r= 0. 60 - 0. 75; p< 0. 05). During VO 2 max testing, HRV-EE estimates across analysis conditions correlated strongly with IC estimates of EE with (r= 0. 85 - 0. 98; p< 0. 05). During free-living conditions, daily average and 4 -day total HRV-EE estimates across all analysis conditions correlated strongly (r= 0. 75 - 0. 98; p< 0. 05). HRV-EE estimation improves as activity-intensity increases. HRV-EE estimates improve further with the addition of IC-measured HRmax and VO 2 max, particularly at low intensities; however, meaningful differences were not seen between values when considering group means. HRV-EE estimates are sufficiently accurate to indicate this method possesses practical utility and may be used for individual EE monitoring...|$|R

Objective: To evaluate the validity of ACC and HR used alone or combined to estimate AEE in free living conditions, compared to doubly-labeled water (DLW). Methods: Ten-day <b>free-living</b> AEE was <b>measured</b> by a DLW protocol in thirty-five 18 - 55 y men (11 lean active, 12 lean sedentary, 12 overweight sedentary) wearing an Actiheart (combining ACC and HR) and a RT 3 accelerometer. AEE was estimated using group- or individual-calibration of the HR/AEE relationship, based on an exercise tolerance test. In a subset (n= 21), AEE changes were measured after one month of detraining (active subjects) or an 8 -week training (sedentary subjects). Results: Actiheart combined ACC/HR estimates were more accurate than estimates from HR or ACC alone. Accuracy of the Actiheart group-calibrated ACC/HR estimates was modest (intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC]= 0. 62), with no bias but high {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) and limits of agreement (LOA). The mean bias of the estimates was reduced by one third, like RMSE and LOA, by individual calibration (ICC= 0. 80). Contrasting with group-calibrated estimates, the Actiheart individual-calibrated ACC/HR estimates explained 38 % of the variance of the DLW-AEE change (ICC= 0. 63). Conclusion: This study supports a good level of agreement between the Actiheart ACC/HR estimates and DLW-measured AEE in lean and overweight men with varying fitness levels. Individual calibration of the HR/AEE relationship is necessary for AEE-estimations at individual level rather than at group scale and for AEE change evaluation...|$|R

However, natural variability in the photosynthetic characteristics of red coralline algae is poorly understood. This study investigated diurnal variability in encrusting Porolithon sp. and <b>free-living</b> Lithophyllum kotschyanum. <b>Measured</b> parameters included: photosynthetic characteristics, pigment composition, thallus reflectance and intracellular concentrations of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), an algal antioxidant that is derived from methionine, an indirect product of photosynthesis. L. kotschyanum thalli were characterised by a bleached topside and a pigmented underside. Results Minimum saturation intensity and intracellular DMSP concentrations in Porolithon sp. were characterised by significant diurnal patterns {{in response to the}} high-light regime. A smaller diurnal pattern in minimum saturation intensity in the topside of L. kotschyanum was also evident. The overall reflectance of the topside of L. kotschyanum also exhibited a diurnal pattern, becoming increasingly reflective with increasing ambient irradiance. The underside of L. kotschyanum, which is shaded from ambient light exposure, exhibited a much smaller diurnal variability. Conclusions This study highlights a number of dynamic photoinhibition strategies adopted by coralline algae, enabling them to tolerate, rather than be inhibited by, the naturally high irradiance of tropical reef systems; a factor that may become more important in the future under global change projections. In this context, this research has significant implications for tropical reef management planning and conservation monitoring, which, if natural variability is not taken into account, may become flawed.

40|$|Abstract Background The SenseWear™ Armband (SWA) (BodyMedia, Inc. Pittsburgh, PA) is a {{physical}} activity and lifestyle monitor that objectively and accurately <b>measures</b> <b>free-living</b> energy balance and sleep and includes software for self-monitoring of daily energy expenditure and energy intake. The real-time feedback of the SWA can improve individual self-monitoring and, therefore, enhance weight loss outcomes. Methods We recruited 197 sedentary overweight or obese adults (age, 46. 8 ± 10. 8 y; body mass index (BMI), 33. 3 ± 5. 2 kg/m 2; 81 % women, 32 % African-American) from the greater Columbia, South Carolina area. Participants were randomized into 1 of 4 groups, a self-directed weight loss program via an evidence-based weight loss manual (Standard Care, n = 50), a group-based behavioral weight loss program (GWL, n = 49), the armband alone (SWA-alone, n = 49), or the GWL plus the armband (GWL+SWA, n = 49), during the 9 -month intervention. The primary outcome was change in body weight and waist circumference. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis compared change in the intervention groups to the standard care group on weight and waist circumference status after adjusting for age, sex, race, education, energy expenditure, and recruitment wave. Results Body weight was available for 62 % of participants at 9 months (52 % standard care, 70 % intervention). There was significant weight loss in all 3 intervention groups (GWL, 1. 86 kg, P = 0. 05; SWA-alone, 3. 55 kg, P = 0. 0002; GWL+SWA, 6. 59 kg, P Conclusions Continuous self-monitoring from wearable technology with real-time feedback may be particularly useful to enhance lifestyle changes that promote weight loss in sedentary overweight or obese adults. This strategy, combined with a group-based behavioral intervention, may yield optimal weight loss. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials. gov: NCT 00957008 </p...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{energy requirements}} in healthy elderly subjects, we assessed {{the association of}} total energy expenditure (TEE) with resting metabolic rate (RMR), physical activity, body composition, and energy intake in 13 individuals (aged 56 to 76 years, six women and seven men). <b>Free-living</b> TEE was <b>measured</b> using doubly labeled water, RMR was measured by respiratory gas analysis, and energy expenditure of physical activity (EEPA) {{was derived from the}} difference between TEE and RMR, assuming the thermic response to feeding contributes 10 % of TEE. Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were obtained from underwater weighing, Volmax was determined from a bicycle test to exhaustion, energy intake was obtained from a 3 -day food diary, and leisure time activity (LTA) was determined by structured interview. TEE was 2, 406 f 436 kcal/d (range, 1, 656 to 3, 200 kcal/d, or 1. 25 to 2. 11 times RMR) and was related to Vormax (I =,. 79, P =. OOl), LTA (r =. 74. P =. 004), FFM (r =. 69. P =. OOS), and FM (r =-. 64, P =. 016). The association between TEE and Vo,max persisted after adjustment for FFM (partial r =. 56, P =. 036). EEPA was related to LTA (r =. 63, P c. OOOl) and FM (r =-. 56, P =, 039). Energy intake underestimated TEE by 31 % + 16 % in women and by 12 % rt 11 % in men. Using stepwise regression, TEE was best predicted by Vo,max and LTA (total adjusted rz =. 66). We conclude the following: (1) TEE varies greatly within healthy elderly subjects due to variations in physical activity; (2) Vo,max has an important role in predicting energy requirements in older individuals; and (3) healthy older individuals underreport energy intake.

Background: Red coralline algae are critical components of tropical reef systems, and their success and development is, at least in part, dependent on photosynthesis. However, natural variability in the photosynthetic characteristics of red coralline algae is poorly understood. This study investigated diurnal variability in encrusting Porolithon sp. and <b>free-living</b> Lithophyllum kotschyanum. <b>Measured</b> parameters included: photosynthetic characteristics, pigment composition, thallus reflectance and intracellular concentrations of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), an algal antioxidant that is derived from methionine, an indirect product of photosynthesis. L. kotschyanum thalli were characterised by a bleached topside and a pigmented underside. Results: Minimum saturation intensity and intracellular DMSP concentrations in Porolithon sp. were characterised by significant diurnal patterns {{in response to the}} high-light regime. A smaller diurnal pattern in minimum saturation intensity in the topside of L. kotschyanum was also evident. The overall reflectance of the topside of L. kotschyanum also exhibited a diurnal pattern, becoming increasingly reflective with increasing ambient irradiance. The underside of L. kotschyanum, which is shaded from ambient light exposure, exhibited a much smaller diurnal variability. Conclusions: This study highlights a number of dynamic photoinhibition strategies adopted by coralline algae, enabling them to tolerate, rather than be inhibited by, the naturally high irradiance of tropical reef systems; a factor that may become more important in the future under global change projections.

40|$|Background It was {{proposed}} over 60 {{years ago that}} “the differences between the intakes of food must originate in differences in the expenditure of energy” (Edholm et al., 1955). It was also proposed that a ‘U’ shaped function described the relationship between physical activity (PA) energy expenditure (EE) and dietary intake (Mayer et al., 1956); this relationship also involved body mass. These relationships served {{as the basis for}} the studies conducted for this thesis. The main objective was to examine the associations among free-living sedentary and active behaviours, adiposity and appetite control. The investigation was conducted within an energy balance framework. The main focus of the thesis was to extend understanding of the interaction between PA, sedentary behaviour (SB), adiposity and appetite. Methods The methodology was based on measurements of body composition together with anthropometric, physiological, behavioural and psychological variables and involved a combination of cross-sectional and medium-term (12 -weeks) intervention studies. The thesis used state-of-the-art methodology for <b>measuring</b> <b>free-living</b> activity and aimed to detect a measure of SB based on both posture and activity intensity. Results Study 1 - SB was positively associated with adiposity and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was negatively associated with adiposity. Study 2 - A procedure was developed to integrate data on two dimensions of free-living SB (posture and activity intensity) using two validated activity monitors. Study 3 - Posture alone (as a marker of SB) is not a good indicator of the tendency to accumulate fat mass (FM). Study 4 - Total EE and the metabolic contributors to total EE (fat-free mass (FFM) and resting metabolic rate (RMR)) were associated with subjective appetite sensations and EI, and provisionally can be regarded as drivers of appetite. Study 5 - The 12 -week exercise intervention resulted in a significant (compensatory) increase in EI, however, there was no change in non-exercise physical activity (NEPA). Study 6 - Diet induced weight loss (mainly FM loss) did not lead to a compensatory reduction in PA or increase in SB. Conclusions These studies have extended the understanding of the associations among PA, SB, adiposity and appetite control. The outcomes of the studies have contributed to a theoretical framework for understanding the interactions between physiological and behavioural variables that contribute to energy balance and body mass (adiposity) regulation under realistic conditions. It could be deduced that a combination of increased EE (through exercise) and reduced EI are likely to produce greater weight loss and more favourable changes in body composition than either exercise or diet alone...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{activity}} (PA) is well recognised as {{an essential}} component of a healthy lifestyle and is commonly recommended as part of a multimodal management approach for people with chronic low back pain (CLBP). However, to date there is limited evidence of how best to promote PA in people with CLBP. Knowledge of the correlates and determinants of PA in this patient group is necessary to facilitate and promote PA in patients’ everyday lives. The main aim of this thesis was to determine the physical and psychological correlates of objectively measured PA in people with CLBP. This doctoral thesis examined the correlates of PA and sedentary activity in people with CLBP using a mixed methods approach. Initially, a systematic review was undertaken to examine the common assumption that patients with CLBP are less active than healthy individuals. There was no consistent evidence supporting this hypothesis for adults or adolescents. For older adults, there was evidence that they are less active than healthy control based on self-reported levels of PA. The ActivPAL™ activity monitor has previously been validated as a measure of postural PA in people with CLBP. To further examine this monitor, a study was designed to determine if the ActivPAL™ can also accurately measure the intensity of PA in this patient group. The findings were positive and suggest that the ActivPAL™ “counts” function may be useful, from which one can accurately determine PA intensity especially during locomotor activity. A study designed to examine the correlates of free-living PA and sedentary activity in people with CLBP revealed an important role of depression and elevated body mass index (BMI) respectively. Moreover, given the heterogeneity of people with CLBP, the comparative PA and sedentary activity profile of patients with and without a neuropathic pain (NeuP) component was examined. The findings are in line with previous findings which suggest that patients with a NeuP component are more disabled and have poorer psychological functioning. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the level of PA or sedentary activity between the groups. Finally, to add perspective and aid in the interpretation of the quantitative findings of this thesis, a qualitative study was undertaken to explore the perceptions and attitudes towards PA among patients with CLBP. The results, while highlighting a number of important barriers and motivations for PA, support recent experimental evidence which suggests that a decision to engage in or avoid activity is partly dependent on the motivational context of the activity. When patients are intrinsically motivated by non-pain goals, they are more likely to persist with an activity. In summary, only depression and BMI were associated with objectively <b>measured</b> <b>free-living</b> PA and sedentary activity respectively. From a qualitative perspective, a number of potential barriers and motivations for PA were indentified although it was clear from the results that choosing to engage in or avoid activity was highly task- and context-specific...|$|R
40|$|Improving {{physical}} activity (PA) participation {{is a public}} health priority in developed and developing countries to curb the substantial and growing prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases. Early childhood may be an especially important time to encourage PA; however, there is a paucity of research in this area. The aim {{of this research was}} to contribute to the limited body of work in PA in early childhood by investigating PA measurement approaches in young children and applying this knowledge to determine socio-environmental associations of preschool PA. An initial literature review provided the background for the thesis and determined the approaches taken in the ensuing chapters. A second literature review provided a detailed critique of research specific to PA measurement in early childhood to further inform the empirical studies. Information for the empirical chapters was drawn from three research projects: two studies were completed that assessed tools for objectively measuring PA in young children (pedometers and accelerometers), and these studies informed a final project to quantify associates of PA in a sample of preschool-aged children. Novel and important findings from the preliminary studies were that pedometer accuracy for <b>measuring</b> <b>free-living</b> PA and walking in children aged 3 - 5 years was poor, especially for pedometers worn {{at the back of the}} child, or during slow walking. Furthermore, when investigating the utility of accelerometers (more complex and frequently adopted tools) to quantify PA intensity in preschoolers, their application and use of commonly employed thresholds resulted in systematic underestimation of PA intensity and poor agreement (= 0. 09) when compared with a direct observation criterion measure. Application of existing accelerometer thresholds to classify PA intensity in preschoolers was therefore likely to yield biased estimates. Given the dearth of robust alternatives, a novel approach was developed to calculate individual activity rates from the raw accelerometer data. To account for over-dispersion in accelerometer counts, daily average activity rates per second were derived for each participant using negative binomial generalised estimating equation (GEE) models with a first-order autoregressive (AR 1) correlation structure. These rates were assumed to be exchangeable between days and normally distributed. Potential socio-environmental associates of children’s activity rates and body size were thus assessed using normal GEE models with exchangeable correlation structures. Parental PA and child age were independently and significantly associated with child activity rates (P≤ 0. 04). No relationships between child body size and PA or television (TV) exposure were found. Common approaches to PA measurement and data consideration were challenged in this research and novel robust methods devised utilising contemporary statistical methods. Accelerometer data can be successfully reduced to individual activity rates to mitigate current issues related to objective PA quantification with preschoolers. Parental involvement in preschool PA interventions is worthy of further investigation, and younger children may stand to benefit more from increased activity. Further exploration of the complex interactions between PA, exposure to media, and health outcomes in preschool-aged children is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{activity}} and sedentary behaviour {{have been associated}} with several health outcomes among adults and school-aged children. In addition, the evidence base linking physical {{activity and}} sedentary behaviour to health outcomes in preschool-aged children is increasing. Yet, a major issue in this field of research is the accuracy of methods used to measure physical activity and sedentary behaviour in 4 - to 6 -year-old children. Currently, hip-mounted accelerometers such as the ActiGraph and Actical are the most common devices used to objectively <b>measure</b> <b>free-living</b> physical activity and sedentary behaviour in preschool-aged children. Several calibration studies have been conducted to develop equations and cut-points to predict energy expenditure and classify physical activity intensity or sedentary behaviour in young children. However, the resulting equations and cut-points differ substantially among calibration studies. As a result, researchers are challenged with the decision of which equation and/or cut-point to use to estimate energy expenditure or time spent physically active. The choice of an accurate equation or cut-point is of great importance as the use of different cut-points results in significant differences in the reported outcomes such as time spent in different physical activity intensities. Another problem with hip-mounted accelerometers is their inability to differentiate between sitting and standing. This is of importance when examining sedentary behaviour which is defined as any activity with an energy expenditure value of {{less than or equal to}} 1. 5 times resting metabolic rate while in a sitting or reclining position. More recently a thigh-mounted accelerometer (the activPALTM) has been developed to measure posture and postural changes. However, the validity of the activPALTM for examining sedentary behaviour in preschool-aged children remains unclear. To overcome aforementioned issues, methodological studies comparing the accuracy of current accelerometer equations and cut-points against appropriate criterion measures in preschool-aged children are needed. The outcomes of such studies might improve the consistency of physical activity and sedentary behaviour measurement in this age group. Therefore, the primary aim of this thesis was to examine the validity of several accelerometer cut-points and equations developed to classify physical activity intensity and sedentary behaviour, and to estimate energy expenditure in preschool-aged children. Additionally, the validity of the activPALTM for assessing sedentary behaviour, physical activity and energy expenditure was investigated. The aims were addressed by simultaneously examining current ActiGraph and Actical energy expenditure equations and cut-points against energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry and physical activity intensity classified by direct observation. In addition, the validity of the activPALTM for classifying sedentary behaviour and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, and estimating energy expenditure in preschool-aged children was examined against these criterion methods. The studies in this thesis will make a unique contribution to the evidence related to the objective measurement of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in preschool-aged children. The first study described in this thesis explored the feasibility of the use of a room calorimeter in preschool-aged children. In total, 40 children, aged 4 - to 6 -years, were recruited to the study and asked to follow a graded activity protocol while in a room calorimeter. In addition, six children participated in two additional resting protocols to examine the effect of a light standardised breakfast followed by a 90 -minute fast on resting energy expenditure measures. The results of this study supported the use of room calorimetery in preschool-aged children. In addition, the effect of a light standardised breakfast followed by a 90 -minute fast on resting energy expenditure appeared to be small. Nevertheless, measured resting energy expenditue values were slightly higher than predicted resting energy expenditure using the Schofield equation. The biological importance of this difference is unclear. Therefore, the use of predicted resting energy expenditure was recommended for future studies where an overnight fast is not feasible. The studies reported in Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 examined the predictive validity of ActiGraph and Actical energy expenditure equations, respectively. In addition, the classification accuracy of current accelerometer cut-points was tested. For these studies, 40 children completed a 150 -minute activity protocol involving age-appropriate sedentary, light- and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities. Energy expenditure measured by room calorimetry and physical activity intensity classified by direct observation were used as criterion measures. The results of these studies showed all Actical equations and the ActiGraph equation developed by Pate et al. performed reasonably well when predicting energy expenditure during moderate- to vigorousintensity physical activity. However, none of the equations estimated energy expenditure accurately over the complete range of intensities. For the Actical, the classification accuracy was highest when using cut-points of ≤ 6 counts per 15 seconds, between 7 - 286 counts per 15 seconds, and ≥ 287 counts per 15 seconds for sedentary behaviour, light-intensity physical activity and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, respectively. For the ActiGraph, using cut-points ≤ 25 counts per 15 seconds, between 26 - 419 counts per 15 seconds, and ≥ 420 counts per 15 seconds resulted in the highest accuracy for classifying sedentary behaviour, light-intensity physical activity and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, respectively, in preschool-aged children. In Chapter 6, the validity of the activPALTM for assessing postural allocation was examined using direct observation as the criterion measure. The activPALTM showed good (ROC-AUC = 0. 84) classification accuracy for sitting/lying (i. e. sedentary behaviour), whereas classification accuracy for standing and walking was found to be fair (ROC-AUC = 0. 76 and 0. 73, respectively). Nevertheless, time spent sitting/lying and standing was overestimated (mean difference = 5. 9 % and 14. 8 %, respectively) and time spent walking was underestimated (mean difference = 10. 0 %). In addition, the total number of breaks in sedentary behaviour was overestimated (mean difference = 35). One of the factors influencing the accuracy of the activPALTM appeared to be the classification of activities defined as ‗other‘, such as kneeling down on one knee. It was recommended future studies should examine the importance of classifying these postures before conclusions around the validity of the activPALTM in preschool-aged children can be made. The study in Chapter 7 examined the predictive validity of the energy expenditure equation embedded in the activPALTM software. Additionally, an activPALTM cut-point for the classification of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity was developed and validated. The activPALTM energy expenditure equation overestimated energy expenditure during sedentary behaviour whereas energy expenditure during light- and moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activities was underestimated. Further development of this prediction equation is needed before it can be used with confidence in studies examining energy expenditure among preschool-aged children. For the classification of moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity, an activPALTM cutpoint of ≥ 1418 counts per 15 seconds was established with excellent classification accuracy. In addition, validation of this cut-point in a separate sample resulted in good classification accuracy for moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (ROC-AUC = 0. 88). However, studies validating this cut-point under free-living conditions are needed to confirm its accuracy for assessing habitual moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity in preschool-aged children. To conclude, this thesis aimed to provide evidence to better understand the accuracy of methods used to objectively measure physical activity, sedentary behaviour and estimate energy expenditure in preschool-aged children. If implemented consistently the recommendations from the reported studies could improve measurement accuracy and comparability between studies in this age group. The decision as to which methodology to use depends on the research question under investigation. Using the accelerometer physical activity cut-points identified as most accurate in this thesis might be the best available approach when examining physical activity intensities and/or adherence to current guidelines. However, if sedentary behaviour is the focus of the study, using the activPALTM accelerometer might be an appropriate alternative to using physical activity intensity cut-points. Finally, approaches more refined than single linear regression equations might be needed to accurately predict free-living energy expenditure from accelerometer data in preschool-aged children...|$|R
40|$|The health {{benefits}} of physical activity are well established. However, several aspects {{of the association of}} physical activity and sedentary behavior with various health outcomes remain unclear, {{in part because of the}} challenges associated with <b>measuring</b> <b>free-living</b> activity. Up to now, questionnaires remain the most widely used method to evaluate activity patterns at the population level. The accuracy of these instruments is often limited due to recall errors, social desirability bias, misinterpretation of the questions and difficulties associated with capturing low-to-moderate routine activities of daily living. Over the past decades, significant advances have been made in the objective assessment of active and sedentary behavior, including the use of accelerometer-based monitors. Still, each of these techniques has important limitations. Recent monitors like the SenseWear Armband, that combine accelerometry with physiological measures, can address many of these limitations and improve the accuracy of measurement. However, no single technique can accurately assess the volume of physical activity and at the same time provide information about which activities are being performed. Therefore, to allow for a more comprehensive investigation of physical activity patterns, this study complemented the objective monitoring through the SenseWear Armband with a direct measure of the type of activity through an electronic diary. The combination of both techniques allowed for a better understanding of habitual physical activity, thereby contributing to systematic progress in physical activity and health-related research and providing essential information for policy guidance. The aim of this project was three-fold. First, methodological issues associated with the measurement of physical activity and sedentary behavior were examined. Secondly, current activity levels were described and compared among population subgroups. Finally, associations of physical activity and sedentary behavior with health outcomes were investigated. The first paper of the methodological chapter examined sources of variance in physical (in) activity measures obtained with the SenseWear Armband, and determined the number of monitoring days needed to quantify activity patterns reliably. The results indicated that at least three days of monitoring from Monday through Friday were required to obtain reliable estimates of physical activity patterns during weekdays. Moreover, because of the marked differences between weekdays, Saturday and Sunday, both Saturday and Sunday need to be monitored in addition to the three to five weekdays. These findings have important implications for study design and data reduction strategies. The second paper examined the agreement between intensity- and domain-specific physical (in) activity parameters obtained with the Flemish Physical Activity Computerized Questionnaire (FPACQ) with those obtained from the combination of the SenseWear Armband and the electronic diary (SWD). Despite themoderate correlations, significant differences between both methods were found. In general, physical activity was higher and sedentary behavior lower as calculated from the FPACQ, compared to SWD. In addition, correspondence varied with gender and age. Though, no clear patterns were observed. Results differed according to the specific intensity and domain of activity. In the chapter of descriptive epidemiology, current levels and patterns of physical (in) activity were described and compared among population subgroups. The first paper evaluated compliance with various physical activity guidelines and investigated the relationship between meeting the guidelines and socio-demographic characteristics. Approximately 87 % of men and 68 % of women achieved 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per week, but only 58 % and 37 % accumulated this amount as 30 min/day on &# 8805; 5 days/week. With regard to vigorous physical activity, 28 % of men and 16 % of women achieved 75 min/week and 13 % and 7 % achieved 20 min/day on &# 8805; 3 days/week. Despite the high compliance with the guidelines for cardiovascular health, only 35 % of men and 22 % of women were sufficiently active to avoid excessive weight gain. The lowest compliance rates were observed for the goal of 10000 steps/day, with 16 % of men and 14 % of women attaining the minimum number of steps on seven consecutive days. The odds of meeting the recommendations was significantly lower among women and lower with higher age. Educational level was positively related with accumulating 75 min/week of vigorous activity, but negatively with taking 10000 steps/day. Smokers were 60 % less likely to participate weekly in 150 min of MVPA compared to non-smokers. Marital status, on the other hand, was not related to meeting the different guidelines. These results highlight the need to further examine the nature of the different guidelines and determine the most appropriate way to communicate physical activity requirements to the general public. The second paper described a comprehensive physical activity and inactivity profile among body mass index (BMI) defined normal-weight, overweight and obese adults. Physical activity level was significantly lower with higher BMI. Sedentary time was higher in obese men compared to normal-weight men and overweight and obese women compared to normal-weight women. Light physical activity was higher in obese than normal-weight men, but was not significantly different between female subgroups. Overweight and obese adults had significantly lower levels of moderate and vigorous physical activity compared to their normal-weight peers. The average duration of a sedentary bout and the number of breaks in sedentary time were only different between female BMI groups. The difference in time spent in domain-specific activity was minimal, whereas the intensity of these activities was lower with higher BMI. Normal-weight subjects had the highest and obese subjects the lowest activity levels throughout the week, but patterns differed between subgroups, with the difference most pronounced on Saturday for the male BMI groups. This study provided a unique insight into current patterns of physical activity and sedentary behavior among adults with various degrees of overweight. The results could be used to develop programs towards those activities, intensity levels and periods of the week that are especially concerning in obese individuals. The first paper of the chapter on physical activity, sedentary behavior and health examined the independent associations of overall, intensity- and domain-specific physical activity and sedentary behavior with bioelectrical impedance determined percent body fat. Time spent in light activity was positively and moderate, vigorous and combined MVPA inversely associated with percent body fat, independent of total sedentary time and potential confounders. Furthermore, MVPA achieved during leisure time, but also during occupation and household chores contributed significantly to percent body fat. The positive associations with total and domain-specific sedentary behavior, on the other hand, diminished after MVPA was controlled for. Thus, engagement in MVPA may be important to successfully prevent fat gain. In addition, these findings indicate that lifestyle physical activity accumulated during occupational, domestic and recreational activities should be fully integrated into future programs. The second paper investigated the associations between subcomponents of physical activity and sedentary behavior and the presence of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its individual components. The MetS was observed in 11 % of men and 6 % of women. Adults who spent &# 8805; 60 min/day in MVPA were 54 - 82 % less likely to have the MetS or individual risk factors, compared to those with < 30 min MVPA. Controlling for total sedentary time attenuated the associations, but subjects who engaged in &# 8805; 60 min/day still had a three-fold lower odds of having at-risk profiles for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). Once total MVPA was controlled for, parameters of sedentary behavior were not associated with MetS or its components. Light-intensity activity, on the other hand, was beneficially related with abdominal obesity, independent of time spent in MVPA. Physical activity of at least moderate intensity was associated with a significantly reduced likelihood of the MetS and individual risk factors. The strongest associations were found for time spent at vigorous physical activity. Both total MVPA as well as MVPA accumulated in 10 -min bouts were significantly inversely associated with individual and clustered metabolic risk. However, the lowest odds ratios were achieved with sustained bouts. Additional adjustment for total sedentary time revealed comparable results for low HDL and only partially attenuated the odds ratios for abdominal obesity. But, associations with hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension and the MetS were attenuated to a nonsignificant level. The findings of these studies have important implications for the assessment of physical activity in field-based research and the development of strategies to increase physical activity and promote health. Together, the results indicate that MVPA should be promoted as the key parameter for body composition and metabolic health. Lifestyle activities can be performed intermittently throughout the day, but to achieve additional benefits, adults should try to accumulate physical activity in sustained bouts. When feasible for the subjects, including some vigorous activities may be beneficial. Finally, it might be important to reduce sedentary behavior in addition to increasing physical activity. status: publishe...|$|R
