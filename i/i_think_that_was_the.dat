And, with Eric B. & Rakim, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first moment where I felt like, 'I've got to own this. This is crucial." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis played {{through a}} {{shoulder}} injury early in the 1993 season. Defensive end Reggie White, who signed with the Green Bay Packers following the 1992 season after spending eight seasons with the Eagles and earned seven Pro Bowl selections, said that he believed he destroyed Davis' confidence as a rookie and second-year player, as Davis had to go up against White in practice every week. White said [...] "there are some guys who get very discouraged because they can't block you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> situation at times with Antone." [...] Davis, however, disputed White's statements as the Eagles played against the Packers in {{the second week of}} the season. Dave Goldberg, a writer for the Associated Press, named Davis to his [...] "all-" [...] team after his performance against White. Davis started in every game for the Eagles at right tackle in 1993.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} a guest appearance by actor William Daniels as KITT, a character from the Knight Rider television series of which Homer is a fan. KITT is an artificially intelligent electronic computer module installed in an automobile. In the episode, {{after failing to}} cheer Homer up with a film reel of his life, the family shows him a video featuring KITT. The automobile, seen driving in the desert, tells Homer the following: [...] "Hello Homer. It's me, KITT, from TV's Knight Rider. Your family has asked me to invite you to a very special ..."; the film reel breaks just before KITT finishes his sentence. This of course leads to Homer becoming even more depressed. [...] Daniels' appearance in [...] "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was the first and}} only time that he voiced KITT outside of Knight Rider and the film Knight Rider 2000. He recalls that [...] "when I told my son in New York that I {{was going to be on}} The Simpsons, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first time that he was really impressed with what I was doing! The Simpsons is a great show and I'm glad they thought of KITT in one of their jokes." ...|$|E

500|$|For the {{flashback}} {{scene at}} the Tower of Joy, actor Robert Aramayo was cast to play a young Eddard Stark. In an interview with Access Hollywood, Aramayo stated {{that he was a}} big fan of the series, and that [...] "it was an honor and a gift {{to be able to be}} a part of it." [...] In regards to portraying the character similar to Sean Bean, who played Eddard Stark in the first season, Aramayo noted, [...] "I didn't want to get too hung up in sounding like Sean because I think that would've sort of got in my way if I'd have just situated all my work in that place. I watched a lot of footage of him playing Ned in the first season again, repeatedly, especially one particular fight scene that he was in and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> biggest help for me when creating this version of Ned – was watching what Sean did with Ned in the first season and trying to work out what a younger man's version of that is." [...] In a separate interview with The Hollywood Reporter Aramayo spoke about auditioning for the role, stating, [...] "The chance to audition to be on the show was a dream, even to audition. It was an absolute dream to me. I was very excited to audition, and landing the role was beyond my wildest dreams. Then when I found out the role was Ned, it was overwhelming." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer and supervising {{producer}} Brad Kern {{reflected on}} the show's cancellation, saying, [...] "Ten years later, everybody you talk to... they all love the show. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> biggest disappointment about the show not coming back. We knew we were doing something special." [...] Told of the show's success in the TV Guide [...] "Save Our Shows" [...] poll, Sandy Grushow said, [...] "Obviously I'm happy and not entirely surprised", but added, [...] "You can't dismiss a season's worth of ratings." [...] Kim Manners, director on {{nearly a third of}} the Brisco episodes, said working on the series gave him an opportunity to grow creatively. He told writer Joe Nazzaro, [...] "It really woke me up as a director, almost spiritually", and that directing for Brisco was a large contributing factor to his success as a regular director on The X-Files. Manners said, [...] "When they didn't give it a second year, I was devastated", adding that he wished Cuse would have made a feature film based on Brisco. Considering the show's short life, Cuse later commented, [...] "If the show could have survived into a second season, I think it could have ended up running for actually a long time. Some shows just sort of fall through the cracks in the right away and they kind of stay on the air long enough to aggregate an audience. I think if circumstances had been different, Brisco could have had a much longer life." [...] Cuse also said the Friday night time slot hurt Briscos chances of building an audience, saying, [...] "We were on at 8 p.m. on Friday night, which is sort of a death slot– I mean people do still go bowling– few shows have succeeded in that slot." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I’ve {{always said}} it: Mike {{is a lot}} funnier, and a lot wittier, than people thought. And Chris {{was a lot more}} {{knowledgeable}} and sharp, sports-wise, than people thought. So I think that combination, at times, got a little overrated—that Mike was the encyclopedic one, and Dog was the goofy one. Which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> perception for a long time. After a while, they realized, hey, Mike’s funny! And Dog knows what he’s talking about! Once that was established, I think the show was sharp." ...|$|E

2500|$|Droste and Bear were {{subsequently}} joined by bass guitarist and producer Chris Taylor, and performed four shows {{together as a}} three-piece. Regarding these shows, Droste noted, [...] "We've never played without the four of us, really. The first couple shows we did before we knew Dan , we did with three of us {{and they kind of}} sucked. From the get-go, when we were trying to put together a live show, that's when we discovered our sound and that's why <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the band." ...|$|E
2500|$|That {{was written}} {{around the time}} of the first record [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> second thing Ed and I wrote together. It came out of a jam in the studio and Ed didn't really have any lyrics. He came up with some ideas right there on the spot, and that's what we recorded. For some reason, it didn't make it on Ten. I was kind of bummed at the time. I really wanted it to be on our first record. But at the time, I was really young and just happy to be around this situation, so I did whatever.|$|E
2500|$|Gilmour later said, [...] "When {{we first}} started playing World Series Cricket, I think we {{lost a lot of}} friends ... not player-wise, I don't think ... the players are OK. It's the {{officials}} that take a bit of swaying again... There were officials with the cricket association who I regarded as good friends and I had drinks with them whenever I was in Sydney or whenever they were in Newcastle. And they started treating me and the other players in WSC like lepers. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most hurtful thing of all. It was something that they didn't go along with and they just couldn't handle it".".|$|E

60|$|It may {{be argued}} {{that there are certain}} {{conditions}} that make necessities and impose them upon us, {{and to the extent that}} a necessity is imposed upon a man, he must submit to it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> condition in which we found ourselves when we established this government. We had slaves among us; we could not get our Constitution unless we permitted them to remain in slavery; we could not secure the good we did secure, if we grasped for more; but, having by necessity submitted to that much, it does not destroy the principle that is the charter of our liberties. Let that charter stand as our standard.|$|E
60|$|Dora told me, shortly afterwards, {{that she}} was going to be a {{wonderful}} housekeeper. Accordingly, she polished the tablets, pointed the pencil, bought an immense account-book, carefully stitched up with a needle and thread all the leaves of the Cookery Book which Jip had torn, and made quite a desperate little attempt 'to be good', as she called it. But the figures had the old obstinate propensity--they WOULD NOT add up. When she had entered two or three laborious items in the account-book, Jip would walk over the page, wagging his tail, and smear them all out. Her own little right-hand middle finger got steeped to the very bone in ink; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only decided result obtained.|$|E
