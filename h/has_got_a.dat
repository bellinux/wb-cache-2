Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, the best grade of the night, saying [...] "Simpsons was one of their best episodes in a long time, and it continues a season that's had some pretty good episodes overall. I wouldn't put this on The Simpsons' top tier, but I think it's definitely on that next tier down, episodes that maybe don't have the most original plots but do have solid jokes throughout. Even the Bart and Lisa B-plot, involving Lisa getting a sudden addiction to Olympic pin collecting, starts out kind of bland and gets better and better as Lisa's jones grows." [...] Jason Hughes of the TV Squad gave the episode a positive review as well saying [...] "All in all, it was a weird time out of Springfield this week, with some highlight moments sprinkled throughout". Steve Tilley of the Toronto Sun wrote [...] "Sure, the episode was probably funnier for Canadians and curlers (and maybe Harry Potter fans) than anyone else, but it did prove Homer <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> bit of meteorological, psychic in him: 'Pack your winter coat, we're going to Canada's warmest city!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Referred to as a [...] "genre roulette" [...] by the San Francisco Chronicle, Post {{touches on}} various musical styles, {{including}} industrial music, big-band jazz, trip hop, chillout, and experimental music. Jim Farber, reviewing the album in 1995 for Entertainment Weekly, considered Post to be a [...] "connecting point between industrial-disco, ambient-trance, and catchy synth pop". When asked if this variety of genres was intentional, Björk replied: [...] "Yes, I'm {{very aware of}} that. I've got very many sides to me. To be honest, I think everyone <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> thousand sides to them. It's called being human. Nature gave us that kinda complexity. Most people pretend they're only one thinglike : [...] "cool" [...] or [...] "intelligent" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] or [...] "caring". But I think everyone are all of these things, including me". She recognises Post as darker and more aggressive than Debut, and has identified independence, strength, and instinct as its lyrical themes. In a 1997 interview, the singer said: [...] "Post... {{a bit like the}} Tin Tin books. Sort of Tin Tin goes to Congo. Tin Tin goes to Tibet. So it's all these different flavors, me sort of trying all these different things on". The balance between synthetic and organic elements in the album—generated through the combination of electronic and [...] "real" [...] instruments—is a recurring characteristic of Björk's output. In 1999, Vibe stated: [...] "Fusing techno, industrial, ambient, punk, and the rarefied yet tuneful spheres of art rock, Björk explores a jungle of tones, supported by her eternally buoyant voice from Mars." ...|$|E

[...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone gave the album three-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "When the pain takes over her corseted soul, [...] she just overdubs her big bodice-ripping voice into a choir." [...] Additionally, {{he added that the}} [...] "best songs are the creepiest", and concluded; [...] "Obviously, Lee <b>has</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> touch of the magnetic and destructive herself. But that's what makes the breakup songs on The Open Door feel mighty real." [...] Jon Dolan of Entertainment Weekly explained the record is [...] "more personal and, by accessing a deeper emotional palette, maybe even more universal". Blender gave a positive review, confessing, [...] "Denser and more scuzzed-up than Fallen, the album amps everything up to gloriously epic, over-the-top proportions". Billboard said, [...] "Those who embraced Fallen will doubtlessly fall even harder into The Open Door." [...] Spins Mellisa Maerz rated the album with four stars out of five and commented, [...] "A post-dysfunctional kiss-off that builds from ethereal Sunday-mass uplift into full-eff-you guitar dirges, revealing an angrier, more self-assured Lee who waxes sardonic [...] but still misses the comfort in being sad".|$|E
