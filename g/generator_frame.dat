5000|$|The {{diesel engine}} is an twelve-cylinder, turbocharged, water-cooled, four-cycle, V-type engine usedto provide power. It is {{directly}} connected to the main generator. The traction motors are axle hung and supported on the truck transoms by spring-loaded suspension. One motor is geared to each axle through a single set of gears with a ratio of 14:72. The radiator keeps engine at proper operating temperature between 100 and 1980F (37.7 and 92.2°C). Two externally mounted battery boxes, {{one on each side}} of the locomotive, provide ventilated compartments to house the eight batteries. Two main reservoir tanks, one {{on each side of the}} locomotive, provide a means of storing air for the air system. The main generator furnishes direct-current power over a wide range of voltage at variousspeeds up to 1200 rpm. It is separately excited by the exciter generator mounted on the <b>generator</b> <b>frame.</b> The generator also acts as a starting motor when the start button is pushed and the battery switch is closed. The fuel tank can hold 500 gallons (1892 liters) of diesel fuel for engine operation. Two fill pipes and two sight glasses, one on each side of the locomotive, provide a means of filling the tank and monitoring the level of fuel. The blower provides forced ventilation for the traction motors which require adequate cooling. It is belt driven from the main generator shaft.|$|E

The inputs to this approach are final pre-hadronization partons, to remove dependence on unphysical details such as the order of matrix element calculation and shower <b>generator</b> <b>frame</b> recoil treatment. These are clustered using standard jet algorithms, modified to restrict the allowed pseudojet combinations to those in which tracked flavour labels are consistent with QCD and QED Feynman rules. The resulting algorithm is shown to be portable between the major families of shower generators, and largely insensitive to many possible systematic variations: it hence offers significant advantages over existing ad hoc labelling schemes. However, it is shown that contamination from multi-parton scattering simulations can disrupt the labelling results. Suggestions are made for further extension to incorporate more detailed QCD splitting function kinematics, robustness improvements, and potential uses for truth-level physics object definitions and tagging...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. When a Cardinal B-spline {{of order}} greater than 1 {{is used as}} the scaling {{function}} to generate a multiresolution approximation of L 2 = L 2 (IR) with dilation integer factor M ≥ 2, the standard “matrix extension ” approach for constructing compactly supported tight frames has the limitation {{that at least one}} of the tight <b>frame</b> <b>generators</b> does not annihilate any polynomial except the constant. The notion of vanishing moment recovery (VMR) was introduced in our earlier work (and independently by Daubechies, Han, Ron, and Shen) for dilation M = 2 to increase the order of vanishing moments. This present paper extends the tight frame results in the above mentioned papers from dilation M = 2 to arbitrary integer M ≥ 2 for any compactly supported M-dilation scaling functions. It is shown, in particular, that M compactly supported tight <b>frame</b> <b>generators</b> suffice, but not M − 1 in general. A complete characterization of the M-dilation polynomial symbol is derived for the existence of M − 1 such <b>frame</b> <b>generators.</b> Linear spline examples are given forM = 3, 4 to demonstrate our constructive approach...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{introduction}} of vanishing moment recovery (VMR) functions in our recent work (also called “fundamental functions ” {{in an independent}} paper by Daubechies, Han, Ron, and Shen) modifies the so-called “unitary extension principle ” to allow the construction of compactly supported affine frames with any desirable order of van-ishing moments up {{to the order of}} polynomial reproduction of the given associated compactly supported scaling function.

40|$|Abstract. We {{develop a}} natural {{generalization}} of vector-valued frame theory, we term operator-valued frame theory, using operator-algebraic methods. This extends {{work of the}} second author and D. Han which {{can be viewed as}} the multiplicity one case and extends to higher multiplicity their dilation approach. We prove several results for operator-valued frames concerning duality, disjointeness, complementarity, and composition of operator valued frames and {{the relationship between the two}} types of similarity (left and right) of such frames. A key technical tool is the parametrization of Parseval operator valued frames in terms of a class of partial isometries in the Hilbert space of the analysis operator. We apply these notions to an analysis of multiframe generators for the action of a discrete group G on a Hilbert space. One of the main results of the Han-Larson work was the parametrization of the Parseval <b>frame</b> <b>generators</b> in terms of the unitary operators in the von Neumann algebra generated by the group representation, and the resulting norm path-connectedness of the set of <b>frame</b> <b>generators</b> due to the connectedness of the group of unitary operators of an arbitrary von Neumann algebra. In this paper we generalize this multiplicity one result to operator-valued frames. However, both the parameterization and the proof of norm path-connectedness turn out to be necessarily more complicated, and this is at least in part the rationale for this paper. Our parameterization involves a class of partial isometries of a different von Neumann algebra. These partial isometries are not path-connected in the norm topology, but only in the strong operator topology. We prove that the set of operator <b>frame</b> <b>generators</b> is norm pathwise-connected precisely when the von Neumann algebra generated by the right representation of the group has no minimal projections. As in the multiplicity one theory there are analogous results for general (non-Parseval) frames. 1...|$|R

Without the unconditionally convergence property, we show, counter intuitively, that even orthonormal bases can have arbitrary small system bandwidth.

40|$|Hilbert {{transform}} {{pairs of}} wavelets, biorthogonal wavelets and frames {{were found to}} be attractive in many applications. The Hilbert transform pairs are, however, hardly adoptable for applications, since their two-scale symbols are not trigonometric polynomials. Moreover, the symbols can not be implemented as FIR filters, nor rational IIR filters. That is the reason why approximations are constructed by many researchers in spite of the theoretical existence of the Hilbert transform pairs of wavelets, biorthogonal wavelets, and frames. But these conventional approaches have two drawbacks. Firstly, the wavelets and refinable functions do not have closed forms. Secondly, the symmetry, or ”linear phase”, of the wavelets and refinable functions is an important constraint in many applications. But, the results, however, show that {{it is not easy to}} get symmetric Hilbert transform pairs of wavelets (or <b>generators</b> of <b>frames).</b> In the first half of this thesis, we study the construction of Hilbert transform pair of MRA tight frames, which overcomes the drawbacks of the conventional constructions.
