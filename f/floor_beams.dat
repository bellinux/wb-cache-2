500|$|The {{director}} of the original investigation stated that, [...] "the towers really did amazingly well. The terrorist aircraft didn't bring the buildings down; it was the fire which followed. It was proven that you could take out {{two thirds of the}} columns in a tower and the building would still stand." [...] The fires weakened the trusses supporting the floors, making the floors sag. The sagging floors pulled on the exterior steel columns causing the exterior columns to bow inward.

Additionally, the report found the towers' stairwells were not adequately reinforced to provide adequate emergency escape for people above the impact zones. NIST concluded that uncontrolled fires in 7WTC caused <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> and girders to heat and subsequently [...] "caused a critical support column to fail, initiating a fire-induced progressive collapse that brought the building down".|$|E

The unique features of this system are circular and elongated web openings that allow tie-bars, building services and ducts passing through the structural depth of the beam. For the composite beam in bending, the longitudinal shear force is transferred by a unique shear mechanism which results from the special configuration of the beam, and shear connectors, if they are present. The work reported in this paper includes a total of 16 full-scale push-out tests aimed at investigating the longitudinal shear behaviour of these beams and the effects of additional shear connectors.

40|$|The {{growth of}} world {{population}} {{will be the}} challenge of the century regarding the carbon footprints. The human activities produce both direct and indirect carbon emission that is contributing to the climate change. The construction industry itself contributes around 30 percent of total carbon emissions in the world. Thus, the challenge is {{to solve the problem of}} meeting the increasing needs and expectations of a growing population while at the same time modifying the current production and consumption patterns to achieve a more sustainable development model. Based on this, the need for the sustainable structural element is inevitable. Extending the exploitation life of the structural element is one of the solutions that should be looked. Reusing instead of recycling the structural element is one of the ways to extend the exploitation life which can reduce the carbon emission. Therefore the innovation in the structural design to reduce the carbon emission is important. The purpose of this thesis is to study the feasibility of a conceptual design of demountable structural system. On the first part of the thesis, it investigated the structural behaviour of a composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> that consists of steel beam, prefabricated concrete deck and a single embedded nut bolt shear connector in the SLS condition. To accommodate fabrication tolerance and construction process, the bolt shear connector must have enough clearance. Various bolt-hole gap in bolt shear connector is applied to see the effect on structural performance of composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> in SLS. The study of demountable composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> is performed by mean of analytical calculations and finite element analysis. It is found that the bolt-hole gap clearance influences the deflection of composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam</b> due to partial interaction between prefabricated concrete deck and steel beam which leads to incomplete interaction of composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam.</b> The bigger hole clearance, the higher deflection occurs on composite <b>floor</b> <b>beam.</b> The second part of the thesis explores the conceptual design of plug and play beam-column connection. The purpose of developing a plug and play beam-column connection is to reduce the construction time so that it is easy to be mounted and demounted. Two conceptual designs have been developed and were evaluated through FEA. The resistance of those two conceptual designs is found to be higher than fin-plate connection while the rotational stiffness of this plug-play connection can be classified as a nominally pinned joint. The last part of the thesis aims to see the possibility of having a non-symmetrical column splice connection on the column. This is interesting for the architect as it provides aesthetic benefit for the façade. The non-symmetrical column splice connection located on the corner is evaluated by FEA. The connection is a combination of end-plate and cover plate splice column connection. Due to unsymmetrical nature of the connection, the resistance and failure mode of the connection is different in a different orientation of the loading...|$|R

2500|$|Construction of the {{new road}} deck and {{stiffening}} truss of the 1950 span was conducted differently than had been done in Gertie's case. In 1940, the road deck was prefabricated in [...] long sections on the Tacoma tideflats, then barged to the site via tugboats and hoisted into place via gantry cranes installed on the main cable. When construction of the road deck began in early March, workers installed a Chicago boom high above the roadway level, upon which prefabricated stiffening truss assemblies each -by- were hoisted into place. After the deck assemblies were hoisted into place and finished, four traveling derricks were then lifted onto the completed deck sections. [...] After the traveling derricks (called [...] "layleg rigs" [...] by the crew) were assembled and readied, the deck was then assembled {{in a series of}} steps. On the new bridge, the stiffening truss featured a series of outer members called [...] "chords" [...] that formed {{the top and bottom of}} the stiffening truss. These were installed first, then the diagonal and vertical truss members on the sides were installed. Next, an [...] deep stiffening truss [...] "floor beam" [...] perpendicular to the length of the bridge was installed at intervals of [...] (the distance between suspender cables; they were installed at each vertical beam member in the stiffening truss). These <b>floor</b> <b>beams,</b> each [...] wide, would form the upper lateral stiffening mechanism in the deck itself. After the <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> were installed, at alternate floor beam panel points a set of diagonal bracing struts were installed. Then, a series of lateral bracing struts were installed on the top and bottom of the road deck - that connected to the outer steel chords. Next, a series of eight [...] deep I-beam [...] "stringers" [...] were installed (positioned longitudinally). This was the final steelwork step involved, and the deck was soon raised [...] on each corner to attach the suspender cables and their [...] "jewels" [...] to the vertical stiffening truss members.|$|E

2500|$|Mill's {{empiricism}} thus {{held that}} knowledge {{of any kind}} is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. [...] The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. [...] This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such [...] "groups of permanent possibilities of sensation" [...] might exist in the first place. [...] Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of [...] "reality" [...] that goes beyond mere [...] "possibilities of sensation", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the [...] "gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all". [...] Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.

2500|$|In November 2008, NIST {{released}} its final {{report on the}} causes of the collapse of 7World Trade Center. This followed their August 21, 2008 draft report which included a period for public comments. In its investigation, NIST utilized ANSYS to model events leading up to collapse initiation and LS-DYNA models to simulate the global response to the initiating events. NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role, nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the twin towers, nor did the transfer elements (trusses, girders, and cantilever overhangs). But the lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor. The fires burned out of control during the afternoon, causing <b>floor</b> <b>beams</b> near Column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat, triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14. With a loss of lateral support across nine floors, Column 79 soon buckled – pulling the East penthouse and nearby columns down with it. With the buckling of these critical columns, the collapse then progressed east-to-west across the core, ultimately overloading the perimeter support, which buckled between Floors 7 and 17, causing the entire building above to fall downward as a single unit. [...] From collapse timing measurements taken from a video of the north face of the building, NIST observed that the building's exterior facade fell at free fall acceleration through a distance of approximately 8 stories (32 meters, or 105 feet), noting [...] "the collapse time was approximately 40 percent longer than that of free fall for the first 18 stories of descent." [...] The fires, fueled by office contents, along with the lack of water, were the key reasons for the collapse.|$|E
