5|$|After {{a period}} of leave in England over winter 1805–6 and {{promotion}} to colonel on 29 October 1805, Brock returned to Canada temporarily {{in command of the}} entire British army there. By 1806 the United States was becoming increasingly hostile to the British Empire; relations between the two nations continued to deteriorate until war <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> out in 1812.|$|E
5|$|The {{contamination}} caused what {{is known}} as a hard alpha inclusion, where a contaminant particle in a metal alloy causes the metal around it to become brittle. The brittle titanium around the impurity then cracked during forging and fell out during final machining, leaving a cavity with microscopic cracks at the edges. For the next 18 years, the cracks all grew slightly each time the engine was powered up and brought to operating temperature and <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> open, causing the disk to fail.|$|E
5|$|This {{fighting}} was so heavy that the NK 8th Division {{was forced to}} hold its ground a week before trying to advance. When it <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> out, it was only able to advance briefly before it was stalled again by South Korean resistance. The division was forced to halt a second time to wait for reinforcements. However the other two attacks were more successful, catching the UN forces by surprise. The North Koreans quickly pushed South Korean forces back.|$|E

5|$|Virginia {{went into}} {{the game with a}} 1–3record and {{at the bottom of the}} ACC. They mustered only 36points (and just 20points against Division I FBS teams) in the {{previous}} four games, while allowing their opponents 128points. Their last game had been a 31–3defeat at the hands of Duke, which <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> the Blue Devils' 25-game ACC losing streak.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> through the Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps {{to be withdrawn}} from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the assault was on hand, on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{initially}} sold slowly {{upon its}} release, {{but by the}} second half of 1992 it became a breakthrough success, attaining an RIAA gold certification. Almost a year after its release, the album <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> into the top ten of the Billboard 200 album chart on May 30, 1992, reaching number eight. Ten would eventually peak at number two for four weeks. It was held off the top spot by the Billy Ray Cyrus album, Some Gave All. The album spent a total of 261 weeks on the Billboard charts, {{making it one of the}} top 15 charting albums ever.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Andrassos or Adrassos was an {{engagement}} fought in autumn 960 in an unidentified mountain {{pass on the}} Taurus Mountains, between the Byzantines, led by Leo Phokas the Younger, and {{the forces of the}} Hamdanid Emirate of Aleppo under the emir Sayf al-Dawla. Taking advantage of the absence of much of the Byzantine army on campaign against the Emirate of Crete, the Hamdanid prince invaded Asia Minor and raided widely. On his return, however, his army was ambushed by Leo Phokas at the pass of Andrassos. Sayf al-Dawla himself barely escaped, but his army was annihilated. Following a series of Byzantine defeats in the previous years, this battle <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> the power of the Hamdanid emirate.|$|E
5|$|Asher {{broke off}} the {{engagement}} in early 1968, after {{coming back from}} an acting assignment in Bristol to find McCartney in bed with another woman, Francie Schwartz. McCartney and Asher later attempted to mend their relationship, but <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> up in July1968. Asher has consistently refused to publicly discuss {{that part of her}} life. Schwartz, a twenty three year old New York scriptwriter, had travelled to London trying to interest Apple Corps in a film script. Schwartz was then asked by McCartney to move into his Cavendish Avenue house, and was given a job working for Derek Taylor at Apple, which was then based in Wigmore Street, London. She attended many sessions during the recording of the White Album, and was living with McCartney when Lennon and Yoko Ono were also invited to live there. Shortly after, Schwartz sold the story of her time at Cavendish Avenue to Rolling Stone magazine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} centuries, the Byzantines were usually on the defensive, and avoided open field battles, preferring {{to retreat to}} their {{fortified}} strongholds. Only after 740 did they begin to launch counterstrikes of their own, but still the Abbasid Empire was able to retaliate with often massive and destructive invasions of Asia Minor. With the decline and fragmentation of the Abbasid state after 861 and the concurrent strengthening of the Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty, the tide gradually turned. Over a period of fifty years from ca. 920 to 976, the Byzantines <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> through the Muslim defences and restored their control over northern Syria and Greater Armenia. The last century of the Arab–Byzantine wars was dominated by frontier conflicts with the Fatimids in Syria, but the border remained stable until {{the appearance of a}} new people, the Seljuk Turks, after 1060.|$|E

50|$|Gradually, {{he became}} very {{interested}} in Bartók. <b>Finally</b> he <b>broke</b> a new ground and started writing his original music inspired by Japanese traditional folk songs and old nursery rhymes. He was also gifted writer who published several books. In the late period {{of his life he}} was passionate painter too who painted oil paintings.|$|R
50|$|In the 18th century, Euler {{worked on}} {{problems}} of combinatorics. In addition to working on several problems of probability which {{is linked to}} combinatorics, {{he worked on the}} knights tour, Graeco-Latin square, Eulerian numbers, and others. He also invented graph theory by solving the Seven Bridges of Königsberg problem, which also {{led to the formation of}} topology. <b>Finally,</b> he <b>broke</b> ground with partitions by the use of generating functions.|$|R
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1989 that a Pacific team <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> the {{dominance}} of the established Atlantic powers. Atlético Nacional of Medellín won the final series, thus becoming the first team from Colombia to win the tournament. Atletico Nacional faced off against Olimpia losing the first leg in Asunción 2–0. Because Estadio Atanasio Girardot, their home stadium, did not have the minimum capacity CONMEBOL required to host a final, the second leg was played in Bogota's El Campín with the match ending 2–0 in favor of Atletico Nacional. Having tied the series, Atletico Nacional become that year's champions after winning a penalty shootout which required four rounds of sudden death. Goalkeeper René Higuita cemented his legendary status with an outstanding performance as he stopped four of the nine Paraguayan kicks and scored one himself. The 1989 edition also had another significant first: it was the first ever time that no club from Argentina, Uruguay, or Brazil managed to reach the final. That trend would continue until 1992.|$|E
5|$|On 11 May 1944 General Sir Harold Alexander, {{commanding}} the Allied Armies in Italy, launched Operation Diadem, which <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> through the Gustav Line {{and forced the}} Tenth Army to withdraw. In the process, a gap opened up between the Tenth and Fourteenth Armies, threatening both with encirclement. For this failure, Kesselring relieved von Mackensen of his command, replacing him with General der Panzertruppe Joachim Lemelsen. Fortunately for the Germans, Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, commander of the U.S. Fifth Army, obsessed with the capture of Rome, failed {{to take advantage of}} the situation and the Tenth Army was able to withdraw to the next line of defence, the Trasimene Line, where it was able to link up with the Fourteenth Army and then conduct a fighting withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons {{began their}} drive at the Tech 30-yard line after the fumble, which {{effectively}} eliminated any chance Tech had {{to earn the}} two scores needed to regain the lead. The Falcons moved the ball effectively down the field, running out the clock as they did so. Bart Weiss <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> through the Tech defense for a 12-yard gain and the Falcons' final touchdown of the game. Though the extra point kick was missed, Air Force had taken an insurmountable 237 lead with 2:08 remaining in the game. Following Air Force's post-touchdown kickoff, Tech's offense returned to the field at its 20-yard line. The first play of the Hokies' drive resulted in a 10-yard holding penalty against Tech. With time winding down, Tech advanced the ball successfully via several passes, but time ran out shortly after Tech crossed the 50-yard line. Air Force clinched a 237 victory.|$|E
60|$|With this {{evidence}} against them, Haddon, Jillson and Dusenbury were {{submitted to a}} severe gruelling, each being examined separately. <b>Finally</b> Dusenbury <b>broke</b> down completely and admitted {{that he and the}} other two had fired John Calder's barn after stealing his noted pair of gray horses. The horses had been shipped out of town, and were later on recovered, as were also Mr. Powell's Blackbird and several other of the animals.|$|R
5000|$|The May Day riots of 1894 were {{a series}} of violent demonstrations that {{occurred}} throughout Cleveland, Ohio on May 1, 1894 (May Day). Cleveland's unemployment rate increased dramatically during the Panic of 1893. <b>Finally,</b> riots <b>broke</b> out among the unemployed who condemned city leaders for their ineffective relief measures. According to the New York Times, [...] "the desire to stop work seemed to take possession of every laborer..." [...] on May Day of 1894.|$|R
50|$|A {{third album}} was {{recorded}} and featured guitarist Mick Grabham of Procol Harum but was never released and <b>finally</b> the band <b>broke</b> up. A 5-song EP from the unreleased album {{has been released}} in 2016 entitled BANDIT3 EP.|$|R
5|$|The Greco-Persian Wars {{had their}} roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and in {{particular}} Ionia, by the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city. While Greek states {{had in the past}} often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.|$|E
5|$|The {{stage of}} the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who {{would be the first to}} break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano it <b>finally</b> <b>broke.</b> Johnny 'Guitar' Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around him. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and drummer Ringo Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast on the Grosse Freiheit, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen, armed with coshes, who beat them all as punishment.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} importance of south-east England declined after peace was declared with France in 1558. Military attention instead shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west of the country; tensions grew and war <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> out in 1569. The new threat led to improvements being made to Pendennis and St Mawes castles in Cornwall, and repairs to Calshot, Camber and Portland along the south coast. In 1588 the Spanish armada sailed for England and the Device Forts were mobilised in response. As part of this work, West Tilbury was brought back into service and supported by a hastily raised army, which was visited by Queen Elizabeth I, and further enlargement followed {{under the direction of}} the Italian engineer, Federigo Giambelli. Gravesend was improved and several of the Essex fortifications were temporarily brought back into use; there were discussions about enhancing the defences at Hull and Milford Haven, but no work was actually carried out.|$|E
50|$|<b>Finally</b> 2015, he <b>broke</b> the French National Hour Time Record {{during the}} National Meeting in 25-meter pool in Compiègne (France) with 5859 m, {{and he won}} a Bronze Medal for the 1500 m of French 2015 Swimming Championships in 25-meter pool in Angers (France).|$|R
50|$|The story {{takes place}} in a {{hospital}}. One day the chief doctor left the hospital for his own wedding, so the sick for several days were being examined by feldsher Kuryatin. The church sexton Vonmiglasov came to the hospital as he had a toothache. After examining the tooth, Kuryatin decided to remove it. The sexton yelled terribly, for Kuryatin was trying to drag the tooth out of his mouth for a long time, and <b>finally</b> he <b>broke</b> it. During this procedure, the polite feldsher and the patient utterly quarreled.|$|R
2500|$|As {{the surface}} {{continually}} reshaped itself {{over hundreds of}} millions of years, continents formed and broke apart. They migrated across the surface, occasionally combining to form a supercontinent. Roughly , the earliest-known supercontinent Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia, , then <b>finally</b> Pangaea, which <b>broke</b> apart [...]|$|R
5|$|When the {{rebellion}} <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> out in Batoche in March, Irvine advanced {{quickly through the}} snow from Regina to Prince Albert, which he garrisoned with 90 police. Superintendent Leif Crozier took a force of police, civilian volunteers and a 7-pounder (3kg) gun to Fort Carlton and attempted to seize a cache of supplies. In the process, Crozier confronted a larger force of rebels at Duck Lake, where his detachment came off much worse in the resulting fight. Emboldened, some of the Cree leaders, including Poundmaker and Big Bear, now joined the Métis in their revolt, although others continued to tacitly support the government, in part {{the result of the}} good relationship the police had built up with them. The police rapidly abandoned most of their posts along the valley, falling back to more easily defensible locations; Inspector Francis Dickens was forced to flee Fort Pitt with his men on a makeshift boat.|$|E
5|$|With the {{initiative}} {{back with the}} Germans and Italians, Kesselring hoped to launch an offensive that would drive the Allies out of North Africa. At the Battle of the Kasserine Pass his forces gave the Allies a beating, {{but in the end}} strong Allied resistance and a string of Axis errors stopped the advance. Kesselring now concentrated on shoring up his forces by moving the required tonnages of supplies from Sicily but his efforts were frustrated by Allied aircraft and submarines. An Allied offensive in April <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> through, leading to a collapse of the Axis position in Tunisia. Some 275,000 German and Italian prisoners were taken. In return, Kesselring had, however, held up the Allies in Tunisia for six months, forcing a postponement of the Allied invasion of Northern France from the middle of 1943 to the middle of 1944.|$|E
5|$|Following the club's {{negative}} performances, Zeman {{was sacked}} {{and replaced by}} the club's technique coach Aurelio Andreazzoli in early February 2013. Under his new manager, Totti scored a goal against Juventus on 16 February, with a powerful strike, as Roma shocked the league leaders in a 1–0 win. On 3 March, he scored his 225th goal against Genoa to become Serie A's joint second-top scorer – alongside Gunnar Nordahl – as Roma cruised to a 3–1 victory. Totti <b>finally</b> <b>broke</b> Nordahl's record by scoring against Parma on 18 March, increasing his Serie A tally to 226 goals. On 8 April, with a goal from a penalty kick in the 1–1 draw against Lazio, he became the joint top scorer of all time in Serie A in the Rome Derby with nine goals, putting him on par with Dino da Costa and Marco Delvecchio. Totti finished the 2012–13 Serie A season with 12 goals and 12 assists from 34 appearances. Totti also reached the 2013 Coppa Italia final with Roma, but lost the match 0–1 on 26 May to cross-city rivals Lazio.|$|E
50|$|In 1848 {{the stream}} Shaker Run forever damaged the canal. Shaker Run, in western Turtlecreek Township, drained the large swamp on the Shaker {{settlement}} at Union Village. The stream frequently jumped its banks and flooded the canal, depositing sediment that required constant dredging and repairs. <b>Finally,</b> Shaker Run <b>broke</b> through the canal's embankment.|$|R
50|$|By 1929, Titus had {{established}} {{himself in the}} senior side's forward line, playing alongside Jack Baggott. He won the best and fairest and led the club's goalkicking for the first time, but was held goalless in the Grand Final as the Tigers lost yet again. The Tigers used him as a flanker or in the pocket {{during the next few}} years as they desperately sought a combination that could break the jinx caused a succession of Grand Final losses. <b>Finally,</b> Richmond <b>broke</b> through for a premiership in 1932 and Titus {{was a member of the}} team.|$|R
50|$|Jin siege carts {{began moving}} towards the city. Scaling ladders were erected {{and the city}} was {{assaulted}} on all sides. The Ming defenders {{had run out of}} gunpowder after their gunpowder stores were hit by Li Yongfang's cannoneers. <b>Finally</b> morale <b>broke</b> as two walls fell to the Jin. As Yuan Yingtai saw this he set his watchtower on fire, committing suicide. Ming's Mongol allies who were present were too busy looting the city to do any fighting and fled soon soon after the Ming army was defeated. Following Yuan's example the other Ming officers committed suicide as well.|$|R
