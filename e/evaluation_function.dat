This is particularly useful for win/loss searches {{near the end of}} a game where the extra depth gained from the narrow window and a simple win/loss <b>evaluation</b> <b>function</b> may lead to a conclusive result. If an aspiration search fails, it is straightforward to detect whether it failed high (high edge of window was too low) or low (lower edge of window was too high). This gives information about what window values might be useful in a re-search of the position.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOpponent-Model {{search is}} a game-tree search method that {{explicitly}} uses {{knowledge of the}} opponent. There is some risk involved in using Opponent-Model search. For adequate forecasting, two conditions should be imposed. Both the prediction of the opponent's moves and the judgement of future positions should be of good quality. The two conditions heavily depend on the <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions</b> used. In the article we distinguish <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions</b> by type. Three fundamentally different types are introduced. Thorough analysis {{of a variety of}} characteristics leads to eight possible orderings.

Moreover, actual computer game-playing programs investigate the research questions by a series of experiments in which Opponent-Model search is performed. The game of Bao is our test bed, it was selected because of its relatively narrow game tree, which allowed for an appropriate search depth in the experiments. We restrict ourselves to five <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions</b> generated with the help of machine-learning techniques.

2500|$|On March 9, 1949, Shannon {{presented}} a paper called “Programming a Digital Computer for Playing Chess.” [...] The paper was {{presented a}}t the National Institute for Radio Engineers Convention in New York. [...] He described how to program a computer to play chess based on position scoring and move selection. [...] He proposed basic strategies for restricting the number of possibilities to be considered in a game of chess. In March 1950, published in Philosophical Magazine, Series 7, Vol. 41 (No. 314, March 1950). This was the first article on computer chess. [...] His process for having the computer decide on which move to make was a minimax procedure, based on an <b>evaluation</b> <b>function</b> of a given chess position. Shannon gave a rough example of an <b>evaluation</b> <b>function</b> in which the value of the black position was subtracted from that of the white position. Material was counted according to the usual chess piece relative value (1 point for a pawn, 3 points for a knight or bishop, 5 points for a rook, and 9 points for a queen). He considered some positional factors, subtracting ½ point for each doubled pawn, backward pawn, and isolated pawn. Another positional factor in the <b>evaluation</b> <b>function</b> was mobility, adding 0.1 point for each legal move available. Finally, he considered checkmate to be the capture of the king, and gave the king the artificial value of 200 points. Quoting from the paper: ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{powerful}} and very popular application for random numbers in numerical simulation is in numerical optimization.

In the traveling salesman problem the goal is to minimize distance traveled. There are also applications to engineering design, such as multidisciplinary design optimization.

40|$|The authors {{proposed}} a new practical optimum design method {{that consists of}} two steps: the design of experiments and mathematical programming. The design of experiments is used to generate approximate <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions</b> for the controlling behavior depending on the changes in design variables of an object structure, {{by a series of}} finite element analyses (FEA). Based upon an orthogonal array of a combination of design variables, effects of the design variables can be calculated by {{a relatively small number of}} FEA, and then the approximate <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions</b> are generated by those effects based upon analysis of variance. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions</b> can also be used as direct tools for estimating the behavior of design structure. Finally, a successive quadratic programming (SQP) method is employed to solve the optimization problem of the approximate <b>evaluation</b> <b>functions.</b> It is confirmed that the proposed method can be used for almost all kinds of the nonlinear problems including the impact behavior of structures, and that it can be carried out in much smaller number of FEA than the other existing methods.

It was found that the present method is a very effective and powerful tool for the optimum design of various practical design problems. 現在提案されている最適化設計のシステムの多くは複雑，効率が悪いという問題を持っている．本論文では，実験計画法，構造解析および数理計画法を組み合わせた実用的で効率の良い最適化方法を提案する...|$|R
