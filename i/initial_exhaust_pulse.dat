50|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of flat-four boxer configuration is its requirement for long exhaust pipes merging the exhaust from those exhaust ports located on opposing banks {{in order to}} achieve evenly spaced <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse.</b> In a four stroke engine, each cylinder creates an <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> every 720 degrees of crank rotation, {{and they need to be}} paired with another pulse that is 360 crank degrees offset in a four-cylinder configuration to achieve an even scavenging of exhaust gas in the cylinders, which is needed for uniform filling of intake and uniform combustion.|$|R

50|$|Crossplane V8 engines have a {{left and}} right bank each {{containing}} 4 cylinders. When the engine is running, pistons are firing according to the engine firing order. If a bank has two consecutive piston firings it will create a high pressure area in the exhaust pipe, because two <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulses</b> are moving through it close in time. As the two pulses move in the exhaust pipe they should encounter either an X or H pipe. When they encounter the pipe, part of the pulse diverts into the X-H pipe which lowers the total pressure by a small amount. The reason for this decrease in pressure is that the fluid (liquid, air or gas) will travel along a pipe {{and when it comes}} at a crossing the fluid will take {{the path of least resistance}} and some will bleed off, thus lowering the pressure slightly. Without an X-H pipe the flow of exhaust would be jerky or inconsistent, and the engine would not run at its highest efficiency. The double <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> would cause part of the next <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> in that bank to not exit that cylinder completely and cause either a detonation (because of a lean air-fuel ratio (AFR)), or a misfire due to a rich AFR, depending on how much of the double pulse was left and what the mixture of that pulse was.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{usually has}} a Roots blower to provide air for {{scavenging}} {{and this is}} arranged to deliver excess air so that air follows the exhaust gases into the exhaust manifold.

This research seeks to provide new insight into the impact of unsteadiness on turbine performance. The discrepancy between the pulsed flow behavior and that predicted by a typical steady flow performance map is a central issue considered in this work.

50|$|Inline-4, flat-4 and V4 are {{the common}} types of four {{cylinder}} engine. Normal inline-4 configuration {{has very little}} rocking couples that often results in smooth middle rpm range, but the secondary imbalance, which is undesirable for high rpm, is large due to two pistons always moving together. Rotational vibration on the X axis, which is often felt during idling, tend to be large because, {{in addition to the}} non-overlapping power stroke inherent in engines with 4 or fewer cylinders, the height imbalance from connecting rods centre of gravity swinging left and right is amplified due to two connecting rods moving together. Intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> on ordinary inline-four engines have equal 360° spacing between the front-most and the rear-most cylinders, as well as between the middle two cylinders.

Work extraction from the exhaust flow which is wasted to environment is one possible solution to increase both power density and efficiency. In this study, the behavior of pulsating exhaust flow, as characterized by maximum pressure as well as maximum available work (exergy), are investigated to design a suitable exhaust expander to harness this exhaust exergy. However, the cyclic variation of exhaust flow is a challenge as this can seriously impact the ability to directly harness the available exhaust energy. In this poster, we attempt to estimate the exergy of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse.</b> The experiments were performed on a single cylinder research engine at 1500 RPM, 5 and 2. 5 bar BMEP with different boost pressures. A GT-power model is constructed to estimate instantaneous exhaust temperatures and mass flow rates and the model is validated against measured cylinder pressure and apparent heat release rate. A piezoresistive exhaust sensor is used to measure instantaneous exhaust pressures over 1000 engine cycles at various engine speeds, loads and intake charge pressures. The exergy of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> is estimated from one engine cycle to another and further analysis is conducted to separate out the pressure and temperature components of the exhaust exergy.

50|$|Ordinary flat-4 boxer engines have {{excellent}} secondary balance {{at the expense}} of rocking couples due to opposing pistons being staggered (offset front to back). The above-mentioned rotational vibration on the X axis is much smaller than in an inline-4 because the pairs of con-rods swinging up and down together move at different centre of gravity heights (different left-right position in this case). Another important imbalance somewhat inherent to boxer-four that is often not dialed out in the design is its irregular <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> on one bank of two cylinders.

In a {{turbocharged}} engine, {{preserving the}} maximum amount of <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulse</b> energy for turbine operation will result in improved low end torque and engine transient response. However, the exhaust flow entering the turbine is highly unsteady, and the presence of the turbine as a restriction in the exhaust flow results in a higher pressure at the cylinder exhaust ports and consequently poor scavenging.

If the level of residual gas can be reduced and controlled, it should enable the engine to operate at a higher compression ratio, improving its thermal efficiency. This paper presents a method of turbocharger matching for reducing residual gas content in a turbocharged engine. The turbine is first scaled to a larger size as a preliminary step towards reducing back pressure and thus the residual gas concentration in-cylinder. However a larger turbine causes a torque deficit at low engine speeds. So in a following step, pulse separation is used.

40|$|Most {{boosting}} {{systems in}} internal combustion engines utilize `pulse turbocharging' {{to maximize the}} energy extraction by the turbine. An internal combustion engine with more than four cylinders has a significant overlap between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>pulses</b> which, unless isolated, can decrease the overall pulse energy and increase the engine pumping loss. Thus, it is advantageous to isolate a set of cylinders and introduce the exhaust gases into two or more turbine entries separately. There are two main types of multiple entry turbines depending on the method of flow division: the twin-entry and the double-entry turbine.

Steady-state simulations have been carried out for different speeds and a fuel-air ratios in order to determine the optimum settings for highest brake torque for a given operating point, namely the maximum rack position, the amplitude and the phase offset. Finally, an adaptive controller has been developed in Matlab-Simulink. The controller adapts its parameters according to the operating point in order to improve the system response for a wide range of operating conditions.

5000|$|Switching from an exhaust {{manifold}} to exhaust headers (also known as extractors in Australia) will optimize the {{exhaust gas flow}} speed and in turn increase the high-end power of the engine. This is done by using an individual pipe for each exhaust port that has smoother bends with a larger turn radius, decreasing airflow resistance, {{as well as a}} calculated pipe diameter to obtain a good scavenging effect for the specific engine capacity. The pipes then merge into a collector and then flow into a larger pipe (down pipe), just before the catalytic converter. With equal length headers, as each exhaust valve in the head of the engine is opened and exhaust gas is forced out, it passes down one of the header pipes and through to the down pipe, where the exhaust gas velocity causes a slight vacuum in another header pipe. This has an effect of scavenging exhaust gas from the cylinder, which is beneficial for performance. In performance engines, which have cam overlap, the scavenging effect will pull air through from the intake manifold as well, further increasing performance. The length of exhaust headers can be tuned to perform best at specific RPM ranges. Stock {{exhaust manifold}}s are usually made of cast iron and can be restrictive. Headers may or may not increase the dB level of the exhaust, depending on the original exhaust manifold it replaces and the engine.
