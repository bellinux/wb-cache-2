5|$|Beardsley {{signed for}} League One club Preston North End on a free {{transfer}} on 12 August 2012, linking up again with manager Graham Westley. He {{had spent the}} pre-season ahead of 2012–13 training with the club, although the transfer had been held up while the club waited for confirmation from the Football League in accordance with new <b>financial</b> <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> rules. Beardsley made his Preston debut in a 2–0 home win over Huddersfield Town in the League Cup on 14 August 2012, assisting the club's second goal of the match, with his low cross being scored by Nicky Wroe. He scored his first goal for Preston on 4 September 2012 after converting David Amoo's cross in the third-minute of their 1–1 away draw with Carlisle United in the Football League Trophy, a tie that Preston won 3–1 on penalties. Beardsley scored one further goal that month, heading in Jeffrey Monakana's cross on 64 minutes as Preston came from behind to beat Yeovil Town 3–2 at home. It proved to be Beardsley's last goal for five months, ending his goal drought in a 3–1 away loss to Yeovil on 12 February 2013, in what was Westley's last match {{in charge of the}} club. Beardsley made just two appearances under new manager Simon Grayson over the remainder of 2012–13, both all as a second-half substitute. Shortly after the season ended, he was told he could leave Preston if a suitable offer was received. He made 22 appearances during 2012–13, scoring 3 times, as Preston ranked in 14th-place in League One.|$|E

Big money signings Thiago Silva, Zlatan Ibrahimović, Edinson Cavani and David Luiz arrived to the club, though not without consequences.

40|$|AbstractPurpose of studyThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to emphasize the moral dimension's presence and its necessity into athletes training, reflected into the <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> attitudes and behaviors. The main objective is to identify some possible correlations between variables: <b>fair</b> <b>play,</b> moral values, to highlight at athlets their <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> into competitions and training. The issue aims to study the likelihood of a direct correlation between variables like general <b>fair</b> <b>play,</b> <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> in competition, <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> and moral values into society. Research MethodsThe research was conducted on a total of 40 subjects prepared by several variables (gender, age, sports, skill level). Analysis and interpretation of results was performed by using SPSS 11. 0 for statistical analysis Pearson bivariate correlation between next variables: general <b>fair</b> <b>play,</b> <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> in competition, <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> and moral values into society. FindingsIn qualitative terms, the correlations found between variables of <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> in competition, general <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> and <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> in society point to the fact that athletes who exhibit a <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> behavior in competition will manifest the same type of behavior in social life. Norms, rules, and sports standard orders, as well as social norms and rules of social life mark on the athlets’ behavior, which are internalized and behave in a spirit of <b>fair</b> <b>play.</b> Respect for others, respect for opponents and team mates, learning and respect the rules of play and social behavior leads to the training in the spirit of <b>fair</b> <b>play,</b> a habit that occurs in any life situation. ConclusionsFair play does not mean only to follow the rules of the game, it transcribes the attitude that the athlete must have: to respect the opponent and keep his physical and mental integrity. An athlete will behave in an attitude of <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> when he will think to others. Moral values (altruism, honesty, faith, dignity, responsibility) and psychosocial ones (self, love, openness, social recognition, independence) are mainly related to individual networking with peers and social and moral desirability. © 2009 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

25|$|In 2015 Inter and Roma {{were the}} only two Italian clubs that were sanctioned by the UEFA due to their {{breaking}} of UEFA <b>Financial</b> <b>Fair</b> <b>Play</b> Regulations. As a probation to avoid further sanction, Inter agreed to have a three-year aggregate break-even from 2015 to 2018, with the 2015–16 season being allowed to have a net loss of a maximum of €30million, followed by break-even in the 2016–17 season. Inter was also fined €6million plus an additional €14million in probation. Inter also made a financial trick in the transfer market in summer 2015, in which Stevan Jovetić and Miranda were signed by Inter on temporary deals plus an obligation to sign outright in 2017, making their cost less in the loan period. Moreover, despite heavily investing in new signings, namely Geoffrey Kondogbia and Ivan Perišić that potentially increased the cost in amortization, Inter also sold Mateo Kovačić for €29million, making a windfall profit. On 21 April 2017, Inter announced that their net loss (FFP adjusted) of 2015–16 season was within the settlement agreement allowed limited of €30million. However, UEFA also announced that the reduction of squad size of Inter in European competitions would not be lifted yet.|$|E
25|$|After {{the club}} failed to qualify to Europe {{at the end}} of 2009–10 Serie A, as well as lack of player profit, Fiorentina {{turnover}} was decreased from €140,040,713 in 2009 to just €79,854,928, despite the wage bill also falling, la Viola still made a net loss of €9,604,353. In the 2011 financial year, the turnover slipped to €67,076,953, as the club's lack of capital gains from selling players and 2010 financial year still included the instalments from UEFA for participating 2009–10 UEFA Europa League. Furthermore, the gate income had dropped from €11,070,385 to €7,541,260. The wage bill did not fall much and in reverse the amortisation of transfer fee had sightly increased due to new signings. La Viola had savings in other costs but counter-weighted by huge €11,747,668 write-down for departed players, due to D'Agostino, Frey and Mutu, but the former would counter-weight by co-ownership financial income, which all made the operating cost remained high as worse as last year. Moreover, in 2010 the result was boosted by acquiring the asset from subsidiary (related to AC Fiorentina) and the re-valuation of its value in separate balance sheet. If deducting that income (€14,737,855), 2010 financial year was net loss 24,342,208 and 2011 result was worse with €8,131,876 only in separate balance sheet. In 2012, the club benefited from the sales of Matija Nastasić and Valon Behrami, followed by Stevan Jovetić and Adem Ljajić in 2013. In 2014, due to €28.4million drop from the windfall profit of selling players, the club recorded their worst financial results since re-foundation, despite the fact the club maintained the same level of windfall profit, the result was still worse than in 2013. Moreover, Fiorentina also revealed that the club had a relevant football net income of minus €19.5million in the first assessment period of UEFA <b>Financial</b> <b>Fair</b> <b>Play</b> Regulations in the 2013–14 season (in May 2014). (aggregate of 2012 and 2013 results), which within the limit of minus €45million, as well as minus €25.5million in assessment period 2014–15 (aggregate of 2012, 2013 and 2014 results). However, as the limit was reduced to minus €30million in assessment period 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 season, the club had to achieve a relevant net income of positive €5.6million in 2015 financial year. La Viola sold Juan Cuadrado to Chelsea in January 2015 for €30million fee, to make the club eligible to 2016–17 edition of UEFA competitions.|$|E
500|$|Dein {{described}} Wenger as {{the most}} important manager in the club's history: [...] "Arsène's a miracle worker. He's revolutionised the club. He's turned players into world-class players. Since he has been here, we have seen football from another planet". Former Watford manager Graham Taylor said of Wenger in 2002: [...] "I believe his biggest contribution to football is getting across the idea that players have to prepare right and look after themselves". Wenger's loyalty towards <b>financial</b> <b>fair</b> <b>play</b> and handling of Arsenal's debt since their stadium move has earnt him praise, not least from American baseball general manager Billy Beane, who in particular lauded his transfer strategy. A survey in 2007 found Wenger was the only Premier League manager to have made a profit on transfers, and between 2004 and 2009, he made an average profit of £4.4million per season on transfers, far more than any other club.|$|E
