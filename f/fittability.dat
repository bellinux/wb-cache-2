In the ISO 2692 : 2014 [1] dimensioning and tolerancing standard, {{the writing of}} this requirement violates the principle of independency and is limited to features of size. This paper proposes two complementary writings and several explanations {{for the application of}} the concepts. In order to make the definitions consistent with those of ISO 1101 : 2012 [2] standard, the requirements are defined by means of unilateral tolerance zones. For features of size, the dimension of the tolerance zone for the specified surface and for the reference is written directly between brackets in the specification. For all complex surfaces, the tolerance zone is defined by an offset surface of the nominal surface. The offset value is written between braces. The definitions of form, location and orientation specifications with these modifiers are given for simple elements and for a pattern of holes. Composite specifications, which associate orientation and location tolerance zones with respect to the same nominal, are defined. An example with flutter on a primary reference shows that it is no longer possible to use all the degrees of freedom to associate the subsequent references. The use of an orientation plane to deal with unidirectional chains of dimensions is defined. In terms of metrology, the characteristic to evaluate is the margin between the actual surface and the limit surface of the tolerance zone when the tolerance zone on the references is respected. This margin enables one, for example, to determine a capability. Three applications present an assembly of a mechanism with clearances, a connection with a complex surface and a 3 D chain of dimensions at least material which requires a composite specification...|$|E
