40|$|In {{the present}} work, we have {{suggested}} a technical solution of a CO laser facility for industrial separation of uranium {{used in the}} production of fuel for nuclear power plants. There has been used a method of laser isotope separation of uranium, employing condensation repression in a free jet. The laser operation with nanosecond pulse irradiation can provide acceptable efficiency in the separating unit and the high effective coefficient of the laser with the wavelength of 5. 3 [*]μm. Receiving a uniform RF discharge under medium pressure and high Mach numbers in the gas stream solves the problem of an electron beam and cryogenic cooler of CO lasers. The laser active medium is being cooled while it is expanding in the nozzle; a low-current RF discharge is similar to a non-self-sustained discharge. In the present work, we have developed a calculation model of optimization and have defined the parameters of a mode-locked CO laser with an RF discharge in the supersonic stream.

40|$|Laser Isotope Enrichment for Medical and Industrial Applications by Jeff Eerkens (University of Missouri), Jay Kunze (Idaho State University), and Leonard Bond (Idaho National Laboratory) The {{principal}} isotope enrichment {{business in}} the world is the enrichment of uranium for commercial power reactor fuels. However, {{there are a number of}} other needs for separated isotopes. Some examples are: 1) Pure isotopic targets for irradiation to produce medical radioisotopes. 2) Pure isotopes for semiconductors. 3) Low neutron capture isotopes for various uses in nuclear reactors. 4) <b>Isotopes</b> for <b>industrial</b> tracer/identification applications. Examples of interest to medicine are targets to produce radio-isotopes such as S- 33, Mo- 98, Mo- 100, W- 186, Sn- 112; while for MRI diagnostics, the non-radioactive Xe- 129 isotope is wanted. For super-semiconductor applications some desired <b>industrial</b> <b>isotopes</b> are Si- 28, Ga- 69, Ge- 74, Se- 80, Te- 128, etc. An example of a low cross section isotope for use in reactors is Zn- 68 as a corrosion inhibitor material in nuclear reactor primary systems. Neutron activation of Ar isotopes is of interest in industrial tracer and diagnostic applications (e. g. oil-logging).. In the past few years there has been a sufficient supply of isotopes in common demand, because of huge Russian stockpiles produced with old electromagnetic and centrifuge separators previously used for uranium enrichment. Production of specialized isotopes in the USA has been largely accomplished using old ”calutrons” (electromagnetic separators) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. These methods of separating isotopes are rather energy inefficient. Use of lasers for isotope separation has been considered for many decades. None of the proposed methods have attained sufficient proof of principal status to be economically attractive to pursue commercially. Some of the authors have succeeded in separating sulfur isotopes using a rather new and different method, known as condensation repression. In this scheme a gas, of the selected isotopes for enrichment, is irradiated with a laser at a particular wavelength that would excite only one of the isotopes. The entire gas is subject to low temperatures sufficient to cause condensation on a cold surface. Those molecules in the gas that the laser excited are not as likely to condense as are the unexcited molecules. Hence the gas drawn out of the system will be enriched in the isotope that was excited by the laser. We have evaluated the relative energy required in this process if applied on a commercial scale. We estimate the energy required for laser isotope enrichment is about 20 % of that required in centrifuge separations, and 2 % of that required by use of &# 34;calutrons&# 34;...|$|R

Results and Conclusion: The result of this research indicates that the level of absorbed dose in various body parts of radiation workers in ordinary work conditions in controlled areas is less than the allowable absorbed dose. Moreover, despite the fact that the irradiation level for the whole body and different body parts are being 10 times more in restricted and prohibited areas, the absorbed dose is also measured to be less than the allowable dose.

40|$|Abstract Lead is a frequent, {{potentially}} toxic pollutant of {{the urban}} environment. Its risk assessment in airborne particulate matter requires data both on its speciation and potential sources. In this paper we present results of a detailed mineralogical (XRD and TEM) and geochemical (selective chemical extractions and lead isotope ratio analyses) study of total suspended particulate (TSP) matter samplesfrom Budapest, Hungary, to fulfill these requirements. Total lead concentrations showed significant enrichment in the studied TSP samples as compared to its geochemical background value. It could be associated with several host phases. The potentially mobile fraction of lead, which could also be harmful to humans, can {{be as high as}} 16 % of the total lead. This is represented by Pb sorbed on the surface of clay minerals and in the form of carbonates (and sulfates). On the other hand, between 20 and 30 % of total lead of TSP material is hosted by magnetite, a highly resistant mineral. However, its rapid oxidation during combustion processes to hematite and/or weathering in the acidifying urban environment to ferrihydrite, may result in the enhanced mobilization of lead. The lead isotope composition of the TSP samples suggests the mixing of several sources for this metal, with slight variation among the sampling sites. Despite the phasing out of leaded gasoline, its contribution to the Pb content of the TSP was observed. Our data also supported that the presence of lead of gasoline origin decreases in the airborne TSP during the last decade in Budapest. Another important source for lead is found to be coal combustion linked to domestic and <b>industrial</b> heating. Lead <b>isotope</b> ratio data suggest additional source(s) for this metal, at least in certain localities, but further investigations are necessary to specify them...|$|R
40|$|For {{detection}} and identification of nuclear material we equipped a transportable container with neutron and gamma measurement systems. The container itself provides the necessary infrastructure, e. g., energy supply, communication means, and work places. In {{case of a}} threat by nuclear terrorist there is urgent need for information on type and quantity of the radioactive respectively nuclear material inside the object. Only with this knowledge {{it is possible to}} estimate the potential risk and to take adequate protective measures. Therefore we improved the system by a new telescope detector. This detector consists of two different HPGe Germanium detectors which are placed one after the other in one detector end-cap. Both detectors are cooled by one small liquid nitrogen dewar. Seen from the window the first detector is an planar germanium detector with high resolution suitable to detect the energy lines of uranium and plutonium gamma rays in the 100 keV range. The signals of this detector are processed by a digital spectrum analyzer. The spectrum is then evaluated with the MGA/MGAU code to determine the uranium and/or plutonium isotope vector. The second detector is a coaxial detector with high efficiency for high energy gammas. Although the efficiency of this detector is considerably reduced by the presence of the planar detector in front, this detector is well suited to detect gamma radiation in the Cs/Co energy range. The signals of the detector are processed by another digital spectrum analyzer and evaluated by standard nuclide identification software. The main advantage of this system in the field of nuclear terrorism is that one mobile device is used for two measurements: uranium and plutonium identifcation and the identifcation of <b>industrial</b> and medical <b>isotopes.</b> This is especially of great use if the system has to be transported to the suspect object with a robot. The paper presents first experiences with the device. This technical improvement may ease the task of identifying suspect objects containing radioactive or nuclear material and thus may help to combat nuclear terrorism...|$|R
40|$|Industrial mega-sites are characterised by the {{multiplicity}} and the generally complex succession of industrial activities. Consequently, {{the history of}} contamination, not always well documented, induces a succession or superposition of contaminant sources and contamination pathways. Assessment of the contamination of the different reservoirs (soil, surface water, groundwater, biota) at a given moment and the related risks for their present and future use {{as well as the}} conception of remediation strategies requires indications on both the origin and the timeline of contamination processes in order to foresee their release and propagation in the receptor milieus. Isotope fingerprinting and groundwater dating increase our ability of disentangling the chronology of multiple contaminations; the large choice of isotopic tools offers the possibility of selecting specific direct or indirect tracers of most inorganic or organic contaminants. Here we present results from an industrial area in Northern France, a former coal mining area, where the first coking plant was installed in 1897. Over the following century, a large diversity of coal-based chemical industries developed on this site, including the treatment of coke oven gas, ammonia and PVC production. Coking activities ceased in 1986, the present day production concerns ammonia water, fertilisers and PVC. Over time, several decantation basins were constructed and two settling zones representing potential contamination pathways for groundwater in the Upper Cretaceous chalk aquifer, partly overlain by Tertiary to Pleistocene sediments and modern alluvial deposits. Main contaminants are cyanides, arsenic, nitrate, ammonium and sulphate, found mainly in groundwater but also, to a lesser extent, in surface waters downstream of the site To complete a comprehensive chemical monitoring programme, a multi-isotope and groundwater dating study was conducted combining delta 15 N and delta 18 O of nitrate, delta 34 S and delta 18 O of sulphate, stable isotopes of the water molecule and delta 11 B of dissolved boron with CFCs and SF 6 as indicators of groundwater residence times. For part of the contaminated groundwaters, mean CFC-derived residence times exceed 30 years so that the contamination can be qualified as historical. A rough anticorrelation of SF 6 with total cyanide and arsenic points to the same conclusion. Arsenic concentrations are not clearly correlated with any major compound or isotope tracer. Nitrate contents are related to ammonium and fertiliser production [1] and are partly limited by denitrification processes induced by the release of organic compounds by the industrial processes. delta 34 S values of sulphate around 0 ‰ vs. CDT are compatible with hydrolysis and oxidation of sulphur produced by coal combustion [2], delta 18 O of sulphate indicates variable contribution of atmospheric oxygen and water depending on the reaction mechanism (hydrolysis-oxidation, or oxidation-hydrolysis, [3]). Boron concentrations and isotope signatures of most groundwaters {{in the vicinity of the}} industrial site and immediately downstream do not significantly differ from upstream baseline values. Boron appears rather as a tracer of groundwater-surface water mixing processes than as co-tracer of the <b>industrial</b> contaminations. Stable <b>isotopes</b> of the water molecule show clear signs of evaporation for the highly contaminated groundwater below the site and directly downstream which indicate a strong impact of decantation basins as vector of contamination...|$|R
