50|$|This is {{a visual}} binary where the {{positions}} of the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> are tracked over time, and used to calculate an orbit. The <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> orbit each other every 55 years. Their orbit is fairly eccentric, at 0.720, and the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> are separated by 0.188&Prime; on average. Both stars are A-type main-sequence stars with similar masses.|$|R
5000|$|Maréchal de camp ("field marshal"(major general)): {{the first}} {{substantive}} rank of general. The maréchaux de camp wore a special uniform, blue and red, {{with a single}} bar of gold lace, and in the late 18th century also received <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> on the shoulder straps. With {{the abolition of the}} rank of brigadier des armées in 1788, it became the lowest general officer rank, but its insignia of <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> remained unchanged. The rank was redesignated Général de brigade in 1793 which retained the <b>two</b> <b>star</b> insignia. This explains why French generals' insignia starts with <b>two</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> of ι Cancri are {{separated}} by 30 arcseconds, changing only slowly. Although no orbit has been derived, the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> show a large common proper motion and {{are assumed to be}} gravitationally related.|$|R
50|$|Tau5 Eridani is a double-lined spectroscopic binary system. The <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> orbit {{each other}} closely with {{a period of}} 6.2 days and an {{eccentricity}} of 0.2. On average, the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> are separated by around 0.183 AU.|$|R
50|$|A circumbinary {{planet is}} a planet that orbits <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> instead of one.Because {{of the short}} orbits of some binary stars, {{the only way for}} planets to form is by forming outside the orbit of the <b>two</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|R

50|$|This is a spectroscopic binary: the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> {{cannot be}} {{individually}} resolved, but periodic Doppler shifts in its spectrum mean {{there must be}} orbital motion. The <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> orbit each other every 5.5226013 days. Their orbit is fairly eccentric, at 0.0844.|$|R
5000|$|... 47 Tauri is {{a visual}} binary, {{meaning that the}} two {{components}} can be resolved, and the orbit {{is derived from the}} positions of the <b>two</b> <b>stars.</b> The primary component is a G-type giant. Its radius is about 13 times that of the Sun. The companion is likely a white-colored A-type main-sequence star that is fainter. The <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> are separated about 1.3 arcseconds away, and because of their large separation, the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> take some 479 years to complete an orbit.|$|R

50|$|In 2010, AMBER {{interferometry}} resolved HD 93250 into <b>two</b> separate <b>stars.</b> No {{relative motion}} or radial velocity variations could be detected {{and so the}} orbit and properties of the <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> is still uncertain. The projected separation of the stars is 1.5 mas, approximately 3.5 astronomical units. The <b>two</b> <b>stars</b> show no measurable colour difference and are both likely to be hot O stars with masses within 10% of each other.|$|R
