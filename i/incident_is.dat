5|$|Arguably, {{the most}} famous {{locomotive}} {{to come out of}} the Rogers shops was built in 1855. Rogers built a 4-4-0, serial number 631, in December of that year for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. The railroad named the locomotive The General. This locomotive, best known for being at the heart of an American Civil War <b>incident,</b> <b>is</b> now on display at the Southern Museum of Civil War and Locomotive History (the Big Shanty Museum) in Kennesaw, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Drinking in {{the village}} pub, Danny and Angel meet Simon Skinner, manager of the local supermarket, and George Merchant, a wealthy {{drunkard}} who made his fortune selling kitchen goods. Danny takes Angel home and the two binge-watch action movies. That evening, an unseen figure causes a gas explosion that destroys Merchant's mansion, killing him. The <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> deemed an accident and Angel is ridiculed for believing otherwise.|$|E
50|$|Not {{all such}} <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> {{distressing}} {{to the youth}} who experienced them. Distressing <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> episodes where youth rated themselves as very or extremely upset or afraid {{as a result of}} the incident.|$|R
50|$|<b>Incidents</b> <b>are</b> {{the result}} of service {{failures}} or interruption. The cause of <b>incidents</b> may <b>be</b> apparent and may be addressed {{without the need for}} further action. <b>Incidents</b> <b>are</b> often assigned priorities (e.g. P1, P2, P3, P4 or High, Medium, Low) based on the impact and urgency of the failure or interruption.|$|R
50|$|The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> {{the subject}} of a book, The Allagash Abductions by Raymond E. Fowler. The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> also dramatized in an episode of Unsolved Mysteries and {{featured}} in the TV program Abducted by UFOs.|$|R
5|$|Giraldus Cambrensis wrote a Life of St Æthelberht, {{probably}} at Hereford during the 1190s. He quotes an incident from Asser {{that occurred during}} the reign of Offa of Mercia, who died in 796. This <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> not in the surviving copies of the manuscript. It is possible that Giraldus had access to a different copy of Asser's work. It is also possible that he is quoting a different work by Asser, which is otherwise unknown, or even that Giraldus is making up the reference to Asser to support his story. The latter is at least plausible, since Giraldus is not always regarded as a trustworthy writer.|$|E
5|$|On 15–16 January 1974, Suharto faced a {{significant}} challenge when violent riots {{broke out in}} Jakarta during visit of Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka. Students demonstrating against increasing dominance of Japanese investors was encouraged by General Sumitro, deputy commander of armed forces. Sumitro was an ambitious general who disliked the strong influence of Suharto's Aspri inner circle. It was reported to Suharto that the riots were engineered by Sumitro who wished to destabilize the regime utilizing the student unrest, resulting in Sumitro's dismissal and forced retirement. This <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> referred as Malari Incident (Malapetaka Lima Belas Januari / Disaster of 15 January). However, Suharto also disbanded Aspri to appease popular dissent.|$|E
5|$|The Tiananmen Square {{self-immolation}} incident {{took place}} in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing, {{on the eve of}} Chinese New Year on 23 January 2001. The <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> disputed; Chinese government sources say that five members of Falun Gong, a spiritual practice that is persecuted in mainland China, set themselves on fire in the square. Falun Gong sources disputed the accuracy of these portrayals, noting that their teachings explicitly forbid violence or suicide. Several Western journalists and scholars also noted inconsistencies in the government's account of event, suggesting the self-immolations were staged by the government to discredit Falun Gong.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: : Research on {{patient safety}} in allied {{healthcare}} is scarce. Our {{aim was to}} document patient safety in primary allied healthcare in the Netherlands and to identify factors associated with incidents. DESIGN AND SUBJECT:: A retrospective study of 1000 patient records in {{a representative sample of}} 20 allied healthcare practices was combined with a prospective incident-reporting study. MEASURES: : All records were reviewed by trained researchers to identify patient safety <b>incidents.</b> The <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> classified and analyzed, using the Prevention and Recovery Information System for Monitoring and Analysis method. Factors associated with <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> examined in a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: : In 18 out of 1000 (1. 8 %; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 0 - 2. 6) records an <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> detected. The main causes of <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> related to errors in clinical decisions (89 %), communication with other healthcare providers (67 %), and monitoring (56 %). The probability of <b>incidents</b> <b>was</b> higher if more care providers had been involved and if patient records were incomplete (37 % of the records). No <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> reported in the prospective study. CONCLUSIONS: : The absolute number of <b>incidents</b> <b>was</b> low, which could imply a low risk of harm in Dutch primary allied healthcare. Nevertheless, incompleteness of the patient records and the fact that <b>incidents</b> <b>were</b> mainly caused through human actions suggest that a focus on clinical reasoning and record keeping is needed to further enhance patient safety. Improvements in record keeping will be necessary before accurate <b>incident</b> reporting will <b>be</b> feasible and valid...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> often replayed in Tonight Show retrospectives and was {{considered}} a major highlight of the 1970s era of the show. The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> also featured in the documentary Mr. Warmth: The Don Rickles Project.|$|R
50|$|The <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> one of {{the main}} themes of {{progressive}} metal band Savatage's concept album The Wake of Magellan. A partially fictionalized version of the <b>incident</b> <b>was</b> the plot of the book The Stowaway by Robert Hough.|$|R
5|$|The {{supposed}} refusals {{from these}} first three artists to participate {{was seen as}} evidence of self-censorship {{out of fear of}} violence from Islamists, which led to much debate in Denmark. The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> properly described.|$|E
5|$|This <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> {{often cited}} {{as an example of}} the Grammy Awards {{selection}} committee being out of touch with popular sentiment, and was named the biggest upset in Grammy history by Entertainment Weekly. Other publications that have included the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance upset in their lists of top Grammy moments include Cracked.com (number one), Time (number ten), and the Ventura County Star (number twenty).|$|E
5|$|In 1823, one of {{her cousins}} was {{forcibly}} conscripted into the Imperial Russian Army as a punishment for celebrating the Constitution of 3 May; this <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> said {{to be one of}} the key events in her life, and one that galvanized her pro-Polish and anti-Russian attitude. In 1829, Plater began a grand tour throughout the historical Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, visiting Warsaw and Kraków, and the battlefield of Raszyn. Her mother died a year later; her father remarried and refused to even meet his daughter. After the outbreak of the November Uprising against Imperial Russia, she became a vocal supporter of the anti-Tsarist sentiments in the lands of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania. She became one of a dozen or so females to join the Uprising, and the most famous of them all.|$|E

5|$|Mulder {{believes}} that the entity travels from victim to victim like a contagion. At his request, Scully performs an autopsy on Chantara's body at the morgue. During the procedure, a conversation between Scully and the coroner's assistant (Tara Karsian) causes the latter to panic about a Hantavirus outbreak. The entity suddenly kills her with the disease. When Mulder discusses the death with Scully, he realizes that Wetzel {{is in danger of}} being revisited by the entity. The agents and police return to the crack house, where the entity has trapped an injured Wetzel in an upstairs room. The agents are unable to enter the room until dawn comes, when the entity disappears and spares Wetzel's life. After the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> over, Scully expresses her sympathies to Mulder that being filmed by a national television crew did not provide the public exposure to paranormal phenomena that he had hoped. However, Mulder remains hopeful, noting that {{it all comes down to}} how the production crew edits the footage together.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1993, Italy posthumously {{decorated}} the four Italian ECMM observers {{killed in the}} attack with the Gold Medal of Military Valor, and the surviving three Italians aboard the second helicopter with the Silver Medal of Military Valor. Eychenne was posthumously promoted to lieutenant commander effective 7 January 1992, and attributed Mort pour la France on 14 April of the same year.

5|$|The Mahabharata portrays Iravan as dying {{a heroic}} {{death in the}} 18-day Kurukshetra War (Mahabharata war), the epic's main subject. However, the South Indian cults have a {{supplementary}} tradition of honouring Aravan's self-sacrifice to the goddess Kali to ensure her favour and {{the victory of the}} Pandavas in the war. The Kuttantavar cult focuses on one of the three boons granted to Aravan by the god Krishna in honour of this self-sacrifice. Aravan requested that he be married before his death. Krishna satisfied this boon in his female form, Mohini. In Koovagam (கூவாகம்), Tamil Nadu, this <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> re-enacted in an 18-day festival, first by a ceremonial marriage of Aravan to ThiruNangais and male villagers (who have taken vows to Aravan) and then by their widowhood after ritual re-enactment of Aravan's sacrifice.|$|E

5|$|Władysław Sikorski's death {{controversy}} {{revolves around}} {{the death of the}} commander-in-chief of the Polish Army and Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, General Władysław Sikorski, in the 1943 B-24 crash in Gibraltar. Sikorski's Liberator II crashed off Gibraltar almost immediately after take off, with the plane's pilot being the only survivor. The catastrophe, while officially classified as an accident, has led to several conspiracy theories that persist to this day, and often propose that the crash was an assassination, which has variously been blamed on the Soviets, British, Nazis or even a dissenting Polish faction. The <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> still described by some historians as mysterious, and since 2008 it has been under an investigation by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, ongoing as of July 2013.|$|E
5|$|Jaquio tells Ryu {{his master}} plan of using Ashtar as a pawn, used to awaken the true evil. He {{plans to use}} the Dark Sword of Chaos to use Irene's life force to open the Gate of Darkness and call up all the demons, while Ryu awakens them from their sleep. Jaquio then {{challenges}} Ryu to a showdown in which Ryu defeats him. Before Ryu and Irene can destroy the evil altar though, Jaquio's blood awakens the Dark Sword, which opens up the Gate of Darkness, shocks Irene and Ryu with its energy. The Demon Jashin arrives through the Gate of Darkness and reanimates the corpse of Jaquio. He then turns into a demonic wall, which Ryu, after borrowing strength from his Dragon Sword, defeats. Jashin is once again sealed away, the Dark Sword then breaks apart, the Gate of Darkness closes and disappears, and Ryu flees with Irene out of the temple just as it collapses. He then begins to mourn for Irene, who is presumed to be dead, when the power of the Dragon Sword revives her. Irene tells Ryu that she felt like she had been dreaming for a long time. Ryu tells her that the <b>incident</b> <b>is</b> over, and the game ends as the two watch the sun set.|$|E
