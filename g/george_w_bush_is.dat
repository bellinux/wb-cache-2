The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers.

25|$|Some of Horowitz's {{accounts}} of U.S. {{colleges and universities}} as bastions of liberal indoctrination have been disputed. For example, Horowitz alleged that a University of Northern Colorado student received a failing grade on a final exam for refusing to write an essay arguing that <b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> a war criminal.

25|$|<b>George</b> <b>W.</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>is</b> {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of capital punishment. During his tenure as Governor of Texas, 152 people were executed in that state, maintaining its record as the leading state in executions. As President of the United States, he has continued in his support for capital punishment, including presiding over the first federal execution in decades, that of convicted terrorist Timothy McVeigh.

A second video was produced, showing Madonna donning military clothing and singing in front of the various flags of the world.
