25|$|John Launer's 2015 {{biography}} of Spielrein (in English) {{is based on}} close readings of <b>her</b> <b>hospital</b> notes, diaries and correspondence, and calls into question many of the received accounts about Spielrein.

Instead, Launer sees her historical importance as someone who made an early attempt to harmonize psychoanalysis and developmental psychology within an overarching biological framework, anticipating modern ideas from attachment theory and evolutionary psychology.|$|E
