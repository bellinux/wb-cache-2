40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} of reusing frequencies of a terrestrial digital video broadcasting (DVB-T) network for a UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) with negligible influence on the DVB-T performance. A frequency division duplex (FDD) UTRAN is deployed such that it can reuse all frequencies of the DVB-T network in each DVB-T <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> in the downlink, with a predefined level of (negligible) interference from the UTRAN to DVBT. The downlinks of both networks can thus coexist in the same frequency spectrum, thereby increasing the spectral efficiency. The uplink of UTRAN-FDD is assumed to operate in traditional non-coexistence and is therefore not considered. Close to 100 % of the capacity of a non-coexisting UTRAN are achievable for typical UTRAN cell sizes, with only marginal increase of outage in the DVB-T network...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Enabling {{underlay}} direct Device-to-Device (D 2 D) communication mode {{in future}} cellular networks has good potential for spectrally-efficient and low-latency support of local media services. Recently, {{it has become}} evident that shrinking the reuse distance over which wireless resources are reused is a key enabler for achieving high spectral efficiency. Moreover, Interference Alignment (IA) based transmission can enhance the capacity of a wireless network by providing more degrees of freedom. In this work, we exploit clustering of D 2 D users, <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> over <b>clusters</b> and then using IA to enhance the sum rate. Specifically, we show that in a D 2 D environment, {{it is possible to}} achieve significant gains in attainable rates by constructing clusters of D 2 D pairs and reuse the available radio resources over the clusters. Moreover, within a cluster, it is possible to further enhance the spectral efficiency by constructing small-sized groups of D 2 D pairs over which IA is applied to offer additional degrees of freedom. We show that resource <b>reuse</b> over the <b>clusters</b> offer overall rate increase proportional to the number of formed clusters. In addition, interference alignment offers up to 33 % increase in the overall rates in the high transmission power regimes compared to the normal Point-to-Point (P 2 P) communication.

40|$|Abstract — Underwater {{acoustic}} {{communications systems}} are {{challenged by the}} characteristics of acoustic propagation through the underwater environment. There are {{a wide range of}} physical processes that impact underwater acoustic communications and the relative importance of these processes are different in different environments. Acoustic propagation is characterized by three major factors: time-varying multipath propagation, low speed of sound and attenuation that increases with signal frequency. Limited bandwidth in these systems is of paramount obstacles. To overcome this problem the idea of <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> pattern seems to be useful. The key characteristic of a cellular network is the ability to re-use frequencies to increase both coverage and capacity. One element that determines <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> is the reuse distance depending on the cell radius and the number of cells per <b>cluster.</b> Analysis of <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> between adjacent <b>clusters</b> and optimal cell-radius selection criteria has been carried out recently. In other recent woks, the parameters of the cellular networks designing have been calculated based on a rough approximation of the attenuation and propagation model. In our work, after driving the ratio of signal to interference for underwater acoustic channels with more accuracy, the constraints for the cell radius are determined. One of the most important results of this contribution is that, for special parameters like bandwidth, it may be impossible to provide the required signal to interference ratio and bandwidth for the network users. Furthermore, in this paper, the number of supportable users, per-user bandwidth, and the user capacity for a cellular underwater network are determined...|$|R

In CAR, cell layout is based on two-tier cell-reuse structure and each cell is allocated one extra channel set for channel alternations and rotations. The extra channel set gives network designer the flexibility to assign channels according to nearest front lobe interference avoidant strategy to enhance co-channel interference ratio (CII). CAR allows deployment of smaller, non-integer <b>reuse</b> <b>cluster</b> sizes based on CII requirements, thus increases <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> efficiency.

Different from device-centric content placement, cluster-centric placement focuses on placing content in each cluster such that the collective performance of all the devices in each cluster is optimized.

Since this restricts the <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> within a <b>cluster</b> to one, and may not also be feasible due to storage/energy limitations, we also characterize the network performance in terms of coverage probability and area spectral efficiency (ASE) for a general class of strategies in which the content of interest for the typical device is available at the kth closest device to the cluster center. Our analysis concretely demonstrates significant improvement in network performance when the content of interest for the typical device is biased to lie closer to the cluster center compared to the case when it is placed at a randomly chosen device.

30|$|A {{second major}} {{issue is the}} payload {{implications}} of the adoption of full <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse.</b> Multibeam Joint Processing can be classified in the more general category of multi-user detection (MUD) techniques. Interfering users are successively decoded/precoded thus allowing for the subtraction of the known interfering signals. This alleviation of interferences enables the full <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> in multibeam system allowing for more aggressive exploitation of the available bandwidth thus leading to higher spectral efficiency. Nevertheless, the added on-board complexity that results from the increase of the <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> in a multibeam satellite system needs to be noted. More aggressive reuse of the spectrum is translated in a proportional {{increase in the number}} of amplifiers accommodated in the satellite payload. Indeed, when advancing from a specific <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> scheme (e.g., four color <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse)</b> to full <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse,</b> the number of on board high-power amplifiers (HPAs) needs to be increased (e.g., four times more HPAs) since each beam will occupy the hole bandwidth of the amplifier. Currently, this proves a heavy burden for the satellite payload hence more simplistic approaches need to be investigated. Added to that, a fairness issue arises in the comparison of multibeam joint decoding to conventional single beam decoding since the first, requires increased power and payload mass compared to the latter.|$|R

In the proposed <b>frequency</b> <b>reuse</b> architecture, all available subcarriers are partitioned into three bands and the cell is divided into two major parts, cell center and cell edge. The edge of the cell is further divided into three regions Interior Edge Band (IEB), Intermediate Band (IB) and Exterior Edge Band (EEB). Cell center uses all three bands with low power and cell edge uses one of three bands. Each band is divided into three sub-bands and allocated at the cell edge with different power levels.
