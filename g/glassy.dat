5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into teardrop-shaped <b>glassy</b> fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even {{take the form of}} long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a <b>glassy</b> matrix with trachytic plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|The spores are elliptical, {{wrinkled}} {{or slightly}} warted, and 10–14 by 5–7.5μm. They are nonamyloid, meaning {{they have a}} negative color reaction with the iodine in Melzer's reagent. The spore-bearing structures, the basidia, are elongated or club-shaped, hyaline (<b>glassy</b> or translucent), and four-spored, with dimensions of 60–90 by 8.5–11.5μm. G.clavatus does not contain cystidia, the sterile cells associated with basidia in many species. Clamp connections are present.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, <b>glassy</b> spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|Atomic carbon {{is a very}} {{short-lived}} species and, therefore, carbon is stabilized {{in various}} multi-atomic structures with different molecular configurations called allotropes. The three relatively well-known allotropes of carbon are amorphous carbon, graphite, and diamond. Once considered exotic, fullerenes are nowadays commonly synthesized and used in research; they include buckyballs, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanobuds and nanofibers. Several other exotic allotropes have also been discovered, such as lonsdaleite (questionable), <b>glassy</b> carbon, carbon nanofoam and linear acetylenic carbon (carbyne).|$|E
5|$|Seamounts are {{volcanic}} mountains which {{rise from}} the seafloor. The unlimited supply of water surrounding these volcanoes can cause them to behave differently from volcanoes on land. The lava emitted in eruptions at Bowie Seamount is made of basalt, a common gray to black or dark brown volcanic rock low in silica content (the lava is mafic). When basaltic lava makes contact with the cold sea water, it may cool very rapidly to form pillow lava, through which the hot lava breaks to form another pillow. Pillow lava is typically fine-grained, due to rapid cooling, with a <b>glassy</b> crust, and has radial jointing.|$|E
5|$|The Aristarchus {{region was}} part of a Hubble Space Telescope study in 2005 that was {{investigating}} the presence of oxygen-rich <b>glassy</b> soils {{in the form of the}} mineral ilmenite. Baseline measurements were made of the Apollo 15 and Apollo 17 landing sites, where the chemistry is known, and these were compared to Aristarchus. The Hubble Advanced Camera for Surveys was used to photograph the crater in visual and ultraviolet light. The crater was determined to have especially rich concentrations of ilmenite, a titanium oxide mineral that could potentially be used in the future by a lunar settlement for extracting oxygen.|$|E
5|$|The most {{apparent}} lava flows at a seamount are the eruptive flows that cover their flanks, however igneous intrusions, in {{the forms of}} dikes and sills, are also {{an important part of}} seamount growth. The most common type of flow is pillow lava, named so after its distinctive shape. Less common are sheet flows, which are <b>glassy</b> and marginal, and indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks dominate shallow-water seamounts. They are the products of the explosive activity of seamounts that are near the water's surface, and can also form from mechanical wear of existing volcanic rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{underwater}} flow is pillow lava, a circular lava flow named after its unusual shape. Less common are <b>glassy,</b> marginal sheet flows, indicative of larger-scale flows. Volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks {{are common in}} shallow-water environments. As plate movement starts to carry the volcanoes away from their eruptive source, eruption rates start to die down, and water erosion grinds the volcano down. The final stages of eruption caps the seamount in alkalic flows. There are about 100,000 deepwater volcanoes in the world, although most are beyond the active stage of their life. Some exemplary seamounts are Loihi Seamount, Bowie Seamount, Davidson Seamount, and Axial Seamount.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a <b>glassy</b> material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E
5|$|Hugh Ross Williamson cites a {{tale about}} St. Collen, {{one of the}} {{earliest}} hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is made of glass so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the <b>glassy</b> mansion of the dead.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the other}} {{discovered}} allotropes, carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997. It {{consists of a}} low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2kg/m. Similarly, <b>glassy</b> carbon contains {{a high proportion of}} closed porosity, but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement. Linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure -(C:::C)-. Carbon in this modification is linear with sp orbital hybridization, and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds. This carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its Young's modulus is forty times that of the hardest known material– diamond.|$|E
5|$|The {{amorphous}} form is {{an assortment}} of carbon atoms in a non-crystalline, irregular, <b>glassy</b> state, not held in a crystalline macrostructure. It is present as a powder, and is the main constituent of substances such as charcoal, lampblack (soot) and activated carbon. At normal pressures, carbon {{takes the form of}} graphite, in which each atom is bonded trigonally to three others in a plane composed of fused hexagonal rings, just like those in aromatic hydrocarbons. The resulting network is 2-dimensional, and the resulting flat sheets are stacked and loosely bonded through weak van der Waals forces. This gives graphite its softness and its cleaving properties (the sheets slip easily past one another). Because of the delocalization of one of the outer electrons of each atom to form a π-cloud, graphite conducts electricity, but only in the plane of each covalently bonded sheet. This results in a lower bulk electrical conductivity for carbon than for most metals. The delocalization also accounts for the energetic stability of graphite over diamond at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{region has}} been used by humans for centuries. Obsidian was {{collected}} by Mono Paiutes for making sharp tools and arrow points. <b>Glassy</b> rock continues to be removed in modern times for use as commercial scour and yard decoration. Mono Mills processed timber felled on or near the volcanoes for the nearby boomtown Bodie in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Water diversions into the Los Angeles Aqueduct system from their natural outlets in Mono Lake started in 1941 after a water tunnel was cut under the Mono Craters. Mono Lake Volcanic Field and {{a large part of the}} Mono Craters gained some protection under Mono Basin National Forest Scenic Area in 1984. Resource use along all of the chain is managed by the United States Forest Service as part of Inyo National Forest. Various activities are possible along the chain, including hiking, bird watching, canoeing, skiing, and mountain biking.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic ash {{particles}} erupted during magmatic eruptions {{are made}} up of various fractions of vitric (<b>glassy,</b> non-crystalline), crystalline or lithic (non-magmatic) particles. Ash produced during low viscosity magmatic eruptions (e.g., Hawaiian and Strombolian basaltic eruptions) produce a range of different pyroclasts dependent on the eruptive process. For example, ash collected from Hawaiian lava fountains consists of sideromelane (light brown basaltic glass) pyroclasts which contain rare microlites (small quench crystals) and phenocrysts. Slightly more viscous eruptions of basalt (e.g., Strombolian) form a variety of pyroclasts from irregular sideromelane droplets to blocky tachylite (black to dark brown microcrystalline pyroclasts). In contrast, most high-silica ash (e.g. rhyolite) consists of pulverised products of pumice (vitric shards), individual phenocrysts (crystal fraction) and some lithic fragments (xenoliths).|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, <b>glassy</b> green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} glaciovolcanism {{is still a}} {{relatively}} new field. Early accounts described the unusual flat-topped steep-sided volcanoes (called tuyas) in Iceland that were suggested to have formed from eruptions below ice. The first English-language paper on the subject was published in 1947 by William Henry Mathews, describing the Tuya Butte field in northwest British Columbia, Canada. The eruptive process that builds these structures, originally inferred in the paper, begins with volcanic growth below the glacier. At first the eruptions resemble those {{that occur in the}} deep sea, forming piles of pillow lava {{at the base of the}} volcanic structure. Some of the lava shatters when it comes in contact with the cold ice, forming a <b>glassy</b> breccia called hyaloclastite. After a while the ice finally melts into a lake, and the more explosive eruptions of Surtseyan activity begins, building up flanks made up of mostly hyaloclastite. Eventually the lake boils off from continued volcanism, and the lava flows become more effusive and thicken as the lava cools much more slowly, often forming columnar jointing. Well-preserved tuyas show all of these stages, for example Hjorleifshofdi in Iceland.|$|E
25|$|Some aqueous {{solutions}} can be supercooled into a <b>glassy</b> state, {{for instance}} LiCl:RH2O (a solution of lithium chloride salt and water molecules) {{in the composition}} range 4<R<8. An aqueous solution containing sugar has a <b>glassy</b> state {{and can be used}} as a surfactant.|$|E
25|$|Slag Hill, another {{parasitic}} subglacial volcano {{located just}} north of Mount Cayley, was erupted during the Pleistocene period, producing <b>glassy</b> lava flows, such as augite-phyric basaltic andesite. These lava flows were cooled to form steep-sided, <b>glassy,</b> finely jointed lava domes comparable to those found at Ember Ridge, and one minor, flat-topped bluff.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} a pale, <b>glassy</b> green with {{longitudinal}} ridges {{except on the}} top.|$|E
25|$|This is the {{quenched}} {{product of}} sulfur melts above 160°C (at {{this point the}} properties of the liquid melt change remarkably, e.g. large increase in viscosity). Its form changes from an initial plastic form gradually to a <b>glassy</b> form, hence its other names of plastic, <b>glassy</b> or vitreous sulfur. It is also called χ-sulfur. It contains a complex mixture of catena-sulfur forms mixed with cyclo-forms.|$|E
25|$|The <b>glassy</b> Modernist {{building}} at 525 East 85th Street {{was built in}} 1958. Its architect was Paul Mitarachi.|$|E
25|$|Soft-paste {{porcelain}} made in England {{from about}} 1745 used a white-firing clay {{with the addition}} of a <b>glassy</b> frit.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally, {{the name}} trinitite is broadly {{applied to all}} <b>glassy</b> {{residues}} of nuclear bomb testing, not just the Trinity test.|$|E
25|$|It {{is fired}} at a medium temperature, up to , which {{gives it a}} much better body than soft-paste objects with a <b>glassy</b> frit.|$|E
25|$|Black arsenic {{can also}} be formed by cooling vapor at around 100–220°C. It is <b>glassy</b> and brittle. It is also a poor {{electrical}} conductor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{gasification}} processes treat ash containing {{heavy metals}} {{at very high}} temperatures {{so that it is}} released in a <b>glassy</b> and chemically stable form.|$|E
25|$|Peridotite {{is named}} for the {{gemstone}} peridot, a <b>glassy</b> green gem mined in Asia and Arizona (Peridot Cove). Some peridotite is mined for ornamental stone.|$|E
25|$|On Monday 27 February Darwin {{presented}} a {{talk to the}} Cambridge Philosophical Society on <b>glassy</b> tubes he had found amongst Maldonado sand dunes, explained by lightning having fused the sand.|$|E
25|$|The {{regolith}} contains rocks, {{fragments of}} minerals {{from the original}} bedrock, and <b>glassy</b> particles formed during the impacts. In most of the lunar regolith, half of the particles are made of mineral fragments fused by the <b>glassy</b> particles; these objects are called agglutinates. The chemical composition of the regolith varies according to its location; the regolith in the highlands is rich in aluminium and silica, just as the rocks in those regions. The regolith in the maria is rich in iron and magnesium and is silica-poor, as are the basaltic rocks from which it is formed.|$|E
25|$|Slag-like {{granulated}} corium, slag-like irregular gray-magenta to dark-brown <b>glassy</b> granules with crust. Formed by prolonged contact {{of brown}} ceramics with water, located in large heaps in both {{levels of the}} Pressure Suppression Pool.|$|E
25|$|When the {{temperature}} {{is less than the}} glass transition temperature, , the activation energy of viscosity is high because the amorphous materials are in the <b>glassy</b> state and most of their joining bonds are intact.|$|E
25|$|The {{impact of}} micrometeoroids, {{sometimes}} travelling faster than , generates enough heat to melt or partially vaporize dust particles. This melting and refreezing welds particles together into <b>glassy,</b> jagged-edged agglutinates, reminiscent of tektites found on Earth.|$|E
25|$|In {{various sources}} such as dictionaries, scrying often is {{described}} as crystal gazing, {{but in fact the}} media, terminologies, and methods of different practitioners vary arbitrarily and need not involve crystals or <b>glassy</b> materials at all.|$|E
25|$|If the pouring {{temperature}} {{is too high}} or a sand {{of low melting point}} is used then the sand can fuse to the casting. When this happens the surface of the casting produced has a brittle, <b>glassy</b> appearance.|$|E
25|$|Non-slagging gasifiers produce dry ash {{similar to}} that {{produced}} by conventional coal combustion, which can be an environmental liability if the ash (typically containing heavy metals) is leachable or caustic, and if the ash must be stored in ash ponds. Slagging gasifiers, which are utilized at many of the major coal gasification applications worldwide, have considerable advantage in that ash components are fused into a <b>glassy</b> slag, capturing trace heavy metals in the non-leachable <b>glassy</b> matrix, rendering the material non-toxic. This non-hazardous slag has multiple beneficial uses such as aggregate in concrete, aggregate in asphalt for road construction, grit in abrasive blasting, roofing granules, etc.|$|E
