5|$|Various {{inflammatory}} {{processes and}} cytokines {{may also have}} a role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation is a general marker of tissue damage in any disease, and may be either secondary to tissue damage in AD or a marker of an immunological response. There is increasing evidence of a strong interaction between the neurons and the immunological mechanisms in the brain. Obesity and systemic inflammation may interfere with immunological processes which promote <b>disease</b> <b>progression.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E

5|$|Stowell's article {{attracted}} intense attention, {{and placed}} Albert Victor {{among the most}} notable Ripper suspects, but his innocence was soon proven. Gull died before Albert Victor, and so {{could not have known}} about Albert Victor's death. All three doctors who were attending Albert Victor at his death in 1892 concurred that he had died of pneumonia, and given the timescale of syphilitic <b>disease</b> <b>progression,</b> it is highly improbable that Albert Victor had syphilis. The first symptoms of mental illness that arise from syphilitic infection tend to occur about 15 years from first exposure. While the timescale of <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> is never absolute, for Albert Victor to have suffered from syphilitic insanity in 1888, he would probably have to have been infected at the age of nine in about 1873, six years before he visited the West Indies. Stowell claimed that his suspect had been incarcerated in a mental institution, when Albert Victor was serving in the British army, making regular public appearances, and visiting friends at country houses. Newspaper reports, Queen Victoria's diary, family letters, and official documents prove that Albert Victor was attending functions in public, or meeting foreign royalty, or hundreds of miles from London at the time of each of the five canonical murders.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|Motor symptoms, if not treated, advance aggressively in {{the early}} stages of the disease and more slowly later. Untreated, {{individuals}} are expected to lose independent ambulation after an average of eight years and be bedridden after ten years. However, it is uncommon to find untreated people nowadays. Medication has improved the prognosis of motor symptoms, while at the same time it is a new source of disability, because of the undesired effects of levodopa after years of use. In people taking levodopa, the progression time of symptoms to a stage of high dependency from caregivers may be over 15 years. However, it is hard to predict what course the disease will take for a given individual. Age is the best predictor of <b>disease</b> <b>progression.</b> The rate of motor decline is greater in those with less impairment at the time of diagnosis, while cognitive impairment is more frequent in those who are over 70 years of age at symptom onset.|$|E

40|$|The {{neuropathology}} of Alzheimer {{disease is}} characterized by senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and cell death. These hallmarks develop according to the differential vulnerability of brain networks, senile plaques accumulating preferentially in the associative cortical areas and neurofibrillary tangles in the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. We suggest that the main aetiological hypotheses such as the beta-amyloid cascade hypothesis or its variant, the synaptic beta-amyloid hypothesis, will have to consider neural networks not just as targets of degenerative processes but also as contributors of the <b>disease's</b> <b>progression</b> and of its phenotype. Three domains of research are highlighted in this review. First, the cerebral reserve and the redundancy of the network's elements are related to brain vulnerability. Indeed, an enriched environment appears to increase the cerebral reserve {{as well as the}} threshold of disease's onset. Second, <b>disease's</b> <b>progression</b> and memory performance cannot be explained by synaptic or neuronal loss only, but also by the presence of compensatory mechanisms, such as synaptic scaling, at the microcircuit level. Third, some phenotypes of Alzheimer disease, such as hallucinations, appear to be related to progressive dysfunction of neural networks as a result, for instance, of a decreased signal to noise ratio, involving a diminished activity of the cholinergic system. Overall, converging results from studies of biological as well as artificial neural networks lead to the conclusion that changes in neural networks contribute strongly to Alzheimer <b>disease's</b> <b>progression...</b>|$|R

5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. Then, if complete pain relief is not achieved or <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that, {{in spite of the}} fact that motor {{symptoms}} manifest late in the course of Alzheimer's <b>disease</b> (AD), neuropathological <b>progression</b> in the motor cortex parallels that in other brain areas generally considered more specific targets of the neurodegenerative process. It has been suggested that motor cortex excitability is enhanced in AD from the early stages, and that this is related to <b>disease's</b> severity and <b>progression.</b> To investigate the neurophysiological hallmarks of motor cortex functionality in early AD we combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with electroencephalography (EEG). We demonstrated that in mild AD the sensorimotor system is hyperexcitable, despite the lack of clinically evident motor manifestations. This phenomenon causes a stronger response to stimulation in a specific time window, possibly due to locally acting reinforcing circuits, while network activity and connectivity is reduced. These changes could be interpreted as a compensatory mechanism allowing for the preservation of sensorimotor programming and execution over a long period of time, regardless of the <b>disease's</b> <b>progression...</b>|$|R

25|$|In RTOG {{clinical}} trial 0129, {{in which all}} patients with advanced disease received radiation and chemotherapy, a retrospective analysis (recursive-partitioning analysis, or RPA) at three years identified three risk groups for survival (low, intermediate, and high) based on HPV status, smoking, T stage and N stage (see Ang et al., Fig. 2). HPV status was the major determinant of survival, followed by smoking history and stage. 64% were HPV+ and all were in the low and intermediate risk group, with all non-smoking HPV+ patients in the low risk group. 82% of the HPV+ patients were alive at three years compared to 57% of the HPV- patients, a 58% reduction {{in the risk of}} death. Locoregional failure is also lower in HPV+, being 14% compared to 35% for HPV-. HPV positivity confers a 50–60% lower risk of <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> and death, but the use of tobacco is an independently negative prognostic factor. A pooled analysis of HPV+OPC and HPV-OPC patients with <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> in RTOG trials 0129 and 0522 showed that although less HPV+OPC experienced <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> (23 v. 40%), the median time to <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> following treatment was similar (8 months). The majority (65%) of recurrences in both groups occurred within the first year after treatment and were locoregional.

25|$|Arterial ultrasound, {{especially}} of the carotid arteries, with measurement of {{the thickness of the}} artery wall, offers a way to partially track the <b>disease</b> <b>progression.</b> As of 2006, the thickness, commonly referred to as IMT for intimal-medial thickness, is not measured clinically though it has been used by some researchers since the mid-1990s to track changes in arterial walls. Traditionally, clinical carotid ultrasounds have only estimated the degree of blood lumen restriction, stenosis, a result of very advanced disease. The National Institute of Health did a five-year $5 million study, headed by medical researcher Kenneth Ouriel, to study intravascular ultrasound techniques regarding atherosclerotic plaque.
