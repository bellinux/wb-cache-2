40|$|Abstract:- In recent years, {{there has}} {{dramatic}} proliferation of research concerned with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID). The RFID technologies are getting considerable attentions not only academic research {{but also the}} applications of enterprise. One of most important issues of applications is the <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> location. Many researchers have used varied technologies to perform the tracking of <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> location. In this paper, we will purpose a new method using RFID tags to perform <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> location tracking, too. This method uses Received Signal Strength (RSS) to collect signal strength from reference tags beforehand. Next, signal strength is used to set up Power Level areas of ranges by reference tags. And then, using signal strength from reference tags to match signal strength by track tags. Finally, when track tags is set up into indoor environments, it will find out the position of neighboring reference tags, and using arithmetic mean to calculate the location values. A preliminary experiment proves that our method provides a better precision than LANDMRC system.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to improve the precision in tracking of an ultra-wideband (UWB) based Local Positioning System (LPS). This work is motivated by the approach taken to improve the accuracies in the Global Positioning System (GPS), through noise modeling and augmentation. Since UWB <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> tracking is accomplished using methods {{similar to that of the}} GPS, the same two general approaches can be used to improve accuracy. Trilateration calculations are affected by errors in distance measurements from the set of fixed points to the object of interest. When these errors are systemic, each distinct set of fixed points can be said to exhibit a unique set noise. For UWB <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> tracking, the set of fixed points is a set of sensors measuring the distance to a tracked tag. In this work we develop a noise model for this sensor set noise, along with a particle filter that uses our set noise model. To the author’s knowledge, this noise has not been identified and modeled for an LPS. We test our methods on a commercially available UWB system in a real world setting. From the results w...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> {{tracking}} problem under the variation of received signal strength (RSS) characteristic from the changes of device statuses and environmental factors. A novel <b>indoor</b> <b>position</b> tracking algorithmis introduced to provide reliable position estimates by integrating motion sensor-based positioning (i. e., dead-reckoning) and RSS-based fingerprinting positioning with Kalman filter. In {{the presence of}} the RSS variation, RSS-based fingerprinting positioning provides unreliable results due to different characteristics of RSS measurements in the offline and online phases, and the tracking performance is degraded. To mitigate the effect of the RSS variation, a recursive least square estimation-based self-calibration algorithm is proposed that estimates the RSS variation parameters and provides the mapping between the offline and online RSS measurements. By combining the Kalman filter-based tracking algorithm with the self-calibration, the proposed algorithm can achieve higher tracking accuracy even in severe RSS variation conditions. Through extensive computer simulations, we have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms other position tracking algorithms without self-calibration.
