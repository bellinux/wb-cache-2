5000|$|Heavy-gauge forming {{utilizes}} {{the same}} basic process as continuous thin-gauge sheet forming, typically draping the heated plastic sheet over a mold. Many heavy-gauge forming applications use vacuum only in the form process, although some use two halves of mating form tooling and include air pressure to help form. Aircraft windscreens and machine gun turret windows spurred the advance of heavy-gauge forming technology during World War II. Heavy-gauge parts are used as cosmetic surfaces on permanent structures such as kiosks, automobiles, trucks, medical equipment, material handling equipment, refrigerators, spas, and shower enclosures, and electrical and electronic equipment. Unlike most thin-gauge thermoformed parts, heavy-gauge parts are often hand-worked after forming for trimming to final shape or for additional <b>drilling,</b> <b>cutting,</b> or finishing, depending on the product. Heavy-gauge products typically are of a [...] "permanent" [...] end use nature, while thin-gauge parts are more often designed to be disposable or recyclable and are primarily used to package or contain a food item or product. Heavy-gauge thermoforming is typically used for production quantities of 250 to 3000 annually, with lower tooling costs and faster product development than competing plastic technologies like injection molding.|$|E
5000|$|Under normal usage, swarf {{is carried}} {{up and away}} from the tip of the drill bit by the fluting of the drill bit. The cutting edges produce more chips which {{continue}} the movement of the chips outwards from the hole. This is successful until the chips pack too tightly, either because of deeper than normal holes or insufficient backing off (removing the drill slightly or totally from the hole while <b>drilling).</b> <b>Cutting</b> fluid is sometimes used to ease this problem and to prolong the tool's life by cooling and lubricating the tip and chip flow. Coolant may be introduced via holes through the drill shank, which is common when using a gun drill. When cutting aluminum in particular, cutting fluid helps ensure a smooth and accurate hole while preventing the metal from grabbing the drill bit in the process of drilling the hole. When cutting brass, and other soft metals that can grab the drill bit and causes [...] "chatter", a face of approx. 1-2 millimeters can be ground on the cutting edge to create an obtuse angle of 91 to 93 degrees. This prevents [...] "chatter" [...] during which the drill tears rather than cuts the metal. However, with that shape of bit cutting edge, the drill is pushing the metal away, rather than grabbing the metal. This creates high friction and very hot swarf.For heavy feeds and comparatively deep holes oil-hole drills are used in the drill bit, with a lubricant pumped to the drill head through a small hole in the bit and flowing out along the fluting. A conventional drill press arrangement can be used in oil-hole drilling, but it is more commonly seen in automatic drilling machinery in which it is the workpiece that rotates rather than the drill bit.|$|E
30|$|In {{comparing}} the cumulative {{performance of the}} three fluid systems on average CTE (Fig.Â  19), the optimum observed average CTE was achieved with HWBM. The least average CTE was achieved with fresh water, while BWBM have better average CTE than fresh water. Increased cuttings interactions with HLE have led to its more cuttings recovery to the surface compared {{with the other two}} fluids. The synergy existing between fluid velocity and buoyancy force in HLE bearing mud sample was higher compared to that ofÂ BWBM as the momentum of the flow in HWBM observed during the experiments was higher compared with fresh water and BWBM. Furthermore, HLE associated with WBM shows chemical stability in WBM as surface force easily balance the gravity force and adhered to <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings,</b> resulting in increased drag force action to <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings.</b> This action can easily lift <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> to the surface. For example, for vertical portion of the well (0 Â°), HWBM on average transported about 5.43 % and 9.94 % more <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> than BWBM and fresh water, respectively, while BWBM transported 4.77 % more <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> than fresh water. Similar trend of result was achieved at 45 Â°, 60 Â°, 75 Â°, and 90 Â°. Therefore, it can be suggested that the HLE bearing mud sample contain improved rheological properties than BWBM which significantly enhance the mudâs carrying capacity of <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings.</b>|$|R

30|$|Two {{velocity}} vectors acts on <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> {{in opposite}} direction in vertical annulus, {{and they are}} gravity force pulling them downward and annular fluid velocity pushing them upward. At any time, the fluid velocity is able to surpass the effects of gravity on the <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> owing to synergistic relationship between the fluid velocity and the buoyant force triggered by difference in density, cuttings in the vertical annulus have the tendency to transports out of the annulus. This explained phenomenon is responsible for achieving the highest CTE at 0 Â° hole-angle of this study. In the highly deviated and horizontal portion of the annulus, the cuttings slip velocity vector can be grouped into two components; one working contrary to the fluid velocity, in which it decreases with increasing hole-angle, and the other component driving the cuttings towards the low side-wall of the annulus. This force acting on <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> increases as hole-angle increases, {{as can be seen}} in the range of 35 Â°â 60 Â° hole-angles. When this happens, the <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> are forced towards the low side-wall of the annulus. Furthermore, as the hole-angle increases beyond 60 Â°, the declining nature of the CTE observed at 35 Â°â 60 Â° hole-angles was reversed, and the CTE started to increase again. The increasing trend continued to 90 Â° hole-angle. The sudden change of declining CTE from 35 to 60 Â° hole-angles to nonstop increase from 60 Â° to 90 Â° hole-angles could be credited to the fact that <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> at 60 Â° angle and above are stable and have reduced effects of gravity, indicating reduced <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> avalanched (constant sliding downwards of <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings).</b> Therefore, appropriate hydraulic power could be needed for better cuttings transportation in high-hole angles portion of the well.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Environmental technologyThe North Sea {{contains}} several oil-based <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles {{which have}} accumulated on the seabed {{as a result}} of oil and gas production. An increased awareness of the contaminants within these piles has grown over the years since several platforms are to be decommissioned. Possible relocation of cuttings piles might result in release of contaminants from the <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings,</b> possibly affecting local organisms. It has been of interest to determine rates at which contaminants, total hydrocarbon (THC) in particular, are leaching out to the environment from these piles. This can be done by physical analyses in the laboratory, such as shaking tests, or by mathematical models. The Norwegian Climate and Pollution Agency (Klif) has prepared risk assessment guidelines for contaminated sediments in coastal areas and fjords which includes diffusion calculations. The objective of this thesis is to examine if these guidelines can be used to calculate leaching rates from oil-based <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles in the North Sea. Data from <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles at Statfjord A was used as basis for the calculations in this study. THC is the main contaminant of concern, determining the leaching rate of THC would therefore be preferred. This was not possible however, {{due to the fact that}} THC is not included in the guidelines. The leaching rates are thus calculated based on poly aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which often represent the most toxic part of <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles. The calculated maximum and mean PAH leaching rates, based on equations given in Klifâs guidelines, was determined to be 41, 2 kg/year and 3, 40 kg/year respectively. Several factors of uncertainty with regards to these calculations, such as extensive use of default values and the possibility that processes not included in the guidelines might contribute to the spreading, and lack of comparison values, makes it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of these leaching rates. However, the estimated time to drain the sediment for contaminants was rapid for some of the PAHs, which might indicate overestimations in the calculations. The environmental impact results show that several of the PAHs are exceeding their respective limit values given in Klifâs guidelines. This might indicate that leaching of PAHs from the <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles might affect the species living in, on or possibly near the <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles. This study shows that there are several limitations when using Klifâs guidelines to determine leaching rates from oil-based <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles. Critical parameters are deficient from both the guidelines and the <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> characterization reports to be able to get reliable results. In addition, uncertainty arises due to the fact that the guidelines are based on conditions in harbors and coastal areas and not conditions present in the North Sea. The sum of these uncertainties indicates that the calculated results cannot be considered reliable, and that the present guideline is not feasible to use on oilcontaminated <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles. However, the study might provide useful information on factors that should be present to calculate leaching rates from oil-based <b>drill</b> <b>cuttings</b> piles...|$|R

The transportation of <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> becomes more challenging when drilling a high angle or horizontal well. A sufficiently high annular mud velocity is essential to prevent <b>drilled</b> <b>cuttings</b> from settling and forming stationary beds on the low side of a hole.
