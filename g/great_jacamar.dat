It is found in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Panama, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela, where its natural habitat is subtropical and tropical moist lowland forests.|$|E

40|$|A new genus {{of chewing}} louse as Bobdalgleishia, and its type species Bobdalgleishia stephanophallus sp. n. (Phthiraptera) {{belonging}} to the Brueelia-complex (Ischnocera: Philopteridae) are described. Adults of the new species are fully described, illustrated and compared morphologically with the type species of Motmotnirmus Mey & Barker, 2014, which is its closest relative. The type host of B. stephanophallus is a subspecies of the <b>great</b> <b>jacamar</b> Jacamerops aureus ridgwayi Todd, 1943, an endemic Amazonian bird distributed in northern Brazil, and the type locality is the State of Par√°. Bobdalgleishia is a remarkable genus with unique morphological and chaetotaxic characters which readily separate it from {{other members of the}} Brueelia-complex, in particular by having the first two marginal temporal and ocular setae very long...|$|E
