40|$|Plastic {{materials}} such as polyurethane (PUR), polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are widely used in double-lumen extension tubing. The purposes of our study were to 1) compare in vitro drug delivery through the double <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> available on the market 2) assess the plastic properties of PUR in infusion devices {{and their impact on}} drug delivery. The study compared eight double-lumen <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> in PUR, co-extruded (PE/PVC) plastic and plasticised PVC from different manufacturers. Isosorbide dinitrate and diazepam were used as model compounds to evaluate their sorption on the internal surface of the infusion device. Control experiments were performed using norepinephrine known not to absorb to plastics. Drug concentrations delivered at the egress of <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> were determined over time by an analytical spectrophotometric UV-Vis method. The main characteristics of plastics were also determined. Significant differences in the sorption phenomenon were observed among the eight double-lumen <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> and between pairs of <b>extension</b> <b>tubes.</b> Mean concentrations of isosorbide dinitrate delivered at the egress of double-lumen <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> after a 150 -minute infusion (mean values ± standard deviation in percentage of the initial concentrations in the prepared syringes) ranged between 80. 53 ± 1. 66 (one of the PUR tubes) and 92. 84 ± 2. 73 (PE/PVC tube). The same parameters measured during diazepam infusion ranged between 48. 58 ± 2. 88 (one of the PUR tubes) and 85. 06 ± 3. 94 (PE/PVC <b>tube).</b> The double-lumen <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> in PUR were either thermosetting (resin) or thermoplastic according to reference. Clinicians must be aware of potential drug interactions with <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> materials and so must consider their nature as well as the sterilisation method used before selecting an infusion device...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT It {{is common}} {{practice}} to wash and reuse low-profile gastrostomy (LPG) <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> {{for several weeks}} or {{as long as the}} tubes remain functional. This laboratory study investigated three different cleaning methods and their effectiveness for lowering the microbial contamination of <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> challenged with Staph-ylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Candida albicans, and Acinetobacter. The Food and Drug Admin-istration (FDA) limit of an aerobic plate count exceeding 10, 000 (10 “) organisms per gram of product for microbial contamination of enteral formulas was used as the stan-dard. One hundred thirty-two <b>extension</b> <b>tubes</b> were used (66 analyzed a t 8 days and the remaining 66 analyzed at 18 days), 30 per each inoculated group and 12 with uninoculated formula.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundOperator {{radiation}} exposure is high during coronary procedures. The radial access decreases {{the rate of}} local vascular complications but increases operator {{radiation exposure}}. As the X-ray exposure {{is related to the}} distance between the operator and the radiation source, the use of an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> between the proximal part of the coronary catheter and the ‘injection device’ might decrease operator radiation exposure. AimsTo demonstrate that the use of an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> during coronary procedures performed through the radial approach decreases operator radiation. MethodsOverall, 230 patients were included consecutively and randomized to procedures performed with or without an <b>extension</b> <b>tube.</b> Radiation exposure measures were obtained using two electronic dosimeters, one under the lead apron and the other exposed on the physician's left arm. ResultsA non-significant trend towards lower left-arm operator exposure was noted in the <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> group (28. 7 ± 31. 0 μSv vs 38. 4 ± 44. 2 μSv, p= 0. 0739). No significant difference was noted according to the type of procedure. Radiation levels were low compared with the series published previously and decreased for each operator during the study. ConclusionThe use of an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> did not reduce operator radiation exposure during procedures performed through the radial approach. However, physician awareness was increased during the study due to the use of an exposed electronic dosimeter. The use of exposed electronic dosimeters could therefore be recommended to allow operators to improve their protection techniques...|$|R

40|$|Endotracheal {{intubation}} in mice is both {{a common}} and important technique. However, {{it is a difficult}} procedure because of the small orotracheal size and the success rate is variable. There have been many reports of refined techniques that facilitate intubation but only a few reports have proposed how to verify the proper placement of the endotracheal tube. We describe a novel, safe and reliable method to confirm endotracheal intubation in mice using an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> for intravenous infusion. One drop of water was instilled in the <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> and connected {{to the end of the}} catheter used as an endotracheal tube. When the catheter was inserted correctly into the trachea, the water in the <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> oscillated in synchrony with the movement of the mouse’s thorax, indicating correct placement of the catheter. This method was simple, reliable and use materials that are routinely available. This method is helpful for experimental mouse models that require airway access...|$|R
40|$|A {{double-blind}} within-patient {{investigation was}} performed {{to determine whether the}} interposition of an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> (10 cm length X 3. 2 cm diameter) between a metered dose inhaler and the mouth alters the bronchodilator efficacy of terbutaline sulphate. On two consecutive study days 14 adult patients with stable reversible airways obstruction inhaled a cumulative dose of 500 micrograms of terbutaline which was delivered from a metered dose inhaler with or without the <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> attached and received placebo in a similar manner. The drug was inhaled in doses of 125, 125, and 250 micrograms at 20 minutes intervals. The following measurements were made: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), thoracic gas volume (TGV), and specific airways conductance (sGaw). These were done immediately before and at five and 15 minute intervals after each dose, and were repeated 90, 120, 180, 240, and 300 minutes after the first inhalation of terbutaline. Administration of terbutaline with and without an <b>extension</b> <b>tube</b> achieved significant bronchodilation at all dose levels in all respiratory variables (p < 0. 001). There was no statistically significant difference in FEV 1, FVC, PEFR, and sGaw values at any time or dose level with either method of administration.

5000|$|CONTAX AX - This had {{a unique}} {{autofocus}} system that worked with manual focus lenses {{by moving the}} film plane inside the camera. A side benefit of this arrangement is that it allowed the AX to feature a macro mode which worked much like a built-in 10 mm <b>extension</b> <b>tube,</b> allowing for a magnification ratio higher than 1:1 {{without the use of}} bellows or <b>extension</b> <b>tubes.</b> By using of a special adaptor made by Kyocera, Hasselblad V-series lenses could also be used on all CONTAX C/Y mount cameras.
