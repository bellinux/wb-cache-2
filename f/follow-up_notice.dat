This report shows a 6 -year-old boy diagnosed with factitious oral ulcers that occurred after the self-biting of buccal vestibule and nail-scratching of gingival tissue. Clinically, a significant swelling was observed, hard on palpation, located at the right lower third of the face, next to the posterior area of the mandible. In the intraoral examination, ulcers at different healing stages were noted on the swelling area. During the anamnesis, the father reported a change in his familial structure that triggers psychological stress, providing the clues to the presumptive diagnosis of factitious oral ulcers.

40|$|Introduction: Surgery for hypospadias {{has been}} {{continuously}} evolving, implying thereby {{that no single}} technique is perfect and suitable {{for all types of}} hypospadias. Snodgrass technique is presently the most common surgical procedure performed for hypospadias. Materials and Methods: We analysed the results of tunica vaginalis flap (TVF) as an additional cover to the tubularised incised plate (TIP) repair. Results: A total of 35 patients of hypospadias were repaired using TIP urethroplasty and TVF as a second layer. Mean age at the time of presentation was 6. 63 ± 3. 4 years. Post-operative complications namely wound infection, flap necrosis, scrotal haematoma, scrotal abscess, urethral fistula, meatal stenosis were recorded and analysed during follow-up period. Need for re-do surgery was considered as failure of the operative procedure. Out of 35 patients, 8 (22. 85 %) patients had proximal penile hypospadias and 27 (77. 14 %) patients had distal penile hypospadias. Mean post-operative follow-up was 24. 53 months.

40|$|Purpose – Given {{the calls}} for {{increased}} ethics education following recent corporate collapses, this paper aims to examine the significance of ethical issues that challenge the profession and, more specifically, professional accounting bodies. Design/methodology/approach – The study assesses the perceptions via an online survey of 66 professional accounting bodies worldwide in respect of ethical issues, potential causes of ethical failure {{and the need for}} ethics education. Findings – Respondents identified a number of important challenges including conflicts of interest, earnings management and whistle-blowing. The findings also demonstrate strong support for participation in prescribing the nature of ethics education by members of professional accounting bodies. Research limitations/implications – The results of this study are based on feedback from 41 per cent of member bodies of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC). Despite a number of <b>follow-up</b> reminder <b>notices,</b> some regions are under-represented in the responses to the survey distributed to the (then) 160 member bodies of IFAC. Geographic isolation and language limitations contributed to the failure to gain a higher response rate.

BACKGROUND Hypertensive postmenopausal women have been shown to have abnormal endothelium-dependent vascular function. However, FMD may change over time, according to antihypertensive treatment; the prognostic value of these changes has not been investigated. METHODS A total of 400 consecutive postmenopausal women with mild-to-moderate hypertension and impaired FMD underwent ultrasonography of the brachial artery at baseline and after six months, while optimal control of blood pressure was achieved using antihypertensive therapy. They were then followed up for a mean period of 67 months (range 57 to 78). Endothelial function was measured as FMD of the brachial artery, using high-resolution ultrasound. RESULTS After six months of treatment, FMD had not changed (less than or equal to 10 % relative to baseline) in 150 (37. 5 %) of 400 women (group 1), whereas it had significantly improved (> 10 % relative to baseline) in the remaining 250 women (62. 5 %) (group 2).

40|$|Objective: Nicotinamide {{nucleotide}} transhydrogenase (NNT), one of {{the several}} genes recently discovered in familial glucocorticoid deficiencies (FGD), is involved in reactive oxygen species detoxification, suggesting that extra-adrenal manifestations may occur, due to the sensitivity to oxidative stress of other organs rich in mitochondria. Here, we sought to identify NNT mutations in a large cohort of patients with primary congenital adrenal insufficiency without molecular etiology and evaluate the degree of adrenal insufficiency and onset of extra-adrenal damages. Methods: Sanger or massive parallel sequencing of NNT and patient monitoring. Results: Homozygous or compound heterozygous NNT mutations occurred frequently (26 %, 13 unrelated families, 18 patients) in our cohort. Seven new mutations were identified: p. Met 337 Val, p. Ala 863 Glu, c. 3 G>A (p. Met 1 ?), p. Arg 129 ∗, p. Arg 379 ∗, p. Val 665 Profs∗ 29 and p. Ala 704 Serfs∗ 19. The most frequent mutation, p. Arg 129 ∗, was found recurrently in patients from Algeria. Most patients were diagnosed belatedly (8 - 18 months) after presenting severe hypoglycemia; others experiencing stress conditions were diagnosed earlier. Five patients also had mineralocorticoid deficiency at onset. One patient had congenital hypothyroidism and two cryptorchidism. In <b>follow-up,</b> we <b>noticed</b> gonadotropic and genitalia impairments (precocious puberty, testicular inclusions, interstitial Leydig cell adenoma, azoospermia), hypothyroidism and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Intrafamilial phenotype heterogeneity was also observed. Conclusions: NNT should be sequenced, not only in FGD, but also in all primary adrenal insufficiencies for which the most frequent etiologies have been ruled out. As NNT is involved in oxidative stress, careful follow-up is needed to evaluate mineralocorticoid biosynthesis extent, and gonadal, heart and thyroid function.

Arterial function may change over time according to treatment, but the prognostic value of these changes has not been investigated. Objectives: The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess whether an improvement in large artery rigidity in response to treatment, could predict a more favorable prognosis in a population of men with CAD. Methods: A total of 161 men with CAD (mean age 56. 8 &plusmn; 10. 9 years) being treated with conventional therapy underwent brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (PWVba) measurements at baseline and after six months. Follow-up period was 3. 5 years. End-points were major adverse cardiac events (MACE) : acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary intervention, or cardiac death. Results: During the three-year follow-up period (since initial six-month follow-up), 30 patients experienced MACE. After six-month follow-up, PWVba had not improved (∆PWVba &ge; 0 %, relative to baseline) in 85 (52. 8 %) of 161 men (Group 1), whereas it had improved (∆PWVba &lt; 0 %) in the remaining 76 men (47. 2 %) (Group 2).

We also examined firm size as a potential moderator of their effects. In addition, we tested whether these response-rate enhancements affected the psychometric quality (acquiescence, self-presentation bias) of the executive survey data.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to report our {{experience}} of pregnancy in renal transplant (RT) patients and its medium and long-term effects on the renal graft as well as the maternal fetal complications. We studied 21 pregnancies in 12 RT patients with mean age of 29. 9 ± 5. 3 years. The mean duration of RT to 1 st pregnancy was 42 (21 - 68. 5) months and the median follow-up period was 112. 5 (138 - 165) months. The pregnancy was planned in 28. 6 % of the cases. At the time of the diagnosis of the pregnancy, all the patients were maintained on corticosteroids and cyclosporine, 14. 3 % of the patients were on mycophenolate mofetil, and 71. 4 % of the patients were on azathioprine. The high blood pressure was present before the pregnancy in 33. 3 % of the patients. During pregnancy, proteinuria appeared in 20 % of the cases, urinary tract infection in 33. 3 %, and preeclampsia in 5 %. Anemia was present in all the patients during pregnancy. The doses of cyclosporine were increased during pregnancy. The mean term of delivery was 37 ± 2 weeks. Premature delivery was observed in 19 % of the cases, fetal death in utero in 10 %, and abortion in 15 %.

40|$|Background: Carotenoids {{form the}} biggest {{subgroup}} of antioxidants {{in the human}} body. Since they must be ingested with food, nutrition significantly influences their concentration. The cutaneous carotenoid concentration correlates with the general serum antioxidant level and {{can serve as a}} representative substance for the entire antioxidant status and therefore as biomarker for health and nutrition. Objective: The three studies at hand investigate the interaction between antioxidant concentration and lifestyle. They were designed to determine whether differences or changes in lifestyle and nutrition influence the cutaneous carotenoid concentration. One of them also investigated the effect of biofeedback on those changes. Design and Results: All three studies feature the spectroscopic measurement of the cutaneous carotenoid concentration and the assessment of lifestyle and dietary habits. Study I: Fifty high school students were measured initially in a static phase, followed by an intervention phase including biofeedback on the measured values, health related education and free healthy school lunches. A significant correlation of healthy lifestyle and high antioxidant status could be determined. Subjects improved their nutritional habits and significantly increased their carotenoid concentration during intervention. A <b>follow-up</b> without <b>notice</b> five months later showed a consolidation of values. Study II: In a binational cross-section study with 714 subjects, Koreans resident in South Korea, native Germans and immigrant Koreans and their descendants resident in Germany were analysed for differences in carotenoid concentrations and lifestyle habits. The mean carotenoid concentration measured in the Korean subjects in South Korea was significantly higher than that of both groups in Germany. Moreover, first generation Korean immigrants who preserved Korean dietary habits showed higher concentrations than their German born descendants. Study III: In a third study, four adult female volunteers were measured over a period of 13 days and kept a diary on their nutritional behaviour and stress situations during this period. The measured carotenoid values reflected their nutritional behaviour and stress situations. While positive influences such as the increased intake of fruit and vegetables resulted in a gradual increase of the measured values, stressful situations resulted in an immediate decrease. Conclusions: All three investigations show that a healthy diet and a well-balanced lifestyle correlate with a high cutaneous antioxidant concentration. Stress reduction shows to be equally important as healthy nutrition. Biofeedback of the antioxidant concentration proves effective to raise health awareness...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS: To {{report a}} series of severe intraocular {{inflammatory}} events following intravitreal injections of bevacizumab (Avastin). This procedure is performed on a rapidly increasing number worldwide, and rare complications such as intraocular inflammation, endophthalmitis or intraocular haemorrhage are gaining in importance in clinical routine. METHODS: This is a single-centre retrospective interventional case series of eight patients with severe intraocular inflammation after intravitreal injection of bevacizumab at one referral centre consecutively seen out of approximately a total of 2500 injections performed in that time period. Patients who developed severe intraocular inflammation after intravitreal injection were evaluated clinically, including slit-lamp examination, best-corrected Snellen visual acuity (VA), slit-lamp photography, optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography prior to the event and during <b>follow-up.</b> RESULTS: Patients <b>noticed</b> a painless drop in VA up to 2 days following the injection. All patients had a marked anterior chamber reaction with increased flare and cells, but no hypopyon. Typical posterior segment findings included vitreous cellular infiltrates of pseudogranulomatous aspect. Due to their initial clinical aspect suspicious of an endophthalmitis, three cases were treated with systemic antibiotics, but the final diagnosis was uveitis. Five cases showed a characteristic pseudogranulomatous vitreous infiltration as seen in vitritis and were treated only topically. CONCLUSIONS: Characteristic features of an inflammation induced by bevacizumab injection include an early onset with painless loss in VA mostly without conjunctival or ciliary injection.

40|$|Ventral {{derotation}} spondylodesis, {{according to}} Zielke, achieves good results in operative treatment of idiopathic thoracic scolioses. Corrections of scoliotic major and secondary curve {{as well as}} derotation of the spine are reliably performed. The high rate of rod fractures with subsequent correction loss {{as well as a}} proportionate kyphogenic effect represents a problem. By keeping to the correcting principle, anterior double-rod instrumentation (Halm-Zielke Instrumentation) is to be stable in a similar way as posterior double-rod systems. Thus, it is done to facilitate brace-free postoperative care and to prevent excessive kyphotic pattern of the spine. In this prospective study, we retrospectively collected data. We performed radiological follow-up of two groups of patients with idiopathic thoracic scoliosis (King II, III and IV) undergoing an operation with posterior approach (USS instrumentation, posterior group, n= 104) in 1997 and 1998 or being corrected with an anterior fusion (Halm-Zielke instrumentation, anterior group, n= 37) between 2000 and 2001. Mean age of all patients for operation was 15 ± 4  years. Follow-up was performed after 4 ± 2  years on average. Preoperative measurements of the major and secondary curve, the lateral profile, rotation and frontal balance (C 7 to S 1) did not show any significant differences apart from a more severe scoliotic curve in the lumbar spine for the anterior group with appropriately higher lumbar rotation. During <b>follow-up</b> we <b>noticed</b> similar corrections of the thoracic major and lumbar curve in both groups ranging from 49 to 56 %. In case of hypokyphotic (T 4 –T 12 ≤ 20 °) scoliosis a kyphogenic effect on the thoracic spine was achieved with both surgical methods. Hyperkyphotic (T 4 –T 12 ≥ 40 °) scolioses were flattened by posterior spinal fusion; the effect of anterior spinal fusion was not significant. Correction of thoracic and lumbar rotation in the anterior group by 37 or 30 % was more significant than in the posterior group by 27 or 20 %. There was no impact of anterior technique on the balance of the spine whereas the latter shifted by an average of 7  mm to the left in the posterior group. The number of fused segments was significantly smaller in the anterior group with 7 ± 1 vertebral bodies (posterior, 11 ± 1 vertebral bodies). Rates of complication were identical with 11 or 12 % in both groups during follow-up. Anterior and posterior double-rod instrumentations result in comparable corrections for idiopathic thoracic scoliosis of the major and secondary curve. In case of posterior technique, however, four vertebral bodies less were integrated in spondylodesis on average. Balance of the spine did not change after anterior spondylodesis; however, it declined by using the posterior technique. Augmentation of the anterior threaded rod combined with a solid second rod significantly decreases the rate of implant breakages and reliably reduces consecutive correction losses...|$|R
40|$|The {{foreclosure}} {{of property}} tax liens performs an essential economic function by reconnecting underutilized properties {{to the real}} estate market. To clear title in an efficient and just manner, local jurisdictions foreclosing on tax liens require clear, balanced procedures {{for the provision of}} notice to affected parties. In its 2006 decision in Jones v. Flowers, the U. S. Supreme Court found that the foreclosing jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s lack of direct <b>follow-up</b> on returned <b>notice</b> mailings denied the addressee due process because the foreclosing party did not take steps that would be chosen by one desirous of actually informing the property owner. In subjecting to direct constitutional review the myriad notification decisions a foreclosure petitioner must make in conducting diligent attempts at notification, Jones, though rightly decided, threatens the validity of tax foreclosure proceedings and the titles that result from them in a fundamentally different way than earlier precedents that made notification more rigorous without loss of clarity. After demonstrating the Court 2 ̆ 7 s historical use of rules and standards in this area of notice and opportunity to be heard, this Article will show how the development of constitutional safe harbors can be used to resolve the shortcomings of the rule/standard dichotomy. Deploying a theoretical framework for the judicial fostering of fair and efficient constitutional safe harbors, this Article advocates legislative enactment of and judicial support for detailed notification protocols tailored to the particular needs and behaviors of the different types of land interest holders entitled to foreclosure notice. In order to provide reliable guidance to foreclosing parties, these notice procedures should be designed to meet a higher standard developed in the Court 2 ̆ 7 s due process jurisprudence. If a court finds a set of legislated protocols reasonably certain to inform the interested parties for whom they were designed, then that court should judge the constitutionality of notification choices that come before it against that certified rule. Such an approach would be preferable to reviewing those decisions directly using vague, albeit generally less restrictive, constitutional standards such as reasonably calculated... to apprise or chosen by one desirous of actually informing. Notification protocols that meet this due process super standard of reasonable certainty can become safe harbors for those pursuing tax foreclosure remedies while still assuring full compliance with the guarantees of notice and opportunity to be heard embodied in constitutional jurisprudence. due process, notice and opportunity to be heard, tax foreclosure, constitutional safe harbor, rules, standards, pliability rule...|$|R
40|$|Well {{integrity}} affects safety, humans, the environment, production, reputations {{and assets}} value. The concept of well integrity {{in relation to}} human and organizational factors have gained considerable attention in the petroleum sector inNorway {{over the last few}} years. This is not without reason. Resent studies shows that a simple mistake like dropping a hammer, may not only be caused by the obvious direct cause like inattention but may be caused by several underlying causes such as deficiencies {{in the design of the}} drill floor, operating instructions, <b>follow-up</b> of safety <b>notices,</b> competence, planning and implementation, deficient management, and breach of procedure. Historical events like the Piper Alpha incident shows that this underlying causes or human and organizational factors are vital to develop and improve the systems. This means that by improving human and organizational factors may contribute to the improvement of well integrity. This thesis will explain the concept of human and organizational factors through a detailed literary survey. Different models and methods has been presented (the human performance model, Decision making, the "step ladder" decision model, performance influencing factors, human error causation paradigm, human-,technology- and organizational concept) to give the reader a decent understanding of the concept. It is important for this thesis that the reader is given a detailed insight in this aspect since most of the main objectives in this project is answered using these models and methods. Human error has been identified as a primary causal factor in 70 - 80 % of accidents in the oil and gas industry. Identifying and classifying the human and organizational factors of an accident is an effective tool to assist in the investigation process, the target training and make it easier to implement prevention efforts. Through discussions and careful analysis of five methods deemed fit for classification of human and organizational factors in the oil and gas industry, was the STEPP method identified as the best classification scheme for human and organizational factors relevant to well integrity in various phases of a well s life. Well integrity is vulnerable to unforeseen factors that have a critical influence on the work performance. Understanding these unforeseen factors and the relationship between themthrough a human, technological and operational perspective can give better working environment and an opportunity to improve the health, safety integrity, and work performance. Challenges reviled through the human, technological and organizational perspective was identified and categorised as: well control training and knowledge, well integrity training and courses, human computer interface, qualification and testing ofwell barrier elements, verification ofwell barrier elements, automation, national and international standard, well integrity management system, handover documentation and well barrier schematics. Challenges related to human and organizational factor at Veslefrikk has been identified using the humanerror causation paradigms. The different paradigms (the engineering error paradigm, the individual error paradigm, the cognitive error paradigm and the organizational error paradigm) look at the situation from different points of view. Veslefrikk have challenges related to the driller s chair, placement of communication equipment, disturbing elements, alarms with no essential function, drillers workload, service companies and their lack of risk understanding, difficulty in locating relevant procedures, the sheer amount of procedures, time pressure, installation specific training, experience and meetings is being prioritized ahead of actual drilling operation and the departure meetings are too general. Comparison with the overall industry shows that the HO factor situation on Veslefrikk is all in all better. Measures can be initiated to eliminate the identified challenges at Veslefrikk and in the overall industry...|$|R
