In the end, the judges gave Braddock the title with a unanimous decision.|$|E
25|$|The {{flood of}} Scots-Irish, German, and others {{immigrants}} <b>kept</b> <b>coming.</b> Over 200,000 pioneers {{came over the}} Wilderness Road, enduring severe hardships. In the winter of 1778-79, the weather was so cold that the Kentucky River froze {{to a depth of}} two feet. The frontier settlements alongside the road struggled to survive. Many of the cattle and hogs froze to death. The settlers had to eat frozen cattle and horses to survive.|$|E
25|$|He {{was a young}} {{engineer}} {{right out}} of college when he received his first of his over 200 patents. He purchased an outboard motor manufacturing company in Cedarburg, Wisconsin in 1939, intending to make magnetic separators for the area's dairy industry.

60|$|The {{slaughter}} {{was something}} frightful, {{but still the}} remnants of them <b>kept</b> on <b>coming</b> until {{it was a matter}} of hand-to-hand fighting. Here our spearmen were of value, as were also the crude iron swords with which most of the imperial warriors were armed.|$|R

25|$|Despite these changes, the {{failures}} <b>kept</b> <b>coming.</b> After a six-month gap, Midas 5 orbited on April 9, 1962. The satellite reached orbit successfully, but experienced a massive power failure during the sixth orbit. Eight months later, Midas 6 lifted off (December 17) but {{never made it}} to orbit. At liftoff, an improper disconnect of the hydraulic rise-off caused loss of booster engine hydraulics fluid during ascent. The Atlas drifted off its flight path and the Range Safety destruct command was sent 82 seconds into the launch.|$|E
25|$|After some {{search for}} the girl, I interviewed a nightclub dancer who had just scored in a small {{emotional}} part in a play that did not run (The Noose). She {{seemed to have the}} quality I wanted, a sort of rough poignancy. She at once displayed more sensitive, easily expressed emotion than I had encountered since Pauline Lord. She and (Hal) Skelly were the perfect team, and they made the play a great success. I had great plans for her, but the Hollywood offers <b>kept</b> <b>coming.</b> There was no competing with them. She became a picture star. She is Barbara Stanwyck.|$|E
25|$|The goals <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> at {{the start}} of April, as Gary McSwegan grabbed 4 goals in a 6–1 win over Dumbarton at Tannadice. Since that 1–0 defeat at Boghead six months previously, United had scored 17 goals against Dumbarton in 3 games. Just as United looked to be running away with the league, they lost another {{important}} three points with a 1–0 defeat to St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park. a 2–0 victory away to Hamilton put United back in the driving seat, and with two games left, United had to play their two nearest challengers. With a one-point advantage, United faced Dunfermline at Tannadice, and with a crowd of 12,000 turning up expecting to see United clinch the title, Dunfermline left with a 1–0 win. That defeat left United two points behind Dunfermline, and the final game of the season was against third-placed Morton. In front of over 12,000, United managed a 2–2 draw to pip Morton to 2nd place on goal difference and secure the play-off place.|$|E
5000|$|Mortal Kombat didn't rely on {{just good}} looks and gore for its success.

50|$|The street {{serves as}} a pit-stop for many of Milwaukee's Harley-Davidson riders {{as a result of}} its annual street festival that coincides with the Milwaukee Rally, which draws {{thousands}} of Harley-Davidson riders to Milwaukee from around the country.

60|$|This was not {{the only}} reason why Bob made no attempt to get sail on at once. He was yet feeble from the {{exposure}} and privations of the nine days in the Trade Wind's yawl, and although there was but little labor involved in such watches as had been <b>kept</b> since <b>coming</b> on board the Bonita, the anxiety prevented an immediate return of strength.|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} eleven seasons of their {{existence}} in the NBA, the Suns had no official mascot, but some years later this mascot was born by accident. A messenger for Eastern Onion, a singing telegram service, came to the Coliseum during a home game dressed as a gorilla. As he left, Coliseum security suggested he do a few dances underneath the basket during a timeout and the fans loved it. So did the messenger, who <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> to games until he was officially invited {{to be part of}} the team. And this is how this mascot was accidentally born. The messenger, a quiet young man named Henry Rojas, was anything but quiet in his costume. An early attempt was made involving a sunflower costume, but it never caught on. Given a Suns warm-up jacket, Rojas shed his shyness, and turned into an entertainment beast, dancing, joking with fans and, in general, enjoying himself to the fullest. Nowadays, the Suns Gorilla is one of the most famous mascots in the NBA.|$|E
500|$|Campbell {{was also}} {{responsible}} for the grim and controversial ending of Tom Godwin's short story [...] "The Cold Equations". Writer Joe Green recounted that Campbell had [...] "three times sent 'Cold Equations' back to Godwin, before he got the version he wanted... Godwin <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> up with ingenious ways to save the girl! Since {{the strength of this}} deservedly classic story {{lies in the fact that}} the life of one young woman must be sacrificed to save the lives of many, it simply would not have the same impact if she had lived." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{the first}} time Oxford had won five {{consecutive}} races since 1913 and was the [...] "closest finish since at least the turn of the century."

[...] He continued: [...] "It was unbelievable. [...] They <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> at us and every time we tried to get away nothing happened." [...] Woodhouse lamented: [...] "All I can say is that we shouldn't have lost by so much." ...|$|E

50|$|The army {{then moved}} on, leaving al-Khalā'iq to their left and traversed the 'Abdullah defile. From there the Prophet <b>kept</b> left; <b>coming</b> down the Yalyal trail where it joined al-Ḍabū'ah. He drank {{of the well}} at al-Ḍabū'ah and then traversed the plain of Malal until he met the road at Ṣukhayrāt al-Yamām {{and then went on}} along it till he reached al-’Ushayrah, in the valley of Yanbu‘. They {{expected}} to ambush that caravan there.|$|R
60|$|Now Striped Chipmunk had {{not heard}} Bowser the Hound at all when he spoke, but just {{then there was the}} patter of heavy feet among the dried leaves, and sure enough there was Bowser himself. My, how {{everybody}} did run,--everybody but the stranger from the North. He <b>kept</b> on <b>coming</b> down the tree just the same. Bowser saw him and stopped in surprise. He had never seen anything quite like this big dark fellow.|$|R
500|$|When {{his parents}} fell in love, their {{relationship}} met with resistance from Luisa Santiaga Márquez's father, the Colonel. Gabriel Eligio García {{was not the}} man the Colonel had envisioned winning {{the heart of his}} daughter: he (Gabriel Eligio) was a Conservative, and had the reputation of being a womanizer. Gabriel Eligio wooed Luisa with violin serenades, love poems, countless letters, and even telephone messages after her father sent her away with the intention of separating the young couple. Her parents tried everything {{to get rid of the}} man, but he <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> back, and it was obvious their daughter was committed to him. Her family finally capitulated and gave her permission to marry him (The tragicomic story of their courtship would later be adapted and recast as Love in the Time of Cholera.) ...|$|E
500|$|The Hudson's Bay Company first sent fur trappers {{into the}} Snake River {{watershed}} in 1819. The party of three traveled into {{the headwaters of}} the Owyhee River, a major southern tributary of the Snake, but disappeared. Meanwhile, as American fur trappers <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> to the region, the Hudson's Bay Company ordered the Canadian trappers to kill as many beavers as they could, eventually nearly eradicating the species from the Snake River watershed, under the [...] "rationale [...] if there are no beavers, there will be no reason for the Yanks (...) to come." [...] Their goal was to eventually gain rights over the Oregon Territory, a region covering Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming (most of the present-day region called the Pacific Northwest). However, the area was eventually annexed into the United States.|$|E
500|$|Oxford's Baird claimed [...] "I {{might have}} caught a crab, but I {{do not really}} know what happened." [...] Cambridge number six MacLeod said of the Dark Blues: [...] "They <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> at us time and time again. [...] I was only sure of victory in the last mile of the race." [...] Christopher Dodd, writing in The Guardian was impressed: [...] "The contest had a rare element ... it was a race nearly all the way, and was not all over in the first 20 stokes as has so often {{been the case in}} recent years." [...] Burnell {{suggested}} it was a race for the aficionados: [...] "This was surely one of those so common Boat Races, which are hard fought all the way, yet never exciting {{from the point of view}} of the average spectator." ...|$|E
60|$|Dunham {{turned to}} go below, from where they stood {{at the head of}} the cabin stairs. Staniford looked round, and saw Lydia, whom they had <b>kept</b> from <b>coming</b> up; she must have heard him. He took his cigar from his mouth, and caught up a stool, which he placed near the ship's side, where Lydia usually sat, and without waiting for her {{concurrence}} got a stool for himself, and sat down with her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was confounded at the idea, but Mr Powell made me {{soon see}} that an Act of Parliament hasn't {{any sense of}} its own. It has only the sense that's put into it; and that's {{precious}} little sometimes.

500|$|More {{than one}} {{thousand}} young actresses were {{considered for the}} part of Max before Jessica Alba was chosen; Cameron started reviewing audition tapes when it had been narrowed down to 20 or 30 applicants. Cameron {{said he was not}} overly impressed with Alba's acting skill or appearance in her audition tape, though he <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> back and watching it as there was something about her attitude that he liked, eventually deciding he needed to see her in person. Alba was hired for the role before the scripts were written. Eglee said [...] "We had the benefit of being able to write a script kind of backwards, we were writing for this actress, with her cadences and her rhythms and her sensibilities and her attitude and her slang." [...] In order to train for the role, Alba spent a year doing martial arts and gymnastics and riding motorcycles.|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{talent was}} {{evident from the}} start of {{training}} camp. Reports came out of the Giants training compound of the exploits of the new [...] Taylor's teammates took to calling him Superman and joked that his locker should be replaced with a phone booth. Phil Simms, the team's quarterback, said, [...] "on the pass rush, he's an animal. He's either going to run around you or over you. With his quickness, he's full speed after two steps." [...] Taylor made his NFL exhibition debut on August 8, 1981, recording 2 sacks in the Giants' 23–7 win over the Chicago Bears. Before the season word spread around the league about Taylor. Years after facing him in an exhibition game, Pittsburgh Steelers Quarterback Terry Bradshaw recalled, [...] "e dang-near killed me, I just kept saying, 'Who is this guy?' He <b>kept</b> <b>coming</b> from my blind side and just ripped my ribs to pieces." ...|$|E
500|$|For unclear reasons, Lobengula's {{attitude}} towards foreigners reversed sharply {{during the late}} 1870s. He discarded his Western clothes in favour of more traditional animal-skin garments, stopped supporting trading enterprises, and began to restrict the movement of whites into and around his country. However, the whites <b>kept</b> <b>coming,</b> particularly after the discovery in 1886 of gold deposits in the South African Republic (or Transvaal), which prompted the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and the founding of Johannesburg. After rumours spread among the Witwatersrand (or Rand) prospectors of even richer tracts, [...] "a second Rand", north of the Limpopo, the miners began to trek north to seek concessions from Lobengula {{that would allow them}} to search for gold in Matabeleland and Mashonaland. These efforts were mostly in vain. Apart from the Tati Concession, which covered a small strip of land on the border with the Bechuanaland Protectorate where miners had operated since 1868, mining operations in the watershed remained few and far between.|$|E
50|$|From the beginning, Fiction Monthly {{presented}} a certain freshness to the reader. The articles were chosen quickly, accurately (to match the reader's taste), and with multiple dimensions.

50|$|Although {{customers}} {{expressed concerns}} {{that there would}} be radical changes brought by the new owners after 2000, Bill Galatis learned quickly that it would be difficult and risky to make changes to the formula that had made Lyndell's a local institution. The store had stopped opening on Sundays during World War II due to rationing; Galatis changed that and Sunday became their best sales day. He also restored selling cream-filled pastries in the summer months. However, he preserved the classic recipes, custom-decorated sheet cakes, and retro storefront sign that have <b>kept</b> customers <b>coming</b> back.|$|R
