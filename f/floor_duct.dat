The Florida Solar Energy Center?s (FSEC) Manufactured Housing Lab (MHLab) was retrofitted with an interior soffit duct. The duct system was added on so that either the attic duct system or the new interior duct system would be able to supply air to the conditioned space using the same mechanical equipment.

The hydrodynamic modeling of the fluid phase is based on direct numerical simulation. The kinematics and trajectory of the particles {{as well as the}} collisions are described by the discrete element method. Three sizes of particles are considered with diameters equal to 50 μm, 100 μm and 500 μm. Firstly, the particle transportation by turbulent flow is studied {{in the absence of the}} gravitational effect. It is found that the collisions play an important role in the particle distribution especially in the near-wall regions. The inter-particle collisions enhance the particle diffusion in the direction perpendicular to streamwise flow and make the particles distribute more uniformly near the wall. Then, the particle deposition is studied under the effect of the wall-normal gravity force in which the influence of collisions on the particle resuspension rate and the final stage of particle distribution on the <b>duct</b> <b>floor</b> are discussed, respectively. The collisions are found to have influence on the particle resuspension rate near the <b>duct</b> <b>floor</b> whereas hardly affect the particle behavior near the duct center. Under the gravitational effect the 50 μm particles deposit more efficiently near the side walls but the 100 μm and 500 μm particles preferentially deposit near the center of the <b>duct</b> <b>floor.</b> Moreover, all the sizes of particles tend to concentrate near the center of the <b>duct</b> <b>floor</b> at the final stage of the particle deposition when the inter-particle collisions are considered...|$|R

40|$|Exposure to {{airborne}} particles is detrimental {{to human health}} and indoor exposures dominate total exposures for most people. The accidental or intentional release of aerosolized chemical and biological agents within or near a building can lead to exposures of building occupants to hazardous agents and costly building remediation. Particle deposition in heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems may significantly influence exposures to particles indoors, diminish HVAC performance and lead to secondary pollutant release within buildings. This dissertation advances the understanding of particle behavior in HVAC systems and the fates of indoor particles by means of experiments and modeling. Laboratory experiments were conducted to quantify particle deposition rates in horizontal ventilation ducts using real HVAC materials. Particle deposition experiments were conducted in steel and internally insulated ducts at air speeds typically found in ventilation ducts, 2 - 9 m/s. Behaviors of monodisperse particles with diameters in the size range 1 - 16 {micro}m were investigated. Deposition rates were measured in straight ducts with a fully developed turbulent flow profile, straight ducts with a developing turbulent flow profile, in duct bends and at S-connector pieces located at duct junctions. In straight ducts with fully developed turbulence, experiments showed deposition rates to be highest at <b>duct</b> <b>floors,</b> intermediate at <b>duct</b> walls, and lowest at duct ceilings. Deposition rates to a given surface increased {{with an increase in}} particle size or air speed. Deposition was much higher in internally insulated ducts than in uninsulated steel ducts. In most cases, deposition in straight ducts with developing turbulence, in duct bends and at S-connectors at duct junctions was higher than in straight ducts with fully developed turbulence. Measured deposition rates were generally higher than predicted by published models. A model incorporating empirical equations based on the experimental measurements was applied to evaluate particle losses in supply and return duct runs. Model results suggest that duct losses are negligible for particle sizes less than 1 {micro}m and complete for particle sizes greater than 50 {micro}m. Deposition to insulated <b>ducts,</b> horizontal <b>duct</b> <b>floors</b> and bends are predicted to control losses in duct systems. When combined with models for HVAC filtration and deposition to indoor surfaces to predict the ultimate fates of particles within buildings, these results suggest that ventilation ducts play only a small role in determining indoor particle concentrations, especially when HVAC filtration is present. However, the measured and modeled particle deposition rates are expected to be important for ventilation system contamination...|$|R

40|$|Particle {{deposition}} in ventilation ducts influences particle exposures of building occupants and {{may lead to}} a variety of indoor air quality concerns. Experiments have been performed in a laboratory to study the effects of particle size and air speed on deposition rates of particles from turbulent air flows in galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. The duct systems were constructed of materials typically found in commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. In the steel duct system, experiments with nominal particle sizes of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. In the insulated duct system, deposition rates of particles with nominal sizes of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m were measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to <b>duct</b> surfaces (<b>floor,</b> wall and ceiling) at two straight duct sections where the turbulent flow profile was fully developed. In steel ducts, deposition rates were higher to the <b>duct</b> <b>floor</b> than to the wall, which were, in turn, greater than to the ceiling. In insulated ducts, deposition was nearly the same to the <b>duct</b> <b>floor,</b> wall and ceiling for a given particle size and air speed. Deposition to duct walls and ceilings was greatly enhanced in insulated ducts compared to steel ducts. Deposition velocities to each of the three duct surface orientations in both systems were found to increase with increasing particle size or air velocity over the ranges studied. Deposition rates measured in the current experiments were in general agreement with the limited observations of similar systems by previous researchers...|$|R

40|$|In {{ventilation}} duct flow the turbulent flow profile is commonly disturbed or not fully developed and these conditions {{are likely to}} influence particle deposition to duct surfaces. Particle deposition rates at eight S-connectors, in two 90 {sup o} duct bends and in two ducts where the turbulent flow profile was not fully developed were measured in a laboratory duct system with both galvanized steel and internally insulated ducts with hydraulic diameters of 15. 2 cm. In the steel duct system, experiments with nominal particle diameters of 1, 3, 5, 9 and 16 {micro}m were conducted at each of three nominal air speeds: 2. 2, 5. 3 and 9. 0 m/s. In the insulated duct system, deposition of particles with nominal diameters of 1, 3, 5, 8 and 13 {micro}m was measured at nominal air speeds of 2. 2, 5. 3 and 8. 8 m/s. Fluorescent techniques were used to directly measure the deposition velocities of monodisperse fluorescent particles to duct surfaces. Deposition at S-connectors, in bends and in straight ducts with developing turbulence was often greater than deposition in straight ducts with fully developed turbulence for equal particle sizes, air speeds and duct surface orientations. Deposition rates at all locations were found to increase {{with an increase in}} particle size or air speed. High deposition rates at S-connectors resulted from impaction and these rates were nearly independent of the orientation of the S-connector. Deposition rates in the two 90 {sup o} bends differed by more than an order of magnitude in some cases, probably because of the difference in turbulence conditions at the bend inlets. In straight steel ducts where the turbulent flow profile was developing, the deposition enhancement relative to fully developed turbulence generally increased with air speed and decreased with downstream distance from the duct inlet. This enhancement was greater at the duct ceiling and wall than at the <b>duct</b> <b>floor.</b> In insulated <b>ducts,</b> deposition enhancement was less pronounced overall than in steel ducts.

40|$|This work extends an {{investigation}} into the use of a cavity flameholder to aid scramjet combustion at high flight Mach number. A parallel scramjet duct incorporating a cavity flameholder in the floor with an inclined rear face and an aspect ratio of 4. 8 was investigated. The experiments were performed in a shock tunnel facility operated in semidirect- connect mode. Measurements of the axial pressure distribution along the <b>floor</b> of the <b>duct</b> were made and both planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) and luminosity images were recorded of the flow {{in the vicinity of the}} duct. The experiments described here were for a range of equivalence ratios for hydrogen injected axially upstream into the cavity from the rear ramp of the cavity. This paper discusses the comparison of pressure data with the luminosity images and with steady state CFD simulations of the flow in the scramjet duct. While agreement was reasonable, especially in the form of the centerline pressure distribution down the duct, the numerical predictions under predict the observed pressure levels. This may be indicative of both the uncertainty in the free stream flow state and the simplified chemistry model used. Additionally the steady state model can not capture the inherently unsteady nature observed for the flow field. Simulations at slightly lower flight Mach number indicate that combustion at these lower conditions is only marginal. The numerical simulations indicate that the pressure drag penalty incurred by the cavity can be reduced by the injection of fuel into the cavity and further again by the combustion of the fuel above the cavity...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{separation}} in the scramjet air intakes {{is one of}} {{the reasons}} of failure of these engines which rely on shock waves to achieve flow compression. The shock waves interact with the boundary layers (Shock/ Boundary Layer Interaction or SBLI) on the intake walls inducing adverse pressure gradients causing flow separation. In this experimental study we investigate the role of secondary flows associated with the corners of ducted flows and identify the mechanisms by which they affect flow separation induced by a shock wave interacting with the boundary layers developing along supersonic inlets. The coupling between flow three-dimensionality, shock waves and secondary flows is in fact a key aspect that limits the performance and control of supersonic inlets. The study is conducted at the University of Michigan Glass Supersonic Wind Tunnel (GSWT). This facility replicates some of the features of the three-dimensional (3 D) flow-field in a low aspect ratio supersonic inlet. The study xxiii uses stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) to measure the three-component (3 C) velocity field on several orthogonal planes, and thus allows us to identify the length scales of separation, its locations and statistical properties. Furthermore, these measurements allow us to extract the 3 D structure of the underlying vortical features, which are important in determining the overall structure of separated regions and their dynamics. The measurements and tools developed are used to study flow fields of three cases: (1) Moderately strong SBLI (Mach 2. 75 with 6 ◦ deflection), (2) weak SBLI (Mach 2. 75 with 4. 6 ◦ deflection) and (3) secondary corner flows in empty channels. In the configuration of the initial work (moderately strong SBLI), the shock wave system interacts with the boundary layers on the sidewall and the <b>floor</b> of the <b>duct</b> (inlet), thus generating both a swept-shock and an incident-shock interactions. Furthermore, the swept-shock interaction taking place on the sidewalls interacts with the secondary flows in the corners of the tunnel, which are prone to separation. This interaction causes major flow separation on the sidewall as fluid is swept from the sidewall. Flow separation on the floor should be expected given the strength of the SBLI (moderately strong case), but it is instead not observed in the mean flow fields. Our hypothesis is that interacting secondary flows are one of the factors responsible for the sidewall separation and directing the incoming flow towards the center-plane to stabilize and energize the flow on the center of the duct, thus preventing or at least reducing, flow separation on the floor. The secondary flows in an empty tunnel are then investigated to study their evolution and effects on the primary flow field to identify potential separation sites. The results from the empty tunnel experiments are then used to predict locations of flow separations in the moderately strong and weak SBLIs. The predictions were found to be in agreement with the observations...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1957 This study deals {{primarily}} with the evaluation and {{improvement of the}} content of a college-level drafting course for air conditioning engineering students. The necessity for better integration of the mechanical and architectural elements contained in the course, and an adequate coverage of field drafting room practices were the chief evidences of the need for the study. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop criteria that could be used to evaluate and improve said drafting course; and the end result was manifested by an improved proposed drafting course, which was included in the Appendix. The study was conducted in the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area. Eighteen carefully selected air conditioning and refrigeration firms were interviewed to determine the per cent frequency of occurrence of selected field drafting room practices. This group represented contracting firms, consulting engineering offices, controls companies, and manufacturing firms. Chapter II presents a brief history of the development of the air conditioning and refrigeration industry. Special attention was given to the contemporary applications and to the need for specialized training on a college level. The collected field data was tabulated, analyzed and classified in Chapter III. This field data represented percent frequency of occurrence responses concerning drafting room practices covering the following nine general areas: (1) <b>floor</b> plans; (2) <b>duct</b> work; (3) piping drawings; (4) controls; (5) equipment rooms; (6) manufacturing; (7) sketching; (8) drafting techniques; and (9) drafting material. Five orders of classification were established: (1) standard practices; (2) common practices; (3) occasional practices; (4) infrequent practices; and (5) obsolete practices. Chapter IV contains the summary, conclusions and recommendations. The conclusions reached the were as follows: (1) ranked practices can be used as an evaluative instrument; (2) greater weight should be given to standard end common field and area practices; (3) many occasional and infrequent practices are essential practices in the individual firms concerned; (4) practices with broad general concepts should be used as instructional vehicles; (5) a degree of standardization of drafting practices has taken place; (6) a few of the practices have become obsolete; (7) the comprehension of control circuits is beyond most freshmen; (8) there is a trend toward more manufacturing in the area investigated; and (9) sketching ability is highly desirable.
