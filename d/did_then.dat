5|$|In the novel, {{the protagonist}} {{and a female}} {{accomplice}} rent a home like the one Cox and Hauck rented in Atlanta. The character then opens accounts at several banks in the area {{so that he can}} use them for money laundering purposes, which Cox <b>did.</b> <b>Then,</b> Cox, like the character in the manuscript, forged a document, claiming that the mortgage on the home—which he did not even own—was paid off. The character in the manuscript then contacted lenders, and told them he owned the property outright. Cox is in prison for this same crime.|$|E

Though he <b>did</b> <b>then</b> receive a League Cup runners-up medal: club secretary Alan Jones had kept a spare one back, which he presented to Gill after Francis left. Under new manager Steve Bruce he played only one game, a 3–0 FA Cup defeat at Liverpool for which Jeff Kenna was cup-tied, and when the team won promotion to the Premier League that season, {{it became clear that}} his future lay elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Audubon {{set about}} to study American birds, {{determined}} to illustrate his findings {{in a more}} realistic manner than most artists <b>did</b> <b>then.</b> He began conducting the first known bird-banding on the continent: he tied yarn to the legs of eastern phoebes and determined that {{they returned to the}} same nesting spots year after year. He also began drawing and painting birds, and recording their behavior. After an accidental fall into a creek, Audubon contracted a severe fever. He was nursed and recovered at Fatland Ford, with Lucy at his side.|$|E

25|$|James Pratt, son of Luther Martin Thomas Plummer and Rachel Parker Plummer, was {{separated}} from his mother (who never knew about his further fate) and was soon given away to another Comanche band. Late in 1842 he was ransomed and in 1843 reunited with his grandfather James W. Parker. Parker refused to return his grandson to his father, claiming that Luther Plummer had not even paid his ransom. Even when the latter appealed successfully to the Governor of Texas, Parker refused to return his grandson. Luther Plummer, meanwhile remarried and father of another child, <b>did</b> <b>then</b> not pursue the matter. James Pratt Plummer married twice and had four children. He died of pneumonia while serving with the Confederate Army in 1862.|$|E
25|$|Webster {{attended}} Phillips Exeter Academy, a preparatory {{school in}} Exeter, New Hampshire, before attending Dartmouth College. He was chosen Fourth of July orator in Hanover, the college town, in 1800, {{and in his}} speech appears {{the substance of the}} political principles for the development of which he became famous. After he graduated from Dartmouth (Phi Beta Kappa), Webster was apprenticed to the lawyer Thomas W. Thompson in Salisbury. When his older brother Ezekiel's studies required Webster's support, the young man resigned from the law office and worked as a schoolteacher– as young men often <b>did</b> <b>then,</b> when public education consisted largely of subsidies to local schoolmasters. In 1802 Webster began as the headmaster of the Fryeburg Academy, Maine, where he served for one year. When Ezekiel's education could no longer be sustained, Webster returned to his apprenticeship.|$|E

500|$|To avoid bloodshed, Cowboy Frank Patterson promised Hurst {{they would}} return the mules and Hurst persuaded the posse to withdraw. Hurst went to nearby Charleston, but the Cowboys showed up {{two days later}} without the mules, {{laughing}} at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Hurst had printed and distributed a handbill in which he named Frank McLaury as specifically assisting with hiding the mules. He reprinted this in The Tombstone Epitaph on July 30, 1880. Virgil later said that McLaury had {{asked him if he}} had posted the handbills. When Virgil said he had not, McLaury said if Virgil had printed the handbills it was Frank's intention to kill Virgil.

500|$|The town {{wall was}} {{constructed}} during the 13th and 14th centuries to repel Scottish invaders. Newcastle is about [...] from the River Tweed, which marks {{the border between}} England and Scotland, as it <b>did</b> <b>then.</b> At that {{time there was a}} power struggle between England and Scotland, that eventually led to the Wars of Scottish Independence. The Scottish kings were always ready to take advantage of any weakness in the English rule to invade the North of England. An example of this is David I of Scotland, who took advantage of the civil war between Stephen and Matilda to invade Northumberland in three successive years—1136–8. In the Treaty of Durham (1139), David’s son Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland. Newcastle was not included in this grant but the Scots ignored this clause and occupied Newcastle until 1157. Although the town had a strong castle, built by Robert Curthose in 1080, and improved by Henry II between 1172 and 1177, it did not provide sufficient protection for the local merchants' properties, and so it was decided that a fortified town wall was needed.|$|E

The Cowboys showed up two days later without the mules and laughed at Hurst and the Earps. In response, Capt. Hurst printed a handbill describing the theft, and specifically charged Frank McLaury with assisting with hiding the mules. He also reproduced the flyer in The Tombstone Epitaph, on July 30, 1880. Frank McLaury angrily printed a response in the Cowboy-friendly Nuggett, calling Hurst [...] "unmanly", [...] "a coward, a vagabond, a rascal, and a malicious liar", and accused Hurst of stealing the mules himself. Capt. Hurst later cautioned Wyatt, Virgil, and Morgan that the Cowboys had threatened their lives. Virgil reported that Frank accosted him and warned him, [...] "If you ever again follow us as close as you <b>did,</b> <b>then</b> you will have to fight anyway."

[...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while.
