5|$|Chu spent a {{great deal}} of time {{preparing}} in the month before his first appearance on Jeopardy! He studied tapes of former Jeopardy! contestants and created study guides based on the advice of Roger Craig. He also read about game theory and Jeopardy! strategy online.

5|$|In June 2009 {{he spoke}} against the Israeli West Bank barrier and later that year, pledged his {{support to the}} Gaza Freedom March. In 2011 he {{announced}} that he had joined the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> is disillusioned with UK foreign policy towards Israel. In October 2016 Waters lost four million dollars in sponsorship after American Express refused to fund his North America tour due to his anti-Israel rhetoric at a previous festival sponsored by the financial company.|$|E
25|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{does not}} believe there is an {{inherent}} right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution. He has, however, expressed disapproval of George W. Bush's assertions on {{the legality of the}} NSA wiretapping program.|$|E

25|$|Bout was {{involved}} with a Soviet military operation in Angola in the late 1980s. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was in Angola {{for only a few}} weeks. Bout's web site states that he began an air freight business in Africa {{around the time of the}} collapse of the USSR.|$|E
25|$|He is a 1977 {{graduate}} of Horace Mann School. After scoring 1590 out of 1600 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), {{he received a}} Bachelor's degree at Princeton University and his Juris Doctor at Harvard Law School. At Princeton, he was elected chairman of the undergraduate student government and graduated in 1981. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> received a perfect score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT), {{and went on to}} attend Harvard Law School, where he met and married Silda Wall. Spitzer was an editor of the Harvard Law Review.|$|E
25|$|Van Sant got {{an offer}} of $2 million from an outside {{investor}} but when he put off production for nine months so that Phoenix could make Dogfight, the investor and his money disappeared. Producer Laurie Parker shopped the script around and, at the time, New Line Cinema {{was in the process}} of branching out into producing arthouse films and decided to back Van Sant's vision with a USD$2.5 million budget. In an interview in March 2012, Kiefer Sutherland said that he declined the offer by Gus Van Sant to star in the lead role because he wanted to go skiing, a decision <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> regrets.|$|E
60|$|He was {{not happy}} at what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> was filled with disgust at himself. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not nice.|$|R
50|$|On 29 March 2015 {{regional}} {{elections were}} held and Alberto ruled himself out as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would in 2011, Miguel Albuquerque {{won the election}} and became the new president on 20 April 2015.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wounded? I had {{not seen}} his wound. I saw him sitting alive and {{apparently}} unhurt in his caleche, and I concluded that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> killed you as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would. What else could I conclude?" ...|$|R
25|$|The {{castle and}} barony has been owned or {{held by the}} medieval Muir family, the (Boyle) Earls of Glasgow, the (Campbell) Earls of Loudoun, the (Corbett) Barons Rowallan, and more {{recently}} by the property developer, Niall Campbell; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> is planning to make changes enabling it {{to be used as}} golfer's accommodation and this has given rise to some concern. It is said that the earliest piece of Lute music was written at Rowallan. It {{is said to have been}} visited by the unfortunate King James I of Scotland when on his way from Edinburgh to England. The first Mure holder, Sir J. Gilchrist Mure was buried in the Mure Aisle at Kilmarnock.|$|E
25|$|In early 2016, Lula was {{appointed}} Chief of Staff under Rousseff, but Justice Gilmar Mendes of the Supreme Federal Court blocked the appointment due to ongoing federal investigations. In Brasil the presidential {{chief of staff}} is a cabinet-level position that requires charges of malfeasance to be tried in a special court. On 12 July 2017, the former president was convicted of money laundering and passive corruption, defined in Brazilian criminal law as the receipt of a bribe by a civil servant or government official. He was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison by judge Sérgio Moro but remains free pending an appeal of the sentence; if the court upholds Moro's decision, Lula would be ineligible {{to run in the}} 2018 presidential election as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would.|$|E
25|$|On February 26, 2008 Houston Dynamo President Oliver Luck {{revealed}} the planned negotiations {{to the media}} stating that the Houston Dynamo would be managed in majority by original owners Anschutz Entertainment Group (who held 50% of ownership) along with newfound partners Gabriel Brener, head of Brener International Group, and multiple World and Olympic boxing champion Oscar De La Hoya (each with 25% ownership). De La Hoya has been seen wearing Dynamo colors on his boxing uniform with a small Houston Dynamo logo on his right leg in a fight against boxer Steve Forbes. He has also pledged to help find Dynamo a soccer-specific stadium, though he has been too busy with training to participate significantly in Dynamo decision-making. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would become more involved once he retires in 2009.|$|E
6000|$|The {{fisherman}} {{shook his}} head. No, {{he would not}} go; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would not, and he would not. But the wife only smiled and said again, [...] "My advice to you is that you go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{sit down}} for a moment," [...] <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b> <b>He</b> made his speech a little elaborately. She plucked at the knots of her racket and heard him to the end, then spoke in a {{restrained}} undertone.|$|R
50|$|Well {{after the}} elections, a case was filed against Shahabuddin that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> lied in his electoral declaration; whereas <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> been named in 19 cases, at the time, there were 34 cases pending against him.|$|R
25|$|Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr. {{was born}} on September 27, 1982, {{and grew up in}} the Hollygrove {{neighborhood}} of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father–son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Lil Wayne has also spoken about his deceased stepfather, Rabbit, who <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> considers his real father. Carter has a tattoo dedicated to Rabbit, who was murdered before Carter became a star. Carter enrolled in the gifted program of Lafayette Elementary School and in the drama club of Eleanor McMain Secondary School. Wayne attended McMain in the early 1990s for two years. He moved to the Marion Abramson Senior High School.|$|E
500|$|Gil {{has been}} open {{about the fact}} that he has smoked {{marijuana}} for much of his life. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> believes [...] "that drugs should be treated like pharmaceuticals, legalized, although under the same regulations and monitoring as medicines".|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{has stated}} {{he does not}} see himself {{primarily}} as a visual artist, one who instinctively sketches or doodles. [...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> approaches {{his work as a}} writer as he lacks confidence in his graphic skills. [...] He subjects his dialogue and visuals to constant revision—he reworked some dialogue balloons in Maus up to forty times. [...] A critic in The New Republic compared Spiegelman's dialogue writing to a young Philip Roth in his ability [...] "to make the Jewish speech of several generations sound fresh and convincing".|$|E
50|$|Captain Charles de Gaulle {{continued}} to be a protégé of Pétain throughout these years. He even named his eldest son after the Marshal before finally falling out over the authorship of a book <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> ghost-written for Pétain.|$|R
5|$|On 8 March 2010, Wilders {{announced}} that he would take a seat on the Hague city council, after it became clear he won 13,000 preference votes. Earlier <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would not take up a seat if he won.|$|R
6000|$|Violet {{was obliged}} to confess her ignorance. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> should be going about, and had given her no address. Much vexed, Lord Martindale forbore to {{distress}} her by remarks, and replied to his cousin's question whether the house was insured-- ...|$|R
500|$|Since 2010, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> {{would allow}} for a doctor's {{discretion}} in life-threatening cases such as ectopic pregnancies. Concerning same-sex marriage, Paul has made a distinction between his personal beliefs and how he feels the government should handle it. He has stated that he personally feels same-sex marriage [...] "offends [...] {{and a lot of}} people", and said there is a [...] "crisis that allows people to think there would be some other sorts of marriage." [...] However, he believes the issue should be left to the states to decide, and would not support a federal ban.|$|E
500|$|His first post-Harry Potter {{project was}} the 2012 horror film The Woman in Black, {{adapted from the}} 1983 novel by Susan Hill. The film was {{released}} on 3 February 2012 in the United States and Canada, and was released on 10 February in the UK. Radcliffe portrays a man sent {{to deal with the}} legal matters of a mysterious woman who has just died, and soon after he begins to experience strange events and hauntings from the ghost of a woman dressed in black. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "incredibly excited" [...] {{to be part of the}} film and described the script as [...] "beautifully written".|$|E
500|$|Vainio {{worked at}} Fazer Music as a lyricist with monthly salary {{and at the}} same time wrote his own songs. He {{translated}} several international hits into Finnish, including Piilopaikka ("Hideout", originally [...] "You've Got Your Troubles") by Danny and Nyt meni hermot ("Now I'm Furious"), which became the breakthrough recording of pop group [...] "The First". Vainio was often late for arranged studio sessions, which irritated the bands and the company's management. At 30, Vainio wrote one of his best-known translations, Fredi's Kolmatta linjaa takaisin ("Back along Kolmas Linja"). Another success was his translation of The Beatles' [...] "Penny Lane", recorded by Pepe Willberg as Rööperiin ("To Rööperi"). Although Vainio's version is set in Helsinki, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was thinking about Kotka when he wrote the lyrics.|$|E
6000|$|... “How {{much have}} you go on?” whispered Clovis. The other whispered the sum through dry, shaking lips. It {{was more than}} he or any one {{connected}} with him could pay; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> done what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would do. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> been rash.|$|R
60|$|They found that, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> <b>he</b> {{was hit in}} the body. The wound {{had almost}} ceased {{bleeding}} now, and {{there was nothing to be}} done for it. With an ominous shake of the head, they remounted the cart, and drove gently on.|$|R
60|$|Lapham had {{not told}} his {{daughter}} where he was going; she had heard him packing his bag, and had offered to help him; but <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could do it best, and had gone off, as he usually did, without taking leave of any one.|$|R
500|$|The cartooning is far looser than in Brown's earlier work, and {{concerned}} more with gesture and expression than literal detail. They are rendered with a brush, and amongst {{the simplest and}} sparsest in his body of work. There is nonetheless {{a significant amount of}} hatching, and the backgrounds are naturalistic, in contrast to the thin, distorted figures. [...] Brown had been paring his artwork since the Playboy stories, as he was not happy with his style and sought [...] "to rebuild [...] style in a way that [...] would like". [...] He continued this with I Never Liked You, where <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> was [...] "trying to get even more pared down than The Playboy". [...] Certain inanimate objects receive a focus imbuing them with special significance, such as Chet's habitual after-school package of soda crackers or the Brown family home—a house that, to reviewer Darcy Sullivan, [...] "is as much a character [...] as in The Playboy".|$|E
500|$|Let the Blind Lead {{has been}} {{characterized}} as ambient, psychedelic, and pop music, similar in style to Cox's previous work with Deerhunter, such as the band's 2007 album Cryptograms. [...] Cox is drawn to ambient music due to its ambiguous, repetitive, and [...] "emotive" [...] nature. [...] He considers himself inspired {{in part by the}} style and [...] "sonic picture" [...] of girl groups and doo-wop music. [...] Instruments heard on the record include the guitar, drums, glockenspiel, mbira, and Ghanaian bells. [...] Cox also considers his voice an instrument of its own. [...] While moving toward using less layering effects on the vocal tracks in his music, because he does not consider himself a songwriter, Cox prefers to use such effects to make his voice more instrumental and ambiguous in nature. [...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> is [...] "always more interested in the parts that are like vocalists, wordless vocals: the harmonizing, the oohs when the vocals become like an instrument." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} {{are designed to}} speak with their own internal voices to capture their views of the world. The Atlantic pondered whether Martin ultimately intended the readers to sympathize with characters {{on both sides of}} the Lannister–Stark feud long before plot developments force them to make their emotional choices. Contrary to most conventional epic fantasies, the Ice and Fire {{characters are}} vulnerable so that, according to The Atlantic, the reader [...] "cannot be sure that good shall triumph, which makes those instances where it does all the more exulting." [...] Martin gets emotionally involved in the characters' lives during writing, which makes the chapters with dreadful events sometimes very difficult to write. Seeing the world through the characters' eyes requires a certain amount of empathy with them, including the villains, all of whom <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> loves as if they were his own children. Martin found that some characters had minds of their own and took his writing in different directions. He returns to the intended story if it does not work out, but these detours sometimes prove more rewarding for him.|$|E
50|$|Then his {{brothers}} told the coachman <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> could steal the troll's bed-quilt, and the coachman again told the king. He demanded three days, {{and when he}} saw the bed-quilt being hung out to air, he stole it. This time, the king made him his body-servant.|$|R
60|$|But {{they were}} not {{prepared}} {{to go to that}} length. The senior day-room had a great respect both for Drummond's word and his skill with his hands. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> would slay any one who touched Sheen, and they were of opinion that he would do it.|$|R
5000|$|Eric married Maxine Rose-Marie Harding, 18 {{years his}} junior. They had two daughters, Victoria Maxine and Nicola Ilona. He died in Mallorca, an island <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{fallen in love}} with [...] "from the moment he first saw the rocky {{coastline}} from the deck of the Barcelona ferry." ...|$|R
