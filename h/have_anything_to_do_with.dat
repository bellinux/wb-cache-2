5|$|A four-part series {{published}} between January and April 1996, {{the story}} begins with the New York Police Department using Brock's wife, Ann, to trap him. Brock sends the symbiote to Ann, turning her into She-Venom again and letting her escape. In issue #3, Ann is afraid of the symbiote's influence and refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Brock while he wears it. This plotline is resolved in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol.2 #19 (2000), in which Ann's experience with the symbiote triggers her suicide. The story includes contemporary Spider-Man Ben Reilly trying to bring Venom to justice.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte {{restored}} Lafayette's citizenship on 1 March 1800, and he {{was able}} to recover some of his properties. The ruler offered to make Lafayette minister to the United States, but was met with a firm refusal, as Lafayette would not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Napoleon's government. In 1802, Lafayette was part of the tiny minority that voted no in the referendum that made Bonaparte consul for life. Bonaparte offered to appoint Lafayette to the Senate and to bestow the Legion of Honor upon him, but Lafayette declined, though he stated he would gladly have taken the honors from a democratic government.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} awaiting Mary Godwin in England was {{fraught with}} complications, {{some of which}} she had not foreseen. Either before or during the journey, she had become pregnant. She and Percy now found themselves penniless, and, to Mary's genuine surprise, her father refused to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> her. The couple moved with Claire into lodgings at Somers Town, and later, Nelson Square. They maintained their intense programme of reading and writing, and entertained Percy Shelley's friends, such as Thomas Jefferson Hogg and the writer Thomas Love Peacock. Percy Shelley sometimes left home for short periods to dodge creditors. The couple's distraught letters reveal their pain at these separations.|$|E

5|$|When Marge {{takes the}} family to the Family Fun Center, she notices Nelson acting like a bully, {{especially}} when he knocks Milhouse off the track and wins a BB gun from stolen prize tickets. Bart and Nelson attempt to be friends, but Marge forbids Bart {{to hang out with}} Nelson. Bart goes to Nelson’s house anyway and starts using Nelson's new BB gun. When Nelson pressures Bart to shoot a bird in a nest, Bart accidentally kills the bird. Marge is furious that Bart killed an animal, but instead of punishing him, she refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> his destructive ways.|$|E
5|$|After his return, Lad is bred {{with another}} prize-winning collie, Lady, {{and they have}} two male puppies which are named Little Lad and Wolf. Angela is allowed her choice of one as a present to her when they {{are old enough to}} leave their mother & she chooses Little Lad. However, Jackson White (Jack Daly), a poacher Lad fought and chased off the {{property}} before, sets fire to barn out of vengeance. Elizabeth is injured and Little Lad is killed but not Wolf. Lad later aids in capturing White when he breaks into the house to try to steal Lad's gold trophy from the dog show. Angela is initially inconsolable over the loss of her puppy Little Lad, and refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Wolf. After he is nearly lost in another accident, she changes her mind and accepts Wolf as her new dog.|$|E
5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such ideas are about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Herodotus.|$|E

Rather, they both had a love of prize {{fighting}} and {{used to go to}} boxing matches together, engaging in jocose discussion of the relative merits of Negro with Jewish pugilists. They would occasionally wager a bottle of whisky on these bouts.|$|E
25|$|Welland's {{original}} script also featured, {{in addition}} to Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams, a third protagonist, 1924 Olympic gold medallist Douglas Lowe, who was presented as a privileged aristocratic athlete. However, Lowe refused to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the film, and his character was written out and replaced by the fictional character of Lord Andrew Lindsay.|$|E

In 1916, he was thrown from a horse and suffered a broken jaw and a serious head injury; he received a mandatory discharge, and returned to writing.|$|E
25|$|According to the Pāli Canon & Āgama (the Early Buddhist scriptures), {{there is}} no any saying that same or {{opposite}} gender relations <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> sexual misconduct, and some Theravada monks express that same-gender relations do not violate the rule to avoid sexual misconduct, which means not having sex with someone under age (thus protected by their parents or guardians), someone betrothed or married and who have taken vows of religious celibacy.|$|E
25|$|Mr. & Mrs. Barry: Diana's parents. Mr. Barry farms. Near {{the end of}} the book, {{he offers}} to rent some tracts to help out Anne and Marilla, after Matthew's passing. Mrs. Barry has a severe personality, expecting her {{children}} to follow strict rules. After Anne accidentally gets Diana drunk, Mrs. Barry rejects the girl, forbidding Diana to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> Anne.

25|$|Blood {{addresses}} relations forged {{between the}} Japanese and the Burmese during World War II. A young Japanese woman visits Burma {{to find her}} half-brother, the child of her father, {{an officer in the}} Japanese army, and a Burmese mother. Her half-brother initially refuses to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> her because he believes that his father raped his mother. A joint production with the Japanese turned this novel into a film which had its 2003 premiere in Japan.|$|E
25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an International child abduction the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|Cockburn {{commanded}} {{a squadron of}} warships for the landings in Walcheren in July 1809 during the Walcheren Campaign. He took command of the third-rate HMS Implacable {{off the coast of}} Spain in January 1810 and sailed to Quiberon Bay with a small squadron whose mission was to arrange the escape of the King of Spain, whom the French had imprisoned at the Château de Valençay. The mission failed when Ferdinand refused to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the British. Cockburn was promoted to commodore, hoisting his broad pennant in the fourth-rate HMS Grampus in November 1811.|$|E

25|$|In early January 2008, protesters marched {{from the}} Minnesota State Capitol to the Xcel Energy Center {{in hopes of}} {{securing}} a protest permit. The Saint Paul Police Department authorized the event, but only approved the permit through July 2008. On February 8 and February 9, 2008, antiwar protesters attended a weekend conference at the University of Minnesota to discuss the protests and antiwar rally. On February 28, 2008, the Associated Press (AP) reported that the police department adopted new guidelines for the investigation of protest groups. The police department said that this did not <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the convention.|$|E
25|$|It seems {{unlikely}} from the workmanship that the well's stone and 'cross' <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> the old chapel, but {{one possibility is}} that it came from over the entrance door to Laigh Chapelton as the custom was for a Templar property to have the 'cross' symbol of the order displayed in such a fashion. On the other hand it could have been made for the Chapelton (old) House to associate the building with the Christian history of the site. The stone is unusually thick and has been clearly reworked to pass a spout through it.|$|E
25|$|Interscope gave us, like, {{a million}} bucks last year, and we built a {{recording}} studio, and then they basically didn't do too well with Pummel, so we bailed out and took our recording studio with us. I think the thing they didn't realize, and we did realize, is that it's easier to market some of those mall punk bands because you've got the fashion that's there with it; you know, the nice hairdos and the fake British accents. But with All or Descendents, it's basically these ugly dork people playing music. They thought they could market {{it because it was}} the right music, but the fact of it is that the music doesn't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> anything, really. We knew that.|$|E
