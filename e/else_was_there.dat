500|$|There were no documentaries or {{compilation}} albums in {{the wake}} of Drake's death. His public profile remained low throughout the mid and late 1970s, although occasional mentions of his name appeared in the music press. By this time, his parents were receiving an increasing number of fans and admirers as visitors to the family home in Far Leys. Island Records, following a 1975 NME article written by Nick Kent, stated [...] "we have no intention of repackaging Nick's three albums (which remained available), either now or at anytime in the foreseeable future", but in 1979 Rob Partridge joined Island Records as press officer and commissioned the release of the Fruit Tree box set. Partridge was a fan of Drake's, and had seen him perform early in 1969: [...] "The first thing I did when I got to Island was suggest we put together a retrospective—the studio albums plus whatever <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> I wasn't necessarily expecting massive vaults with millions of tunes, live recordings or whatever, but there was very little". The release brought together the three studio albums as well as the four tracks recorded with Wood in 1974 and was accompanied by an extensive biography written by the American journalist Arthur Lubow. Although sales were poor, Island Records never deleted the three albums from its catalogue.|$|E

Therefore, Pharaoh used to go early in the morning to the water (when no one <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> to witness that he {{relieved}} himself like other humans). God, therefore, told Moses to catch him just at this critical moment.|$|E
2500|$|FBI Special Agent James P. Hosty and Dallas Police Captain Will Fritz (chief of homicide) {{conducted}} the first interrogation of Oswald on Friday, November 22. When Oswald {{was asked to}} account for himself {{at the time of}} the assassination, he replied that he was eating his lunch in the first-floor lounge (known as the [...] "domino room"). He said that he then went to the second-floor lunchroom to buy a Coca-Cola from the soda machine there and was drinking it when he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker, who had entered the building with his gun drawn. Oswald said that while he was in the domino room, he saw two [...] "Negro employees" [...] walking by, one he recognized as [...] "Junior" [...] and a shorter man whose name he could not recall. Junior Jarman and Harold Norman confirmed to the Warren Commission that they had [...] "walked through" [...] the domino room around noon during their lunch break. When asked if anyone else was in the domino room, Norman testified that somebody <b>else</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> but he could not remember who it was. Jarman testified that Oswald was not in the domino room when he was there. During his last interrogation on November 24, according to postal inspector Harry Holmes, Oswald was again asked where he was {{at the time of the}} shooting. Holmes (who attended the interrogation at the invitation of Captain Will Fritz) said that Oswald replied that he was working on an upper floor when the shooting occurred, then went downstairs where he encountered Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion L. Baker.|$|E
