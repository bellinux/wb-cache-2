Applying a rest frame δ function form of pulses we obtain the light curve of pulses, ignoring the effect of the rest <b>frame</b> <b>pulse</b> width, for expanding fireballs. From the light curve we find that the time scale of a pulse would be significantly {{affected by the}} Lorentz factor. If the Lorentz factor Γ is very large, the observed width of the light curve of a very narrow pulse would become much smaller than the time scale of the real size of the fireball, following the law of Γ ^- 2. This explains why for many sources very short time scale of pulses is observed. In addition, light curves of rest <b>frame</b> rectangle <b>pulses</b> as well as other forms of rest <b>frame</b> <b>pulses</b> which last an interval of time are also studied. These light curves reveal the well known structure of a fast rise and an exponential decay (FRED) observed in many GRBs. We find that, the character of FRED is a consequence of the expanding motion of fireballs. The main difference of the observed profiles of pulses is due to their rest frame widths. The interval between the beginning and the peak of pulses depends not only on the Lorentz factor but also on the width of the rest <b>frame</b> <b>pulse</b> as well...|$|R

In this system, the closely spaced optical pulses of interleaved PCM channels are “space sorted ” by a coincidence detection technique using an optical reference waveform {{generated in the}} receiver. For synchronization of the reference waveform with a spatial waveform produced by the received laser beam in the demultiplexer, a number of pulses on these two optical waveforms are coded with a pseudo-random sequence.

As described in the experimental part of [1] that at first a transition between a stationary periodic and a traveling wave like Hopf mode is observed by lowering the starch concentration in the chemical reactor. Now, keeping a low starch concentration and by increasing the malonic acid concentration a similar transition takes place which makes an almost 1 D Turing state loose its stability to a Hopf state when malonic acid concentration is doubled.

Bands of maximum intensity spreads alternatively toward right and left directions with a time delay.

The scattering depth of the evanescent wave inside the microemulsion depends strongly on the angle of incidence and the wavelength.

In particular, at a pulsed source the instrument operates with a broad wavelength band covering all neutrons within one <b>frame</b> between two <b>pulses.</b> In order to yield viable counting statistics it is highly desirable to integrate data corresponding to significant fractions of the wavelength band.

40|$|With {{advancement}} in automotive systems, {{it is not}} just the combination of mechanical devices like in old days. Almost all the systems of today's modern car are controlled electronically by a number of ECUs (Electronics Control Unit) with the combination of sensor modules. To exchange information between the ECU and sensor modules a number of communication standards are used. The most commonly used standards are CAN, LIN, and PWM etc. The data transmission between the ECU and sensor modules can be easily established with a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) techniques in comparison with CAN or LIN. PWM provide a convenient solution in terms of cost and performance when the data-rate is up to 10 -bits. While for higher resolution data rates its performance is not satisfied. Extra effort is needed to implement diagnostic information for the integrity of data. Also, the accuracy of PWM signal is dependent on the noise voltage and channel bandwidth. In 10 -bit system a single bit is represented by 4 mV which face serious problem in automotive system due to the noise voltage pulses which effect the resolution of the PWM. The alternative solution for safe and high data rate which is more than 10 -bit resolution is to used CAN and LIN protocols. Both CAN and LIN have availability of diagnostic modes for an ensured data transmission. Also, their capabilities for interconnecting a number of nodes (sensors-modules) on the same network can significantly reduce the wiring cost. But in automotive a number of systems need to communicate through point-to-point link, and it seem to be too expensive to used CAN and LIN for point-to-point communication because of its development complexity and wiring cost for a standalone system. To overcome these issues and to provide an alternative low-cost solution the SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) developed a 3 -wire new digital point-to-point protocol called SENT. SENT (Single Edge Nibble Transmission) Protocol is now an international standard (SAE J 2716). SENT is unidirectional point-to-point communication protocol, which can be used for high resolution data transmission between sensor module and ECU. The data are transmitted by sensor module in a series of pulses each pulse is 4 -bit (one nibble) long and the data are measured between two falling edges by the receiving module. There are total of nine pulses which defined the SENT <b>frame.</b> The first <b>pulse</b> is called calibration pulse, it is used for compensating to recalibrate all the other pulses in case of transmitter clock deviation, this is the best feature of SENT and can be implemented in the decoder design. This thesis work focuses on the development of SENT protocol decoder and its signal robustness analysis in comparison with the conventional PWM signal. Our first goal is to developed SENT-Protocol decoder in software on the available microcontrollers is to check how much memory foot print is used and how much the processor overhead. Two platforms have been used for this purpose. First, two implementation designs prototype were made with fixed-point and floating-point development techniques on the 32 -bit platform for SENT decoder. Secondly SENT-decoder were developed with 8 -bit platform and compared with the two previous designs to check how much memory foot print is used and how much is the processor overhead. Finally, the signal integrity analysis has been performed for PWM and SENT signal using spice simulation. The purpose is to check the maximum data rate limit that the PWM signal support without creating any bit error in the transmitted signal. The same data rate is then used for SENT signal to be compared with PWM signal...|$|R
