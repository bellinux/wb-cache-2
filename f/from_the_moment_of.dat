5|$|During the Middle Ages, Capetian Kings of France {{chose to}} have their heirs {{apparent}} crowned during their own lifetime {{in order to avoid}} succession disputes.

In response, trustees further encumbered the land to fund the university's operations while funneling cash donations to a separate account for what is today the University of Chicago Divinity School (which temporarily moved to a separate campus in Morgan Park before rejoining the larger university in its current location in Hyde Park location in 1891).|$|E

Prior to the service introduction of the first Airbus airliners, engineers within Airbus had identified nine possible variations of the A300 known as A300B1 to B9. A 10th variation, conceived in 1973, later the first to be constructed, was designated the A300B10. It was a smaller aircraft which would be developed into the long-range Airbus A310. Airbus then focused its efforts on the single-aisle market, which was dominated by the 737 and McDonnell Douglas DC-9.|$|E

50|$|Both drift {{diffusion}} (DD) and the hydrodynamic (HD) {{models can}} be derived <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) using simplified approximation valid for long channel devices. The DD scheme is the most classical approach and usually solves the Poisson equation and the continuity equations for carriers considering the drift and diffusion components.

On the other hand, the HD method solvesthe DD scheme with the energy balance equations obtained <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments</b> <b>of</b> BTE. Thus, one may capture and calculate physical details such as carrier heating and the velocity overshoot effect. Needless to say, an accurate discretization method is required in HD simulation, since the governing equations are strongly coupled and one has to deal with larger number of variables compared to the DD scheme.|$|R
