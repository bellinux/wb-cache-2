5|$|Anup Mahal is a {{multi-storey}} structure, which {{functioned as}} the administrative {{headquarters of the}} kingdom. It has ornate wooden ceilings with inlaid mirrors, Italian tiles, and fine lattice windows and balconies. It has some <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> paintings. It is considered {{as one of the}} “grandest construction”.|$|E

5|$|Cimabue {{achieves}} a masterful handling of colour; medieval churches {{tended to be}} extremely colourful, with frescoed walls, painted capitals, and <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> paintings. Pale tonalities dominate, with the main contrast found in the dark areas of Christ's hair and beard, which are utilised to make the features of his face stand out more, and position his head as the focal point.|$|E
5|$|Stiffening laths, if used, are attached. Both {{horn and}} laths may be bound and glued with further lengths of sinew. After months of drying the bow {{is ready for}} use. Further {{finishing}} may include thin leather or waterproof bark, to protect the bow from moisture, and recent Turkish bows were often highly decorated with colourful paints and <b>gold</b> <b>leaf.</b>|$|E
5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines.

5|$|Leonardo's {{youth was}} spent in a Florence that was ornamented by the works of these artists and by Donatello's contemporaries, Masaccio, whose figurative frescoes were imbued with realism and emotion, and Ghiberti, whose Gates of Paradise, gleaming with <b>gold</b> <b>leaf,</b> {{displayed}} the art of combining complex figure compositions with detailed architectural backgrounds. Piero della Francesca had made a detailed study of perspective, {{and was the first}} painter to make a scientific study of light. These studies and Alberti's treatise De Pictura were to {{have a profound effect on}} younger artists and in particular on Leonardo's own observations and artworks.|$|E
5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, the drawing room and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in <b>gold</b> <b>leaf.</b> The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E

50|$|The Dymkovo {{toys are}} moulded from {{a mixture of}} local potter's clay and river sand. The parts of a toy are then {{fastened}} together with watery clay. After the toys are dried and tempered in a furnace, they are whitewashed with chalk diluted in milk, then painted with tempera (before 1953, the artists used aniline paints ground with eggs) in 4 to 10 (or more) colors, and decorated with <b>gold</b> <b>leafs.</b>|$|R

5|$|The helmet is {{an example}} of a three-piece Roman {{ceremonial}} cavalry helmet, made of sheet iron covered with silver sheet and partly decorated with <b>gold</b> <b>leaf.</b> Such helmets were worn by Roman auxiliary cavalrymen in displays known as hippika gymnasia and may also have been worn in battle, despite their relative thinness and lavish decoration. Horses and riders wore lavishly decorated clothes, armour and plumes while performing feats of horsemanship and re-enacting historical and legendary battles, such as the wars of the Greeks and Trojans.|$|E
5|$|Edward's {{body was}} embalmed at Berkeley Castle, {{where it was}} viewed by local leaders from Bristol and Gloucester. It was then taken to Gloucester Abbey on 21 October, and on 20 December Edward was buried by the high altar, the funeral having {{probably}} been delayed to allow Edward III to attend in person. Gloucester was probably chosen because other abbeys had refused or been forbidden to take the King's body, {{and because it was}} close to Berkeley. The funeral was a grand affair and cost £351 in total, complete with gilt lions, standards painted with <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> and oak barriers to manage the anticipated crowds. Edward III's government probably hoped to put a veneer of normality over the recent political events, increasing the legitimacy of the young King's own reign.|$|E
5|$|Increasingly tough {{economic}} times in the early 1930s caused many theater owners to cancel plans for new construction and concentrate on attracting customers to existing theaters. Only one more cinema, the 2,168-seat Alameda Theatre (1932) in Alameda, California would ever be built by Pflueger. Commissioned by the Nasser Brothers, the eclectic Alameda's exterior incorporated deeply incised and intricate Moorish Revival rosettes on cream-colored smoothly curved sides {{on either side of}} Art Nouveau flowers in bas relief rising between eight vertical Moderne speed lines. The Art Deco interior design used imitation silver and <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> for accents and warm colors for a stylized mezzanine mural with a hint of Cubism. In the interest of economy, the Alameda's floor plan was nearly identical to that of the El Rey Theatre, including twin curved staircases, and some floral and geometric elements were borrowed from the Paramount.|$|E

5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and a complete set of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|The Hallaton Helmet is a {{decorated}} iron Roman cavalry parade helmet originally {{covered in a}} sheet of silver and decorated in places with <b>gold</b> <b>leaf.</b> It was discovered in 2000 near Hallaton, Leicestershire after Ken Wallace, {{a member of the}} Hallaton Fieldwork Group, found coins in the area. Further investigation by professional archaeologists from University of Leicester Archaeological Services discovered that the site appeared to have been used as a large-scale Iron Age shrine. Nine years of conservation and restoration has been undertaken by experts from the British Museum, supported by a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of £650,000. The helmet is now on permanent display at the Harborough Museum in Market Harborough alongside other artefacts from the Hallaton Treasure hoard.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of gold on the shields, {{in contrast to}} its absence {{on the rest of}} the ceiling, serves to link the ceiling to some extent with the frescoes around the walls. In the latter, <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> has been applied lavishly to many details and in some of the frescoes, notably those by Perugino, has been most expertly used not just to detail the robes but to highlight the folds by subtle graduation in the density of golden flecks. It is this technique that Michelangelo has picked up on and carried a step further, inspired also perhaps by the medallions that appear on a Roman triumphal arch in Botticelli's episode from the Life of Moses, showing the Punishment of the Rebels.|$|E
50|$|The {{special issue}} Canadian <b>Gold</b> Maple <b>Leaf</b> coin {{contains}} the highest purity gold of any bullion coin, at 99.999% or 0.99999, while the popular issue Canadian <b>Gold</b> Maple <b>Leaf</b> coin has a purity of 99.99%. In 2006, the United States Mint began producing the American Buffalo gold bullion coin with a purity of 99.99%. The Australian Gold Kangaroos were first coined in 1986 as the Australian Gold Nugget but changed the reverse design in 1989. Other modern coins include the Austrian Vienna Philharmonic bullion coin and the Chinese Gold Panda.|$|R

5|$|The {{jewellery}} {{consists of}} three gold pendants, two glass beads, one gold wire bead, and a fragment of a jet hair pin. The pendants and beads all {{seem to have been}} strung together, probably forming a necklace that was in place around the neck of the body. Two of the pieces consist of gold cabochon pendants inset with jewels, while the third is a very elaborate shield-shaped jewel inlaid with 57 red garnets and a larger scallop-shaped gem in the centre. The garnets rest on a thin layer of <b>gold</b> <b>leaf</b> to reflect the light and increase their luminosity. It may have been created from recycled older pieces of jewellery, as the size, shape and thickness of the individuals garnet are all different.|$|E
5|$|The {{resort is}} among the first modern tourist destinations, after King George III's, brother the Duke of Gloucester built a grand {{residence}} there, Gloucester Lodge, and passed the mild winter there in 1780; the King made Weymouth his summer holiday residence on fourteen occasions between 1789 and 1805, even venturing into the sea in a bathing machine. A painted statue of the King stands on the seafront, called the King's Statue, which was renovated in 2007/8 by stripping 20 layers of paintwork, replacing it with new paints and <b>gold</b> <b>leaf,</b> and replacing the iron framework with a stainless steel one. A mounted white horse representing the King is carved into the chalk hills of Osmington.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish {{made to look like}} a castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with <b>gold</b> <b>leaf.</b> One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E
