5000|$|Fisherman have {{different}} preferences about the equipment they use for bank fishing, but most agree with certain basics. Obviously fishing tackle is needed. Most bank fishing is performed with a rod, reel and lures or bait. Often two fishing rods are used. The bait {{can be changed}} on one rod while fishing continues with the other. Some fishermen bring a lidded container for the fish they catch which doubles as a seat. Other fishermen bring a [...] to hold the fish they catch. Catch and release fishermen don't need either of these.

Tracker sells their boats at Bass Pro Shops retail stores, retail centers owned by Tracker, as well as a network of Independent boat retailers in the United States, Canada, and in more than 25 other countries around the world.

40|$|Motivation: Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) is used {{to study}} the organization and the positioning of specific base pair sequences of DNA within the nucleus of a cell. Many FISH image analysis software tools have been developed capable of nuclei extraction from the image background as well as fluorescent signal identification. However, previously developed tools use a threshold-based method for extracting nuclei from the image background; therefore, they are highly inflexible, and thus manual extraction of the nuclear boundary is often required. In addition, manual extraction is a subjective task due to the investigator’s cognitive bias. As a result, we propose a graphical software tool called <b>FISH</b> <b>FINDER</b> to automatically analyze FISH images. Furthermore, <b>FISH</b> <b>FINDER</b> {{is based on a}} statistical approach called Compound Bayesian Classifier, which enables investigators to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively; additionally, <b>FISH</b> <b>FINDER</b> is capable of both 2 D and 3 D FISH image analysis.

50|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>finders</b> {{were derived}} from fathometers, active sonar {{instruments}} used for navigation and safety to determine the depth of water. The fathom is a unit of water depth, from which the instrument gets its name. The fathometer is an echo sounding system for measurement of water depth. A fathometer will display water depth and can make an automatic permanent record of measurements. Since both fathometers and fishfinders work the same way, and use similar frequencies and can detect both the bottom and fish, the instruments have merged.|$|R

40|$|Motivation: Fluorescence in situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) is used {{to study}} the organization and the positioning of specific DNA sequences within the cell nucleus. Analyzing the data from FISH images is a tedious process that invokes an element of subjectivity. Automated FISH image analysis offers savings in {{time as well as}} gaining the benefit of objective data analysis. While several FISH image analysis software tools have been developed, they often use a threshold-based segmentation algorithm for nucleus segmentation. As fluorescence signal intensities can vary significantly from experiment to experiment, from cell to cell, and within a cell, threshold-based segmentation is inflexible and often insufficient for automatic image analysis, leading to additional manual segmentation and potential subjective bias. To overcome these problems, we developed a graphical software tool called <b>FISH</b> <b>Finder</b> to automatically analyze FISH images that vary significantly. By posing the nucleus segmentation as a classification problem, compound Bayesian classifier is employed so that contextual information is utilized, resulting in reliable classification and boundary extraction. This makes it possible to analyze FISH images efficiently and objectively without adjustment of input parameters. Additionally, <b>FISH</b> <b>Finder</b> was designed to analyze the distances between differentially stained FISH probes...|$|E

25|$|In 1931, {{the first}} powered drum {{was created by}} Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a {{circular}} device that was set {{to the side of}} the boat and would draw in the nets. Since World War II, radio navigation aids and <b>fish</b> <b>finders</b> have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. The first purpose built stern trawler was Fairtry built in 1953 at Aberdeen, Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. The ship served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the second}} World War, {{there have been}} rapid {{improvements}} in fish finding and harvesting techniques {{with the development of}} scientific location methods such as <b>fish</b> <b>finders</b> and the development of size-selective harvesting methods such as net mesh size [17]. There has also been economic pressure on fishermen to harvest the more valuable larger old fish and not harvest the smaller young fish. As a result of this targeting of bigger fish, commercial fish populations are changing to populations of smaller and weaker fish [18]. For example, Crocket [4] has reported that it is now rare to find South Atlantic red snapper older than 10 years. The declining size in fish populations also tends to be related to behavioral changes and/or genetic changes resulting in slower growth rates and a smaller size at maturity [11].|$|R
