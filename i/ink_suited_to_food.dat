His method of casting type may have been different from the hand mould used in subsequent decades. Detailed analysis of the type used in his 42-line Bible has revealed irregularities {{in some of the}} characters that cannot be attributed to ink spread or type wear under the pressure of the press. Scholars conjecture that the type pieces may have been cast from a series of matrices made with a series of individual stroke punches, producing many different versions of the same glyph. It has also been suggested that the method used by Gutenberg involved using a single punch to make a mould, but the mould was such that the process of taking the type out disturbed the casting, creating variants and anomalies, and that the punch-matrix system came into use possibly around the 1470s.This raises the possibility that the development of movable type in the West may have been progressive rather than a single innovation.|$|R

50|$|As {{with other}} cast iron vessels, a {{seasoned}} pan or dutch oven should not regularly be used <b>to</b> cook <b>foods</b> containing tomatoes, vinegar or other acidic ingredients, as these foods will eventually remove the protective layer created during the seasoning process. Cast iron ovens are best <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> cook <b>food</b> high in oil or fat, such as chicken, bacon, or sausage, or used for deep frying. Subsequent cleanings are usually accomplished {{without the use}} of soap. Detergent soaps and dishwashers can remove the seasoning on cast iron, so some cookbook authors recommend only wiping the pans clean after each use, or using other cleaning methods such as a salt scrub or boiling water. The protective layer itself is polymeric and not very susceptible to soaps, and many users do briefly use detergents and soaps. However, cast iron is very prone to rust, and the protective layer may have pinholes, so soaking for long periods is contraindicated as the layer may start to flake off.|$|R

The beak of each species is <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> the <b>food</b> available in its particular environment, suggesting that beak shapes evolved by natural selection. Large beaks were found on the islands where the primary source of food for the finches are nuts and therefore the large beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for opening the nuts and staying well nourished. Slender beaks were found on the finches which found insects to be the best source of food on the island they inhabited; their slender beaks allowed the birds to be better equipped for pulling out the insects from their tiny hiding places. The finch is also found on the mainland and it is thought that they migrated to the islands and began adapting to their environment through natural selection.|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that larval food stress reduces {{lifetime}} fitness {{regardless of the}} conditions subsequently faced by adults. However, according to the environment-matching hypothesis, a plastic developmental response to poor nutrition results in an adult phenotype that is better adapted <b>to</b> restricted <b>food</b> conditions than one having developed in high food conditions. Such a strategy might evolve when current conditions are a reliable predictor of future conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of larval food conditions (low, improving and high food) on reproductive fitness in both low and high food adults environments. Contrary to this hypothesis, we {{found no evidence that}} food restriction in larval ladybird beetles produced adults that were better <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> continuing <b>food</b> stress. In fact, reproductive rate was invariably lower in females that were reared at low food, regardless of whether adults were well fed or food stressed. Juveniles that encountered improving conditions during the larval stage compensated for delayed growth by accelerating subsequent growth, and thus showed no evidence of a reduced reproductive rate. However, these same individuals lost more mass during the period of starvation in adults, which indicates that accelerated growth results in an increased risk of starvatio...|$|R

40|$|Evidence of Shakespeare’s {{interest}} in food preparation and cooking is recurrent throughout his works, though the difficulties {{provided by the}} translation of such figurative language have attracted much less interest among scholars. Building on some earlier research (Scarpa 1995 a, 1995 b) and some more recent publications (Fitzpatrick 2007, 2011) on the language of food, taste and cooking in Shakespeare’s plays, the paper discusses some instances of the translation into Italian by different translators of this often very culture-specific knowledge and terminology {{in terms of the}} difficulty of translating such imagery in the target language when trying to maintain the language of food. This specialized language may in fact be considered to fall into the Bard’s language of “things” and, as such, stands most in danger of becoming archaic and posing a problem for translators with a different historical and cultural background. The examples will mainly be drawn from the two practical operations of the baking of bread, cakes and pastry, and the preparation and cooking of meat. It will be argued that the translation approach most <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> all <b>food</b> references in Shakespeare’s plays is a reader-centred approach and in the conclusion some remarks will also be made on other reader-centred approaches to Shakespeare’s language outside the boundaries of Translation Studies which can {{have a positive impact on}} revitalizing Shakespeare for a contemporary audience...|$|R

The study examined methods and amounts of investment by small-holder farmers in southwestern Nigeria. Multistage sampling {{was used to}} randomly select 200 arable farmers from 20 LGAs distributed throughout five states in the region. Descriptive statistics and a multiple regression analysis were used to analyze data. The study showed that {{the average age of}} farmers was 46. 5 years and that families were very large, averaging 10 members. The level of education was mostly low but respondents were highly experienced farmers with a mean farming experience of 24. 6 years.

Ninety percent of farmers had no tenure on their farm holdings beyond usufructuary rights. Most farmers did not use critical farm inputs such as tractors; fertilizer, improved seedlings and agrochemicals while those who did use them had invested very little. Key factors determining farm investment were farm size and income while expenditure incurred on fertilizer, land improvement and capital assets were key determinants of a farm’s income. Important recommendations determined by the study include the use of farm extension agents to educate farmers on sources and how to access existing investment opportunities for small holder operators, land reform policies that will give tenure to farm operators, and to increase investment on farm inputs and assets to increase output and income...|$|R

This paper compares school food provision systems and their utilisation of organic food in Denmark, Finland, Germany, Italy and Norway, discussing how various strategies and instruments used for organic food procurement in school meals may increase organic {{food consumption}}. Using five analytical categories—(a) type of school food service, (b) degree of public financing, (c) degree of political and administrative involvement in school food procurement in general, (d) degree of specific support for organic school food, and (e) availability of organic <b>food</b> supply adapted <b>to</b> school <b>food</b> service— values have been assessed for each country in order to summarise and visually display their differences. Especially, the degree of specific support for organic school food shows a significant relation to the actual use of organic food in school meals. To maximise the share of organic food in school meals, instruments should be adapted to the actual points of departure in each case. It is argued that strategies and instruments designed to promote public procurement of organic food increase the consumption of organic food in schools and that such policies will have the greatest impact when they are linked up with broader concepts such as a whole-school approach and sustainable nutrition...|$|R

The estimated internal rate of return (IRR) to investment in maize research and extension in southern Mali over the period 1969 - 90 is 135 %. This high rate can be attributed to low research costs (much of the technical package was borrowed from research conducted elsewhere in West Africa), and the high economic value of maize as an import substitute. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the IRR is robust with respect to adverse changes in assumptions concerning overvaluation of the exchange rate, research costs, extension costs, and area of improved maize.

40|$|The {{highland}} cooking banana (Musa spp., AAA-EA genome) is {{the most}} important crop in the East African Great Lakes region. In Uganda, production has expanded and productivity increased in the country’s southwest and declined in the Central region where the crop has traditional roots. Analyzing crop characteristics and performance was imperative to elucidate the factors that have contributed to this change. Performance analysis helps to inform possible investment policies and strategies in the banana subsector for both regions. The study was carried out in central and southwest regions of the country, which have divergent production constraints and opportunities. Changes in economic conditions appear to have contributed to the shift in banana production from the central to the southwest. Specifically, increase in nonfarm-farm income in the central region reduced farmers’ need for cash income generated from farm production. On the other hand, high food prices increased farmers’ need to rely on own farm production for household needs. There was a shift in resource allocation in favor of crops most <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> satisfying household <b>food</b> needs (e. g., sweet potato (Lpomoea batatas), cassava (Manihot esculenta) and beans (Phaseolus spp.) against crops that appear to be more profitable (e. g., bananas) when valued at farm-gate prices. In the southwest, farmers adopted technologies and crop activities that were relatively more labor demanding but more rewarding in terms of cash benefits. Specifically, bananas were adopted because they satisfied both the cash needs and food requirements of the farmers. However, a significant proportion of land (not <b>suited</b> <b>to</b> banana production) in the southwest (15. 4 %) is committed to finger millet (Eleusine coracana) production to supplement bananas in terms of food security...|$|R

To inform the Australian red meat industry regarding the environmental performance of exported food products, this study conducted the first multi-impact analysis of Australian red meat export supply chains including all stages through to warehousing in the USA. A large, integrated dataset based on case study farms and regional survey was used to model beef and lamb from major representative production regions in eastern Australia. Per kilogram of retail-ready red meat, fresh water consumption ranged from 441. 7 to 597. 6  L across the production systems, stress-weighted water use from 108. 5 to 169. 4  L H 2 O-e, fossil energy from 28. 1 to 46. 6  MJ, crop land occupation from 2. 5 to 29. 9  m 2 and human edible protein conversion efficiency ranged from 7. 9 to 0. 3, with major differences observed between grass finished and grain finished production. GHG emissions excluding land use and direct land use change ranged from 16. 1 to 27. 2  kg CO 2 -e per kilogram, and removals and emissions from land use and direct land use change ranged from − 2. 4 to 8. 7  kg CO 2 -e per kilogram of retail retail ready meat. Process based life cycle assessment shows that environmental impacts and resource use were highest in the farm and feedlot phase. Transportation contributed ≤ 5 % of greenhouse gas emissions, water and land, confirming that food miles is not a suitable indicator of environmental impacts for red meat transported by ocean shipping. The contribution of international transportation to total energy demand was higher, ranging from 14 to 23 %.
