50|$|Although often {{considered}} foundational in business law, the modern relevance of negotiability has been questioned. Negotiability {{can be traced}} back to the 1700s and Lord Mansfield, when money and liquidity was relatively scarce. The <b>holder</b> <b>in</b> <b>due</b> <b>course</b> rule has been limited by various statutes. Concerns have also been raised that the <b>holder</b> <b>in</b> <b>due</b> <b>course</b> rule does not align the incentives of the mortgage originators and the assignees efficiently.|$|E

40|$|Underpinning {{the law on}} {{documentary}} {{credits and}} independent guarantees is a legal principle of autonomy which dictates that these financial instruments should, {{as a matter of}} law, be treated separately from a trader’s contractual agreement. However, despite this, fraudulent behaviour may still occur when these financial and legal instruments are used in practice. In response, a fraud exception to the autonomy principle has been recognised by many national and international courts in an attempt to mitigate the effects of fraudulent trade practices. The application of this exception within the English courts is, however, problematic owing to the narrowness of its construction and application. Additionally, the paucity of alternate legal instruments for regulating fraudulent trade practices means that Jordanian courts are not in any better position than their English counterparts, leaving traders confused as to their legal position when a fraud dispute arises. Given the large financial value of fraudulent transactions and the risks involved, the use of these legal instruments has declined as has the banks’ investment in this area creating a problem for legal policy makers. The aim of this dissertation is to, first, critically examine the fraud exception under English and Jordanian law by exploring the problems associated with the application of the fraud exception; and, second, to propose legal reforms which would alleviate both the legal and practical problems associated with the fraud exception as it stands currently. The thesis is that, whilst the autonomy principle plays a vital role in international trade, the courts should facilitate the fraud exception application and recognise other exceptions, such as the non-genuinity and the underlying contract exception, where the former exception would be unable to prevent fraud occurrence. The approach is based upon a critical evaluation of Anglo-American and Jordanian case law, supplemented by secondary sources and a qualitative examination of the Jordanian approach to the fraud exception based upon interviews with Jordanian judges. The dissertation concludes that an effective legal approach to fraudulent transactions using documentary credits and independent guarantees must be founded upon objective rather than subjective principles and that the courts’ use of injunctions should be different <b>in</b> cases involving <b>holders</b> <b>in</b> <b>due</b> <b>course</b> from those not involving such parties. These findings will impact upon legal policy debates within both English common law and international trade law more generally and the examination of the Jordanian position is instructive in that it is the first such study of its kind...|$|R

If the recipient of a negotiable interest is a donee (that is, a person who receives by gift), that person would generally not have the rights of a <b>holder</b> <b>in</b> <b>due</b> <b>course</b> - that is, a person who received the instrument for value and without notice of other claims. However, if the gift was received from a qualifying <b>holder</b> <b>in</b> <b>due</b> <b>course</b> of the same instrument, the shelter rule gives the donee the right to recover on the instrument.|$|E

The instrument, memorializing: (1) the power to demand payment; and, (2) the right to be paid, can move, for example, in the instance of a [...] "bearer instrument", wherein the possession of the document itself attributes and ascribes the right to payment.

5000|$|Negotiable {{instruments}} are unconditional and impose few to no duties on the issuer or payee other than payment.
