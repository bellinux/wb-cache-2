50|$|A typical energy {{efficiency}} is 60%, but up to 80% is possible. This {{should not be}} confused with the volumetric efficiency, which relates the volume of water delivered to total water taken from the source. The portion of water available at the delivery pipe will be reduced by the ratio of the <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> to the supply head. Thus if the source is 2 meters above the ram and the water is lifted to 10 meters above the ram, only 20% of the supplied water can be available, the other 80% being spilled via the waste valve. These ratios assume 100% {{energy efficiency}}. Actual water delivered will be further reduced by the energy efficiency factor. In the above example, if the energy efficiency is 70%, the water delivered will be 70% of 20%, i.e. 14%. Assuming a 2-to-1 supply head to <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> ratio and 70% efficiency, the delivered water would be 70% of 50%, i.e. 35%. Very high ratios of delivery to supply head usually result in lowered energy efficiency. Suppliers of rams often provide tables giving expected volume ratios based on actual tests.|$|E

40|$|A new {{instrumental}} {{method for}} measuring the physical properties of a liquid has been developed. The instrument, called a capacitive drop tensiometer (CDT), {{is based on the}} drop volume principle in combination with a capacitive transducer. A <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> with a specialized wetting design was constructed for forming drops. The capacitive transducer uses the <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> as one of its plates and a cylindrical ring plate, which surrounds the <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> and the space occupied by the drop that is formed, as another. Excellent linearity is achieved by optimizing the design, with an accuracy of drop volume measurement of approximately 2 mu l. The system is suitable for measuring both drops in equilibrium and those in the process of growing. Its capability of real-time measurement makes it particularly useful for volatile liquids, in which instance the measurement of drop volume using a flowmeter or a pump is no longer reliable. The CDT {{can also be used to}} determine concentration. It was found that the concentration curve is linear for aqueous glycerol solutions although not so for aqueous ethanol solutions.

40|$|Investigations of {{hydraulic}} {{operating conditions}} of air lift pump with {{three types of}} air-water mixers. The paper presents the analysis of results of the investigations concerning the influence of various constructive solutions of the air-water mixers on hydraulic operating conditions of the air lift pump. The scope of the investigations encompassed the determination of characteristics of <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> and delivery rate for three types of air-water mixers applied in the constructed air lift pump. Using the obtained results, {{the efficiency of the}} three types of air-water mixers applied in this air lift pump was determined. The analysis was carried out and there was checked whether the improved analytical Stenning-Martin model can be used to design air lift pumps with the air-water mixers of these types. The highest capacity in the water transport was reached by the air lift pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest one – with the 3 rd type air-water mixer. The water flow in the air lift pump increases along with the rise in the air flow. The lower are the hydraulic losses generated during flow of the air flux by the air-water mixer, the higher is the air lift pump capacity. Along with the rise in the water <b>delivery</b> <b>head,</b> the capacity of the air lift pump decreases. The highest efficiency is reached by the air lift pump with the 1 st type air-water mixer, the lowest – with the 3 st type air-water mixer. The efficiency of the air lift pump for the three investigated types of air-water mixers decreases along with the rise in air flow rate and water <b>delivery</b> <b>head.</b> The values of submergence ratio (h/L) of the delivery pipe, calculated {{with the use of the}} improved analytical Stenning-Martin model, coincide quite well with the values of h/L determined from the measurements...|$|E

40|$|A {{hydrokinetic}} coil pump (HCP) {{is described}} by its name. It is a coil pump driven by the kinetic energy in flowing water. The hydrokinetic energy is converted into mechanical energy {{by means of a}} paddle-wheel. The coil pump makes up part of the paddle-wheel and together is called a HCP. The HCP floats in a stream of flowing water while tethered to the bank. The focus {{of the study was to}} identify and analyse the factors influencing the HCP. The HCP was then optimized for rural application. Data acquisition took place through experimentation on a full scale experimental platform according to a central composite experimental design. Variables used for the experimentation included; Stream Velocity, <b>Delivery</b> <b>Head,</b> Number of Coils, Discharge, Number of Paddles, Paddle-Wheel rotational speed Overall HCP efficiencies of up to 22 percent were obtained. The efficiency would drop as the stream velocity increased. Stream velocity has been identified as the most influential factor with regards to the variables analysed by this study. The HCP is ideal for rural application. The simplicity of the design ensures reliability as well as an effective water supply solution. The HCP is ideal for slow flowing rivers and can deliver up to 1190 ℓ/h to a <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> of 5 m with a stream velocity of 1. 2 m/s.

40|$|Cavitation in a kinetic pump reduces <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> and {{efficiency}} of the pump. It also causes mechanical damage and an increase of vibrations and noise. Therefore, {{it is important to}} detect inception and development of a cavitation phenomenon in the pump. This article deals with signals of vibration and noise, which will be used for detection and monitoring of the cavitation in kinetic pumps, and also to prevent the effect of the cavitation in the pump and pumping system. When the cavitation is increasing, the flowing conditions are changing, which leads to an increase of vibrations of the pump and emitted noise in the surroundings. Because vibrations and noise are transferred from the pump through its casing, the signal is non-uniformly distorted due to transfer losses and structure of the casing surfaces. Noise and vibrations are increasing steadily, but in some specific frequency ranges the signal is more pronounced than {{in other parts of the}} spectrum. Experimental results have shown that vibration and noise in the audible spectrum can be successfully used for cavitation detection and its prevention...|$|E
40|$|Direct laser {{deposition}} (DLD) is an {{additive manufacturing}} process that builds up a part layer-by-layer by fusing metal powder to a solid substrate. A coaxial laser and powder <b>delivery</b> <b>head</b> is commonly used, and here a critical process variable is the standoff {{distance between the}} nozzle and the material deposition point. This contribution investigates the role of this variable and the effect that it has on the final part geometry. The experimental results show that good layer consistency can, in fact, be obtained with no movement of the substrate between layers for more than 20 layers, or 10 mm under tested conditions, and that poorer results are obtained by regular movement of the substrate by a badly chosen constant amount. A theoretical {{analysis of the situation}} establishes a method to estimate melt pool size using an analytically calculated temperature near the heat source. Based on this, simple heat and mass flow models are established to allow some of the results to be explained. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Several methods and correlations {{have been developed}} to predict reduction rate in centrifugal pump performance when handling viscous fluids, but their results are not in very good agreement with each other. In this study, a common industrial low specific speed pump, which is extensively used in different applications, is studied. The entire pump, including impeller, volute, pipes, front and rear sidewall gaps, and balance holes, is simulated in Computational Fluid Dynamics and 3 D full Navier Stokes equations are solved. CFD results are compared with experimental data such as pump performance curves, static pressure in casing, and disk friction loss. Dimensionless angular velocity and leakage rate are investigated in sidewall gap and efficiency variation due to viscosity is studied. The results demonstrate that the behavior of the fluid in sidewall gap is strictly sensitive to viscosity. Increasing viscosity improves the volumetric efficiency by reducing internal leakage through wear rings and balance holes, causing, however, a significant fall in the disk and overall efficiency. Results lead to some recommendations for designing centrifugal pumps which may be used in transferring viscous fluids...|$|E
