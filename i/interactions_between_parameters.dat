The structure of PBPK models are ideal frameworks into which disparate in vitro and in vivo data can be integrated and utilised to translate information generated, using alternative to animal measures of toxicity and human biological monitoring data, into plausible corresponding exposures. However, these models invariably include the description of well known non-linear biological processes such as, enzyme saturation and <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> such as, organ mass and body mass. Therefore, an appropriate sensitivity analysis technique is required which can quantify the influences associated with individual parameters, <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> and any non-linear processes. In this report we have defined a workflow for sensitivity analysis of PBPK models that is computationally feasible, accounts for <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters,</b> and can be displayed in the form of a bar chart and cumulative sum line (Lowry plot), which we believe is intuitive and appropriate for toxicologists, risk assessors and regulators...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper uses a GIS-based cellular automata (CA) framework to study and create an applied and ecologically significant model of spread for invasive plant species. Cellular automata (CA) coded within a Geographic Information System (GIS) are employed to test the ability of studied parameters of vegetation dynamics to represent spatial growth patterns. This method combines the well-established spatial data management and presentation capabilities of GIS with the spatial and temporal modeling capabilities of CA theory, creating the ideal tool for applied, data rich modeling. Instead of conventionally testing a previously created model, parameters are examined through simulation for their contribution to spread and the resulting spatial pattern. Initial simulation runs focus on the different effects of stochastic versus deterministic parameter values. Further studies examine the effect of different relationships, conditions and <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters.</b> Upper and lower bounds to parameters, the <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters,</b> and the relative importance of each parameter are examined in a number of combinations. Each parameter is then accepted or declined to create a conceptual model outlining the ecologically most significant features of the species. The authors show how models of invasion and vegetation dynamics can effectively be transposed into a contextually rich environment through a GIS-CA framework of model creation. 1...|$|E

The evader is modeled as a {{six degrees of}} freedom generic jet fighter aircraft with aileron, elevator, rudder and throttle setting as the control variables. The pursuer is a medium range generic air-to-air missile and modeled as a point-mass body. The game is played in three dimensions. The pursuer seeks to intercept the evader and the evader seeks to avoid interception. The search for an optimal evading solution is performed by using parallel evolutionary programming (PEP). The optimisation algorithm has to minimise the objective function, which is a ¡¯selfplay¡¯ pursuit-evasion simulation. The value of the game is the outcome of the ¡¯self-play¡¯ game, i. e. capture or no capture. The solution that gives the maximum value of fitness with no capture is considered the best. The good solution is found to be highly dependent on the initial condition, the number of generation, the size of population and the number of CPUs used. The complex <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> is best studied from a statistical perspective. The <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> is studied by using factorial analysis.

We conclude that the concept of programming can be applied to reproductive development and related health outcomes, and that the complex potential for <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> controlling fetal development and postnatal exposures invokes a need to adopt a perspective across the life course of an individual.

40|$|Inverse {{parameter}} estimation of individual-based models (IBMs) {{is a research}} area which {{is still in its}} infancy, in a context where conventional statistical methods are not well suited to confront this type of models with data. In this paper, we propose an original evolutionary algorithm which is designed for the calibration of complex IBMs, i. e. characterized by high stochasticity, parameter uncertainty and numerous non-linear <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> and model output. Our algorithm corresponds to a variant of the population-based incremental learning (PBIL) genetic algorithm, with a specific "optimal individual" operator. The method is presented in detail and applied to the individual-based model OSMOSE. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated and estimated parameters are compared with an independent manual calibration.

40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} {{examined}} the effectiveness of using probabilistic models to guide the sample generation process for searching high dimensional spaces. Although the simplest models, which do not account for parameter interdependencies, often perform well on many problems, they may perform poorly when used on problems that have a high degree of interdependence between parameters. More complex dependency networks that can account for the <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters</b> are required. However, building these networks may necessitate enormous amounts of sampling. In this paper, we demonstrate how a priori knowledge of parameter dependencies, even incomplete knowledge, can be incorporated to efficiently obtain accurate models that account for parameter interdependencies. This is achieved by effectively putting priors on the network structures that are created. These more accurate models yield improved results when used to guide the sample generation process for search and also when used to initialize the starting points of other search algorithms...|$|E

30|$|Concluding this part, we {{have shown}} that the applied {{experimental}} plan can be used to identify within a comparably low number of experiments the influence of the different reaction parameters on the nanocrystals' size and size dispersion and to identify the most important <b>interactions</b> <b>between</b> <b>parameters.</b> The values obtained with models built for calculating/predicting the size and PL linewidth of the nanocrystals are in good agreement with the experimental values, validating the assumptions made. Therefore, the synthesis of nanocrystals having a desired mean size and low size dispersion can be designed {{on the basis of the}} results of the experimental plan. On the other hand, the predictivity of the experimental plan is strongly dependent on the chosen experimental domain, i.e., the levels of the parameters (factors). As a consequence, extrapolation of the levels of some parameters beyond the predefined experimental range may be necessary. The use of an experimental plan having three (or more) levels per parameter reduces this problem.|$|E

While {{agent-based}} models (ABMs) {{are becoming}} increasingly popular for simulating complex and emergent phenomena in many fields, understanding and analyzing ABMs poses considerable challenges.
