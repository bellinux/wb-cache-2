40|$|This is {{the peer}} {{reviewed}} {{version of the}} following article: ANTAKI, C. [...] . et al, 2015. Police interviews with vulnerable people alleging sexual assault: probing inconsistency and questioning conduct. Journal of Sociolinguistics, 19 (3), pp. 328 – 350, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Reporting sexual assault to the authorities is fraught with difficulties, and these are compounded when the complainant is hindered by an intellectual disability (ID). In a study of 19 UK police interviews with complainants with ID alleging sexual assault and rape, we found that most interviewing officers on occasion pursued lines of questioning which not only probed inconsistencies (which is mandated by their guidelines), but implicitly questioned complainants' conduct (which is not). We detail two main conversational practices which imply disbelief and disapproval of the complainants' accounts and behaviour, and whose pragmatic entailments may pose problems for complainants with ID. Such practices probably emerge from interviewers' foreshadowing of the challenges likely to be made in court by defence counsel. As a policy recommendation, we suggest providing early explanation for the motivation for such questioning, and avoiding certain question formats (especially <b>how</b> <b>come</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> X? and why didn't <b>you</b> <b>do</b> Y?) ...|$|R

You know well enough that he's fifty times cleverer than Joe, {{and even in the}} matter of strength, though he's not so strong, I'm very sure that with his pugilistic powers he could keep order quite as well. Besides, all the people had made up their minds, as a matter of course, that Dom was to be premier, and then--he's a gentleman." ...|$|R

50|$|Answer: The one {{and only}} one reason is because {{citizens}} in USA have procedure to expel District Police Commissioner of their district. So Police Commissioner in US takes very less bribes and also ensures that the staff doesn‟t take much bribes. If Police Commissioner in US comes to know that his/her junior staff is taking bribes, (s)he will immediately run a sting operation; gather evidences and gets them expelled. Because (s)he fears that if corruption in junior staff increases, the citizens may expel him/her. The corruption in US police in drugs related cases is because most citizens in US do not have much aversion against drugs. But since in India, citizens have NO procedure to expel Police Chief, the Chief not only collects bribes, (s)he asks his/her juniors to collect maximal bribes. A typical Police Commissioner is alleged of keeping half of what (s)he collects and passes the half to MLAs, Home Minister and CM. <b>How</b> <b>come</b> <b>you,</b> the reader, <b>did</b> not know that US citizens can expel their Police Chiefs? Because the EIIs(Eminent Intellectuals of India), who control most {{of the media and}} the textbooks, do not want citizens of India to know that “US citizens have procedure to expel District Police Chiefs” because EIIs don‟t want citizens of India to demand such procedures.|$|R
