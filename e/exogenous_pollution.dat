40|$|Market {{mechanisms}} {{are increasingly being}} used as a tool for allocating somewhat scarce but unpriced rights and resources, such as air and water. Tradable permits have emerged as the most cost–effective measure leading to the emergence of both nationwide (SO 2) and supranational (CO 2) emission permits markets. By means of the dynamic optimization of companies which are covered by such environmental regulations, we develop an endogenous model for the emission permit spot price dynamics that also accounts for the presence of asymmetric information. In the model, the companies are characterized by <b>exogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> processes that, in the short term, are the underlying of the permit price dynamics. An extensive numerical exercise is carried out for the CO 2 permit price in the European market. We introduce for the first-time in the current literature a CO 2 option pricing model comparison. The option pricing method can be used for hedging purposes and for pricing CO 2 -linked projects and investments.

30|$|Our {{paper is}} {{among the first to}} study the medium- and {{long-term}} effects of pollution on labor supply in a developing country and adds to the very limited evidence by studying the issue at the aggregate population level and by using a fully <b>exogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> shock, rather than achieving identification through some policy change that might be suffering from other confounders. The closest paper to our study that we are aware of is Hanna and Oliva (2015). They however differ from us in that they study the reverse phenomenon of pollution reduction. Isen et al. (2016) is another paper with a similar research question. However, they only focus on the early childhood exposure and use a policy change in the 1970 s to identify the effect of pollution exposure, which is overall less persuasive than the direct evidence of pollution exposure our study uses. At the same time, an important difference between these studies and ours is that we are dealing with a relatively short but intense pollution shock, while they study a sustained decrease in pollution over time. Since the impact of pollution might not be linear, the resulting estimates need to be put in context and interpreted accordingly.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} an {{optimal growth model}} of an economy facing an <b>exogenous</b> <b>pollution</b> quota. In {{the absence of an}} international market of pollution permits, the economy has three instruments to reach sustainable growth: R&D to develop cleaner technologies, investment in new clean capital goods, and scrapping of the old dirty capital. The R&D technology depends negatively on a complexity component and positively on investment in this sector at constant elasticity. First, we characterize possible balanced growth paths for different parameterizations of the R&D technology. It is shown that countries with an under-performing R&D sector would need an increasing pollution quota over time to ensure balanced growth while countries with a highly efficient R&D sector would supply part of their assigned pollution permits in an international market without harming their long-term growth. Second, we study transitional dynamics to balanced growth. We prove that regardless of how large the regulation quota is, the transition dynamics leads to the balanced growth with binding quota in a finite time. In particular, we discover two optimal transition regimes: an intensive growth (sustained investment in new capital and R&D with scrapping the oldest capital goods), and an extensive growth (sustained investment in new capital and R&D without scrapping the oldest capital) ...|$|E

40|$|This work is an interdisciplinary, cross-cultural, widely-calibrated {{checklist}} for EU sustainable landscape management, {{which is}} intended to serve both as an analytical tool of reference {{as well as a}} design tool for local, regional and European policy making on sustainable developments. The tool has been developed out of a multidisciplinary study in EU countries which was designed to find out what would be the overall requirements for a sustainable management of the landscape of rural areas. Could these stipulations be brought together in a comprehensive system with sufficient consistency to comply with the notion that the landscape is an entity, which should be managed accordingly? Cooperation of the scientific experts with those involved in the practical side, and alternating plenary reporting with subgroup visits to farms in the rural landscapes of the participants' countries, allowed for the development of some truly interdisciplinary teamwork. Organic agriculture has been included to find out how organic agriculture contributes to the rural landscape. In the development of sustainable rural landscapes, aspects and processes from the a-biotic or environmental sphere and from the ecological or bio-sphere, do play a most fundamental role. So they are of crucial importance in the selection of criteria needed for the assessment of sustainability. Processes taking part in the a-biotic compartments like soil, water and air, do indispensably influence relations in the bio-sphere realm of a landscape (living organisms and ecosystems) and vice versa. Actually, the whole biosphere depends on the conditions that the a-biotic sphere provides for. The other way round, living nature creates non-living nature as a product of its vital processes. Both spheres are subject {{to a wide range of}} interconnected complexes of physical, (bio) chemical and ecological processes, assimilation and dissimulation, anabolism and catabolism, growth, maturation and decline. They all are quite sensible to endogenous control and also to the systems’ <b>exogenous</b> <b>pollution,</b> degradation, depletion and destruction, because the nature of these processes is very subtle and dynamic and moreover locally determined. These days, they are increasingly influenced by a number of deteriorating side effects of industrial and infra-structural activities on a global-level. The sustainable management of landscapes, that obviously includes the prevention of the negative effects of human activities on specific elements of the a-biotic- and the bio-sphere, bio-topes or whole landscapes, requires careful and comprehensive planning and an attitude of good stewardship. Overall objectives of such a sustainable landscape management should include a clean, healthy environment and a bio-(genetic) diversity, which respects the valuable heritage of natural and cultural evolution. Here, with the word environment we refer to the a-biotic sphere: soil, water, air and energy, targeting at favourable conditions of the earth’s non-renewable resources. The biosphere is referred to as ecology, meaning all relevant biological and ecological relationships in space and in time. It is important to realise that all elements of the environment and the biosphere have not only complicated interactions among themselves as such. The elements are also very dependent on the extent into and the way in which they are perceived by the people in charge of policy decision-making. In the social realm, as will be pointed out later on (see column 3 economy and column 4 sociology of Table 3. 1), the existing differences between various actors and groups in getting access to decision-making are highly determinative for the kind of decisions taken. If experts or representatives are invited to participate in any decision-making process then the question is “who decides on whom to be invited in or out?” The various (potential) actors or actor-groups may have a combination of different economic and power interests. Especially in the context of policy shifts, e. g. toward a more sustainable land use, the vested interests connected to the previous policies have to find and accept ways to accommodate. A crucial question within economics is “which strategy is economic to whom?” The fairly usual and short term interest of relative smaller private groups has to be exchanged for the long term interest of larger and more communal groups. This requires another level of considerations with a rather ethical dimension, indicated as the cultural realm. Therein, the personal perceptions of the involved values are addressed as well as the explicit differences in paradigms and related value systems that make people prefer short term over and above long term or vice versa. For instance, the standard for clean water is not only determined in an indisputable scientific way. Examples of questions related to the standard for clean water are: “how clean should the water be and of what substance (absence or “x” concentration of “y” substances) ” and “how clean should the water be for what kind of uses: human consumption, bathing, washing, or trout farming?” The same decisions have to de made for standards on the necessary diversity of plant and animal species in a valley, on top of a hill or on a south or a north exposed slope. Aspects filtering in from the social and cultural realm should not be disregarded or even denied in the decision-making process of the environment and biosphere values and qualities. The setting of sustainable management standards can only be done in a satisfying way if the existence, the background and the future perspectives of such value-system related perceptions are explicitly addressed. Here, satisfying means: long time functioning and thus positively recognisable in the landscape in retrospective. (See the psychological aspects in section 3. 2. 3 and the anthropological aspects also in section 3. 2. 3.) In our study, the presence of experts who are familiar with the practices and ideas of organic agriculture was found to be very fruitful. They added experiences on possibilities to merge food production and nature production in not yet widely acknowledged ways. This once again stressed the importance of considering facts in their proper contexts. Compliant to what has already been mentioned about the complex interactions between the a-biotic and the bio-sphere, is that targets, criteria and parameters mentioned in column 1 (environment) of Table 3. 1 and resource conditions are thought to be respected and included in column 2 (ecology and biosphere) of Table 3. 1. Subsequently, they will be included as basic requirements in the considerations made in column 3 (economy), column 4 (sociology), column 5 (psychology) and column 6 (psychology and physiognomy/cultural geography). All these targets, criteria and parameters are compliant to the idea that survival of the biosphere is a prerequisite for a sustainable human development. The quality of the a-biotic biotic environment for sustainable landscape management is represented by the criteria for the a-biotic and biotic realm, viz. : environment and ecology. These two groups of criteria are presented below: Environment Resource conditions 1. 1 	Clean environment 1. 1. 1 	Fertile and resilient soil 1. 1. 2 	Water quality 1. 1. 3 	Air quality 1. 1. 4 	Wild fire control 1. 2 	Food and fibre sufficiency and quality 1. 2. 1 	Nationally sufficient and regionally sustainable levels of food and fibre production 1. 2. 2 	Good food and fibre quality to match sufficient quantities 1. 3 	Regional carrying capacity 1. 4 	Economic and efficient use of resources 1. 5 	Sustainable, site-adapted and regionally specific production systems Ecology Biological relationships 2. 1 	Bio-diversity 2. 1. 1 	Flora and fauna species’ diversity 2. 1. 2 	Bio-tope diversity 2. 1. 3 	Ecosystems’ diversity 2. 2 	Ecological coherence 2. 2. 1 	Vertical coherence: onsite 2. 2. 2 	Horizontal coherence: in the landscape 2. 2. 3 	Cyclical coherence: in time 2. 3 	Eco-regulation 2. 4 	Animal welfar...|$|E

40|$|By the BCR {{extraction}} {{procedures and}} HG-ICP-AES technique, the chemical speciation and pollution characteristics of soil mercury in typical mercury deposit areas of Western Hunan-Eastern Guizhou were studied. It {{was found that}} the concentrations of mercury in soils are dominated by residual form, followed by organic-sulfide form. Fe-Mn oxides and acid-exchangeable form are rather low. The percent of the four mercury species in soils are 85. 77 %, 12. 44 %, 0. 93 % and 0. 86 %, respectively. The total concentrations and each species of mercury in soils show positive relationship with the concentration of sands, and negative relationship with the concentration of clays in soils. They also increase with the soil pH value. Mercury concentration in soils has spatial changes. In general, the concentrations in the surface soil are higher than those of sub-surface soils. Furthermore, the concentrations rapidly decrease with the distance from the pollution source increased and vary among different soil samples from different location and land use type. The results indicated that <b>exogenous</b> mercury <b>pollution</b> caused by human activities provides significant influence on environmental toxicity and pollution characteristics of mercury in soils of mercury deposit area...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze whether the choice between two {{instruments}} of environmental policy (pollution taxes vs emission permits) affects the market shares in the presence of imperfectly competitive product markets.

The environmental policy taken by each government is different.

Thus, the Higher− Abatement− Cost (the Lower) sector in the Domestic country increases (decreases) its market shares compared to its counterpart in the Foreign country. ...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays {{the quality}} of food is a multifactorial concept, which include safety, {{nutritional}} and edonistic aspect. Concerning the safety problems, {{it is important to}} assess the presence of undesirable compounds, which can affect negatively the normal organism physiology. The sources of these substances can be <b>exogenous</b> (environmental <b>pollution)</b> or endogenous (related to degradation of some components). The aim of this paper was to investigate on PAH contamination of 4 different types of feeds (and corresponding ingredients) and possible transfer of PAH contamination to the meat of 4 groups of pigs (of 8 pigs each) feeded with the 4 different formulations. Among feed ingredients, the most contaminated resulted to be tender wheat bran and soybean (BaP mean amounts of 0, 248 and 0, 153, respectively), while barley and corn showed the lowest contamination levels. All the meat samples showed similar and very low contamination levels, to confirm the fact that PAHs ingested with feeds are rapidly metabolised. The volatile fraction was assessed on feed, raw material and meat. Particular attention was paid for marker of secondary oxidation, like hexanal. The results obtained showed a low amount of hexanal, between not detectable (< 0. 2 μg/ kg) and 20 μg/kg. Among the raw material, soybean presented the lowest amount (from < 0. 5 to 0. 6 μg/kg), instead the quantity in barley was variable. The feeds showed high amount of hexanal: control fodder had 134 ± 69 μg/kg of hexanal, fodder + oil + vitamin E had 146 ± 72 μg/kg, fodder + sunflower oil had 182 ± 32 μg/kg, fodder + vitamin E had 161 ± 67 μg/kg.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{the impacts of}} an energy tax – the Climate Change Levy (CCL) – on the manufacturing sector using panel data from the UK production census. Our identification strategy builds on the comparison of trends in outcomes between plants subject to the CCL and plants that were granted an 80 % discount on the levy after joining a so-called Climate Change Agreement (CCA). Since the CCAs stipulate specific targets for energy usage or carbon emissions, this comparison yields a lower bound {{on the impact of}} the discount. To address a likely selection endogeneity in CCA participation, we adopt an IV approach that exploits <b>exogenous</b> variation in <b>pollution</b> discharges that determined eligibility for CCA participation. We find robust evidence that CCA participation had a strong positive impact on growth in both energy intensity and energy expenditures. An analysis of fuel choices at the plant level reveals that this effect is mainly driven by stronger growth in electricity use and translates into a positive impact on CO 2 emissions. We do not find any statistically significant impacts of the tax on employment, gross output or total factor productivity. We conclude that, had the CCL been implemented at full rate for all businesses, further cuts in energy use of substantial magnitud...|$|R
40|$|The day {{it became}} clear that {{disclosure}} was a powerful regulatory tool was June 30, 1988, when Richard J. Mahoney, then head of Monsanto (one of the biggest chemical manufacturers in the U. S.), made a dramatic claim. Mahoney said bluntly that he had been astounded by the magnitude of Monsanto’s annual release of 374 million pounds of toxins. He vowed to cut the release of air emissions 90 % worldwide by the end of 1992. ” 2 Atlantic Monthly, April 2000 The Toxic Release Inventory (TRI), which the United States Congress enacted in 1986, is the largest “Right to Know ” program in the world. Each year over 20, 000 facilities are required to report their emissions of hundreds of toxic chemicals to the government for dissemination to the public. Facilities that comprise the “Top 10 ” worst polluters within states not only emit a hugely disproportionate share of total U. S. environmental releases, but receive significant negative attention from the media, citizen’s groups, and non-governmental organizations. This paper uses <b>exogenous</b> changes to <b>pollution</b> rankings within states (due to the expansion of the industries covered by the TRI in 1998) as a way to test whether being labeled a “Top 10 ” worst polluter affected a facility’s total environmental releases. The results indicate that firms did respond to the “Top 10 ” worst polluter identification. Facilities that experienced an unexpected downward shift in their rankings, which led to their removal from the “Top 10 ” rankings within their states, reduced their emissions by hundreds of thousands of pounds less than they would have had they not experienced the drop in their rankings brought about by the introduction of the new highly polluting industries.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three chapters that analyze {{the health effects of}} pollution in China. The first chapter investigates the effect of air pollution on cardiovascular mortality in the urban areas of China. The second chapter estimates the effect of water pollution on infant mortality. The third chapter studies the relationship between water pollution and cancer among the elderly. The first chapter entitled "The Effect of Air Pollution on Cardiovascular Mortality: Evidences from the Beijing Olympic Games". I explore the <b>exogenous</b> air <b>pollution</b> variations induced by the 2008 Olympic Games to estimate the effects of air pollution on cardiovascular mortality in China. I use the regulation status during the Olympic Games as an instrument for air pollution. In the fixed-effects instrumental variable model, I find that air pollution has a robust and significant effect on cardiovascular mortality. In contrast, estimates from the conventional associational models are not robust. I estimate that decreasing current PM_ 10 concentration by 10 % will save more than 67, 000 lives (from cardiovascular diseases) in the urban areas in China each year. China's surface water system has been severely polluted in the process of rapid industrialization. The second chapter investigates how this water pollution affects infant mortality. I find that surface water pollution has a significant, nonlinear effect on infant mortality. As surface water quality deteriorates, infant mortality first increases and then decreases. Moderate levels of pollution are the most dangerous. People's avoidance behavior may explain the results: as water becomes more polluted people reduce the consumption of surface water. The ordered-probit selection model is applied to estimate the effects, and precipitation and wastewater dumping are used as the instruments for surface water quality. China also witnessed a dramatic increase in cancer rate in the past thirty years. In the third chapter, I investigate whether this high cancer rate is caused by water pollution. The difficulty in estimating the long-run health effects of pollution is that the lifetime exposure to pollution is hard to measure. However, China provides an ideal setting to estimate the long-run health effects of pollution because the Household Registration System (Hukou) effectively stopped people from migrating for many years. I focus on the elderly people (Age> 60) because their mobility is extremely restricted by the System, so their life-time exposure to water pollution is more likely captured by the water quality data in recent years. I find that water pollution has large, significant, positive effects on all cancer mortality rate, digestive cancer mortality rate, urinary cancer mortality rate, liver and stomach cancer mortality rate. I also find that water pollution has no impact on cancer mortality rates for the younger adults (Age from 20 - 50), which may partially justify our argument that pollution exposure for the younger people cannot be accurately measured because they migrate...|$|R
