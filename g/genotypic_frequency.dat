5000|$|Mutations of the ACADS gene are {{associated}} with a deficiency in the encoded protein short chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase; this is also known as butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. Many mutations have been identified in specific populations, and large-scale studies have been performed to determine the allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> for the defective gene. As short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is involved in beta-oxidation, a deficiency in this enzyme is marked by an increased amount of fatty acids. This deficiency is characterized by the presence of increased butyrylcarnitine (C4) in blood plasma, and increased ethylmalonic acid (EMA) concentrations in urine. Genotypes of individuals with this deficiency have it {{as a result of a}} mutation, variant, or a combination of the two. Among one population with the disease, three subgroups have been identified: one group has a failure to thrive, feeding difficulties, and hypotonia; another group had seizures; finally, one group had hypotonia and no seizures. Other studies showed that the deficiency may be asymptomatic in some individuals under normal conditions, with symptoms presenting under physiological stress conditions such as fasting or illness. The treatment of this deficiency can sometimes be unclear, because it can sometimes be asymptomatic. The treatment for this disease is similar to treatment of other fatty acid oxidation disorders, by trying to restore biochemical and physiologic homeostasis, by promoting anabolism and providing alternative sources of energy. [...] Flavin adenine dinucleotide supplementation has also been identified as a therapy for this deficiency, because it is an essential cofactor for proper function of SCAD. SCAD deficiency is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Carrier testing can be performed for at-risk family members, and prenatal testing is also a possibility.|$|E
50|$|Mutations of the ACAT1 gene are {{associated}} with a deficiency in the encoded protein mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase; this is also known as ketothiolase deficiency. Many mutations have been identified in specific populations, and large scale studies have been performed to determine the allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> for the defective gene. As mitochondrial acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase is involved in beta-oxidation, a deficiency in this enzyme is marked by an increased amount of cholesterol compounds. Additionally, the isoleucine amino acid pathway is affected, such that proper metabolism of it is halted. This deficiency belongs to a more general class of disorders known as organic acidemias, in which the dysfunction of a specific step of amino acid catabolism results in the excretion of non-amino acids in the urine. This deficiency specifically presents as ketosis, acidosis, as well as hypoglycemia, but there are other clinical manifestations as well. The characteristics of organic academia disorders are vomiting, poor feeding, neurologic symptoms such as seizures and abnormal tone, and lethargy progressing to coma, which are all manifestations of toxic encephalopathy. The clinical outcome of infants with these disorders is largely determined by the time of diagnosis, with the potential outcome greatly improving if the disease is diagnosed in the first ten days of life. Ketothiolase deficiency is diagnosed by performing GC-MS and quantitative amino acid analysis in the urine; the diagnostic markers are 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyric acid, 2-methylacetoacetic acid, and tiglylglycine. The disease is managed by trying to restore biochemical and physiologic homeostasis; common therapies include restricting diet to avoid the precursor amino acids and use of compounds to either dispose of toxic metabolites or increase enzyme activity. This disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning that carriers of the gene do not show symptoms of the disease.|$|E

The genetic polymorphism of the milk protein loci alphas 1 -casein, beta-casein, k-casein and beta-lactoglobulin was examined in Argentinian Holstein cattle. Samples from 12 herds of four regions of Córdoba were analyzed by starch gel electrophoresis. The chi² {{test was used to}} assess whether the populations were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotypic diversity was analyzed by the Shannon-Weaver index. The observed <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> were analyzed by Hedrick's genetic identity and the genetic distance of Balakrishnan and Sanghvi. The allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> were similar to those of other Holstein populations. The <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> of the alphas 1 -casein and beta-casein loci were in equilibrium, whereas in some populations the k-casein and beta-lactoglobulin loci were not.

40|$|Abstract. This study {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that cyclomorphosis in Daphnia galeata mendotae is equated with seasonal changes in the genetic structure of populations. Multilocus electrophoretic genotyping of individual D. g. mendotae was used to identify related parthenogenetic lines. Between different clones and genotypes, there was phenotypic variability in both laboratory and field populations. Within clones and within genotypes, {{and in the absence}} of intense invertebrate predation, phenotypic expression was conservative. These pat-terns suggested that there was a correlation between phenotypic and genetic change. However, in the field, only two of three populations showed seasonal changes in <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency,</b> whereas all three showed seasonal changes in phenotype. Furthermore, the patterns of phenotypic change seen in the field populations were different and appeared to be correlated with changes in physical conditions and predation pressure. We conclude that helmet morphology within genotypes is plastic enough to account for much of the seasonal variability observed in three populations of D. g. mendotae and that <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> changes are not necessary to explain seasonal changes in D. g. mendotae phenotype...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} of the present work was to identify and validate single nucleotide variations located in candidate genes to growth traits in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Two transitions were identified in the promoter region of the growth hormone gene (GH); eight nucleotide changes were identified in introns and promoter region of the IGF-I gene; and a transition (T/C) was identified in the Myogenin gene (MyoG). The highest <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> (0. 8) for GHpA 1 and MyoG {{was found in the}} GG and TT homozygous individuals, while the highest frequency (0. 9) for GHpB 1 was observed in the CT heterozygous fish.

Based on their allelic frequencies, validation as novel single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of those variations located at O. niloticus GH and MyoG genes was possible. These new markers will allow their association with growth traits in tilapia to be exploited in order to determine their potential use as assisted-selection markers...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) {{syndrome}} is an autoimmune disease. The monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) gene has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of certain autoimmune diseases. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether a MCP- 1 polymorphism was associated with VKH syndrome. Methods: A case-control analysis was performed using genomic DNA samples from 307 VKH patients and 319 age-, sex-, and ethnically-matched healthy controls. The MCP- 1 polymorphism at the − 2518 A/G locus was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) assay. Results: The distribution of <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> of the MCP- 1 − 2518 A/G polymorphism in all subjects did not deviate from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE; p> 0. 05). Allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> analysis revealed no significant difference between VKH patients and healthy controls for the MCP- 1 − 2518 A/G polymorphism (p> 0. 05).

We screened the linkage region around chromosome 14 q 22 and narrowed it down to JDP 2. We then genotyped case and control groups of three different ethnic populations: 403 Japanese intracranial aneurysm (IA) cases and 412 controls, 181 Korean IA cases and 181 controls, 379 Dutch cases and 642 Dutch controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing technology. The allele distribution of three SNPs (two intronic: rs 741846; P= 0. 0041 and rs 175646; P= 0. 0014, and one in the untranslated region: rs 8215; P= 0. 019) and their genotype distribution showed significant association in the Japanese IA patients.

40|$|Variations in T-cell {{activation}} Rho-GTPase activating protein (TAGAP) {{have been}} associated with various autoimmune diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). The gene is involved in T cell activation and is therefore of particular interest in context of T cell-driven autoimmune diseases. Genome-wide association studies suggest association between TAGAP and RA in various populations. This study sought to investigate any association of TAGAP with RA in Pakistani population. For this, two variants in TAGAP (rs 182429 A/G and rs 212389 A/G) were investigated because of their high implication in RA liability of European patients. The variants were genotyped in 186 Pakistani RA patients and 185 controls. No significant difference was observed in distribution of rs 212389 between patients and controls (P = 0. 87 for <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> and P = 1. 000 for allelic frequency) which differs from findings in European subjects. Conversely, statistically significant difference was observed in rs 182429 (P = 0. 0026 for <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> and P = 0. 0373 for allelic frequency). Heterozygous genotype AG and allele A were found to be disease susceptible genotype and allele respectively, because of their higher frequency in patients. While higher frequency of genotype GG and allele G in healthy controls suggests them as protective genotype and allele, respectively, in Pakistani population. This is the first TAGAP association study with RA in Pakistani cohort and its results suggest that the distribution of alleles regarding contribution to RA is actually population specific.

We evaluated a possible association between EX and BRVO using lysyl oxidase-like 1 (LOXL 1) gene variants as alternative markers for EX. Methods: Allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> of three LOXL 1 variants (rs 1048661, rs 3825942, and rs 2165241) were determined for 78 consecutive Japanese patients with BRVO (11 patients with exfoliation syndrome [EX+], 67 patients without exfoliation syndrome [EX-]), and 158 patients with cataract without EX (CT) as controls. Results: The rs 1048661 variant differed between the BRVO and CT groups in allelic and <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> (p= 0. 0137 and p= 0. 0203, respectively).

The present study was designed to investigate the association of these two SNPs in an Asian Indian population from south India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1, 300 subjects, 663 normal glucose tolerant (NGT) and 637 type 2 diabetic subjects were randomly selected from the Chennai Urban Rural Epidemiology Study (CURES). The ‑ 3 c → t and Thr 759 Thr were genotyped in these subjects using polymerase chain reaction‑restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR‑RFLP) and a few variants were confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: The frequency of the ‘t’ allele of the ‑ 3 c → t SNP was found to be 0. 27 in NGT and 0. 29 in type 2 diabetic subjects (P = 0. 44).

Recently, the vacA-i region genotype has been suggested {{to be a better}} predictor of disease severity than either the s- or m-region. The main aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the associations of i region poly-morphisms of vacA gene with gastric cancer (GC) and peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in Azerbaijan Province patients. Methods: A number of 89 patients were enrolled. The biopsy samples were taken from patients referring to the endoscopy units of Imam Reza and Shahid Madani Hospitals, Tabriz, Iran from August 2012 to May 2013. The genotype frequencies of vacA-i 1 and i 2 in were studied using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The frequency of vacA-i 1 and i 2 was 51. 68 % and 48. 31 %, respectively. The <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> of vacA-i 1 in patients with GC (21 / 24, 87. 5 %) was significantly higher than in those with non-atrophic gastritis, NAG (19 / 48, 39. 58 %). In contrast, the <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> of vacA-i 2 in patients with NAG, PUD, and GC was 60. 42 %, 64. 70 %, and 14. 28 %, respectively. The results of multiple linear and logistic regression analyses confirmed the intensity of correlation of vacA-i 1 allele with GC compared with control group (NAG). No significant correlation was found between the vacA-i-region alleles and PUD risk. Conclusion: We have proposed that the H. pylori vacA-i 1 genotype could be an im-portant biomarker for predicting the gastric cancer risk in Azerbaijan Province in Iran. However, due to the difference in the allelic frequency of this gene in H. pylori strains from different parts of the world, the vacA-i 1 genotype usefulness in predicting the gas-trointestinal diseases is dependent to the geographic origin of the strains...|$|E

ConclusionsT allele of the 511 site of IL- 1 β gene and V allele of the second introne of IL- 1 Ra gene might be the genetic basis of the rising of IL- 1 β, IL- 1 Ra and US-CRP levels in blood serum of PCOS patients, and are associated with the infertility occurrence of PCOS patients...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundD allele of insertion/deletion {{polymorphism}} of angiotensin-I converting enzyme (ACE) gene {{was reported}} to be associated with myocardial infarction and ischemic cardiomyopathy. It was suggested that the possible mechanism of these of associations might be coronary artery vasopasm. We therefore studied to know whether variant angina is related with polymorphism of ACE gene. MethodsFour groups of patients were studied; (1) variant angina group (n= 64) who received coronary angiography and provocation test using ergonovine or acetylcholine, (2) normal control group (n= 66) whose coronary angiogram was normal, (3) acute ischemic syndrome group (n= 76). (4) chronic stable angina group (n= 25). Genomic DNA was extracted from mononuclear cells of peripheral blood and PCR was done. ResultsDistribution of <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> of normal controls (DD : ID: II= 0. 152 : 0. 500 : 0. 348, D allele: I allele= 0. 402 : 0. 598) is different from that of Caucasians (p< 0. 005) but similar to that of Japanese. Distribution of <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequency</b> of variant angina (DD : ID : II= 0. 094 : 0. 625 : 0. 281, D : I= 0. 406 : 0. 594) is neither significantly different from that of normal controls nor that of ischemic heart disease groups. Furthermore. it is not different from that of patients (n= 22) who had negative results provocation test (DD : ID : II= 0. 182 : 0. 409 : 0. 409, D : I= 0. 386 : 0. 614). In acute ischemic syndrome patients, D allele was more frequent in patients with normal cholesterol level than in patients with high cholesterol level (p< 0. 05). Among patients without hypertension, DD homozygotes were more frequent in patients with high left ventricular mass index than low ventricular mass index (p< 0. 05). ConclusionsThe findings suggest that insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene is not associated with variant angina, butit is associated with the development of acute ischemic syndrome in low risk group and the development of left ventricular hypertrophy...|$|E
40|$|We {{carried out}} two studies {{to test the}} {{hypothesis}} that altered central serotonergic function, as assessed by lower prolactin (PRL) response to d-fenfluramine (D-FEN), is more closely associated with suicidal behavior than a particular psychiatric diagnosis. A D-FEN test was performed in 85 major depressed inpatients, 33 schizophrenic inpatients, and 18 healthy controls. We showed that PRL response to D-FEN is a marker of suicidality, regardless of psychiatric disorder. We then examined the association between the serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) receptor 5 -HT 2 A gene polymorphism (T 102 C) and suicide in a sample of Brazilian psychiatric inpatients (95 with schizophrenia, 78 with major depression) and 52 healthy controls. No differences were found in <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> across patients and controls. Overall, no differences were found between patients with (n= 66) and without (n= 107) a history of suicide attempt. We also compared patients with a history of severe suicide attempts (lethality> 3; n= 32) and patients without such a history (n= 107), but they did not exhibit different <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> either. These results show that the 5 -HT 2 A gene polymorphism (T 102 C) may not be involved in the genetic susceptibility to suicidal behavior...|$|R
5|$|While natural {{selection}} has a direction, guiding evolution towards heritable adaptations {{to the current}} environment, genetic drift has no direction and is guided only by the mathematics of chance. As a result, drift acts upon the <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> within a population without regard to their phenotypic effects. In contrast, selection favors the spread of alleles whose phenotypic effects increase survival and/or reproduction of their carriers, lowers the frequencies of alleles that cause unfavorable traits, and ignores those that are neutral.|$|R
40|$|We {{isolated}} and characterised 13 novel polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite loci {{in the stone}} marten (Martes foina) from genomic libraries enriched for (AAAG) n and (AGAT) n repeat sequences. Thirty-three individuals were genotyped {{and the number of}} alleles per locus recorded varied between two and eight and their observed and expected heterozygosities ranged from 0. 242 to 0. 879 and from 0. 335 to 0. 817, respectively. All <b>genotypic</b> <b>frequencies</b> were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium and no linkage disequilibrium was detected between pairs of loci...|$|R
