25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern <b>injector</b> <b>pump</b> improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned <b>injector</b> <b>pump.</b> The drive vacated by the <b>injector</b> <b>pump</b> was used to power a vacuum pump for the brake servo system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E
25|$|At {{the launch}} of the Ninety Land Rover had insisted that there would not be a 2.5-litre {{development}} of the petrol engine. However, buyer demand and economics made the change inevitable. The larger petrol engine was launched in 1985 (having been developed under the codename 'Project Harrier') and, like its 2.25-litre predecessor it had much in common with the diesel engine. The block was identical, as were most ancillary parts. The key difference was that the petrol engine retained its timing chain, since it lacked the need to drive an <b>injector</b> <b>pump.</b> The cylinder head was adapted to use unleaded fuel. As before, the engine was smooth and refined, and provided the Land Rover with adequate road performance. However, as fuel prices rose and diesel engines improved sales of the petrol engines fell, especially in Europe. It remained a popular option in Africa and other areas where fuel prices or the simplicity of the engine made it an attractive option. It remained available until 1994; although by this time sales had dwindled to almost nothing {{in the face of a}} new generation of refined diesel engines. By this time buyers were limited to those with specific reasons to buy petrol-engined vehicles- for example several police forces in the UK bought fleets of 2.5 petrol Defenders in the mid-1990s because a diesel-engined vehicles would have caused maintenance and logistical problems when operated alongside the fleet of standard patrol cars, all of which were petrol fuelled.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{solutions}} available which allow diesel engines to continue to operate in cold weather conditions. Once the diesel motor is started it may continue to operate at temperatures below the CFPP - most engines have a spill return system, by which any excess fuel from the <b>injector</b> <b>pump</b> and injectors is returned to the fuel tank.

To determine the groundwater quality of the Lahore, 33 water samples were collected from tubewells, shallow wells and four samples from Lahore canal which is recharge source. The water samples were analyzed for E-coli by standard multiple tube method as per guideline of WHO. The results indicate that 100 % water samples collected from <b>injector</b> <b>pumps</b> installed at shallow depth 120 to 150 feet are polluted due to intrusion of sewage water.

40|$|Miniaturized {{analysis}} systems, {{which may}} potentially revolutionize detection of air-borne biological or chemical agents through increased portability and real time response, also present exciting fundamental challenges.

In pressure-driven systems, such components may produce finite amplitude waves and wave attenuation may then be a key design factor in optimizing both devices that operate on steady-state assumptions and devices where unsteadiness is cultivated, for example mixers. A fundamental experimental investigation of wave propagation {{as a function of}} the channel size was performed. A shock wave is transmitted into mm-scale channels to achieve a well-characterized initial condition. Wave attenuation and structure information is obtained from time-of-arrival data and pressure histories along the channel. Experimental results are compared with models developed for the analogous flow regime of wave propagation through macroscale channels in low pressure environments...|$|R
50|$|Diesel fuel is also {{prone to}} waxing or gelling in cold weather; both are terms for the {{solidification}} of diesel oil into a partially crystalline state.

5000|$|The M35A2 is {{commonly}} powered by an LDT 465 engine, made by either Continental Motors Company, Hercules, or White Motor Company.

This is {{coupled with a}} 5-speed manual transmission and divorced 2-speed transfer case (either a sprag-operated transfer case Rockwell 136-21 or air-operated selectable transfer case Rockwell 136-27). Multifuel engines are designed to operate reliably {{on a wide variety}} of fuels, including diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, heating oil or gasoline. Gasoline may be used only in an emergency because it does not properly lubricate the <b>injector</b> <b>pump.</b> While using gasoline, common practice calls for the addition of at least 1 U.S. quart of clean motor oil per 15 U.S. gallons of gasoline (1 imp qt/13 imp gal; 1 L/60 L) for proper pump lubrication where available.|$|E
25|$|Biodiesel has {{promising}} lubricating {{properties and}} cetane ratings compared to low sulfur diesel fuels. Depending on the engine, this might include {{high pressure injection}} <b>pumps,</b> <b>pump</b> <b>injectors</b> (also called unit injectors) and fuel injectors.|$|R
50|$|Series 1 {{delivered}} 57 locomotives in four batches {{which had}} a boiler overpressure of 8 bar.

Batches 3 and 4, delivered from 1865 - 1867 added a roof over the driver's platform; the smokestacks were now cylindrical or pear-shaped and an <b>injector</b> and <b>pump</b> for the feedwater.|$|R
50|$|Comparing regular {{lubricating}} oil with two-stroke oil, the relevant {{difference is that}} two-stroke oil must have a much lower ash content. This is required to minimize deposits that tend to form if ash {{is present in the}} oil which is burned in the engine's combustion chamber. Additionally a non-2T-specific oil can turn to gum {{in a matter of days}} if mixed with gasoline and not immediately consumed. Another important factor is that 4-stroke engines have a different requirement for 'stickiness' than 2-strokes do.Since the 1980s different types of two-stroke oil have been developed for specialized uses such as outboard motor two-strokes, premix two-stroke oil, as well as the more standard auto lube (motorcycle) two-stroke oil. As a rule of thumb, most containers of oil commercially offered will have somewhere on the label printed that it is compatible with 'Autolube' or <b>injector</b> <b>pumps.</b> Those bottles tend to have the consistency of liquid dish soap if shaken. A more viscous oil cannot reliably be passed through an injection system, although a premix machine can be run on either type.|$|R
5000|$|Careful {{design of}} the <b>injector</b> <b>pump,</b> fuel injector, {{combustion}} chamber, piston crown and cylinder head can reduce knocking greatly, and modern engines using electronic common rail injection have very low levels of knock. Engines using indirect injection generally have lower levels of knock than direct injection engine, due to the greater dispersal of oxygen in the combustion chamber and lower injection pressures providing a more complete mixing of fuel and air. Diesels actually do not suffer exactly the same [...] "knock" [...] as gasoline engines since the cause {{is known to be}} only the very fast rate of pressure rise, not unstable combustion. Diesel fuels are actually very prone to knock in gasoline engines but in the diesel engine there is no time for knock to occur because the fuel is only oxidized during the expansion cycle. In the gasoline engine the fuel is slowly oxidizing all the time while it is being compressed before the spark. This allows for changes to occur in the structure/makeup of the molecules before the very critical period of high temp/pressure.|$|E
50|$|Diesel fuel {{is a form}} {{of light}} fuel oil, very similar to {{kerosene}} (paraffin), but diesel engines, especially older or simple designs that lack precision electronic injection systems, can run {{on a wide variety of}} other fuels. Some of the most common alternatives are Jet A-1 type jet fuel or vegetable oil from a very wide variety of plants. Some engines can be run on vegetable oil without modification, and most others require fairly basic alterations. Biodiesel is a pure diesel-like fuel refined from vegetable oil and can be used in nearly all diesel engines. Requirements for fuels to be used in diesel engines are the ability of the fuel to flow along the fuel lines, the ability of the fuel to lubricate the <b>injector</b> <b>pump</b> and injectors adequately, and its ignition qualities (ignition delay, cetane number). Inline mechanical injector pumps generally tolerate poor-quality or bio-fuels better than distributor-type pumps. Also, indirect injection engines generally run more satisfactorily on bio-fuels than direct injection engines. This is partly because an indirect injection engine has a much greater 'swirl' effect, improving vaporisation and combustion of fuel, and because (in the case of vegetable oil-type fuels) lipid depositions can condense on the cylinder walls of a direct-injection engine if combustion temperatures are too low (such as starting the engine from cold).|$|E
