5|$|In 1976, {{members of}} the Somerset <b>Industrial</b> <b>Archaeology</b> Society began {{restoration}} of the site. The Westonzoyland Engine Trust achieved charitable status in 1980 and in 1990 bought the site from the owners, Wessex Water. The structure of the engine house has been stabilised and the pump house and chimney rebuilt. A new exhibition hall has also been built.|$|E
5|$|The quarry {{is also a}} prime {{location}} for geological research and provides opportunities for field studies {{in a variety of}} disciplines: sedimentology, stratigraphy, palaeontology, geography, and <b>industrial</b> <b>archaeology.</b> Several features make this a unique {{location for}} the study of rock formations. Visitors can examine the extensively exposed rock faces, primarily Kentish Ragstone and Hassock facies, and study changes in vertical and lateral facies. The facies are glauconitic with some horizons of silicification. Shell debris (ammonites, belemnites, nautiloids, bivalves, etc.) and bioturbation are also present. The quarry could be important for future research via gamma ray profiling of the rock beds in relation to changes in sea level and climate.|$|E
5|$|Limbert and Roworth have commented that, {{unlike other}} peat areas, {{such as the}} Somerset Levels, where {{recording}} of the industrial heritage has been systematic, the recording of the <b>industrial</b> <b>archaeology</b> of Thorne and Hatfield Moors has been notably scarce. A guide to the industrial history of South Yorkshire published in 1995 {{made no mention of}} peat at all. The canals dug by the Dutch and operated until the 1920s have been mentioned by canal historians such as Charles Hadfield, but have never been investigated systematically. The railways have received a little more attention in the specialist press, and some of the locomotives have been preserved. The history of the workers has been partially recorded through the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Oral History Project. In contrast, the ecology of the moors has been better documented, through the publication of the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Papers, first published by the Doncaster Naturalists Society in 1987. Since 1989, the Thorne and Hatfield Moors Conservation Forum have taken over this responsibility. These papers now run to eight volumes, and the forum has also published technical papers on many aspects of the moors.|$|E

40|$|The {{abandonment}} of mining activities in Sardinia has {{left in the}} territories and landscapes deep lacerations in which the actions of Housing and Building have gradually {{moved away from the}} scope of what is worthy of questioning and thus to be thought of. In terms of conservation of <b>industrial</b> <b>Archaeologies</b> the challenge lies in relation with the statute of Heritage in a society that has changed its scale of values, and in a physical economic and functional context which is evolving fast. Designing a change compatible with a dynamic identity and a co-evolution of the built environment is, therefore, the challenge that these contexts raise nowadays. The “landscapes of care” divert intellectual efforts from pseudo-romantic visions to bring the attention to the identity of places and the values of the architecture to be preserved. The conversion of the old mining harbor of Buggerru - village on the southwest coast of the island - in marina (touristic harbor), has soon proved to be a story devoid of syntax. New planning energies are needed to rebuild the lost relationships of the rich industrial heritage on the waterfront...|$|R
25|$|There is <b>industrial</b> <b>archaeology</b> {{including}} the Grantham Canal and {{the remains of}} the Melton Mowbray Navigation. Windmill sites, ironstone working and smelting archaeological evidence suggest that Melton borough was densely populated in Bronze and Iron Ages. Many small village communities existed and strategic points at Burrough Hill and Belvoir were fortified. There is also evidence to suggest that the site of Melton Mowbray in the Wreake Valley was inhabited before Roman occupation (43AD).|$|E
25|$|The North York Moors is {{the only}} source for British jet. It has been mined in the area from prehistoric times but the {{industry}} grew {{in the middle of}} the 19th century in response to a fashion for the jewellery produced from it. In the 1880s cheap imports produced a decline in the industry which was focused on Whitby. The remains of alum quarries are to be found to the north of the area and along the coast. Alum was important to the textile industry because it was used as a mordant or fixative for dyes that were used to colour cloth. The industry thrived in the region from the early 17th century until 1871. Its decline came when chemical dyes were discovered. The scars of industrial activity on the moors make it an interesting area in which to pursue <b>industrial</b> <b>archaeology.</b>|$|E

500|$|Most of Greater Manchester's listed {{buildings}} {{date from}} the Victorian and Edwardian periods. According to an Association for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Archaeology</b> publication, Greater Manchester is [...] "one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain, {{the result of a}} combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries: a phenomenal rise in population, the appearance of the specialist industrial town, a transport revolution, and weak local lordship". Much of the region, historically a part of Lancashire, was at the forefront of textile manufacturing from the early 19th century until the early 20th century, and the county includes several former mill towns. Greater Manchester has a wealth of industrial heritage, represented by industrial architecture found throughout the county, but most of its Grade I listed buildings have a municipal, ecclesiastic or other cultural heritage.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, the Derwent Valley Mills were {{nominated}} {{to become a}} World Heritage Site. Along with Blaenavon Industrial Landscape, New Lanark, and Saltaire (all now World Heritage Sites), the site was proposed to increase the representation of <b>industrial</b> <b>archaeology</b> {{on the list of}} World Heritage Sites. The proposal was successful and in 2001 the Derwent Valley Mills were designated a World Heritage Site. Its status as a World Heritage Site is intended to ensure its protection; all such sites are considered to be of [...] "outstanding value to humanity". The site was listed under the second and fourth Heritage Site selection criteria. The Derwent Valley Mills pioneered worker's housing as well as much technology developed by Richard Arkwright, producing an industrial landscape and heralding industrial towns. The Derwent Valley Mills Partnership is responsible, on behalf of the British government, for the management of the site. In June 2009, Bath Street Mill in Derby was damaged by fire. The building was part of the World Heritage Site and dated from the 18th century.|$|E
500|$|Much of Greater Manchester's wealth was {{generated}} during the Industrial Revolution, particularly textile manufacture. The world's first cotton mill {{was built in}} the town of Royton, and the county encompasses several former mill towns. An Association for <b>Industrial</b> <b>Archaeology</b> publication describes Greater Manchester as [...] "one of the classic areas of industrial and urban growth in Britain, the result of a combination of forces that came together in the 18th and 19th centuries: a phenomenal rise in population, the appearance of the specialist industrial town, a transport revolution, and weak local lordship". Much of the county was at the forefront of textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution and into the early-20th century; Peter Smith, Baron Smith of Leigh, chair of the Greater Manchester Combined Authority said [...] "clearly, all of the Greater Manchester area was once {{at the heart of a}} very vibrant [...] industry", represented by former textile mills found throughout the county. The territory that makes up Greater Manchester experienced a rapid decline of these traditional sectors, partly during the Lancashire Cotton famine brought on by the American Civil War, but mainly as part of the post-war economic depression and deindustrialization of Britain that occurred during the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Van der Werve {{was born}} in Papendrecht, the Netherlands and {{currently}} {{lives and works in}} Finland and Berlin. He pursued studies in <b>industrial</b> design, <b>archaeology,</b> music composition, and Russian language and literature at several universities in the Netherlands before beginning to create his first video documented performances at the Gerrit Rietveld Academy around 2000. Van der Werve initially started out doing performances but because he disliked the live aspect, he started to film them with simple video cameras. The registrations became gradually more cinematic and professional over the years. Having a background in music Van der Werve tries to create visual art, which communicates as direct as music. In 2006 Van der Werve did a residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam. In 2008 he moved to New York. From 2010 on Van der Werve has been living in the Finnish countryside and Berlin. Van der Werve is an avid runner and triathlete. He's a black T-shirt finisher in the 2012 Anniversary race of the Norseman triathlon. His PB in the Marathon is currently 2.57.06 ran in the Berlin Marathon in 2013. He also finished all of the six World Marathon Majors in under 3:15 minutes, including the terror attacked Boston Marathon of 2013. In 2011 he summited Aconcagua in Argentina, with a height of 6972 meters.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Quarry Reform" [...] rebuilt much of Lebreton's {{original}} project, {{in relation}} to the valorization of technical courses and a curriculum as broad as it was profound for Academy students. As a result, the school began offering courses in decorative drawing and sculpture, geometric design, art history and theory, aesthetics, <b>archaeology,</b> <b>industrial</b> design, and applied mathematics. A curriculum for night classes was also created for trade apprentices, focusing on industrial design, light and perspective, decorative drawing and sculpting, drawing the human body with live models, and elementary mathematics. Porto-Alegre fez mais pela escola: construiu uma nova biblioteca, construiu e decorou a pinacoteca, lutou por melhorias e ampliação da sede da Academia, iniciou a restauração dos quadros da coleção didática e propôs a realização de debates e estudos sobre temas relevantes para o amadurecimento de uma arte condizente com a realidade brasileira.|$|R
40|$|In {{heritage}} site management, {{there is}} often a strong reliance on preservation, sometimes to the exclusion of contemporary use. The result is a tendency to remove heritage sites from the experience of the community who 2 ̆ 7 owns 2 ̆ 7 the heritage. At the site level, heritage management does not always use the full range of available tools; largely because of the emphasis on preservation. Case studies from rural Queensland, Australia, show that even relatively recent <b>industrial</b> and historical <b>archaeology</b> sites can be conserved and presented to benefit both the sites and local communities. There are several components to ultimate success, broadly encompassing a broader recognition of site values, pragmatic management and pro-active presentation. Smaller heritage sites may be modest in appearance, but they are still worthy of conservation. They may not attract large numbers of visitors like Stonehenge or the Acropolis but they are capable of providing socio-economic advantages for local communities and transferring knowledge of the past to future generations...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} public health is {{commonly}} seen as beginning in the 1800 s after the <b>industrial</b> revolution, but <b>archaeology</b> has allowed for components {{of public health}} to be examined for populations that existed well before the 1800 s. Waterlogged soil has led to deposits of organic material to be recovered from York, England-a site that has been occupied for over 6, 000 years. Both the organic and inorganic artifacts along with the skeletal remains from the site {{have been used to}} reconstruct daily life which provides us with a window to examine past health issues. In particular, data from Roman, Viking, and Medieval occupations of the site have been compared in order to better understand the water supply and the treatment of parasitic infections during each different occupation. In order to assess changes in health and sanitation, data sets composed of both direct and indirect evidence allows for a comparative analysis between each occupation. The results from this study are used to evaluate {{the extent to which the}} state was involved in ensuring the health of the community, as well as the way parasitic infections were treated during the different occupations of the site. The information may then add to our understanding of public health today because we will be able to see how it differs from past views of state involvement in community health practices. We will also have more evidence suggesting that human health has been a concern of the state for thousands of years and should continue to be a concern of the state...|$|R
