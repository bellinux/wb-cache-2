25|$|On August 13, 2007, Boras {{finalized}} a record-breaking $7.3 {{million contract}} with the Detroit Tigers for the 27th overall draft pick, Rick Porcello. The four-year major league contract, which could <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> Porcello over $10 million, was the largest contract ever given to a high school player.|$|E
25|$|Those who reload {{with the}} primary goal of maximizing {{accuracy}} or terminal performance may <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> more per reloaded round than for commercial ammunition—this is especially true for military calibers which are commonly available as surplus. Maximum performance, however, requires the highest quality components, which are usually the most expensive. Reloaders who reload {{with the primary}} goal of saving money on ammunition, however, can make a few tradeoffs to realize significant cost savings with a minimal sacrifice in quality.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by direct debit, which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E

He <b>ends</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> around eighteen thousand pounds as he got more drunk. He then attempts to return home but Marlene has locked up and Elgin has taken his car keys {{so it looks like}} he’s going to have a night out in the wild.|$|R

500|$|PEDs, in {{combination}} with price elasticity of supply (PES), {{can be used to}} assess where the incidence (or [...] "burden") of a per-unit tax is falling or to predict where it will fall if the tax is imposed. For example, when demand is perfectly inelastic, by definition consumers have no alternative to purchasing the good or service if the price increases, so the quantity demanded would remain constant. [...] Hence, suppliers can increase the price by the full amount of the tax, and the consumer would <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> the entirety. In the opposite case, when demand is perfectly elastic, by definition consumers have an infinite ability to switch to alternatives if the price increases, so they would stop buying the good or service in question completely—quantity demanded would fall to zero. [...] As a result, firms cannot pass on any part of the tax by raising prices, so they would be forced to pay all of it themselves.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero: Smash Hits {{received}} moderate {{praise from}} reviews, {{many of which}} cited that the game itself demonstrates the over-saturation of the music game market and {{the sheer number of}} titles with the Guitar Hero series that Activision has marketed. Chris Roper of IGN summarized that the game [...] "is the definition of 'milking'", noting that, save for the PlayStation 2 version, all of the songs in the game could have been distributed as downloadable content or reused within other compatible titles. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb commented that [...] "something about the game's full [...] price tag doesn't quite feel right" [...] and reaffirmed that being able to select a handful of the songs to play again would have been a preferred method of distribution. Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer further suggested that a simultaneous release of both the retail product and the same songs as downloadable content would have been an improvement. Chris Kohler of Wired listed Smash Hits on a list of [...] "raw deals" [...] for gamers, citing Activision's approach that results in [...] "players <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> more for segregated song lists", and contrasted the approach to that of the Rock Band series, in which downloadable content is integrated into existing games. Game Informers Matt Helgeson noted that, ultimately, the cost per song was still cheaper than current prices for downloadable content, but he still felt the game's purpose was solely for [...] "creating revenue for Activision".|$|E
2500|$|An {{interesting}} {{situation in}} which the inverse correlation between a company's stock price and CDS spread breaks down is during a Leveraged buyout (LBO). [...] Frequently this leads to the company's CDS spread widening due to the extra debt that will soon be put on the company's books, but also an increase [...] in its share price, since buyers of a company usually <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> a premium.|$|E

2500|$|As of 2012, {{the number}} of migrant workers is {{estimated}} to be around 158,000 workers; however, these numbers may be inaccurate {{due to the fact that}} many workers come in unofficially. In the process of registering with an agency in their indigenous countries, 63% of the workers <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> fees for the agency they apply through. When they do end up in Lebanon, the situation turns out different to what they had initially expected. [...] 6% of the workers were misled to believe that they would have other jobs than housework; jobs like security guards or hotel employees. The numbers get higher when it comes to matters of working hours and salaries, 53% of the employees received the salary they were promised. More figures are representing their very working status, 84% were not informed of their working hours, 78% did not receive any information on weekly days off, 64% were not aware of the household composition and 61% did not know whether they would be able to contact their families or not. Considering the figures presented above and the full scope of the Kafala system in Lebanon, as much as 83% of the surveyed said that they would not have traveled to Lebanon had they known of the situation beforehand.|$|E

50|$|After the war, Neville was an {{inspector}} of revenue under the excise laws, which {{the newly formed}} United States Congress imposed on distilled spirits {{to help pay for}} the cost of the Revolutionary War. There were two methods of paying the whiskey excise: paying a flat charge or paying by the gallon. The tax effectively favored large distillers, most of whom were based in the east, who produced whiskey in volume and could afford the flat fee. Western farmers who owned small stills did not usually operate them at full capacity, so they <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> a higher tax per gallon. Thus, large producers <b>ended</b> <b>up</b> <b>paying</b> a tax of about 6 cents per gallon, while small producers were taxed at about 9 cents per gallon.|$|R

50|$|A {{movement}} for incorporation has been attempted repeatedly over the years, but {{the courts have}} never ruled on the substance of it.
