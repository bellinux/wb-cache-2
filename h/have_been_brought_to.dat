5|$|Gomti Ghat {{consists}} of steps {{leading to the}} Gomti River, {{which is also a}} holy place for pilgrims to take a dip in the river, before visiting Dwarakadish temple. The ghat has a number of small shrines dedicated to the Samudra (God of the Sea), Saraswati and Lakshmi. Other notable temples in the ghat area include the Samudra Narayana (Sangam Narayana) temple, which is at the confluence of the Gomti River with the sea, the Chakra Narayana temple where there is a stone with an imprint of a chakra as a manifestation of Vishnu, and the Gomati temple, which has an idol of the river goddess Gomati that is said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> earth by the sage Vasishta.|$|E
5|$|Late glacial tool finds {{from the}} Upper Palaeolithic date to c.12,000BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle. Flint rarely occurs in Wales {{other than in}} drifts, or as small pebbles on beaches. Flint tools would {{therefore}} have to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Gower from other areas, such as those now known as southern or eastern England, or Antrim, either as finished tools or as incomplete, or unworked, nodules. Remains of red fox, Arctic fox, brown bear, tundra vole, and possibly reindeer, were found {{at the same level}} as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c.12,000BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, red deer and giant deer.|$|E

5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan {{horse in}} Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because of the close {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{accounts}} {{show the}} details of the payments for the construction of the tower between 1398 and 1399, including charges for 36,850 bricks, stone, sand, lime, a hoist and various equipment. At least 170 cartloads of stone are mentioned, and the bricks may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the site along the river by boat, while some of the timber was brought from Great Yarmouth. The total cost of the building from these records, including labour, came to around £36. The number of bricks used in the tower, however, was probably twice the listed number purchased, and the city may therefore already have stockpiled some bricks on the location before the build.|$|E
5|$|The monastery {{enjoyed the}} {{patronage}} of hetmans and other benefactors throughout the years. The chief magnet for pilgrims were the relics of Saint Barbara, alleged to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Kiev from Constantinople in 1108 by Sviatopolk II Iziaslavych's wife {{and kept in}} a silver reliquary donated by Hetman Ivan Mazepa. Although most of the monastery grounds were secularized {{in the late eighteenth}} century, as many as 240 monks resided there in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The monastery served as the residence of the bishop of Chernigov after 1800. A precentor's school was located on the monastery grounds; many prominent composers, such as Kyrylo Stetsenko and Yakiv Yatsynevych, either studied or taught at the school.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of circumcision {{is thought to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> the Bantu-speaking tribes of Africa by either the Jews after one of their many expulsions from European countries, or by Muslim Moors escaping after the 1492 conquest of Spain. In {{the second half of}} the 1st millennium CE, inhabitants from the North East of Africa moved south and encountered groups from Arabia, the Middle East, and West Africa. These people moved south and formed what is known today as the Bantu. Bantu tribes were observed to be upholding what was described as Jewish law, including circumcision, in the 16th century. Circumcision and elements of Jewish dietary restrictions are still found among Bantu tribes.|$|E
5|$|There {{is also a}} {{skeleton}} in Museo di Storia Naturale di Firenze, which it obtained from France in 1833, but was mislabelled as a cassowary until correctly identified by Italian zoologist Enrico Hillyer Giglioli in 1900. Several elements of this skeleton are missing, and some have been replaced with wooden copies. Its right metatarsus was damaged during life and had healed incorrectly. It {{was thought to be}} a male, but is now known to be a composite of two individuals. A fourth specimen was thought to be kept in the Liverpool Museum, but it may simply be a juvenile mainland emu. Apart from the King Island emu specimens brought to France, a few are also known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> mainland Australia in 1803, but their fate is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The carvings are {{all based}} on popular series of engravings, which were often {{published}} in pattern books. Nuremberg was the origin of numerous such books, and one may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>brought</b> <b>to</b> Edzell by the miner Hans Ziegler. Specifically, {{the images of the}} deities are derived from engravings of 1528–29 by the German artist Georg Pencz (or Iorg Bentz, c. 1500–1550), a pupil of Albrecht Dürer; the initials I. B. appear on the carving of Mars. The arts and virtues are both based on engravings derived from paintings by the Flemish artist Marten de Vos. The engravings, by Jan Sadeler and Crispijn de Passe, were widely distributed in Scotland, along with those of the deities. Indeed, the image of Prudence is identical to that used by the King's Master of Works William Schaw, in the spectacular display to welcome Queen Anne to Scotland, following her marriage to James VI in 1589.|$|E
