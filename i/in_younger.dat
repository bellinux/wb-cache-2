40|$|The {{issue of}} stroke <b>in</b> <b>young</b> <b>in</b> India {{has long been}} of {{interest}} to neurologists in the country.

5|$|In {{adults and}} {{children}} {{over the age of}} 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. <b>In</b> <b>younger</b> children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring hemodialysis, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing continuous hemofiltration, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with burns affecting more than 20% of body area, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline articular cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the articular surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E

40|$|Close {{investigation}} of cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood is warranted {{as there is}} a prolongation of the period of risk of initiation beyond adolescence. Few studies have investigated the factors associated with patterns of cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood after the peak age of onset. This is an important period to investigate as risk factors for cannabis use can emerge throughout the life-course and the opportunity to influence adverse developmental pathways can be extended beyond childhood and adolescence. This thesis examined the correlates, predictors and consequences of patterns of cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood, using two successive waves of data from 2, 404 <b>young</b> adults enrolled <b>in</b> the PATH Through Life Project, an Australian longitudinal survey of the influence of lifestyle and social factors on health. The thesis demonstrates that, although cannabis use tends to decline <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood, a notable proportion of young adults remain involved with the drug. Relapse to cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood is not uncommon among former users. Those who first use cannabis <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood generally do not continue or progress to intensive use. A range of factors spanning numerous domains are correlated with cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood. A close connection exists between licit drugs and cannabis use. Early cannabis use and the pattern of cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood are particularly important predictors of subsequent use of the drug. Regular cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood increases the likelihood of later psychosocial and substance use problems including educational underachievement, heavy drinking, tobacco use, cannabis dependence and other illicit drug use. In contrast, ceasing cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood has considerable benefits in terms of reducing several potential harms (mental health problems, cannabis dependence, other illicit drug use) and increasing adult role participation. Risk and protective factors associated with variability and stability of cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood include gender, first use at an early age, dimensions of personality, religiosity, conflict and hostility in friendships and an environment of licit drug use. The results provide a clearer picture of the patterns of cannabis use <b>in</b> <b>young</b> adulthood and the factors that contribute to explaining them. The findings of this thesis make an important contribution to the development of prevention and intervention strategies for young adults by drawing attention to specific areas of vulnerability and resistance...|$|R

5|$|A 2004 {{study by}} Kathryn Thomas and Sandra Carlson used teeth {{from the upper}} jaw of three {{individuals}} interpreted as a juvenile, a subadult, and an adult, recovered from a bone bed in the Hell Creek Formation of Corson County, South Dakota. In this study, successive teeth in columns in the edmontosaurs' dental batteries were sampled from multiple locations along each tooth using a microdrilling system. This sampling method {{takes advantage of the}} organization of hadrosaurid dental batteries to find variation in tooth isotopes over a period of time. From their work, it appears that edmontosaur teeth took less than about 0.65years to form, slightly faster <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> edmontosaurs. The teeth of all three individuals appeared to show variation in oxygen isotope ratios that could correspond to warm/dry and cool/wet periods; Thomas and Carlson considered the possibility that the animals were migrating instead, but favored local seasonal variations because migration would have more likely led to ratio homogenization, as many animals migrate to stay within specific temperature ranges or near particular food sources.|$|E
5|$|Deinonychus antirrhopus {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} dromaeosaurid species, and is a close {{relative}} of the smaller Velociraptor, which is found <b>in</b> <b>younger,</b> Late Cretaceous–age rock formations in Central Asia. The clade they form is called Velociraptorinae. The subfamily name Velociraptorinae was first coined by Rinchen Barsbold in 1983 and originally contained the single genus Velociraptor. Later Phil Currie included most of the dromaeosaurids. Two Late Cretaceous genera, Tsaagan from Mongolia and the North American Saurornitholestes, may also be close relatives, but the latter is poorly known and hard to classify. Velociraptor and its allies are regarded as using their claws more than their skulls as killing tools, as opposed to dromaeosaurines like Dromaeosaurus, which have stockier skulls. Phylogenetically, the dromaeosaurids represent one of the non-avialan dinosaur groups most closely related to birds. The cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists Robert DePalma, David Burnham, Larry Martin, Peter Larson, and Robert Bakker, using updated data from the Theropod Working Group.|$|E

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater <b>in</b> <b>younger</b> people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E
