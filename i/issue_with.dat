5|$|A {{possible}} <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the causeway's identification as a Roman {{structure in}} the latter half of the twentieth century was its incorporation of many small bends along its course.

5|$|A third theory, {{supported}} by both Serbian and Bulgarian researchers, is that despot Michael is an unknown son of Michael Asen IV, the first-born son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371), who was proclaimed co-tsar {{shortly after his}} father's accession and died in a battle against the Ottomans before 1354–1355.

5|$|An <b>issue</b> <b>with</b> the Hinomaru and {{national}} anthem was raised once again when Tokyo hosted the 1964 Summer Olympic Games.
