5|$|The {{relationships}} of the flamecrest or Taiwan firecrest (Regulus goodfellowi) of Taiwan {{have also been}} a source of much debate. It is sometimes viewed as a race of firecrest, but its territorial song resembles those of the Himalayan races of <b>goldcrest,</b> and genetic data show that it is the closest relative of that species, and, despite its alternative name, only distantly related to the firecrest. The flamecrest diverged from the <b>goldcrest</b> 3.0–3.1mya (million years ago).|$|E
5|$|Western Canary Islands <b>goldcrest</b> R. r. ellenthalerae (Päckert et al., 2006). Resident on La Palma and El Hierro, Canary Islands.|$|E
5|$|Santa Maria <b>goldcrest</b> R. r. sanctaemariae (Vaurie, 1954). Found only on Santa Maria Island (Azores); it is paler {{than other}} Azores {{subspecies}} and whitish below.|$|E
25|$|Among birds, <b>goldcrests</b> {{are known}} to prey on money spiders.|$|R
500|$|A {{study in}} the Baltic region showed that {{northern}} <b>goldcrests</b> {{were more likely to}} migrate, and increased their body mass beforehand; non-migratory southern birds did not increase their fat reserves. The travel speed of migrating <b>goldcrests</b> increased for those leaving later in the autumn, and was greater for the northernmost populations. Migration was faster on routes that crossed the Baltic Sea than on coastal routes, and the birds with the largest fat reserves travelled at the highest speeds. The ability to lay down fat is adversely affected in this tiny bird by poor health. In Hungary, <b>goldcrests</b> stopping temporarily on migration were mostly found in scrub, including blackthorn, hawthorn and pear, which provided some protection from sparrowhawks. Females migrated slightly earlier than males, but overall there were more males, with an average sex ratio of 1.6:1. <b>Goldcrests</b> can fly [...] in one day, although they keep at a lower level in heavy headwinds. This is a tame and inquisitive bird, and tired migrants will land near or on humans, sometimes searching for food on their clothing.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: On foggy or {{overcast}} nights, <b>goldcrests</b> {{and other}} disorientated migrants can {{be attracted to}} lighthouses in large numbers.|$|R
5|$|Sao Miguel <b>Goldcrest</b> R. r. azoricus (Seebohm, 1883). Found only on São Miguel, Azores; {{it is like}} R. r. inermis, {{except the}} underparts are more olive-buff.|$|E
5|$|Tenerife <b>goldcrest</b> R. r. teneriffae (Seebohm, 1883). Found only on Tenerife, Canary Islands; it is a distinctive, small {{subspecies}} {{with a black}} {{forehead and}} pink-buff underparts.|$|E
5|$|The <b>goldcrest</b> is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} {{breeding}} season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may not be very great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the <b>goldcrest</b> and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male <b>goldcrest</b> will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.|$|E
5|$|The {{songs of}} {{mainland}} <b>goldcrests</b> vary only slightly across their range and {{consist of a}} single song type, but much more divergence {{has occurred in the}} isolated Macaronesian populations. Not only are there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European <b>goldcrests</b> in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by <b>goldcrests,</b> and identified a previously unknown subspecies.|$|R
25|$|Thousands {{of birds}} pass through {{each year on}} their way to their {{breeding}} or wintering grounds. Chiffchaffs, <b>goldcrests</b> and wheatears are usually the first to pass through, followed by sedge warblers and willow warblers, whitethroats and spotted flycatchers.|$|R
5|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, {{small groups of}} <b>goldcrests</b> maintain exclusive winter feeding territories, which they defend against neighbouring groups. As they roam around their territory, they frequently join loose flocks of other wanderers such as tits and warblers. This kinglet, like other species that prefer mixed-species foraging flocks in winter, hunts over a greater range of heights and vegetation types than when feeding alone. For species that tend to feed in flocks, foraging success while in a flock was about twice that for solitary birds. A consequence of feeding in a flock is that foraging sites may be restricted to avoid competition with other species. In a Swedish study, coal tits and <b>goldcrests</b> foraged in the outer foliage, while the larger willow and European crested tits used the inner canopy. In sites where the numbers of willow and crested tits was artificially reduced, <b>goldcrests</b> and coal tits extended their foraging to include the inner canopy, but {{did not do so}} where the larger tits were retained. In some areas, wintering birds have developed the habit of coming to feeding stations and bird tables to take fat, sometimes with warblers such as the common chiffchaff and blackcap.|$|R
5|$|The <b>goldcrest</b> {{is usually}} easily {{distinguished}} from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion {{with the common}} firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced <b>goldcrest.</b> The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American Regulus species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could {{be more difficult to}} distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile <b>goldcrest,</b> the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.|$|E
5|$|The <b>goldcrest</b> takes a {{wide variety}} of prey, {{especially}} spiders, caterpillars, bugs, springtails and flies. Larger prey such as oak bush crickets and tortrix moths may sometimes be taken. Flying insects are taken in hovering flight but not normally pursued; there is a record of a <b>goldcrest</b> attacking a large dragonfly in flight, only to be dragged along by the insect before releasing it unharmed. Goldcrests will occasionally feed on the ground among leaf-litter with tits. Non-animal food is rare, although goldcrests have been seen drinking sap from broken birch twigs together with tits and nuthatches.|$|E
5|$|The <b>goldcrest</b> is {{a host of}} the {{widespread}} moorhen flea, Dasypsyllus gallinulae, and of the louse Philopterus reguli. The amblycerous mite Ricinus frenatus has been found on the eastern <b>goldcrest</b> subspecies, R. r. japonensis in Japan, and {{at the other end}} of the range in birds of the nominate subspecies on the Faroes and in Spain. These lice move over the host's body, and have strong mouthparts that pierce the host's skin so that they can feed on blood, and sometimes feather material. A number of feather mites have been recorded in the genus Regulus; these mites live on fungi growing on the feathers. The fungi found on the plumage may feed on the keratin of the outer feathers or on feather oil.|$|E
50|$|This ancient {{woodland}} has {{a variety}} of flora such as oxlips and early-purple orchids in the spring and water avens and germander speedwells in the summer. Muntjac and roe deer use the site and birds include <b>goldcrests,</b> great spotted woodpeckers and tawny owls.|$|R
5000|$|Cattle {{are used}} to control the {{vegetation}} and retain the wide open spaces within the park area. Birds {{that can be seen}} in the area include, skylarks, sparrowhawks, kestrels, <b>goldcrests</b> and chaffinches. Other animals include roe deer, woodmice, voles and tawny owls can be seen at night.|$|R
50|$|The {{invertebrate}} fauna {{plays an}} important part in supporting a range of birds and reptiles - and all benefit from the varied mosaic of open and scrubland habitats. In open areas, common lizards and slowworms thrive. Green woodpeckers may be seen in the woods and on the heath, and <b>goldcrests</b> among the woodland edges and in the gorse.|$|R
5|$|This {{species has}} bred in Iceland since about 1999, and was {{widespread}} by 2004, although numbers {{are affected by}} hard winters. Breeds occurs intermittently in the Faroes. The <b>goldcrest</b> has occurred as a vagrant in Jordan and Morocco.|$|E
5|$|Two {{groups of}} <b>goldcrest</b> taxa are {{found on the}} Atlantic islands of Macaronesia. Birds on the Canary Islands are ancient colonists, whereas those on The Azores are of more recent origin. There are no goldcrests on Madeira, where the Madeira {{firecrest}} is the only Regulus species.|$|E
5|$|Western Azores <b>goldcrest</b> R. r. inermis (Murphy & Chapin, 1929). Resident on Flores, Faial, Terceira, São Jorge and Pico, Azores; its upper-parts are {{a darker}} olive-green {{than those of}} the {{nominate}} form, and the underparts are also darker.|$|E
50|$|The mixed {{woodland}} of coniferous and broad leaf trees covering the quarried sandstone edges mean this site is host {{to a wide}} range of woodland birds. Species recorded include coal tits and <b>goldcrests</b> as well as some warblers and woodpeckers. In addition to birds, more than 120 species of butterflies and moths are present throughout the site.Situated at the top of the ridge, remains some relic heathland.|$|R
50|$|Like its relatives, Pallas's leaf warbler is insectivorous, {{feeding on}} the adults, larvae and pupa of small insects {{including}} flies, moths and aphids; spiders are also taken. Birds forage in bushes and trees, picking items from leaves or catching prey in short flights or while hovering. When not breeding, they may join mixed-species foraging flocks together with tits, <b>goldcrests</b> and other warblers. In Asia, accompanying species may also include white-eyes, minivets and babblers.|$|R
5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and <b>goldcrests,</b> and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish researchers found that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|R
5|$|Although their ranges overlap substantially, {{hybridisation}} between goldcrests and firecrests {{seems to}} be prevented by differences in courtship rituals and different facial patterns. Even in aviary studies in which a female <b>goldcrest</b> was given an artificial eyestripe to facilitate mating with a male firecrest, the chicks were never raised by the mixed pair, {{and appeared to be}} poorly adapted compared to the parent species.|$|E
5|$|Several {{subspecies}} of the <b>goldcrest</b> {{have been}} described. In continental Eurasia, {{there are nine}} generally accepted and very similar subspecies, differing only in details such as plumage shade. At the genetic level, the two Central Asian forms, R. r. sikkimensis and R. r. himalayensis, {{are very close to}} each other, and have differentiated only in the recent past, but they diverged from the western subspecies around 2.8mya.|$|E
5|$|The <b>goldcrest</b> {{has a large}} range, {{estimated}} at 13.2millionkm2 (5.1millionmi2) and a total population {{estimated at}} 80–200million individuals, and it is therefore classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List. There was some northward range expansion in Scotland, Belgium, Norway, and Finland during the 20th century, assisted by the spread of conifer plantations. The population is currently stable, although there may be temporary marked declines in harsh winters.|$|E
5000|$|Bohill Forest Nature Reserve is a {{small area}} within the forest where trees had {{previously}} been felled and the land was allowed to naturally regrow. This woodland consists of holly, oak, rowan, birch, hazel and oak trees. Patches that are still clear of tree cover contain bracken, bilberry and heather. The habitat is ideal for the previously rare holly blue butterfly, which the nature reserve {{was set up to}} protect. Other fauna in the woodland includes the speckled wood butterfly, red deer, <b>goldcrests,</b> jays, chiffchaffs and blackcaps.|$|R
5|$|Holkham's north-facing coastal {{location}} {{can attract}} {{large numbers of}} migrating birds in autumn if the weather conditions are right, especially with a north to north-east wind. The common species may {{be accompanied by a}} wryneck, red-backed shrike or greenish warbler in August, with <b>goldcrests,</b> thrushes and finches later in the season, and perhaps red-breasted flycatchers and yellow-browed warblers. Vagrant rarities such as Pallas's, Radde's or dusky warblers may occur; a red-breasted nuthatch in 1989 was the first, and, as of 2012, the only individual of its species to be recorded in the UK.|$|R
50|$|For {{the fourth}} series of Springwatch, the {{production}} team {{moved to a}} new location at the Pensthorpe Nature Reserve in Norfolk due to a change of ownership at the Fishleigh Estate farm. It was broadcast on BBC Two from 26 May to 12 June. Bill Oddie and Kate Humble watched local birds on the nest, including little ringed plovers, <b>goldcrests</b> and reed buntings, all new species for Springwatch. Swallows, blue tits, great tits, greenfinches, pied wagtails and robins were amongst the returning species. Simon King was based in the Cairngorm National Park, where he brought viewers footage of ospreys with chicks, pine martens, Scottish wildcats, ptarmigan and crested tits.|$|R
5|$|The typical contact {{call of the}} <b>goldcrest</b> is a thin, high-pitched zee {{given at}} {{intervals}} of 1–4 seconds, with all the notes at the same pitch. It sometimes has a more clipped ending, or is delivered more rapidly. The call is higher and less rough {{than that of the}} firecrest. The song of the male <b>goldcrest</b> is a very high, thin double note cedar, repeated 5–7 times and ending in a flourish, cedarcedar-cedar-cedar-cedar-stichi-see-pee. The entire song lasts 3–4 seconds and is repeated 5–7 times a minute. This song, often uttered while the male is foraging, can be heard in most months of the year. There is also a subdued rambling subsong. Male goldcrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, since the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|E
5|$|There {{are a few}} Pleistocene (2.6million to 12,000years BP) {{records from}} Europe of extant Regulus species, mostly goldcrests or unidentifiable to species. The only fossil of an extinct Regulus is a left ulna from 2.6–1.95mya in Bulgaria, which was {{identified}} as belonging to an extinct species, Regulus bulgaricus. The <b>goldcrest</b> lineage diverged from this apparent ancestor of the common firecrest in the Middle Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the <b>goldcrest)</b> that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E
25|$|A heronry {{is located}} by Trentabank Reservoir within the reserve; with around twenty-two nests, {{it is the}} largest in the Peak District. The heronry is visible from several viewpoints, and {{close-up}} CCTV pictures of the nests can also be seen in the Trentabank ranger station. Other birds observed in the woodland include crossbills, siskins, <b>goldcrests,</b> pied flycatchers, garden warblers, blackcaps and woodcocks, while the reservoirs support abundant waterfowl including cormorants, coots, goldeneyes, pochard, mallards, tufted ducks, teal, great crested grebe, little grebe and common sandpipers. A herd of around twelve red deer, the remnant of the royal forest herd, still frequents the forest. Small mammals present in the woodland include badgers and weasels.|$|R
50|$|The {{song of the}} Mediterranean {{subspecies}} {{of common}} firecrest, R. i. balearicus, {{is very similar to}} that of the nominate form, but one factor in separating the Madeiran firecrest from common firecrest is that the island bird's song is divided into three phrases, two of them consisting of modified display and anger calls. Its display calls also use a larger frequency range and more harmonics than those of the continental subspecies. Male <b>goldcrests</b> and Madeiran firecrests sometimes show a territorial response to recordings of the songs or calls of the common firecrest, but the reverse is apparently not true, because the songs of the common firecrest are simpler in construction than those of its relatives.|$|R
500|$|The <b>goldcrest's</b> nest is a well-insulated {{cup-shaped}} structure {{built in}} three layers. The nest's outer layer {{is made from}} moss, small twigs, cobwebs and lichen, the cobwebs also being used to attach the nest to the thin branches that support it. The middle layer is moss, which is lined by an inner layer of feathers and hair. The nest is larger, shallower and less compact {{than that of the}} firecrest, with an internal diameter of about , and is constructed by both sexes, although the female does most of the work. It is often suspended from a hanging branch, usually at no great height, although Eric Simms reported nests at heights from [...] One pair built their nest just [...] above that of a sparrowhawk.|$|R
