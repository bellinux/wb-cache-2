Ahmose restored Egyptian rule over Nubia, which was controlled <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> administrative center established at Buhen.

5|$|In these epochs, she was {{not merely}} {{applying}} ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions {{that would be used}} by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of ideals in rings, generalizing earlier work of Richard Dedekind. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> perspective, such as elimination theory and the algebraic varieties that had been studied by her father.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{efforts by}} Magnus to besiege Swedish-controlled Reval were faltering, {{with support from}} neither Ivan nor Magnus' brother, Frederick II of Denmark forthcoming.
