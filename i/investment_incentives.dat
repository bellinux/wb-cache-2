25|$|An {{important}} question regarding public goods {{is whether they}} should be owned by the public or the private sector. Economic theorists such as Hart (1995) argue that ownership matters for <b>investment</b> <b>incentives</b> when contracts are incomplete. The incomplete contracting paradigm {{has been applied to}} public goods by Besley and Ghatak (2001). They consider the government and a non-governmental organization (NGO) who can both make investments to provide a public good. Who should be the owner of the public good, the government or the NGO? Besley and Ghatak show that the party who has a larger valuation for the public good should be the owner, regardless of whether the government or the NGO has a better investment technology. This result contrasts with the case of private goods studied by Hart (1995), where the party with the better investment technology should be the owner. However, more recently {{it has been shown that}} the investment technology matters also in the public-good case when a party is indispensable or when there are bargaining frictions between the government and the NGO.|$|E

40|$|This short paper {{attempts}} to clarify {{some of the}} issues and provide suggestions for reforms in the fiscal incentive system. In particular, it focuses on the <b>Investment</b> <b>Incentive</b> System embodied in the Omnibus Investment Code. The paper {{attempts to}} provide some estimate of revenues forgone, specifically from income tax holiday under different assumptions. It urges that the government should be aware of these costs, be very choosy in granting incentives, and should make sure that social benefits from preferred activities compensate for the costs. Toward this end, the paper proposes a two-tiered approach for reforms [...] generic and special <b>incentives.</b> <b>investment</b> <b>incentive</b> system, fiscal incentives...|$|R

2500|$|Federal {{and provincial}} and federal major <b>investment</b> <b>incentives</b> for oil sands {{companies}} were introduced {{by both the}} federal government under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and the provincial government under Klein. The Liberal federal government [...] "reformed and streamlined the tax write-offs it allowed for oil sands firms."

2500|$|Legal and {{institutional}} frameworks to facilitate {{foreign investment and}} trade also were created. Laws on taxation, joint ventures, foreign investments, and related areas were promulgated to encourage foreign investment. In 1979 China created four special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou (in Guangdong Province), and Xiamen (in Fujian Province). (See Special Economic Zones of the People's Republic of China.) The special economic zones essentially were export-processing zones designed to attract foreign investment, expand exports, and import technology and expertise. In 1984 fourteen coastal cities were designated [...] "open cities." [...] These too were intended to attract foreign funds and technology. But in 1985 the government decided to concentrate resources on only four of the cities: Dalian, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin. Although the special economic zones and open cities {{had the power to}} grant <b>investment</b> <b>incentives,</b> problems with the red tape, bureaucratic interference, and lack of basic infrastructure resulted in less foreign investment and fewer high-technology projects than initially envisioned.|$|E

40|$|In 2000 the South African Government {{introduced}} an <b>investment</b> <b>incentive</b> for the automotive industry, the Productive Asset Allowance (PAA). This {{was intended to}} support {{the objectives of the}} Motor Industry Development Programme (MIDP). This paper presents an empirical assessment of the PAA's prospects for supporting the competitiveness of South Africa's automotive industry. It provides a historical overview of the MIDP and the introduction of the PAA and analyses industry performance data on investment and competitiveness from 1998 to 2004. The findings reveal that while the industry succeeded in increasing exports, the share of domestically produced vehicles in the local market decreased. Moreover, investment in R&D, as an indicator for future competitiveness, was insignificant. The offer of a generic <b>investment</b> <b>incentive</b> like the PAA seems to have a significant and positive effect on industry investment, but limited ability to support long-term industry competitiveness through R&D and innovation. ...|$|R
