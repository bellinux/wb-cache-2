2500|$|Unless you are {{allergic}} to the pollen of certain trees and herbs (such as birch, horse chestnut, alder, lilac, cherry tree, ash tree, rowan tree, lime tree, dandelion), {{the best time}} for travelling to central European Russia is late spring when the temperatures are pleasant and many trees are in bloom, and early and mid autumn when trees change their colour and it is not cold yet. Summer months are also good except for June in cities in central and south Russia when poplar fluff can be a nuisance, but recently the authorities of many Russian cities have taken action against the fluff by cutting and removing poplar trees and the situation has improved dramatically. Late autumn, winter months, and early spring will be enjoyable if you wear appropriate clothes and shoes. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> winter activities, in central European Russia it usually begins to snow in late autumn and snowpack usually doesn't melt away completely before early April, although spells of warm weather do occur and snow can temporarily melt away in mid-winter. Ski resorts in mountainous areas have snow throughout the winter season. Central European Russia sometimes experiences cold spells in early May when the temperature can go from +15°C/59°F to the freezing point for a few days.|$|E

6000|$|He may {{say that}} there has been in many miraculous stories a notion of spiritual {{preparation}} and acceptance: in short, that the miracle could only come to him who believed in it. It may be so, and if it is so how are we to test it? If we are inquiring whether certain results follow faith, it is useless to repeat wearily that (if they happen) they do follow faith. If faith is one of the conditions, those without faith have a most healthy right to laugh. But they have no right to judge. Being a believer may be, if you like, as bad as being drunk; still if we were extracting psychological facts from drunkards, it would be absurd to be always taunting them with having been drunk. Suppose we were investigating whether angry men really saw a red mist before their eyes. Suppose sixty excellent householders swore that when angry they had seen this crimson cloud: surely it would be absurd to answer [...] "Oh, but you admit you were angry at the time." [...] They might reasonably rejoin (in a stentorian chorus), [...] "How the blazes could we discover, without being angry, whether angry people see red?" [...] So the saints and ascetics might rationally reply, [...] "Suppose that the question is whether believers can see visions--even then, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> visions it is no point to object to believers." [...] You are still arguing in a circle--in that old mad circle with which this book began.|$|E
6000|$|This was {{the state}} of mind to which Mr. Brumley had {{attained}} {{when he made his}} ineffectual raid upon Black Strand, and you will remark about it, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the changes in people's ideas that are going on to-day, that although he was prepared to make the most extensive glosses in this particular instance upon the commonly accepted rules of what is right and proper, he was not for a moment prepared to accord the terrible gift of an independent responsibility to Lady Harman. In that direction lay regions that Mr. Brumley had still to explore. Lady Harman he considered was married wrongly and disastrously and this he held to be essentially the fault of Sir Isaac--with perhaps some slight blame attaching to Lady Harman's mother. The only path of escape he could conceive as yet for Lady Harman lay through the chivalry of some other man. That a woman could possibly rebel against one man without the sympathy and moral maintenance of another was still outside the range of Mr. Brumley's understanding. It is still outside the range of most men's understandings--and of a great many women's. If he generalized at all from these persuasions it was in the direction that in the interest of [...] "true marriage" [...] there should be greater facilities for divorce and also a kind of respectable-ization of divorce. Then these [...] "false marriages" [...] might be rectified without suffering. The reasons for divorce he felt should be extended to include things not generally reprehensible, and chivalrous people coming into court should be protected from the indelicate publicity of free reporting....|$|E

6000|$|<b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> architecture, {{and wish}} to make it your chief study, you should draw much from {{photographs}} of it; and then from the architecture itself, with the same completion of detail and gradation, only keeping the shadows of due paleness, in photographs they are always about four times as dark as they ought to be; and treat buildings with as much care and love as artists do their rock foregrounds, drawing all the moss and weeds, and stains upon them. But if, without caring to understand architecture, you merely want the picturesque character of it, {{and to be able}} to sketch it fast, you cannot do better than take Prout for your exclusive master; only do not think that you are copying Prout by drawing straight lines with dots at the end of them. Get first his [...] "Rhine," [...] and draw the subjects that have most hills, and least architecture in them, with chalk on smooth paper, till you can lay on his broad flat tints, and get his gradations of light, which are very wonderful; then take up the architectural subjects in the [...] "Rhine," [...] and draw again and again the groups of figures, &c., in his [...] "Microcosm," [...] and [...] "Lessons on Light and Shadow." [...] After that, proceed to copy the grand subjects in the sketches in [...] "Flanders and Germany;" [...] or in [...] "Switzerland and Italy," [...] if you cannot get the Flanders; but the Switzerland is very far inferior. Then work from Nature, not trying to Proutise Nature, by breaking smooth buildings into rough ones, but only drawing what you see, with Prout's simple method and firm lines. Don't copy his coloured works. They are good, but not at all equal to his chalk and pencil drawings, and you will become a mere imitator, and a very feeble imitator, if you use colour at all in Prout's method. I have not space to explain why this is so, it would take a long piece of reasoning; trust me for the statement.|$|E
