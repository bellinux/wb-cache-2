40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the leakage control and quality {{assurance}} of fabrication pressure vessels for water heating. A relevant welding device and process are described. MAG welding including the equipment for welding water-heater shell,the power source using a welding rectifier with a horizontal static characteristic and measuring welding current and arc voltage during welding are schematic represented. There are shown defects, which are most often occurred at the junctions between the longitudinal and circumferential welds and at the contact between the start {{and end of the}} circumferential weld. One part of the paper describes, how to improve the fabrication of pressure vessels for water heating by welding. Spatter <b>free</b> <b>ignition</b> (SFI) of the welding arc by MAG welding is described. Finally, a leak tightness testing of welds is represented...|$|E

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} Closed access. Controlled Auto Ignition (CAI) uses the {{internal}} {{energy of the}} compressed charge to auto-ignite the mixture. Using internal exhaust gas re-circulation (IEGR) as an indirect control method, CAI offers superior fuel economy and pollutant emission reductions. Practically, this can readily be achieved by a method of early exhaust valve closure and late inlet valve opening to trap a large quantity of exhaust gas residuals within the cylinder from one cycle to the next. Although the emission and fuel economy can be largely improved, the engine power output is limited to part-load conditions only. At high-load, conventional Spark Ignition (SI) is required. In this research, both SI and CAI and the transition between the two were investigated on a single-cylinder research engine equipped with Lotus’ Research Active Valve Train (AVT) System. It {{was found that the}} potential hybrid combustion concept is consisted of four regions: conventional spark ignition combustion, spark ignition controlled auto ignition, spark ignition assisted auto <b>ignition,</b> spark <b>ignition</b> <b>free</b> controlled auto <b>ignition...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of alloying on {{the ignition and}} flammability was studied. One end of a cylindrical specimen was exposed to a <b>free</b> diffusion flame. <b>Ignition</b> required at least partial melting. Burning extinguished once the flame was withdrawn. Specimen tips of pure Mg, AZ 61, and AZ 91 ignited upon prolonged flame exposure. There was smouldering and delayed ignition for Mg- 1 Y. There was no ignition for Mg- 5 Y specimen tips, attributed to a protective surface oxide containing Y. The results indicate that (i) vigorous burning requires a continued supply of Mg vapour, and (ii) a critical alloy concentration is required to change ignition behaviour. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Two-Stroke Spark <b>Ignition</b> <b>Free</b> Piston Linear Engine Concept Is Analyzed In This Paper. The Main Components Of The Engine Are Combustion Chamber, Scavenging Chamber, Kickback Chamber And Slider-Piston. Dynamic And Thermodynamic Models Of The Slider-Piston Motion Are Presented. Also, The Effect Of Various Heat Additions And Compression Ratio On The Slider-Piston Velocity, Time Taken For One Stroke, And Stroke Length Are Explored. By Using Selected Engine Variables, The Motion Of The Two-Stroke Free Piston Linear Engine Is Successfully Simulated. The Results Show That The Velocity Profile Of Slider-Piston Motion Is Non-Sinusoidal. By Varying The Amount Of Heat Addition, The Velocity And Stroke Length Of Slider-Piston Will Increase Accordingly. However, By Increasing Compression Ratio, The Velocity Of Slider Piston Is Noted To Increase But The Stroke Length Of Slider-Piston Remains Constant. ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2006, NASA {{announced}} that five RS-68 engines {{would be used}} instead of SSMEs on the planned Ares V (CaLV). NASA chose the RS-68 because of its lower cost, about $20 million per engine after NASA upgrades. The modifications to the RS-68 for the Ares V included a different ablative nozzle to accommodate a longer burn, a shorter start sequence, hardware changes to limit <b>free</b> hydrogen at <b>ignition,</b> and changes to reduce helium use during countdown and flight. Thrust and specific impulse increases would occur under a separate upgrade program for Delta IV. Later the Ares V was changed to use six RS-68 engines, designated RS-68B. [...] Ares V was canceled along with Project Constellation; NASA's successor heavy-lift vehicle, the Space Launch System, will use {{a variant of the}} RS-25, the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME).|$|R
40|$|The new, 125 °C, solid polymer {{aluminum}} (SPA) capacitors have performance {{advantages over}} {{other types of}} low ESR capacitors when used as output filters in DC-DC modules. The principal advantage of an SPA capacitor is that its ultra low ESR permits filtering in a DC-DC converter with fewer capacitors. This reduces the cost {{and size of the}} converter. Other advantages are <b>ignition</b> <b>free,</b> open circuit failure mode, better filtering from lower ESR, higher peak current capability and more rapid energy transfer. The new type is available as Cornell Dubilier Type ESRH. While SPA capacitors are inherently reliable, they do have a wear out mechanism. Entrapped moisture causes a steady increase in ESR. However, the new 125 °C version has eliminated most of the moisture entrapped during manufacturing and can provide an expected life of more than 10 years in typical, hot running, DC-DC modules. 1...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2003 The Alaska North Slope is a {{potential}} candidate for the Gas to Liquid (GTL) technology. With over 38 Tcf of natural gas reserves stranded on the Alaska North Slope, the GTL technology is considered as a possible method of harnessing the abundant resources. GTL fuels are environmentally friendly (sulfur <b>free)</b> with better <b>ignition</b> and burning properties than conventional petroleum products from crude oil. Evaluating the options of transporting GTL products through the existing Trans Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS) together with crude oil either as a blend of crude oil and GTL (commingled) or as alternate slugs of each product (batching) is {{the main focus of}} this study. Economic evaluation using Rate of Return analysis to identify the most favorable mode of transportation of the GTL products was performed. Batching, using the modem tracking and sensor techniques was found to be the most economic method yielding the highest return on investment...|$|R

40|$|In {{a cement}} plant, {{as in any}} industry, there are {{regulations}} {{of the level of}} emissions. One way to reduce the emissions is by decreasing the clinker content in the produced cement by addition of remains from other processes that together with lime produce the same products as pure clinker. The produced clinker varies in reactivity and in a more reactive clinker the addition could be increased, reducing the emissions per tonnage of cement. Today the produced cement is analyzed for strength and the results are then evaluated, which is about 1. 5 months after the clinker was produced. Clinker samples from the kiln are analyzed every third hour with X-Ray diffraction to see that the composition is correct. If those samples could be used to predict the strength or heat evolution, parameters could be changed directly to keep a stable clinker production. This would give a more stable product and require less energy to produce, thereby producing less emission. In this study, Florida clinker samples have been mixed with 3. 96 % gypsum and ground in a 5 kg-mill. The ground cement has been analyzed for sulfur, loss of <b>ignition,</b> <b>free</b> lime, compressive strength and setting time. They have also been analyzed with X-Ray fluorescence, calorimetry and X-Ray diffraction. The results have been correlated with each other two by two to see if any connections could be found. The results of the correlation analysis showed 9 good correlations. No correlation was found between any clinker mineral or module to heat evolution, compressive strength or setting time. Multivariate analysis has also been used but more data is needed for it to be able to predict the cement strength. The calorimetric analyses were performed while developing a method. The method seemed robust and small changes had no large significance although the mixing time could rather be too long since shorter mixing time was not enough...|$|R
