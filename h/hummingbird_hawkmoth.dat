40|$|Most visual {{systems are}} more {{sensitive}} to luminance than to colour signals. Animals resolve finer spatial detail and temporal changes through achromatic signals than through chromatic ones. Probably, this explains that detection of small, distant, or moving objects is typically mediated through achromatic signals. Macroglossum stellatarum are fast flying nectarivorous hawkmoths that inspect flowers with their long proboscis while hovering. They can visually control this behaviour using floral markings known as nectar guides. Here, we investigate whether this is mediated by chromatic or achromatic cues. We evaluated proboscis placement, foraging efficiency, and inspection learning of naïve moths foraging on flower models with coloured markings that offered either chromatic, achromatic or both contrasts. <b>Hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoths</b> could use either achromatic or chromatic signals to inspect models while hovering. We identified three, apparently independent, components controlling proboscis placement: After initial contact, 1) moths directed their probing towards the yellow colour irrespectively of luminance signals, suggesting a dominant role of chromatic signals; and 2) moths tended to probe mainly on the brighter areas of models that offered only achromatic signals. 3) During {{the establishment of the}} first contact, naïve moths showed a tendency to direct their proboscis towards the small floral marks independent of their colour or luminance. Moths learned to find nectar faster, but their foraging efficiency depended on the flower model they foraged on.

50|$|Both {{subspecies}} Mimulus aurantiacus puniceus (red-flowered) and Mimulus aurantiacus australis (yellow-flowered) of monkeyflowers {{are isolated}} {{due to the}} preferences of their <b>hummingbird</b> and <b>hawkmoth</b> pollinators. The radiation of M. aurantiacus subspecies are mostly yellow colored; however, both M. a. ssp. puniceus and M. a. ssp. flemingii are red. Phylogenetic analysis suggests two independent origins of red-colored flowers that arose due to cis-regulatory mutations in the gene MaMyb2 that is present in all M. aurantiacus subspecies. Further research suggested that two independent mutations did not take place, but one MaMyb2 allele was transferred via introgressive hybridization. This study presents {{an example of the}} overlap of research in various disciplines.

40|$|Two {{hypotheses}} {{have been}} proposed to explain the occurrence of hybrid zones between red-flowered Ipomopsis aggregata and white-flowered I. tenuituba.

We examined restriction site patterns in nuclear DNA (nrDNA), chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from populations of I. aggregata and I. tenuituba representing seven zones of sympatry. No variation was detected in a 350 -bp fragment of mtDNA and uninformative levels of variation were observed for nrDNA. We detected 22 potentially informative restriction site polymorphisms in cpDNA, all of which united geographical areas containing populations of both species. We detected no informative species-specific markers. Studies of other species (e. g. oaks) have detected similar species-independent geographical structure of cpDNA. However, in these cases secondary interegradation could be inferred from species-specific nuclear alleles. The pattern in Ipomopsis is consistent with both primary intergradation (independent speciation in each area of sympatry) or secondary intergradation involving complete cytoplasmic replacement. Thus, additional data are needed to explain the origin of hybrid zones in Ipomopsis...|$|R

40|$|Speciation can be {{described}} as a reduction, and the eventual cessation, in the ability to interbreed. Thus, determining how gene flow differs within and between nascent species can illuminate the relative stage the taxa have attained in the speciation process. Aquilegia formosa and A. pubescens are fully intercompatible, yet occur in different habitats and have flowers specialized for pollination by <b>hummingbirds</b> and <b>hawkmoths,</b> respectively. Using 79 SNP loci, we genotyped nearly 1000 individuals from populations of both species in close proximity to each other and from putative hybrid zones. The species shared all but one SNP polymorphism, and on average, allele frequencies differed by only 0. 14. However, the species were clearly differentiated using Structure, and admixed individuals were primarily identified at putative hybrid zones. PopGraph identified a highly integrated network among all populations, but populations of each species and hybrid zones occupied distinct regions in the network. Using either conditional graph distance (cGD) or Fst/(1 -Fst), we found significant isolation by distance (IBD) among populations. Within species, IBD was strong, indicating high historic gene flow. IBD extended approximately 100 km in A. pubescens and 30 km in A. formosa. However, IBD between the species was very weak and extended only a few km beyond hybrid zones, suggesting little recent gene flow. The extensive sharing of SNP polymorphisms between these species suggests that they are very early in the speciation process while the low signal of IBD suggests that they have largely ceased gene exchange...|$|R
40|$|Macromeria viridiflora is an {{herbaceous}} perennial {{in which}} floral traits vary geographically. In my dissertation research, I analyzed geographic variation in plant morphology and pollinator assemblages. I conducted experiments {{to determine the}} breeding system of the plants, and used visitation rate and pollen deposition to compare effectiveness of floral visitors as pollinators. I analyzed aspects of pollinator attractants and rewards in the flowers and placed this into the context of pollinator syndromes. In addition, I used phylogenetic analysis of the genus to determine polarity of change in corolla size within the species. Analysis of morphometric data from eight sites across {{the range of the}} species revealed significant among-population variation in vegetative and floral traits. Flower size variation is particularly strong and follows a latitudinal cline. <b>Hawkmoths</b> and <b>hummingbirds</b> were the main floral visitors throughout the range. The large-bodied hummingbirds visiting plants in the southern regions are not present in the northern regions, where flowers are visited by hummingbirds with barely half the body size and much shorter bills. This difference in bill size of hummingbird pollinators mirrors the geographic variation in flower size in M. viridiflora, suggesting that pollinator-mediated selection may be acting upon the species. Flowers of M. viridiflora have several characteristics that fit both the <b>hummingbird</b> and <b>hawkmoth</b> pollinator syndromes, namely copious sucrose-rich nectar and long floral tubes. However, they also have characteristics that correspond with a single major pollinator. This plant therefore presents a compromise floral syndrome that attracts two classes of pollinators. Breeding system studies showed that whereas plants are self-compatible and occasionally produce seed autogamously, pollinators are important for reproductive success in the plants. Combining visitation rate and pollen deposition as measures of pollinator effectiveness, hummingbirds were found to be the most effective pollinators at both sites. Phylogenetic analysis produced a single most parsimonious tree that supports the monophyly of the genus. Mapping of corolla size onto the phylogeny indicates that floral size has changed many times within the genus, and that very large corolla size in southern populations of Macromeria viridiflora has been derived from a smaller-flowered ancestor...|$|R
40|$|Inga {{species are}} characterised by generalist or mixed {{pollination}} system. However, this feature does not enhance reproductive rates in species with very low fruit set under natural conditions. Some ecological and genetic factors {{are associated with}} this feature, and to test the effect of massive visits on pollination success in Inga subnuda subsp. luschnathiana, we studied the efficacy of polyads deposited on stigmas of flowers isolated from visitors and polyads exposed to visitors. The proportion of polyads fixed in stigmas decreased after exposure to visitors (24 h) in comparison to stigmas isolated from visitors (<b>hummingbirds,</b> bees, wasps, <b>hawkmoths</b> and bats), and fruit set was very low. Furthermore, nectar production, sugar composition and other floral biology traits were evaluated. Increased nectar production, sugar availability and sucrose dominance during the night indicates adaptation to nocturnal visitors and supports their role as main pollinators; although the brush-flower morphology, time of anthesis, nectar dynamics and chemical composition also allow daytime visitors. Thus the species is an important resource for {{a diverse group of}} floral visitors. We conclude that excess visits (diurnal and nocturnal) are responsible for the decrease in fixed polyads in stigmas of I. subnuda subsp. luschnathiana flowers, thus contributing, with others factors, to its low fruit set. Therefore, the generalist pollination system does not result in reproductive advantages because the low fruit set in natural conditions could be the result of a negative effect of visitors/pollinators...|$|R

Understanding {{the physics of}} biological flyers such as birds and insects can help improve the performance of micro air vehicles. The present research focuses on the aerodynamics of insect-like flapping wing flight with the approach of numerical computation. Insect model of hawkmoth is adopted in the numerical study with rigid wing assumption currently. The numerical model integrates the computational fluid dynamics of the flow and active control of wing kinematics to achieve stable flight. The computation grid is a hybrid consisting of background Cartesian nodes and clouds of mesh-free grids around immersed boundaries.

They did not learn to discriminate two natural flower odours when they were presented with the innately preferred colour blue, but they did learn this discrimination combined with yellow or green colours that are less attractive to the moth. The yellow colour could be trained to become as attractive as the innately preferred blue colour and the blue colour could be trained to become less attractive.

And are learned associations useful after long breaks? In a series of experiments I show here that, depending on previous experience, the European <b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth,</b> Macroglossum stellatarum can use both types of information to choose a first flower after periods of 1 or 3 weeks.

We consider here theoretical properties of insect motion detectors at very low image velocities and measure spatial and temporal sensitivity of neurons in the lobula complex of two specialised hovering insects, the bee-fly Bombylius and the <b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth,</b> Macroglossum. The spatio-temporal optima of direction-selective neurons in these insects lie at lower velocities than those of other insects which we have studied, including large syrphid flies, which are also excellent hoverers. We argue that spatio-temporal optima reflect a compromise between the demands of diverse behaviour, which can involve prolonged periods of stationary, hovering flight followed by spectacular high speed pursuits of conspecifics. Males of the syrphid Eristalis which engage in such behaviour, have higher temporal frequency optima than females. High contrast sensitivity in these flies nevertheless results in reliable responses at very low image velocities. Neurons of Bombylius have two distinct velocity optima, suggesting that they sum inputs from two classes of motion correlator with different time constants. This also provides sensitivity to a large range of velocities...|$|E
40|$|The European <b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth</b> Macroglossum stellatarum is a diurnal nectar forager {{like the}} honeybee, {{and we expect}} {{similarities}} in their sensory ecology. Using behavioural tests and electroretinograms (ERGs), we studied the spectral sensitivity of M. stellatarum. By measuring ERGs in the dark-adapted eye and after adaptation to green light, we determined that M. stellatarum has ultraviolet (UV), blue and green receptors maximally sensitive at 349, 440 and 521 nm, and confirmed that green receptors are most frequent in the retina. To determine the behavioural spectral sensitivity (action spectrum) of foraging moths, we trained animals to associate a disk illuminated with spectral light, with a food reward, and a dark disk with no reward. While the spectral positions of sensitivity maxima found in behavioural tests agree with model predictions based on the ERG data, the sensitivity to blue light was 30 times higher than expected. This {{is different from the}} honeybee but similar to earlier findings in the crepuscular hawkmoth Manduca sexta. It may indicate that the action spectrum of foraging hawkmoths does not represent their general sensory capacity. We suggest that the elevated sensitivity to blue light is related to the innate preference of hawkmoths for blue flowers...|$|E
40|$|The diurnal <b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth</b> Macroglossum stellatarum {{can learn}} the {{achromatic}} (intensity-related) and the chromatic (wavelength-related) {{aspect of a}} spectral colour.

In contrast, they learn the discrimination of two stimuli differing in the achromatic aspect more slowly and less reliably. When trained to use the chromatic aspect, they disregard the achromatic aspect, and when trained to use the achromatic aspect, they disregard the chromatic aspect, {{at least to some}} degree. In a conflicting situation, hummingbird hawkmoths clearly rely on the chromatic aspect of colour. Generally, the moths pay attention to the most reliable cue that allows them to discriminate colours in the learning situation. This is usually the chromatic aspect of the colour but they can learn to attend to the achromatic aspect instead.

40|$|EN]In {{the present}} thesis, {{composed}} of four chapters, we studied {{different aspects of}} the visual system of two pollinator species: Bombus terrestris (bumblebee) and Macroglossum stellatarum (<b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth).</b> Some studies have already investigated the visual system, behaviour and cognition of both species at different levels. Yet, much information is missing. In the four chapters of this thesis we studied the behaviour of both species, with differences concerning the sensorial system and the applied methodology. In the first two chapters we investigated the behaviour of Bombus terrestris while performing tasks related with discrimination and detection of artificial flowers. In in the last two chapters we studied basic and fundamental aspects of the visual system of Macroglossum stellatarum: the spectral sensitivity and the colour discrimination capacity. Despite the fact that bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) and honeybees (Apis mellifera) are related species, comparative studies have shown differences in many aspects of their behaviour related with the use of visual information. Flowers are diverse and so is the foraging behaviour of pollinators. These can employ different strategies and modulate their behaviour to select, detect and discriminate the most rewarding flowers. Macroglossum stellatarum has been considered as an important pollinator of many plants in Europe; yet, basic information about its visual system remained unknown until the development of this thesisFloral visitors are often required to make comparative judgments between flowers, based on, mainly, visual differences between them. Models of colour vision attempt to predict the ease with which animals can discriminate between colours with different spectral properties. The predictions of models are based on the perceptual distance between two colours, where small perceptual distances indicate that discrimination will be difficult, while large perceptual distances mean that discrimination will be easy. There is, in principle, no obvious reason to use one model over the other, but due to models’ formulation and assumptions, predictions can diverge. In the first chapter, we focused on the predictions of different colour vision models and tested how well they adjust to the bumblebee behaviour during a flower discrimination task. We selected four pairs of artificial flowers differing in their perceptual distances (chromatic information) according to two models, while being similar according to a third one. Achromatic contrasts (brightness and green contrast) between flowers were also measured and incorporated into the analyses. Bumblebees were divided between pairs of artificial flowers and trained to discriminate between the two colours of the pair. One of the colours carried the reward (sucrose solution), while the other a punishment (quinine). We measured the time bumblebees took to find the rewarding flowers, as well as the accuracy (measured as the proportion of correct choices). The time that bees required to select a flower and the proportion of correct choices differed between pairs: decision times decreased as achromatic contrast increased, and the proportion of correct choices increased with achromatic contrast and perceptual distance. First, these results suggest that both chromatic and achromatic contrasts affected the discriminability of colour pairs and second, that model predictions are not always in agreement with the animal behaviour. Since flower colour affects the foraging choices of bees and foraging choices affect the reproductive success of plants, a better understanding of which model is more accurate is required to predict bee behaviour and the ecological implications of flower choice and colour. As well as colour, the size of the flowers constrains bumblebee behaviour during the foraging activity when flowers are presented in homogeneous backgrounds. When flowers are big, search time correlates with the colour contrast between flowers and background. When colour contrast or flowers are small, bees take longer to detect these flowers against a homogeneous green background and adjust their behaviour in several ways. Besides vision, olfaction is another important sensory modality that bees use during the foraging activity. Therefore, in the second chapter we studied the effect of colour, size, training and {{the presence or absence of}} a second cue (odour) on bumblebee behaviour while detecting and discriminating flowers presented against a complex background. Bumblebees looking for blue flowers were more accurate, flew faster, followed more direct paths between flowers (travelling less distances) and needed less time to find them, than bumblebees looking for red flowers. When exploiting red flowers they made more errors and required more time to find flowers, although performance increased with experience and with the presence of odour. The size of flowers alone did not directly affect the bumblebee behaviour; however, when combined with colour it had an effect. Bumblebees took longer to find big red flowers. These flowers, had the smallest chromatic contrast with the background, and although the achromatic contrast exceeded that of the blue flowers, the efficiency in detection is not comparable between channels (chromatic and achromatic). The perception of stimuli was mainly affected by the chromatic contrast between the flowers and the complex background, but the difficulty imposed by this combination could be compensated by the presence of a second cue (odour), or the amount of received training. Our results differ from those found in a similar experiment using homogeneous green background and we present possible reasons in the discussion of the chapter. In recent years many studies have been done on the visual system of some floral visitors (especially bees and to some extent butterflies and Syrphids), raising the understanding about mechanisms and functions involved in visual perception. Nevertheless, for most species many basic aspects remain unclear. Macroglossum stellatarum is a diurnal floral visitor – of the otherwise mainly crepuscular Sphingidae family – with demonstrated learning abilities. Macroglossum stellatarum can easily be raised in laboratory, which makes this moth an excellent candidate for studies in environments under controlled conditions. Previous experiments have suggested that M. stellatarum possesses true colour vision, with receptors sensitive in the ultraviolet (UV), blue and green areas of the spectrum. The moth has demonstrated innate preferences and broad colour discrimination capacity over some ranges of the hypothetical visible spectrum. However, the spectral sensitivity of the retinal photoreceptors remains unknown, as well as their peak absorbance. If we aim to understand an animal’s behaviour by carrying out colour vision experiments, we first have to comprehend how animals perceive their environment and distinguish different visual stimuli. In the third chapter we therefore characterised the spectral sensitivity of the <b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth</b> Macroglossum stellatarum and established the peak absorbance of its photoreceptors, using behavioural tests and electroretinogram (ERGs) analyses. By measuring ERGs we determined that M. stellatarum has ultraviolet (UV), blue and green receptors maximally sensitive at 349, 440 and 521 nm. To determine the behavioural spectral sensitivity (action spectrum), we trained moths to associate an illuminated disk with a food reward, and a dark disk with no reward. While the spectral positions of sensitivity maxima found in behavioural tests agree with model predictions based on the ERG data, the sensitivity to blue light was 30 times higher than expected. We relate this higher sensitivity with the moth’s innate preference for blue colour and present a general discussion about results within the chapter. Despite the innate preference for particular colours, M. stellatarum feeds from a variety of flower species and prefers colour over scent when given the opportunity to choose. Given the importance of the spectral properties of flowers for this moth, and knowing the spectral sensitivity of its photoreceptors, the moth’s capacity to discriminate between similar wavelengths is of interesting. Wavelength discrimination is defined as the ability of an organism to discriminate between perceptually close monochromatic stimuli. In the context of foraging, this capacity can result advantageous, especially for insects demanding high energy intakes such as M. stellatarum due to its hovering behaviour while feeding. In the fourth chapter we tested the capacity of M. stellatarum to discriminate between similar wavelengths. We trained moths to associate specific monochromatic lights with a reward. Wavelength selection was based on the moth’s photoreceptors peaks and overlapping areas, determined in the chapter three. Once a monochromatic light was associated with a reward, moths were tested in a dual choice experiment, in which the rewarding wavelength was presented together with an unrewarding wavelength, initially 20 nm longer or shorter than the trained wavelength. Besides two expected pronounced minima (where photoreceptors overlap), M. stelattarum presented a third minimum between the peak of blue receptor and the inflexion curve of the green receptor. We used a colour vision model to predict the discrimination capabilities of the moth and to compare it with the behavioural data. Moth´s behavioural minima were similar to those predicted by the colour vision model, but the model did not predict a third less pronounced minimum of discrimination found during the behavioural tests. Minima of wavelength discrimination in M. stellatarum were smaller than those found for the honeybees (Apis mellifera), approaching values found for a tetrachromatic butterfly (Papilio xuthus). In that chapter, we discuss the differences in the discrimination capacity of those floral visitors tested so far, while integrating new perspectives for this type of experiments: the use of achromatic information. The sensory capacity of floral visitors has helped to shape and increase the variability of the flower signals. However, for many floral visitors, the sensorial system capacity and also its limits are not well understood, and for many others, it remains largely unexplored. It results difficult to interpret the behaviour of a floral visitor within a plant community if we do not properly understand the mechanisms modulating this relationship. The results of the present thesis raise the understanding of the visual systems of two important pollinator species in Europe, the bumblebee (Bombus terrestris) and the diurnal <b>hummingbird</b> <b>hawkmoth</b> (Macroglossum stellatarum). For years, experiments using the honeybee helped to build an understanding of insect vision, but similar information for the vast majority of floral visitors remains unknown. The present thesis shows that the visual capacity of each species is unique. The evolutionary processes that have shaped the sensory ability of floral visitors are unclear, but the importance of behavioural studies in the plant-pollinator context is essential, not only because of the economic value of the pollination service, but also to properly understand the mechanisms linking the plant-pollinator relationship.
