5|$|As Emma {{arrives at}} Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she {{is given a}} key to her room by the elderly {{proprietor}} (Beverley Elliot), who is actually Granny from Little Red Riding Hood. She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby (Meghan Ory), her granddaughter, followed {{by a man who}} came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), Rumpelstiltskin who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if he <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her.

500|$|Like {{all other}} WrestleMania events, WrestleMania III was {{promoted}} {{for several months}} in advance. The main feud stemmed from André the Giant's heel turn and betrayal of his friend, the WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, which began on an episode of Piper's Pit when WWF President Jack Tunney presented Hogan with a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three years, and André, his good friend, came out to congratulate him but cryptically remarked [...] "Three years to be a champion, its a long time". A week later on another episode of Piper's Pit, Tunney presented André with a visibly smaller trophy for being [...] "undefeated in the WWF for 15 years" [...] and Hogan came out to congratulate André, but before The Giant could speak, Hogan ended up being {{the focal point of}} the interview. Annoyed by this, André walked out during Hogan's congratulation speech. A week later on yet another Piper's Pit segment, Jesse Ventura hinted he <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> Andre but wasn’t telling. This infuriated Piper and the two nearly came to blows before Jesse challenged that he could produce André next week, asking Piper “can you produce Hogan?” Piper agreed and nervously asked Hogan later on who agreed. The following week Hogan was on Pipers Pit first when Andre walked out with Bobby [...] "The Brain" [...] Heenan, a long-time adversary of Hogan and André, He announced himself to be André's new manager. André then challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III and attacked Hogan, ripping off Hogan's T-shirt and crucifix necklace.|$|E
2500|$|James Larkin left Ireland for America in October 1914, {{leaving the}} Citizen Army {{under the command}} of James Connolly. [...] Whereas during the Lockout, the ICA had been a workers' {{self-defence}} militia, Connolly conceived of it as a revolutionary organisation – dedicated to the creation of an Irish socialist republic. [...] He had served in the British army in his youth and <b>knew</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> military tactics and discipline. [...] Other active members in the early days included, the Secretary to the Council, the playwright Seán O'Casey, who tried to have Constance Markievicz expelled for her close associations with the volunteers, which he considered as being [...] "inimical" [...] to the ICA's best interests. Francis Sheehy-Skeffington and O'Casey left the ICA when it became apparent that Connolly had started gravitating towards the radical nationalist group, the Irish Republican Brotherhood. [...] The ICA was grossly under-funded. [...] John Devoy, the prominent Irish-American member of IRB Fenians, believed the existence of [...] "a land army on irish soil" [...] was the most important sign since the founding of the Gaelic League. James Connolly, a convinced Marxist socialist and Irish Republican, believed that achieving political change through physical force, {{in the tradition of the}} Fenians, was legitimate. [...] The ICA was the victim of small numbers, fitful discipline, that shrank to only 200-300 persons.|$|E
