25|$|The Archangel Gabriel. When {{he finally}} appears <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> a lily {{in his left}} hand and is raising the other hand.|$|E
60|$|BOYLAN: (Holding up four thick bluntungulated fingers, winks) Blazes Kate! Up {{to sample}} or your money back. (<b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> a forefinger) Smell that.|$|E
6000|$|... "As a {{relation}} of yours, Colonel," [...] says the individual addressed as captain, [...] "the gentleman is welcome," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> a hand accordingly.|$|E
6000|$|... "You know me, then, you man-of-the-woods," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> {{his hand}} in the white trader fashion which the other had taught him.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{will the}} {{minister}} be there?" [...] asked Pearl. [...] "And will <b>he</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> {{both his hands}} to me, as when thou ledst me {{to him from the}} brook-side?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'These are coins of Charles the First,' said <b>he,</b> <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> the few {{which had}} been in the box; 'you see we were right in fixing our date for the Ritual.' ...|$|R
6000|$|BLOOM: Thank you, sir. I will, sir. May I bring two men chums {{to witness}} the deed and take a snapshot? (<b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> an {{ointment}} jar) Vaseline, sir? Orangeflower...? Lukewarm water...? ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Holding the {{footstool}} as a tray, he minces {{across the}} room like an accomplished footman. The gods favour him, for just here LADY MARY enters, and <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> the footstool to her.) ...|$|E
6000|$|Little Miles runs towards them. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> {{a little}} hand. [...] "Oh, Harry! No! which is Harry? You're my Harry," [...] and he chooses rightly this time. [...] "Oh, you dear Harry! I'm {{so glad you}} are come! and they've been abusing you so!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{is the old}} man," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> a heap {{of white}} hair. [...] "Here he is,--wig, whiskers, eyebrows, and all. I thought my {{disguise}} was pretty good, but I hardly expected that it would stand that test." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> advanced, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> his hand; but his restless eyes wandered unsteadily, {{looking away}} from me towards the screen.|$|R
6000|$|... "Excuse my rising," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> a left hand, for {{the right}} was busy. [...] "A single jar will give me ten minutes' work to do again. I am delighted to meet you: Mellot has often spoken to me of you {{as a man who}} has seen more, and faced death more carelessly, than most men." ...|$|R
6000|$|Steady {{and long}} he struggles, [...] He is baffled, bang'd, bruis'd, <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> while his {{strength}} [...] holds out, [...] The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away, [...] they roll him, swing him, turn him, [...] His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is [...] continually bruis'd on rocks, [...] Swiftly and ought of sight is borne the brave corpse.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{now they}} have {{let me come back}} to my Jock, and I see visibly his improvement. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> his hand, and he smiles, and he speaks now and then, the dreadful oppression is gone, and all the {{dangerous}} symptoms are abating, and I cannot tell how happy and thankful we are. 'Send my love, and tell Sydney she has a blessed Monk,' he says, as he wakes, and sees me writing.|$|E
6000|$|... ----called to-day {{in great}} despair about his mistress, {{who has taken}} a freak of----. He began a letter to her, but was obliged to stop short--I {{finished}} it for him, and he copied and sent it. If <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out,</b> and keeps to my instructions of affected indifference, she will lower her colours. If she don't, he will, at least, get rid of her, and she don't seem much worth keeping. But the poor lad is in love--if that is the case, she will win. When they once discover their power, finita Ã¨ la musica.|$|E
6000|$|What comfort {{could he}} give her, what hope could <b>he</b> <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> that the twist, now gnarled and knotted, might be removed, {{that she might}} gain peace of soul and body and the [...] "happiness" [...] {{of which he had}} talked with Alison Parr?... He raised his eyes, to {{discover}} that the woman's were fixed upon him, questioningly.|$|R
60|$|If it was <b>he</b> could <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> for a year, for {{a couple}} of years even, before he got a Crib.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hendry," [...] <b>he</b> pleaded, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> {{his arms}} pathetically, [...] "tak' back these words. Oh, man, have pity, and tak' them back!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Most men," [...] {{continued}} Mr Shirley, [...] "enjoy {{themselves at}} first, {{when they go}} to wild countries in search of adventure, but they generally regret the loss of their best years afterwards. In my opinion men should never emigrate unless they purpose making the foreign land they go to their home. But I won't oppose you, if you are determined to go; I will do all I can to help you, and give you my blessing; but before you make up your mind, I would recommend you to call on Mr Moxton, and hear what prospects <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> to you. Then take a week to think seriously over it; and if {{at the end of that}} time, you are as anxious to go as ever, I'll not stand in your way." ...|$|E
60|$|On New Year's day, while Arthur and his knights {{are keeping}} the Yuletide feast at Camelot, a {{gigantic}} knight in green enters the banquet hall on horseback and challenges the bravest knight present to {{an exchange of}} blows; that is, he will expose his neck to a blow of his own big battle-ax, if any knight will agree to abide a blow in return. After some natural consternation and a fine speech by Arthur, Gawain accepts the challenge, takes the battle-ax, and with one blow sends the giant's head rolling through the hall. The Green Knight, who is evidently a terrible magician, picks up his head and mounts his horse. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> his head and the ghastly lips speak, warning Gawain {{to be faithful to}} his promise and to seek through the world till he finds the Green Chapel. There, on next New Year's day, the Green Knight will meet him and return the blow.|$|E
60|$|The poor unhappy tradesman, having long laboured in the fire, {{and finding}} {{it is in}} vain to struggle, but that whether he strives or not strives, he must break; that he does but go {{backward}} more and more, and that the longer <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out,</b> he shall have the less to offer, and be the harder thought of, {{as well as the}} harder dealt with--resolves to call his creditors together in time, while there is something considerable to offer them, and while he may have some just account to give of himself, and of his conduct, and that he may not be reproached with having lived on the spoil, and consumed their estates; and thus, being satisfied that the longer he puts the evil day from him, the heavier it will fall when it comes; I say, he resolves to go no farther, and so gets a friend to discourse with and prepare them, and then draws up a state of his case to lay before them.|$|E
6000|$|... "How are you, Mr. Bosinney?" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> his hand. [...] "You've been {{spending}} money pretty freely down here, I should say!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How are you?" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> his hand. The young Indian took it {{and responded}} to the shake, but he shook his head.|$|R
60|$|He turned. There {{stood the}} man's great bulk, the {{moonlight}} beating down upon that round fat face of his, and <b>he</b> was <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... [A sputter of snow {{is blown}} in his face. A voice says: [...] "Monsieur, pardon!" [...] WELLWYN recoils spasmodically. A figure [...] {{moves from the}} lamp-post to the doorway. He is seen to be young [...] and to have ragged clothes. He speaks again: [...] "You do not [...] {{remember}} me, Monsieur? My name is Ferrand--it was in Paris, in [...] the Champs-Elysees--by the fountain [...] . When you came to [...] the door, Monsieur--I am not made of iron [...] . Tenez, [...] here is your card I have never lost it." [...] <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> to WELLWYN [...] an old and dirty wing card. As inch by inch he has advanced [...] into the doorway, the light from within falls on him, a tall [...] gaunt young pagan with fair hair and reddish golden stubble of [...] beard, a long ironical nose a little to one side, and large, [...] grey, rather prominent eyes. There is a certain grace in his [...] figure and movements; his clothes are nearly dropping off him.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The kid {{thought for}} a minute. 'I guess I made a mistake,' he says. 'I ought to have gone farther west. They find 'em wild {{out there in the}} canyons.' <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> his hand to John Tom, the little rascal. 'Please excuse me, sir,' says he, 'for {{shooting}} at you. I hope it didn't hurt you. But you ought to be more careful. When a scout sees a Indian in his war-dress, his rifle must speak.' Little Bear give a big laugh with a whoop at the end of it, and swings the kid ten feet high and sets him on his shoulder, and the runaway fingers the fringe and the eagle feathers and is full of the joy the white man knows when he dangles his heels against an inferior race. It is plain that Little Bear and that kid are chums from that on. The little renegade has already smoked the pipe of peace with the savage; and you can see in his eye that he is figuring on a tomahawk and a pair of moccasins, children's size.|$|E
6000|$|CHARTERIS (turning to Craven and {{preparing}} {{to read the}} letter). Now for Julia. (The Colonel turns away to hide his face from Charteris, anticipating a shock, and {{puts his hand on}} a chair to steady himself.) [...] "My dearest boy. Nothing will make me believe that this odious woman can take my place in your heart. I send some of the letters you wrote me when we first met; and I ask you to read them. They will recall what you felt when you wrote them. You cannot have changed so much as to be indifferent to me: whoever may have struck your fancy for the moment, your heart is still mine"--and so on: you know the sort of thing--"Ever and always your loving Julia." [...] (The Colonel sinks on the chair and covers his face with his hand.) You don't suppose she's serious, do you: that's the sort of thing she writes me three times a day. (To Cuthbertson) Grace is in earnest though, confound it. (<b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> Grace's letter.) A blue card as usual! This time I shall not trust the waste paper basket. (He goes to the fire, and throws the letters into it.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seemed as}} {{glad to be}} rid of me as I {{to be rid of}} him. 'Oh, must yer,' <b>he</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> his hand. 'Well, so long.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You shall go, Sam," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> {{his hand}} to his {{attached}} follower. [...] "As you say, you can't go with me, but you shall go somehow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{delighted to}} meet you, Mr. Waddington!" [...] <b>he</b> declared, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> his hand. [...] "Indirectly, you are {{connected}} {{with one of}} the most marvelous discoveries of modern days." ...|$|R
60|$|This is {{the toxic}} {{property}} of all Thackeray's writing. He is himself forever dominated in imagination by the world, and even while {{he tells you}} it is not worth while he makes you {{feel that it is}} worth while. It is not the honest man, but the man of honor, who shines in his page; his meek folk are proudly meek, and there is a touch of superiority, a glint of mundane splendor, in his lowliest. He rails at the order of things, but he imagines nothing different, even when he shows that its baseness, and cruelty, and hypocrisy are well-nigh inevitable, and, for most of those who wish to get on in it, quite inevitable. He has a good word for the virtues, he patronizes the Christian graces, he pats humble merit on the head; he has even explosions of indignation against the insolence and pride of birth, and purse-pride. But, after all, he is of the world, worldly, and the highest hope <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> is that you may be in the world and despise its ambitions while you compass its ends.|$|E
6000|$|... "Apropos of the Doctor of the Sorbonne [uninteresting Peyrau] {{with whom}} he daily disputed, the King said to me once, 'Get me a Bishopric for him.' 'I don't think,' {{answered}} I, (that my recommendation, or that of your Majesty, could be useful to him with us.' 'Ah, truly no!' said the King: 'Well, I will write to the Czarina of Russia for this poor devil; he does begin to bore me. <b>He</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> as Jansenist, forsooth. MON DIEU, what blockheads the present Jansenists are! But France should not have extinguished that nursery (FOYER) of their genius, that Port Royal, extravagant as it was. Indeed, one ought to destroy nothing! Why have they destroyed, too, the Depositaries of the graces of Rome and of Athens, those excellent Professors of the Humanities, and perhaps of Humanity, the Ex-Jesuit Fathers? Education will be the loser by it. But as my Brothers the Kings, most Catholic, most Christian, most Faithful and Apostolic, have tumbled them out, I, most Heretical, pick up as many as I can; and perhaps, one day, I shall be courted {{for the sake of}} them by those who want some. I preserve the breed: I said, counting my stock the other day, [...] "A Rector like you, my Father, I could easily sell for 300 thalers; you, Reverend Father Provincial, for 600; and so the rest, in proportion." [...] When one is not rich, one makes speculations.' ...|$|E
60|$|There has {{not been}} in this century any foreign peace or war, in its origin the fruit of popular desire, except the war that was made with Spain in 1739. Sir Robert Walpole was forced into the war by the people, who were {{inflamed}} to this measure by the most leading politicians, by the first orators, and the greatest poets of the time. For that war Pope sang his dying notes. For that war Johnson, in more energetic strains, employed the voice of his early genius. For that war Glover distinguished himself {{in the way in}} which his muse was the most natural and happy. The crowd readily followed the politicians in the cry for a war which threatened little bloodshed, and which promised victories that were attended with something more solid than glory. A war with Spain was a war of plunder. In the present conflict with Regicide, Mr. Pitt has not hitherto had, nor will perhaps for a few days have, many prizes to hold out in the lottery of war, to tempt the lower part of our character. He can only maintain it by an appeal to the higher; and to those in whom that higher part is the most predominant he must look the most for his support. Whilst <b>he</b> <b>holds</b> <b>out</b> no inducements to the wise nor bribes to the avaricious, he may be forced by a vulgar cry into a peace ten times more ruinous than the most disastrous war. The weaker he is in the fund of motives which apply to our avarice, to our laziness, and to our lassitude, if he means to carry the war to any end at all, the stronger he ought to be in his addresses to our magnanimity and to our reason.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little godchild," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> {{his hand}} as Anne made her obeisance, [...] "the Queen tells me you can read well. I have a fancy to hear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>he</b> can <b>hold</b> <b>out</b> {{a little}} longer, help may reach him," [...] muttered Leonard. Then without more words, he laid himself and Juanna face {{downwards}} {{on the broad}} stone.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, sir," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>holding</b> <b>out</b> the letter; [...] "there is {{the chief}} witness against you. Captain Peters {{instantly}} recognized your handwriting, as Mr. Middleton had done before him." ...|$|R
