5|$|The line <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{positioned}} {{on the end}} of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. He notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when two minutes remain in the half. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E

Robert is warned by his predecessor (Brolin) and several influential politicians that the War on Drugs is unwinnable. Robert's daughter, Caroline (Christensen), an honors student, has been using cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin which quickly develops into a drug addiction after her boyfriend Seth (Grace) introduces her to freebasing. Caroline, Seth, and Vanessa are all arrested when a fellow student overdoses on drugs, and they try to dump him anonymously at a hospital.

5|$|Nevertheless, {{because the}} <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{empowered}} to disregard previous judgments (either his own or of other judges) and can apply his personal interpretation of Sharia {{to any particular}} case through ijtihad, divergent judgements arise even in apparently identical cases. There is a presumption against overturning a decision when {{it is based on}} ijtihad. This principle is crucial in two respects. Firstly, it concentrates the substance of the law in the hands of judges as, in consequence, there is a presumption that only a judge exercising ijtihad, rather than a king or a parliament, can determine God's law. Secondly, it renders a judge's decision practically immune to reversal on appeal. The role of ijtihad has led to calls for the Sharia to be codified to give clarity and remove uncertainty. As a result, in 2010, the Minister of Justice announced plans to implement a codification of Sharia law, although resistance from the religious establishment is reportedly delaying its implementation.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} <b>judge</b> <b>is</b> {{empowered to}} exempt {{from being an}} illegal practice any particular act or omission by a candidate, his or her election agents or any other agent or person in paying a sum, incurring an expense or entering into a contract if {{it was done in}} good faith and was due to inadvertence, accidental miscalculation or the like. Similarly, the judge may make an order allowing an authorized excuse for a failure to file a proper return or declaration relating to election expenses if the candidate or his or her principal election agent shows that he or she acted in good faith {{and that there is a}} reasonable explanation for the shortcoming such as inadvertence or illness, or the absence, death, illness or misconduct of some other agent, clerk or officer. In particular, the judge may relieve a candidate from the consequences of an act or omission by his or her principal election agent if he or she did not sanction or connive in it and took all reasonable means to prevent it.|$|E

5000|$|Criticisms of the {{doctrine}} continue as in the past. Critics argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> making determinations of policy and morality that properly belong with legislators (i.e. [...] "legislating from the bench"), or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> reading views into the Constitution that are not really implied by the document, or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> claiming power to expand the liberty of some people {{at the expense of}} other people's liberty (e.g. as in the Dred Scott case), or argue that <b>judges</b> <b>are</b> addressing substance instead of process.|$|R
