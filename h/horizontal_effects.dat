40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the ‘horizontal effect’ of European {{fundamental}} rights in the jurisprudence of the CJEU. It explores how the Court appies these rights in adjudicating litigations between private parties. It addresses three questions: (1) how the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of fundamental rights operates, (2) which policy goals it serves, and (3) whether this use of fundamental rights is legitimate and desirable. The first section of this paper explains how the terms ‘European fundamental rights’ and ‘private law’ are used throughout the text, and outlines the difference between vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect.</b> The second section outlines the difference between direct and indirect <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of fundamental rights. In its third section, this paper takes position in favour of a normative individualistic understanding of fundamental rights. The fourth section makes some examples of direct horizontal application and the fifth section some examples of indirect horizontal application of fundamental rights in the CJEU jurisprudence. The sixth section analyses the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of the Charter. Here, this paper proposes a new doctrine: the ‘double indirect horizontal effect’ of fundamental rights. This doctrine helps explain the impact of fundamental rights on private relationships in the European multi-level system of court adjudication. It also encourages the Court of Justice to develop its jurisprudence towards a better consideration of the non-economic human interests protected by European fundamental rights. The subsequent sections identify the policies related to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of fundamental rights at the EU level (seventh section). The eighth section addresses the question whether the pursuit of these policies through court adjudication constitutes a legitimate use or an illegitimate instrumentalization of fundamental rights. It assesses {{the extent to which}} both the above-mentioned national and European patterns of <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> correspond to the normative individualistic perspective outlined in the fourth section.

This is true even when the spatial location is irrelevant for {{the choice of the}} correct response (Simon effect). The results are usually ascribed to spatial sensorimotor coupling.

We asked our participants to make saccades towards one of the two saccade targets depending on the color of the centrally presented spatial word, while ignoring their spatial meaning (Experiment 1 and 2 a). Results are compared to a condition in which finger responses instead of saccades were required (Experiment 2 b).

40|$|This article {{explores the}} justice {{dimensions}} {{of the relationship between}} the Charter of Fundamental Rights and private law. It reaches three main conclusions. First, a partisan interpretation of the Charter and its <b>horizontal</b> <b>effects</b> in terms of controversial values would be difficult to match with the reasonable pluralism of worldviews characterizing the European Union (EU). Instead, the interpretation of fundamental rights should be guided by the demands of a political conception of justice that is acceptable to people adhering to divergent understandings of individual and common good. Secondly, courts and other interpreters of the Charter must distinguish between fundamental rights, freedoms, and principles in accordance with their respective moral content and cogency. The generic and hyper-positivistic reference to the ‘constitutional’ or ‘primary EU law’ status of the entire Charter is far too crude. In particular, human rights, which every person equally has by virtue of his or her humanity, should have much stronger force than merely instrumental freedoms and principles. Thirdly, the facts of the reasonable pluralism of worldviews and of the indeterminacy of the Charter and its <b>horizontal</b> <b>effects</b> together call for judicial restraint. Because the fundamental rights, as formulated in the Charter, strongly underdetermine private law rules and outcomes of civil disputes, courts should, in principle, be deferential in cases where the reasons and interests raised by a constitutional right claim have already been adequately addressed in a robust democratic process. From the perspective of justice in each of these dimensions, the Court of Justice probably has been too partisan and activist in some recent private law cases, such as Alemo-Herron...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes and investigates {{a debate}} about differences in the visual system’s anisotropic sensitivity to orientation as well as where and how the brain encodes visual orientation information. Three different visual perceptual patterns are discussed: the Class 1 and 2 oblique <b>effects</b> and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect.</b> The oblique effect {{is the ability to}} perceive cardinal orientations more easily than oblique orientations, and is found using narrowband stimuli. In the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect,</b> oblique orientations are perceived most easily, horizontal orientations are perceived worst, and vertical orientations fall in-between, and is found using broadband stimuli. While the majority of authors refer to the oblique effect as a whole, there is a case that it can be divided into Class 1 and Class 2 depending on what the task is measuring: low-level properties of the visual system or higher-level categorization and memory tasks. Moreover, when determining which reference frame the visual system uses to define the oblique effect, there is a disagreement as to whether it is the retinal or gravitational reference frame. To add evidence that there are two classes of the oblique effect and that they are defined by different reference frames (hence the disagreement), retinal, gravitational, and patterncentric coordinates were put in conflict with one another. The effects of phenomenological coordinates were also tested to determine whether top-down cognition played a role in either the Class 1 or Class 2 effect. That the Class 1 oblique effect remained defined by retinal coordinates no matter the test. The Class 2 oblique effect was defined by gravitational coordinates during head tilt with no available patterncentric information. However, when patterncentric coordinates were available the Class 2 effect pattern was defined by these coordinates. Phenomenological coordinates seemed to make no difference to either effect. These results add to current evidence that the oblique effect should be separated into two classes: Class 1, which shows the low-level orientation characteristics of the visual system and is defined by retinal coordinates, and Class 2, which is defined by patterncentric coordinates, and gravitational coordinates when there is no patterncentric input. There have been no studies to date to address the coordinates used by the visual system to define the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect.</b> The <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> is thought to be important for scene information, so the hypothesis was that it would follow patterncentric coordinates. Again, I tested retinal, gravitational, patterncentric, and phenomenological reference frames. During head tilt (no patterncentric information available), the standard <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> did not remain tied to gravitational coordinates, nor did it transfer completely to retinal coordinates. The pattern did change completely with patterncentric coordinates during scene tilt, indicating that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> is important for scene information. However, during scene tilt alone, retinal and patterncentric coordinates are aligned. During the head and scene tilt condition, when patterncentric and retinal coordinates are in competition, there was also incomplete transfer. Phenomenological changes seemed to have no effect. This suggests that the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> likely receives input from cortical areas where some cells update their receptive fields when vestibular information changes, but some do not, such as V 2 or V 3...|$|R

Recently, we have shown that with broadband stimuli (either 1 /fα visual noise or natural scenes), performance for detecting oriented content is worst at horizontal, best at the obliques, and intermediate at vertical orientations (a “horizontal effect”). This <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> has been explained by a cortical contrast normalization model that is both local (over orientation and spatial frequency) and anisotropic (due to a numerical bias of neurons with different preferred orientations). Here, the bandwidth of content at which an oblique <b>effect</b> or <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> occurs was assessed in two suprathreshold matching experiments conducted with 1 /fα noise stimuli filtered with a triangle increment function of varied bandwidth (16 levels of orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth).

40|$|Summary: The {{judgments}} in Viking and Laval {{confirm the}} Court’s {{previous case law}} on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of Articles 39, 43 and 49 EC, and extend the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of Articles 43 and 49 EC to cover collective action of trade unions by way of strikes, boycotts and the like. A significant knock-on effect {{is an extension of}} Community regulatory competence to cover this same subject matter, despite the contrary indications in Article 137 (5) EC. The judgment in Viking implies that Article 28 EC is also capable of <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect,</b> at least in cases where collective action of individuals produces regulatory effects similar to those resulting from State action. The Court’s reasoning leaves room for future incremental increases in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of fundamental freedoms in cases which involve contractual rules, in particular rules regulating employed or self employed activities. The approach to <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> in Viking supports, for example, the argument that provisions of a corporate constitution could amount to a restriction on freedom of establishment, as could action taken by the board of a company to frustrate a takeover bid. Advocate General Maduro in Viking argues that the Treaty rules on freedom of movement apply directly to any private action that is capable of effectively restricting others from exercising their right of freedom of movement. The present writer suggests further considerations as being relevant to determining the extent of the horizontal reach of fundamental freedoms. Normal market behaviour on the part of one market operator should not in principle be held to amount to a restriction on the fundamental freedom of another. But discriminatory conduct by market operators, or other conduct which falls outside the range of normal market behaviour, would seem capable of falling within the <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of a fundamental freedom, at any rate where it restricts access of other market operators, or consumers, to the market, or places market operators or consumers at a disadvantage because they have exercised a fundamental freedom. Account must be taken of the aims and wording of the freedom in question, along with the policy questions of whether it would be excessively burdensome to make private operators subject to the obligation to comply with the fundamental freedom in question, and whether any consequential extension of Community regulatory competence would unreasonably limit that of the Member States. A related issue {{to be taken into account}} is the possible <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> of the fundamental principle of equality, as articulated in the Mangold case. Even a restrained reading of this much criticised case would suggest that the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality in Article 12 EC might have <b>horizontal</b> <b>effect</b> in circumstances falling within the scope of Community law, such as the supply of goods, services, business accommodation and housing. A similar conclusion could be reached as regards discrimination in the sale of goods, services and real property to non residents. It would not be excessively burdensome to impose on private market operators the obligation not to depart from their normal terms and conditions of sale in the case of non-nationals or non-residents, unless such departure represented normal market behaviour. A possible example of discriminatory service provision contrary to the general principle of equality is that of excessive ‘roaming’ charges, which have been recently regulated by Regulation (EC) No 717 / 2007. A key question which arises in this context is the extent to which a market operator can, or should be able to be, justify discrimination against out of state operators, or discrimination against customers solely because they have crossed a national frontier, on grounds of normal market behaviour, when market conditions are not normal, and the market is not fully competitive...|$|R
