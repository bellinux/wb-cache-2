40|$|Palm oil {{industry}} currently {{has been seen}} as an important role in Malaysia’s economy. However, it also driving towards increasing of waste such as empty fruit bunch, mesocarp <b>fibre,</b> <b>palm</b> oil mill effluent (POME), and palm oil fly ash (POFA). POFA is identified as a material that shows good potential to be used as filler in asphalt mixture. Intensive literature showed that most of research primarily used POFA in concrete material, and limited in pavement material. Therefore, in this study, the potential of POFA in asphalt concrete was evaluated as an alternative initiative to promote waste recycling in road construction industry. POFA was incorporated as filler (material passing 75 m) into a mixture design ACW 20 with varied amount - (0, 3, 5, 7 and 10 % by weight of total aggregate) and bitumen content 5. 1 %± 0. 5. The specific gravity properties of each amount of POFA were assessed to be used during Marshall volumetric properties. These materials then were analyzed using Marshall stability and resilient modulus. A correlation derived as the specific gravity decreased, the Marshall stability decreased and resilient modulus increased compared to conventional asphalt mixes. Based on the results also, the appropriate amount of POFA found as 3 % with the optimum asphalt content 5. 1 %. The laboratory results showed that the resilient modulus of asphalt mixture was improved with the certain amount of POFA and indicated that POFA have the good potential as alternative filler material in asphalt mix...|$|E

This study presents an experimental investigation on pure porous from Date <b>Palm</b> <b>Fibre</b> (DPF). The effectiveness of sound absorbers depends on structural architecture of this material. This study was conducted to examine the potential of using date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> as sound absorber. The effects of porous layer thicknesses, densities and compression on Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC) of sound absorber using date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> were studied. Approach: Rigid frame Johnson-Allard Model for various sample thicknesses was used in this study. The measurements were conducted in impedance tube on normal incidence acoustic absorption. The date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> was mixed with latex which used for physical treatment on this material. Acoustic absorption behaviour of a porous material with different thicknesses was studied as well as samples with same thickness but different densities. In addition, samples with same properties but different period of compression time were inspected. The tests were in accordance to ISO 10534 - 2 and ASTM E 1050 - 98 international standards for Acoustic Absorption Coefficient (AAC). Results: The experimental data indicates that two peak values of AAC is 0. 93 at 1356 Hz for sample with 50 mm thickness, also the AAC at high frequency for same thickness is 0. 99 at 4200 - 4353 Hz that means able to improve acoustic absorption coefficient at low and high frequencies with significant increasing. Meanwhile, another experimental results were acquired for AAC of date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre,</b> with samples thicknesses of 35 mm at different densities. The results show that denser sample (11 Kg m - 3) has higher AAC value of 0. 83 at 1934 - 2250 Hz as compared to less dense sample (9. 92 Kg m - 3) with AAC value 0. 84 at 2443 - 2587 Hz. Conclusion: Acoustic absorption coefficient AAC of date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> was increased at all frequencies when the thickness of sample was increased, particularly at low frequencies less than 1200 Hz.

The date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> reinforced composites (CD 00) were prepared by maintaining constant weight% of fibre of 20 wt% without any fibre treatment. Maleic anhydride (MA) {{was used as the}} compatabilizer (1 and 2 wt%) and the effect of compatabilizer on the blend matrix composites was studied. The mechanical, thermal, morphological properties, water absorption and chemical resistance properties were evaluated for these composites and also studied for pure blend matrix (C 00). Date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> improved the tensile strength and hardness of recycled polymer blend matrix. Further improvement was achieved with 1 % MA (CD 1), which showed that 1 % MA treated composites (CD 1) had higher tensile strength, modulus and hardness properties. Thermal stability and water absorption were improved by 1 % MA. These improvements were demonstrated at the nanoscale level by the decrease in roughness appearing in Atomic Force Spectroscopic Microscopy analysis indicating that flow is better under this concentration. The SEM analysis also showed that the fibre matrix adhesion improved by adding 1 wt% (CD 1) of MA. The melting and crystallisation temperatures of the blends did not change with the addition of date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> and MA, indicating that the additives did not influence the melting and crystallisation properties of the composites. The chemical resistance test results showed that these composites are resistance to all chemicals but more weight gain observed in solvents. 2 wt% of MA (CD 2) caused poor adhesion between the polymer chains and fibres as well as polymer chain scission...|$|R

Smaller local industries include leatherworking, metalworking, and the widespread production of baskets, mats, and sandals from <b>palm</b> <b>fibre.</b> Also important was the gold mined in the Red Sea Hills {{to the east of}} Makuria.|$|R
40|$|<b>Palm</b> <b>fibre</b> is a {{waste product}} from the fruit crushing-extracting process in local communities. This study {{examined}} the characteristics of natural dyed palm yarns and fabrics produced from treated <b>palm</b> <b>fibres.</b> The results showed that fibre characteristics were improved by anaerobic fermentation, and following crushing and carding, were 3 - 5 times smaller, softer and more pliable. In the production of palm/cotton yarns of No. 7 (50 / 50), No. 10 (40 / 60), No. 16 (30 / 70) and No. 10 (0 / 100), the 3 - 5 denier palm yarns and cotton yarns were spun in open-end spinning units. Regarding the physical properties, the blended yarns showed more unevenness and higher tensile strength and elongation at break than 100 % cotton yarn. However, {{it was found that}} the coarser yarns were lower in strength than the finer yarns. Fibre sorting by denier leads to a decrease in unevenness caused by thin and thick patches and neps. When dyed with natural dyes, the palm yarns were found highly fast to light, but only moderately fast to washing. Dark dye spots distributed on the <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> yarns formed a natural pattern structure in the woven textiles. The tested woven textiles from the weft palm yarns are lighter in weight and higher in tensile force and tear strength than their cotton counterparts. The results suggest tha...|$|R
40|$|Interfacial {{adhesion}} {{of natural}} fibres as reinforcement for fibre polymeric composites {{is the key}} parameter in designing composites. In the current study, interfacial adhesion of date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> with epoxy matrix is experimentally investigated using single fibre pull out technique. The influence of NaOH treatment concentrations (0 %- 9 %), fibre embedded length and fibre diameter on the interfacial adhesion property was considered in this study. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the surface morphology and damage feature on the fibre and bonding area before and after conducting the experiments. The results revealed that 6 % concentration of NaOH is the optimum solution for treating the date <b>palm</b> <b>fibre</b> to maintain high interfacial adhesion and strength with epoxy matrix. The embedded length of the fibre controlled the interfacial adhesion property, where 10 mm embedded length was the optimum fibre length. ...|$|R
