40|$|Adopted by the European Union in 2008, the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan) is the {{strategic}} framework {{to accelerate the}} development and deployment of cost-effective low carbon technologies for the period 2010 - 2020 in the perspective of market implementation by 2020 and 2050. Sustainable nuclear fission {{is one of the}} low carbon energy technologies prioritized by the SET-Plan. In 2011, the European Commission published a Materials Roadmap enabling Low Carbon Energy Technologies. The objective is to complement and expand the Technology Roadmaps developed {{in the context of the}} SET-Plan as the basis for its implementation. It puts forward key materials research and innovation activities to advance energy technologies for the next 10 years. It serves as a programmatic guide for research and development activities in the field of materials for energy applications for both the European Union's research and innovation program and Member State programs. The objective of this contribution is to summarize the materials roadmap prepared for nuclear fission technology. The road-mapping exercise has been conducted by taking into account the two established instruments for the SET-Plan implementation, namely the <b>European</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative,</b> EII (for nuclear fission it is the European Sustainable Nuclear Energy Industrial Initiative, ESNII) and the European Energy Research Alliance, EERA (for nuclear fission it is the Joint Program Nuclear Materials, JPNM) as well as the European Technology Platform (for nuclear fission it is the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform, SNETP).

40|$|The EU 7 th Framework ESNII+ {{project was}} {{launched}} in 2013 with the strategic orientation of preparing ESNII for Horizon 2020. ESNII stands for the <b>European</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative</b> on Nuclear Energy, created by the European Commission in 2010 to promote {{the development of a}} new generation of nuclear systems in order to provide a sustainable solution to cope with Europe’s growing energy needs while meeting the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. The designs selected by the ESNII+ project are technological demonstrators of Generation-IV systems. The prototype for the sodium cooled fast reactor technology is ASTRID (standing for Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration), which building phase is foreseen to be initiated in 2019. The ASTRID core has a peculiar design which was created in order to tackle the main neutronic challenge of sodium cooled fast reactors: the inherent overall positive reactivity feedback in case of sodium boiling occurring in the core. Indeed, the core is claimed by its designers to have an overall negative reactivity feedback in this scenario. This feature was demonstrated for an ASTRID-like core within the ESNII+ framework studies performed by nine European institutions. In order to shift the paradigm towards best-estimate plus uncertainties, the nuclear data sensitivity analysis and uncertainty propagation on reactivity coefficients has to be carried out. The goal of this work is to assess the impact of nuclear data uncertainties on sodium boiling reactivity feedback coefficients in order to get a more complete picture of the actual safety margins of the ASTRID low void-core design. The nuclear data sensitivity analysis is performed in parallel using SCALE-TSUNAMI 3 D and the newly developed GPT SERPENT 2 module. A comparison is carried out between both methodologies. Uncertainty on the sodium boiling reactivity feedbacks is then calculated using TSAR module of SCALE and the necessary safety margins conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|The {{present report}} {{estimates}} the current R&D investments in selected low-carbon energy technologies in the EU- 27 {{funded by the}} Member States, through the 6 th EU Research and Euratom Framework Programmes and by companies with headquarters registered in the EU. The technologies considered are those for which the EU's Strategic Energy Technology Plan proposes to launch <b>European</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiatives</b> or for which joint initiatives already exists: wind energy; photovoltaic and concentrating solar power; carbon dioxide capture and storage; smart grids; hydrogen and fuel cells; transport biofuels; nuclear fission and fusion. A novel approach has been developed to estimate corporate R&D investments by technology, combining available data with other publicly available information and with expert judgment. With regard to public R&D investments, information from existing databases (Eurostat and the IEA) has been complemented and improved through the direct contact with Member States. On this basis and despite some associated uncertainties, the current R&D efforts in Europe dedicated to SET-Plan priority technologies are approached and policy-relevant conclusions are derived. JRC.

40|$|This report {{responds}} to the request of Commissioner Oettinger and the Cabinet of Commissioner Geoghegan-Quinn end of 2012, for an expert assessment and recommendations regarding the financing of first-of-a-kind commercial demonstration projects as prioritised in the roadmaps of the Strategic Energy Technology (SET) Plan. The expert group comprised representatives of financial organisations, i. e. the European Investment Bank, the European Venture Capital Association, the European Insurance and Re-insurance federation, the World Bank, and the Climate Change Capital. Six hearings with key stakeholders representing the SET Plan <b>European</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiatives</b> (EIIs), {{as well as the}} Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking were held. These hearings provided information regarding their main barriers for implementation and the gaps as regards access to finance. Existing EU financial were evaluated too. The report concludes that a new financial instrument at EU level is not needed since existing financial instruments already provide equity, loans, or guarantees. However, until now, those instruments have not provided the financing required. As a response to this problem a set of changes to existing financial instruments and their utilisation were recommended. JRC. F. 6 -Energy systems evaluatio...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Europe is {{currently}} dependent on imports for 54 % {{of its energy}} demand. Dependency has grown from 45 % in 1990 due to declining domestic production of oil, gas and coal. The objective of the recent energy and climate change package of the Commission, including the proposal for the renewable energy directive, is to achieve the 2020 European policy objectives. The SET Plan and the <b>European</b> Solar <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative</b> aim at creating the necessary framework conditions to drive down the costs of PV technology and bring about a step change in its market take-up. The Framework Programme for Research (FP) and the Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) Programme of the EU help {{to ensure that the}} PV industry maintains and extends its leadership. One of the most important impacts has been the creation of know-how leading to start-up companies. For example, several European companies producing thin-film photovoltaics have their origins in EU funded projects. These programmes and the Solar <b>Industrial</b> <b>initiative</b> are important {{for the future of the}} European PV industry, because working at the EU level helps to achieve the critical mass of activities which is needed for the EU’s PV industries to grow fast enough and to compete effectively in today’s global PV markets. The 7 th Framework Programme and the second IEE Programme have both significantly increased budget compared to the previous programmes, and will run for seven years, from 2007 to 2013, with calls planned annually...|$|R
40|$|Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) {{has been}} {{identified}} as one of promising future reactor concepts in the technology roadmap of the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) {{as well as in the}} Deployment Strategy of the <b>European</b> Sustainable Nuclear <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ESNII), both aiming at improved sustainability, enhanced safety, economic competitiveness, and proliferation resistance. This new nuclear reactor concept requires the development of computational tools to be applied in design and safety assessments to confirm improved inherent and passive safety features of this design. One approach to this issue is to modify the current computational codes developed for the simulation of Light Water Reactors towards their applicability for the new designs. This paper reports on the performed modifications of the TRACE system code to make it applicable to LFR safety assessments. The capabilities of the modified code are demonstrated on series of benchmark exercises performed versus other safety analyses codes. JRC. F. 5 -Nuclear Reactor Safety Assessmen...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{efforts are}} being devoted {{in order to}} boost R&D on {{advanced}} nuclear reactors due to their sustainability and improved safety characteristics. The main drawbacks for the industrial deployment of a Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) are the lack of operational experience and the technological uncertainties. In order to measure the robustness of the design and improve the safety characteristics of the ALFRED reactor -the demonstration reactor of the European LFR technology- a detailed analysis is envisaged within the EU FP 7 ESNII+ project (project to support the <b>European</b> Sustainable <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative)</b> (ESNII+, 2013). One key research goal for ALFRED is the demonstration of favourable transient behaviour under accident conditions. Such behaviour depends primarily on the reactivity coefficients of the core. For evaluation of those coefficients, computational tools capable of providing results {{with a high level}} of accuracy are available. But the results will be affected by different sources of uncertainty, such as uncertainties on the engineering design, on the nuclear data, model uncertainties, etc. The objective of this work is to perform a sensitivity/uncertainty analysis of ALFRED reactor to assess the impact on the core reactivity of the uncertainties in nuclear data as well as the uncertainties in geometrical tolerances. This will allow having an exhaustive picture of their influence on the core performance, identifying key parameters and proposing specific R&D actions to achieve an improved safety level...|$|R
40|$|This {{special issue}} covers the {{significant}} activities and outputs of the European Commission funded Bioenergy Network of Excellence that has recently completed its six year programme of work. Networks of Excellence (NoE) {{were intended to}} address fragmentation of R&D in the European Research Area by integrating resources and expertise needed to enhance Europe’s global competitiveness in key areas. The Bioenergy NoE consortium consists of eight key bioenergy R&D institutes in Europe and covered the entire field of bioenergy. Within the project, the overall strategy to achieve integration followed a well defined process of firstly identifying barriers, then evaluating RTD goals for their removal, followed by a detailed examination of how integration could be realistically achieved and implemented in the longer term. This is described in the first paper by Sipilä and Wilén. The rest {{of the contents of}} this special issue are devoted to collaborative outputs of the various joint research activities undertaken during the project that cover biomass, conversion technology, and finally policy and education. Progress was influenced by a number of additional EU instruments launched during the project including the <b>European</b> <b>Industrial</b> Technology Platforms and ERA-NET Bioenergy. These led to the EIBI (<b>European</b> <b>Industrial</b> Bioenergy <b>Initiative)</b> and particularly EERA Bioenergy (European Energy Research Alliance – Bioenergy), which is very effectively continuing the work of Bioenergy NoE by establishing a framework for continued cooperation and collaboration. The project resulted in a high level of interaction and collaboration in European R&D which is being further developed and expanded within EERA Bioenergy. The value of Bioenergy NoE can thus be clearly seen in the exciting programme of research activities being developed in EERA Bioenergy.

An ASTRID-like core design has been analyzed (see other paper in this conference) and it was found to have a global negative reactivity feedback to sodium voiding. Taking into account the importance of feedback coefficients on core safety, the influence of the uncertainties in nuclear data should be assessed to have an exhaustive picture of the actual safety margins of ASTRID design. The objective of this work is to contribute to the improvement of the safety of ASTRID nuclear design by assessing different uncertainty propagation methodologies of the TSUNAMI- 3 D module of the SCALE system [1]. In this work, TSUNAMI- 3 D is applied to a pin-cell of the inner zone of the ASTRID core in order to select the optimal TSUNAMI- 3 D parameters.

40|$|With the aim {{to develop}} a joint {{proposal}} for a harmonised European methodology for safety assessment of advanced reactors with fast neutron spectrum, SARGEN_IV (Safety Assessment for Reactors of Gen IV) Euratom coordination action project gathered together 22 partners’ safety experts from 12 EU Member States. The group consisted of eight European Technical Safety Organisations involved in the European Technical Safety Organisation Network (ETSON), European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), system designers, industrial vendors as well as research & development (R&D) organisations. To support the methodology development, key safety features of four fast neutron spectrum reactor concepts considered in Deployment Strategy of the Sustainable Nuclear Energy Technology Platform (SNETP) were reviewed. In particular, outcomes from running <b>European</b> Sustainable Nuclear <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ESNII) system projects and related Euratom collaborative projects for Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors, Lead-cooled Fact Reactors, Gas-cooled Fast Reactors, and the lead-bismuth eutectic cooled Fast Spectrum Transmutation Experimental Facility were gathered and critically assessed.

Provided that structure and content of a SAR generally differ among States, the approach followed to provide recommendations and guidance was to remain as much as possible consistent in the format with the current practices for LWR while identifying those chapters whose subjects need to be adapted to the specific design. Due to the innovative nature of the design, it is recommended that parts of the SAR should be submitted to the regulatory body at an early stage and in accordance with an agreed timetable; this approach will permit a smoother review process and help prevent unnecessary delays.

40|$|The multigroup {{transport}} theory {{is the basis}} for many neutronics modules. A significant point of the cross-section (XS) generation procedure is the choice of the energy groups' boundaries in the XS libraries, which must be carefully selected as an unsuitable energy meshing can easily lead to inaccurate results. This decision can require considerable effort and is particularly difficult for the common user, especially if not well-versed in reactor physics. This work investigates a genetic algorithm-based tool which selects an appropriate XS energy structure (ES) specific for the considered problem, to be used for the condensation of a fine multigroup library. The procedure is accelerated by results storage and fitness calculation speed-up and can be easily parallelized. The extension is applied to the coupled code SIMMER and tested on the <b>European</b> Sustainable Nuclear <b>Industrial</b> <b>Initiative</b> (ESNII+) Advanced Sodium Technological Reactor for Industrial Demonstration (ASTRID) -like reactor system with different fitness functions. The results show that, when the libraries are condensed based on the ESs suggested by the algorithm, the code actually returns the correct multiplication factor, in both reference and voided conditions. The computational effort reduction obtained by using the condensed library rather than the fine one is assessed and is much higher than the time required for the ES search...|$|R

This review has also been used as a reference to provide guidelines on the structure and content of the Safety Analysis Report (SAR) for the innovative ESNII reactors. Structure and content of a SAR generally differ among countries. The approach followed to give recommendations and guidance was to adopt as far as possible the format of the current practices for LWR based on the US NRC Reg Guide 1. 70 together with IAEA publication GS-G- 4. 1 and to identify those chapters whose subjects need to be adapted to the specific design. Due to the innovative nature of the design, the licensing process for new ESNII concepts may take longer. The early involvement of regulators in defining safety objectives and criteria and acceptable solutions to meet these criteria may be beneficial to shorten this process. Therefore, it is recommended that parts of the SAR should be submitted to the regulatory body at an early stage and in accordance with an agreed timetable; this approach will permit a smoother review process and help preventing unnecessary delays...|$|R
