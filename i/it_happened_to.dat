5|$|Moore {{became known}} for his {{involvement}} in the variety of stunts and demonstrations of the show's contestants. The popularity of I've Got a Secret led to a cameo in the 1959 film <b>It</b> <b>Happened</b> <b>to</b> Jane.

5|$|In 1009 Symeon {{was sent}} into exile near Paloukiton, {{a small village}} near Chrysopolis on the Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus. According to one account, he was left by church {{authorities}} alone and without food, {{in the middle of}} winter. There he found a deserted and ruined chapel that had been dedicated to Saint Macrina. <b>It</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be on land owned by one of Symeon's spiritual children, Christopher Phagouras, who donated the land and proceeds to start a monastery.|$|E
5|$|The {{volume of}} space within which an object {{can be said}} to orbit Jupiter is defined by Jupiter's Hill sphere (also called the Roche sphere). When the comet passed Jupiter in the late 1960s or early 1970s, <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be near its aphelion, and found itself {{slightly}} within Jupiter's Hill sphere. Jupiter's gravity nudged the comet towards it. Because the comet's motion with respect to Jupiter was very small, it fell almost straight toward Jupiter, which is why it ended up on a Jupiter-centric orbit of very high eccentricitythat is to say, the ellipse was nearly flattened out.|$|E

5|$|One of {{his major}} prophetic sources was evidently the Mirabilis Liber of 1522, which {{contained}} a range of prophecies by Pseudo-Methodius, the Tiburtine Sibyl, Joachim of Fiore, Savonarola and others (his Preface contains 24 biblical quotations, all but two in the order used by Savonarola). This book had enjoyed considerable success in the 1520s, when it went through half a dozen editions, but did not sustain its influence, perhaps owing to its mostly Latin text, Gothic script and many difficult abbreviations. Nostradamus {{was one of the}} first to re-paraphrase these prophecies in French, which may explain why they are credited to him. It should be noted that modern views of plagiarism did not apply in the 16th century; authors frequently copied and paraphrased passages without acknowledgement, especially from the classics. The latest research suggests that he may in fact have used bibliomancy for this—randomly selecting a book of history or prophecy and taking his cue from whatever page <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> fall open at.|$|E
5|$|Kailua, now {{the capital}} of Owhyhee, was {{the seat of the}} {{government}} of the group after the conquests of the renowned Kamehameha I., who, it will be remembered, died here. It is situated within a wide bay, with a safe roadstead and good anchorage. It has a very few more inhabitants than some of the larger villages in the island, though much frequented by the natives living in the vicinity, on account of its being the centre of their civil and religious affairs. It has, however, four stone buildings and a fort. The buildings are, the residence of the governor; that of the parent of the missionaries, Mr. Thurston, whom we have had already occasion to name; and two places of worship. Immediately upon our arrival, we called to pay our respects to the governor, Kapeau, a native chief, who received us with good-humoured frankness, and ordered a room in the government-house to be prepared for our reception and residence; in order, as he said, that we might be as near to him as possible during our stay in the place. We were not long installed, before the hospitable chief came to pay us a visit, and, as <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be a bright moonlight night, he invited us to go at once in his company, to inspect the fort, which was in front of his residence, and which in passable English he called the right arm of his strength. We found it consist of a single battery commanding the bay, with twelve pieces of cannon of not very large calibre.|$|E

25|$|Starting from 1942, {{it became}} {{necessary}} to move {{some of the}} Caproni Museum's aircraft away from Milan {{to prevent them from}} being damaged or destroyed by Allied bombing. In spite of the precautions that were taken, however, some aircraft were destroyed (this {{was the case with the}} only existing Ca.42, which was destroyed in a fire) or lost (as <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the C.N.A. Eta and to the parts of the Macchi-Nieuport 29 and Roland VIb). Nonetheless, most of the museum's holdings, including not only the aircraft but also the library and the archives, survived the war.|$|E
25|$|In 1862 King {{became an}} {{assistant}} to Alexander Dickson. This led to an interest in cryptogamic botany and was advised by Sir W.J. Hooker to follow the path of his son (J.D. Hooker) to join the Naval Medical Service. King however was interested in India upon reading Royle and Hooker's works. The Indian Medical Service had suspended recruitment from 1860 but <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> restart in April 1865. King obtained an M.B. in 1865 and joined the Indian Medical Service on 2 October, carrying with him an Ipecacuanha plant from Hooker, left for India in March and reached Calcutta on 11 April 1866.|$|E
25|$|However, {{following}} {{the formation of}} the Premier League, it became increasingly difficult for newly promoted clubs to establish themselves in the top flight. Whereas newly promoted teams had once normally survived for at least a few seasons in the old First Division, it was now the norm for at least one newly promoted club to be relegated straight back from the Premier League to Division One. In the nine seasons that followed {{the formation of the}} Premier League, at least one newly promoted club suffered this fate – and in the 1997–98 season <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> all three newly promoted teams. There were exceptions, however; including Blackburn Rovers, who were promoted to the Premier League on its formation and were champions three years later, and Newcastle United, who were promoted in 1993 and finished in the top six for the next four seasons, finishing Premier League runners-up twice.|$|E

25|$|The colours {{were then}} struck to Éveillé, upon which her {{commander}} demanded Roddam come aboard his ship. Roddam refused, answering {{that if he}} was wanted on the French ship, a boat must be sent for him, or else he would rehoist the colours and defend the ship until she sank. A lieutenant was then sent over in a boat from the French ship, and Roddam came aboard. The French commander, Captain Merville, gave Roddam the bedding of the ordinary ship's company and a dirty rug, and did not allow him to change his clothes. Greenwich was ransacked, and the crew left unfed. Roddam protested, and demanded to be taken to see Bauffremont. After Roddam had expressed his grievances, Bauffremont asked Roddam why he had refused to come to present his surrender in his own boat. Roddam replied that he would have considered it a disgrace, and that his sword would have been delivered through the body of the person demanding it, had <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
25|$|After Super Kings captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss {{and elected}} to bat first, openers Murali Vijay and Mike Hussey {{put on an}} opening {{partnership}} of 87 until Vijay was dismissed for 42 (from 32 balls) in the 11th over. Mike Hussey was joined by IPL's leading run scorer Suresh Raina and they scored at a brisk rate to reach 160 when Hussey was dismissed in the eighteenth over for 54 (from 43 balls). Suresh Raina who had scored an imposing 73 (from 38 balls) with five sixes was dismissed off the last ball as Chennai reached a formidable total of 190. In reply, the Knight Riders lost their captain Gautam Gambhir cheaply for 2 in the first over. However, they recovered as Manvinder Bisla (89 from 48 balls) and Jacques Kallis (69 from 49 balls) added 136 for the second wicket. Soon after Bisla's dismissal in the 15th over, the Knight Riders lost wickets at regular intervals and after Kallis was caught out by Ravindra Jadeja off the bowling of Ben Hilfenhaus at 18.5 overs, the Knight Riders required 16 runs from the last 7 balls. Shakib Al Hasan {{appeared to have been}} caught by Murali Vijay off the very next delivery from Hilfenhaus but <b>it</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> be a no-ball and amid the celebrations, Shakib Al Hasan had completed two runs and retained the strike and hit a four the very next ball. Needing 9 runs to win from the last over, Manoj Tiwary hit consecutive fours to secure victory for the Knight Riders. Manvinder Bisla was declared Man of the Match for his 89 from 48 balls which included five sixes and eight fours.|$|E
