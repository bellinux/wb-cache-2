5|$|The mustard-yellow Grade II* listed Stable Block, {{designed}} by architect Roger Morris with a Palladian influence, was ordered by Charles, Fifth Earl of Sutherland {{in the early}} 1730s. It replaced an earlier building which had long been in disrepair and could hold 30 to 40 horses. Morris designed the building with a clear Tuscan architectural <b>design,</b> <b>drawing</b> upon earlier inspiration from his stables at Inigo Jones's St Paul's Church in Covent Garden. A fountain was installed in the courtyard to provide the horse's troughs with water. Several rooms were built within the stable block, including hot and cold baths for riders after hunting, a veterinarian's room with medicines for horses, and {{what was once a}} smoking room. It was converted into an exhibition centre for Princess Diana between 1998 and 2013.|$|E

500|$|The 777 was {{the first}} {{commercial}} aircraft designed entirely by computer. [...] Each <b>design</b> <b>drawing</b> was created on a three-dimensional CAD software system known as CATIA, sourced from Dassault Systemes and IBM. This lets engineers assemble a virtual aircraft, in simulation, to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly—thus reducing costly rework. Boeing developed its own high-performance visualization system, FlyThru, later called IVT (Integrated Visualization Tool) to support large-scale collaborative engineering design reviews, production illustrations, and other uses of the CAD data outside of engineering. Boeing was initially not convinced of CATIA's abilities and built a physical mock-up of the nose section to verify its results. The test was so successful that additional mock-ups were canceled.|$|E

Sugimori, in turn, finalized each <b>design,</b> <b>drawing</b> the Pokémon from various angles in order to assist Game Freak's graphics department in properly rendering the creature. Music for the game was composed by Junichi Masuda, who utilized the four sound channels of the Game Boy to create both the melodies and the sound effects and Pokémon [...] "cries" [...] heard upon encountering them.

500|$|When Jenette Kahn became DC {{editor in}} 1976, she redeveloped the company's {{struggling}} titles; during her tenure, the Joker would {{become one of}} DC's most popular characters. While O'Neil and Adams' work was critically acclaimed, writer Steve Englehart and penciller Marshall Rogers's eight-issue run in Detective Comics #471–476 (August 1977-April 1978) defined the Joker for decades to come with stories emphasizing the character's insanity. In [...] "The Laughing Fish", the Joker disfigures fish with a rictus grin resembling his own (expecting copyright protection), and is unable to understand that copyrighting a natural resource is legally impossible. Englehart and Rogers' work on the series influenced the 1989 film Batman, and was adapted for 1992's [...] Rogers expanded on Adams' character <b>design,</b> <b>drawing</b> the Joker with a fedora and trench coat. Englehart outlined how he understood the character by saying that the Joker [...] "was this very crazy, scary character. I really wanted {{to get back to the}} idea of Batman fighting insane murderers at 3 a.m. under the full moon, as the clouds scuttled by." ...|$|E

500|$|The G2 was {{considered}} by critics to be well-built, but {{was criticized for}} replacing the glass-based construction of the Optimus G with a plainer, plastic-based <b>design,</b> <b>drawing</b> comparisons to recent Samsung products. Ars Technica further criticized the Verizon Wireless version for having a cheaper appearance than the international versions, with a plainer rear cover, modified buttons, and a different speaker layout. The G2's rear buttons were met with equally mixed reception, with most reviewers believing that users {{would be able to}} adjust themselves to operate them. Accordingly, the ability to wake the phone by tapping on the screen {{was considered}} a more convenient method. The G2 was praised for its high-end hardware, with Engadget describing the device as a [...] "beast" [...] with specifications that [...] "seem familiar to anyone who's read a flagship Android phone review in the last 12 months", recognizing that it had become harder for manufacturers to differentiate their flagship products beyond displays and processors. The G2's display was praised for its high resolution and color accuracy, along with LG's efforts to reduce the screen bezel size. The G2 was also praised for having unexpectedly longer battery life than any of its competitors (along with Motorola's Droid Razr Maxx). After lasting about 20 hours of [...] "standard" [...] use in its testing, the G2's battery was considered by Engadget to be [...] "a sign that we're finally crossing into a world of sensible smartphone batteries." ...|$|E
