40|$|The {{number of}} tools for {{dynamics}} simulation {{has grown in}} the last years. It {{is necessary for the}} robotics community to have elements to ponder which of the available tools is the best for their research. As a complement to an objective and quantitative comparison, difficult to obtain since not all the tools are open-source, an element of evaluation is user feedback. With this goal in mind, we created an online survey about the use of dynamical simulation in robotics. This paper reports the analysis of the participants' answers and a descriptive <b>information</b> <b>fiche</b> for the most relevant tools. We believe this report will be helpful for roboticists to choose the best simulation tool for their researches. Comment: 15 page...|$|E

The dataset comprises annual allocations of state aid, including crisis {{aid to the}} financial sector (2008 - 09), by year, country and objective, between the years 1992 - 2009. The raw data has been obtained from the European Commission's EU State Aid Scoreboard, available on the Commission's website. The State Aid Scoreboard indicates aid expenditure made by Member States which falls under the scope of Article 107 (1) TFEU. based on annual reporting by Member States. Expenditure refers to all existing aid measures to manufacturing industries, services, agriculture and fisheries allocated by national authorities, and for which the Commission adopted a formal decision or received an <b>information</b> <b>fiche</b> from the Member States in relation to measures qualifying for exemption under the General Block Exemption Regulation. Project description: The ESRC Centre for Competition Policy (CCP) at the University of East Anglia (UEA) undertakes interdisciplinary research into competition policy and regulation that has real-world policy relevance without compromising academic rigour. It prides itself on the interdisciplinary nature of the research and the members are drawn {{from a range of}} disciplines, including economics, law, business and political science. The Centre was established in September 2004, building on the pre-existing Centre for Competition and Regulation (CCR), with a grant from the ESRC (Economic and Social Research Council) ...|$|E
