5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide {{the success or failure of}} the exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with <b>eighty-five</b> <b>percent</b> of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due to the success of the units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E

At one o'clock they moved leisurely forward, passed through the rocky defile which led into the valley of Abu Klea and bivouacked. Early the next morning the force moved out in square formation and advanced upon the enemy. The most savage and bloody action ever fought in the Soudan by British troops followed. Notwithstanding the numbers and the valour of the Arabs, that they penetrated the square, and that they inflicted on the troops a loss of nine officers and sixty-five men killed and nine officers and <b>eighty-five</b> men wounded--10 <b>percent</b> of the entire force--they were driven from the field with great slaughter, and the Desert Column camped at the wells.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} excess gingival display is {{difficult}} to diagnose and treat. By studying one aspect of excess gingival display, namely the size relationships of the clinical crowns of teeth, {{we can begin to}} quantify reasonable goals of therapy. In this study, two hundred plaster models were used as subjects. These represented two hundred patients before and after orthodontic therapy. The six anterior teeth were measured for length and width and compared to known ideals. Teeth that did not meet ideal standards may require treatment. It was found that the mean tooth length after orthodontic therapy was approximately two millimeters shorter than ideal. The length of maxillary central incisors did not increase over the course of therapy. <b>Eighty-five</b> to ninety <b>percent</b> of maxillary central incisors exceeded allowable tooth width-to-length ratios. Twenty-nine to thirty percent of central incisors exceeded one hundred percent in their width-to-length ratio. Sixty-eight percent of patients displayed asymmetry in gingival architecture...|$|R
40|$|General Information Mast cell tumors (MCT’s) are {{the most}} common tumor in the dog and the second most common tumor in the cat. MCT’s are {{primarily}} a disease of older dogs and cats, however, extremely young dogs and cats have been reported to have MCT’s. Canine breeds reported to be at increased risk for MCT’s are boxers, Boston terriers, Labrador retrievers, terriers and beagles. The only feline breed that has been reported to be at increased risk for MCT’s are Siamese. Most reports show no significant gender predilection for MCT’s in dogs or cats. The etiology of MCT’s is presently unknown. Many have suspected a viral etiology due to MCT transplantability to susceptible laboratory dogs (extremely young or immunocompromised) with tumor cells and cell-free extracts. Recent evidence shows that a significant percentage of dogs with higher-grade MCT’s have genetic mutations in c-kit (stem cell factor receptor) which may be responsible for the genesis and/or progression of MCT’s in dogs. Not all dogs with MCT’s have c-kit mutations, suggesting that they are not the only mechanisms for the development and/or progression of MCT’s. <b>Eighty-five</b> to ninety <b>percent</b> of dogs and cats with MCT’s have solitary lesions.

40|$|James Clifford came to UCSC in 1978, {{and was one}} of two new {{appointments}} in UCSC’s History of Consciousness Program, {{which were}} the result of the first effort to structure the program with full-time, dedicated faculty. His knowledge of Michel Foucault and other figures of ‘French theory,’ acquired during his time in Paris doing dissertation research, proved to be an important common ground between Clifford and his new senior colleague, Hayden White, and in the structuring of histcon that they undertook together. They were charged with infusing the “fundamentally anarchic” program with a sense of ballast, foundation and direction.            The program in time developed a cadre of dedicated and renowned faculty, and a contingent of graduate students who were exceptional for their creativity, their self-direction, and in many cases their political activism. Histcon became extremely successful, with an extraordinarily high figure of <b>eighty-five</b> to ninety <b>percent</b> of graduates getting placed in tenure-track or postdoctoral positions. The program’s interdisciplinary scope, with students engaged in wide array of topics that were too expansive/transgressive for many more traditional departments, earned it an international reputation as a place for cutting edge work.            Beyond histcon, in these sessions Clifford considers his role as the founding director of the Center for Cultural Studies, a campus research institution that championed a vision of the ‘greater humanities,’ and strove to establish links both in and outside of the humanities division. He reflects on the ‘cultural studies turn’ in academia more broadly, which prioritized interdisciplinary, ground-up approaches to study. Clifford closes his narrative with a reflection on the UCSC campus as a physical space, going beyond clichés of its beauty to sketch out his vision of the land as a generative presence, as something that is fundamentally nourishing and creative in ways we don’t yet have language to articulate...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the soil seed bank in tropical forest regeneration, little is known about spatial variability in species composition and abundance of seeds stored in the soil. To develop sampling methods for comparative studies, we examined species richness, spatial variation, and abundance of germinants from the soil seed bank in a 16 year old secondary, tropical wet forest at La Selva Biological Station, Costa Rica. Surface soil (10 cm deep, 4. 7 cm diameter) was collected at the intersection points of a gridded 1 ha plot (10 × 10 -m grid, 121 samples) and in a nested 100 m 2 subplot (2 × 2 -m grid, 36 samples). The 1 ha plot had a density of 4535 seeds/m 2 with 34 species observed. Based on a series of 100 randomized species accumulation curves, a Michaelis-Menten fit predicted a mean species richness of 36. 3 species; the number of observed species was close to the predicted asymptote. A nonparametric, first-order jackknife species richness estimtor predicted a species richness of 37. 0 species. <b>Eighty-five</b> and 95 <b>percent</b> of the observed species richness is contained, on average, within 41 and 74 pooled samples, respectively. Within the 100 m 2 nested subplot, a density of 5476 seeds/m 2 was observed, comprising 26 species with an estimates species richness (Michaelis-Menten fit) of 29. 1 species. The jackknife species richness estimator predicted a species richness of 36. 7 species. For species richness and abundance of both plots, spatial autocorrelation statistics (Moran's I) were not significantly different from zero at lag distances from 2 to 100 m, indicating a random distribution at these spatial scales. For this site, accurate estimates of species composition depend upon the number of samples collected as well as the spatial distribution of sampling effort. Many small samples distributed over a large area provide greater accuracy and precision for estimating species richness of the soil seed bank...|$|R
