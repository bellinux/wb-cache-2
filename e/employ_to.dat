5|$|After {{assuming}} the throne, Ivan Vladislav immediately sent a delegation to Basil II, which arrived {{five days after}} the fall of Maglen. In his letter, Ivan Vladislav notified Basil that he had personally murdered Gavril Radomir and had seized all the power in the country and promised Basil deep humility and obedience, an act of submission which some in the nobility supported. After Ivan Vladislav firmly secured his hold on the throne, however, he openly declared to be against any kind of compromise with the Byzantines and quickly began to follow the determined policy of his predecessors against the ongoing Byzantine conquest. Basil II soon understood that Ivan Vladislav's letter was a ruse and plotted a retaliatory action, bribing the kavkhan Theodore, who was in Byzantine captivity, to murder the Bulgarian ruler. Theodore in turn paid a trusted man in Ivan Vladislav's <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> commit the murder, but in the event the assassin actually killed Theodore himself. In the meantime Basil II continued his march, forcing the Bulgarian emperor to retreat to the Albanian mountains, and advanced {{into the heart of the}} Bulgarian state. The Byzantines took the capital Ohrid and burned the imperial palaces; news, however, arrived that Ivan Vladislav had laid siege to Dyrrhachium and that to the south the Bulgarian general Ibatzes had defeated the Byzantine rear army near Bitola. With his supply routes cut, Basil II had to retreat back to Thessalonica leaving a small garrison in Ohrid, which was swiftly retaken by the Bulgarians. Back in his base at Mosynopolis, Basil divided the Byzantine army to harass the areas of Strumitsa and Sofia. In January 1016 the Byzantine emperor returned to Constantinople.|$|E
25|$|The term ergative–absolutive is {{considered}} unsatisfactory by some, {{since there are}} very few languages without any patterns that exhibit nominative–accusative alignment.

25|$|In 1621, {{a wealthy}} man named Alessandro Marchetto of Udine {{submitted}} a memorandum to the Holy Office accusing both a fourteen-year-old boy and a local shepherd named Giovanni of being a benandanti, each of whom he had previously tried to <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> cure his own cousin, whom it was believed had been bewitched by sorcery.|$|E
25|$|The {{capacity}} to lie is noted early and nearly universally in human development. Social psychology and developmental psychology {{are concerned with}} the theory of mind, which people <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> simulate another's reaction to their story and determine if a lie will be believable. The most commonly cited milestone, what is known as Machiavellian intelligence, is at the age of about four and a half years, when children begin to be able to lie convincingly. Before this, they seem simply unable to comprehend why others do not see the same view of events that they do– and seem to assume {{that there is only one}} point of view, which is their own.|$|E
25|$|These {{tests are}} rough-and-ready tools which grammarians <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> reveal clues about {{syntactic}} structure. A {{word of caution}} is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests {{on a scale of}} reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test {{does not mean that the}} unit is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not mean necessarily that the unit is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given unit in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.|$|E
30|$|Sessile drop {{method was}} <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> measure {{the contact angle}} of the membranes. The contact angles were {{measured}} at ten places and then average values were reported. Contact Angle Meter 110 VAC was <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> measure the contact angles.|$|R
40|$|A Nd:Yag laser {{operating}} in second harmonic (532 nm), 3 ns pulse duration, 1 - 150 mJ pulse energy and 1 - 10 Hz repetition rate is <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> irradiate different coins placed in high vacuum chamber. The ablated material, in vapor phase, is analyzed by a mass quadrupole spectrome-ter {{in the range}} 1 - 300 amu with sensitivity up to 1 ppm. The “on line ” analysis permits to investigate on the ele-ments, chemical compounds and isotopic ratios character-izing the coin composition. Focused and unfocused laser beams can be <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> irradiate sub-millimetric or tens millimetric areas, respec-tively. The first method is <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> determine the ele-mental depth profiles from surface up to about 0. 1 mm. The second method is <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> analyze the average composition of the superficial patina layers. This micro-invasive technique, associated to the characteristic X-ray fluorescence emission due to 20 keV electron impact, was <b>employed</b> <b>to</b> analyze different coins, based on bronze and silver, from VI up to XX sec...|$|R

25|$|Several more {{disputes}} arose {{between the}} parties in the early 1990s, revolving around Burger King's desire to enter the Australian market directly. In 1992 Burger King considered buying out Hungry Jack's and its stores, either itself, through a third party or through a joint venture, but Hungry Jack's rejected these proposals. In 1993 Burger King commenced negotiations with Shell to open Burger King outlets in some of Shell's service stations — initially including but later excluding Hungry Jack's from the discussions — which culminated in the opening of seven outlets from 1995. During this time a senior Hungry Jack's executive was leaking secret information to Burger King about Hungry Jack's internal operations, and advising Burger King of methods it might <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> force Hungry Jack's to sell out its business to Burger King.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, a young English Cambridge {{anthropology}} {{student named}} John Eric Sidney Thompson wrote to Morley seeking employment with the Carnegie programme on digs in Central America. Thompson had studied Morley's 1915 work {{and from that}} taught himself Maya calendrics, which were a particular passion for Morley. The Carnegie Institution at Morley's urging accordingly hired Thompson, and he soon found himself at work in Chichen Itza, involved with its architectural reconstruction (for which task Thompson had no particular qualifications). During the 1925–26 season, Thompson became well-acquainted with Morley, {{the two of them}} along with their wives (the newly married Thompson was in fact on his honeymoon) making several side-trips together. However, {{at the end of the}} 1926 season, Thompson left Carnegie's <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> take up a post offered by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History. This post offered Thompson far greater freedom and diversity for his research. Thompson and Morley were to remain close and like-minded colleagues in spite of this move.|$|E
25|$|For {{most people}} with stroke, {{physical}} therapy (PT), occupational therapy (OT) and speech-language pathology (SLP) are the cornerstones of the rehabilitation process. Often, assistive technology such as wheelchairs, walkers and canes may be beneficial. Many mobility problems can be improved {{by the use of}} ankle foot orthoses. PT and OT have overlapping areas of expertise; however, PT focuses on joint range of motion and strength by performing exercises and relearning functional tasks such as bed mobility, transferring, walking and other gross motor functions. Physiotherapists can also work with patients to improve awareness and use of the hemiplegic side. Rehabilitation involves working on the ability to produce strong movements or the ability to perform tasks using normal patterns. Emphasis is often concentrated on functional tasks and patient’s goals. One example physiotherapists <b>employ</b> <b>to</b> promote motor learning involves constraint-induced movement therapy. Through continuous practice the patient relearns to use and adapt the hemiplegic limb during functional activities to create lasting permanent changes. OT is involved in training to help relearn everyday activities known as the activities of daily living (ADLs) such as eating, drinking, dressing, bathing, cooking, reading and writing, and toileting. Speech and language therapy is appropriate for people with the speech production disorders: dysarthria and apraxia of speech, aphasia, cognitive-communication impairments, and problems with swallowing.|$|E
