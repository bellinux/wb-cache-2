40|$|The Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) of 1982 {{was enacted}} {{with the purpose}} of helping <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> become reemployed through the {{provision}} of job training programs. Using data from the 1984 CPS Displaced Worker Survey, this study analyzes the impact of job training programs on the reemployment probability of <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers.</b> The results suggest that <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> who received classroom training or on-the-job training {{were more likely to be}} reemployed. <b>Dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> who received only job search assistance, however, did not benefit from the assistance in terms of higher reemployment probability. In light of the legislative intent of JTPA Title 111 for increasing dislocated workers' human capital, the results suggest that state JTPA agencies should place more emphasis on the classroom training, which provides basic and job skills to <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers.</b> Copyright 1991 by The Policy Studies Organization. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the decisions and perceptions of Lane Company’s dislocated workforce regarding retraining and reemployment programs funded by the Minnie and B. B. Lane Foundation (MBL Foundation), Virginia Employment Commission (VEC), both organizations, or neither organization. Thirteen Lane Company <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> were interviewed utilizing an open-ended questionnaire. The results of this study indicated that the retraining and reemployment needs of Lane Company’s <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> were accommodated. However, to accommodate those needs, two organizations were required, the VEC and the MBL Foundation. The VEC was instituted by the federal and state government to provide retraining and reemployment services to <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> via the Trade Act of 1974. The MBL Foundation, a nonprofit organization, was established to provide funding for retraining and reemployment programs to Lane Company’s dislocated workforce. Many <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> approached the VEC to apply for retraining, but found that the funding was insufficient or the retraining program they desired was not approved under the Trade Act.

50|$|The federal {{government}} does not distribute aid directly to the student or the student's family; it goes through the college. Colleges use the student's federal student aid eligibility and combine it with state financial aid (if any) and their own aid to create a financial aid package (award), which {{is sent to the}} student. Generally speaking, the lower the EFC the higher the financial aid award will be. Zero is the lowest EFC number (the family cannot afford to pay anything) and 99,999 is the highest.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze input from <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> program to better understand whether the program's design corresponds to issues and problems dealt with by its participants. Sixteen participants from an Illinois community college <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> program and four program providers were interviewed to explore their perceptions of the <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> program. In the first chapter, an overview of <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> programs and legislation and a description of the researcher's perspective lead into the following research questions: (1) identifying improvements to <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> programs; (2) identifying components, other than training and job placement, that can be added to program design; (3) identifying measures, other than performance standards, to measure program success; and (4) discussing whether program quality is as important, if not more important, than program quantity. The second chapter describes the job loss experience as explained by those interviewed and the related literature. The third chapter defines a model for determining the necessary level of assistance for each <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> participant. This model is based on patterns identified in the attitudes, coping skills, and sense of control over circumstances for the participants interviewed. In the fourth chapter, individualizing <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> programs is recommended to improve current program design. The issue of quantity versus quality, in relation to implementing improvements in program design, is discussed. The fifth chapter identifies program improvements based on data collected in the study.

50|$|Once <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> {{obtain a}} new job, they suffer {{significant}} wage reductions. About {{two thirds of}} <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> have lower wages in the new job and one quarter of displaced workers from manufacturing who find a new full-time job suffer earning losses of 30% or more. The reason is that many workers find jobs in services sector where salaries are lower. Ebenstein et al. (2009) find that displaced workers from manufacturing who find {{a job in the}} services sector suffer a wage decline of between 6 and 22%.

The Workforce Investment Act (WIA) was a federal workforce development program that ran from 2000 to 2014. The WIA provided three main programs: youth, adult, and <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker.</b> The focus of this research was to evaluate the individual services in the adult and <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> programs in the Western Kentucky Workforce Investment Area and identify the most effective service in each program. The adult and <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> programs each offered three tiered services: core, intensive, and training. Individuals entered the core service and progressed until employment was obtained or they exited the programs. The services were evaluated based on the success and failure rates of the outcomes using the reported data retrieved from the Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) database. The number of participants were counted in each service as well as the number of individuals that were employed and not employed after exiting the programs. Individuals employed after exiting the program, were counted as successful outcomes. Individuals that were not employed after exiting the program were counted as unsuccessful outcomes. The study found evidence that the training service was the most effective service in both the adult and <b>dislocated</b> <b>worker</b> programs...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{estimated}} the "human capital depreciation" of women re-entering {{the work force}} after voluntary, lengthy interruptions. Those studies have found reduced real wages and furthermore the decrease is positively related {{to the length of}} the interruption. Upon re-entry, however, real wages grow rapidly as human capital is restored. This paper develops a model of the wage histories of <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers.</b> Similar to labor force re-entrants, those <b>dislocated</b> <b>workers</b> who become re-employed would experience wages below their final wage prior to dislocation and the decrease should be associated with the length of dislocation. However, the model suggests that since the career disruptions are involuntary and since occupational shifts generally occur, recovery will not be rapid nor complete. The model is estimated with data from a sample of workers in Ohio who had been dislocated and received services under Title III of the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). This data set has the limitation that the observations are for workers who chose to receive services, but it also has the advantage that the effects of a variety of training interventions on outcomes can be determined. <b>dislocated,</b> <b>workers,</b> JTPA, Hollenbeck...|$|R

30|$|Notwithstanding the {{limitations}} in our cost estimates, the Adult program clearly satisfies a benefit-cost standard {{for both men}} and women if the earnings impacts, estimated at over $ 400 per quarter, continue for a period of just three or four years, which seems plausible. In contrast, our best estimates of the impact on earnings for the <b>Dislocated</b> <b>Worker</b> program imply that impacts on earnings for women ($ 131 per quarter) would have to be very long-lived to exceed direct costs, even without considering forgone earnings. Estimated benefits for men ($ 36 per quarter) could never cumulate to exceed costs at any reasonable rate of interest. As noted above, however, estimates of impacts on employment are more supportive of the <b>Dislocated</b> <b>Worker</b> program. If the program succeeds in increasing the number of individuals with jobs, and the most disadvantaged workers are the gainers, such program impacts could justify the program even if it fails a benefit-cost standard 12.|$|E
