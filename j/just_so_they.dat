Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> could fire a volley into the Union cavalry.

25|$|Hard Network Out – For some reason, {{unbeknownst to}} {{humanity}} at present, professional journalist and Miami Herald columnist Greg Cote cannot {{understand the concept}} of the hard network {{out at the end of}} an hour of the show and will continue to talk through the break. There was a period on the show wherein Le Batard would wear a hat with a clock on the brim to help Cote understand how much time remained at the end of a segment, but to no avail. The phenomenon has now morphed into Le Batard and Stugotz attempting to trap Cote by waiting until late in an hour to ask his opinion, setting him up to ramble through the out. The show maintains frequently that this feat is not a contrived gag but is an actual problem for Cote that they exploit to great comedic benefit. Le Batard and Stugotz also use this as a prank; during an episode in February 2017, the two had Cote on the phone to discuss a Twitter beef with Dwyane Wade, and cut him off at the hard network out before he could respond to Dan's question regarding it. Le Batard admitted he was on the show <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> could cut him off.|$|E

Flutes and bowed instruments underwent many modifications and design changes—most of them unsuccessful—in efforts to increase volume. Other instruments were changed <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> could play their parts in the scores. Trumpets traditionally had a [...] "defective" [...] range—they were incapable of producing certain notes with precision.

500|$|Steinman and Meat Loaf had immense {{difficulty}} finding a record company willing to sign them. According to Meat Loaf's autobiography, the band {{spent most of}} 1975 writing and recording material, and {{two and a half}} years auditioning the record and being rejected. Manager David Sonenberg jokes that they were creating record companies <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> could be rejected. They performed the album live in 1976, with Steinman on piano, Meat Loaf singing, and sometimes Ellen Foley joining them for [...] "Paradise". Steinman says that it was a [...] "medley of the most brutal rejections you could imagine." [...] Meat Loaf [...] "almost cracked" [...] when CBS executive Clive Davis rejected the project.

Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted.

500|$|Mega Man 4 was {{the first}} game in the series for Hayato Kaji, {{credited}} as [...] "K. Hayato", a prominent designer for many later Mega Man games. Kaji {{was responsible for the}} chargeable Mega Buster, a gameplay mechanic that would become a staple of the series. [...] "We knew adding a two-level or three-level charge would change the whole flavor of the game in some respects, and we were very mindful of that," [...] Inafune explained. The Robot Masters in Mega Man 4 are a result of a design contest for fans held in Japan. With over 70,000 character submissions, the development team spent {{an extended period of time}} narrowing them down to only eight bosses. According to Kaji, the team was very satisfied with many of the chosen designs and almost no changes were made to their original illustrations. They were so impressed with Skull Man that they scrapped an entire level being created <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>they</b> could restart it and devote it to that Robot Master. The winning eight contestants of the design contest were each issued a special [...] "golden cartridge" [...] edition of Mega Man 4. As there are only eight of these cartridges in existence, they are extremely rare and fetch a large collector's price today. The musical score for Mega Man 4 was composed by Minae Fujii, credited as [...] "Ojalin", while the sound programming and sound effects were handled by Yasuaki Fujita, credited as [...] "Bun Bun", who had composed the soundtrack for Mega Man 3 the previous year.|$|E
