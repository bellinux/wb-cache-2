40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to help understand the factors determining the emergence and establishment of ragwort seedlings in pastures. To achieve this it was necessary to determine (a) whether the germination of seeds was affected by the presence of light; (b) the influence of <b>herbage</b> <b>cover</b> on the emergence of seedlings; (c) the seasonality of seedling emergence; (d) the impact of treading on the emergence of seedlings and (e) the behaviour of seedlings in a real farm situation. In the first experiment, soil containing ragwort seeds was collected from a dairy pasture and subjected to constant light or dark conditions in growth chambers. Seeds subjected to light produced significantly more seedlings (55. 6 % seedling emergence) than those left in darkness (13. 8 % seedling emergence). It was concluded that germination is positively affected by light. Apparently, seeds which germinated in the dark were those originally close to the soil surface. In the second experiment, a hill country pasture near Woodville was either denuded of <b>herbage</b> <b>cover</b> or left intact once every month. For one year, ragwort seedlings were counted to provide information on the seasonality of seedling emergence. Seedling emergence was constantly higher on bare soil than under the pasture canopy, except in summer when no germination was observed for lack of moisture. Peaks of seedling emergence occurred in September (bare soil and intact pasture) and in June (bare soil). Seedling emergence (bare soil) was high even at low temperatures in winter. Seed germination was strongly checked by either the lack of moisture over summer or the presence of <b>herbage</b> <b>cover</b> at any time of the year. The third experiment was carried out at the same site. A number of defoliation treatments were imposed involving combinations of the presence and absence of <b>herbage</b> <b>cover,</b> treading and grazing. Any form of disturbance to pasture caused a significant increase in seedling emergence. The greatest emergence was found where soil had been denuded of <b>herbage</b> <b>cover,</b> whether trodden or untrodden. Treading generally stimulated germination through damage to the vegetation cover, and some increase in emergence also resulted from soil movement by hooves. Seedling emergence was minimal where pasture was undisturbed. The fourth experiment was carried out on a commercial dairy farm near Palmerston North over a 12 month period. Without interfering with the normal management system, several pasture attributes were monitored every week at three different sites within the farm to help explain the emergence and mortality of ragwort seedlings. Seedlings were counted every week in permanent quadrats and mapped every fortnight. Seedling emergence and survival varied greatly both between sites and throughout the year. The major determinant of seedling emergence was found to be the proportion of bare soil. Bare soil was largely caused by treading in wet months and by drought during summer/early autumn. No emergence was observed over summer when soil moisture levels were low. Depending on the site, peak emergence occurred in June, August and November. The major causes of seedling mortality were water stress, earthworm casts, treading damage and competition from neighbouring plants. Although autumn emergence was small compared to the emergence observed in winter and in spring, it is apparently the most important period of emergence during the year, since seedlings which emerge in winter and in spring are prone to die over summer from water stress. Ragwort seedlings survived longer periods when the sward height was between 2 and 7 cm (approx.) and when herbage mass was between 500 and 2000 kg DM ha- 1. Beskow, W. B. (1995).

When different sites were compared, variability in herbage and spatial heterogeneity were positively correlated. Spatial heterogeneity within a site increased after droughts indicating that compensation between temporal and spatial variations occurred. It was considered that drought-promoted heterogeneity may help the resilience of the vegetation by preserving spots of luxuriant growth. Grazing decreased spatial heterogeneity, however the evenness fostered by grazing did not increase vegetation sensitivity to drought. It is suggested that this {{was because of the}} convergence in plant adaptation to grazing and arid conditions...|$|E

40|$|Lack {{of water}} was the {{dominant}} factor causing vegetation degeneration {{in the lower}} reaches of Tarim River. Stages in degradation of different species differed due to variations in their adaptability to environmental degeneration. Firstly, herbage with high moisture requirements degenerated or disappeared, followed by deep-rooted herbage with parts of the shrubbery and finally, arbor and shrubbery with high tolerance to drought and salinity gradually degenerated. The change in coverage by dominant species also differed. Coverage of arbor (Populus euphratica) decreased continuously during plant degradation with coverage of shrubbery (Tamarix sp.) increasing slightly {{at first and then}} decreasing. <b>Herbage</b> <b>cover</b> decreased gradually at first but, with falling ground-water levels, its coverage as the dominant species decreased abruptly, until all the herbage had completely disappeared. Trends in degradation of plant communities showed typical individual characteristics. Populus euphratica and Phragmites communis, were two of the original plant communities. During the course of degradation of Phragmites communis the dominant species was replaced, but Populus euphratica the dominant species of the Populus euphratica community - retained its dominant position during the course of degeneration...|$|E
40|$|A two-year {{lysimeter}} study was undertaken {{to compare the}} environmental effects (e. g. nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions) of soil applied lactose-depleted dairy factory effluent (LD-DFE) with lactose-rich DFE. The aim of this experiment {{was to determine the}} fate of nitrogen from LD-DFE and dairy cow urine applied to a Templeton fine sandy loam soil (Udic Ustrochrept), supporting a <b>herbage</b> <b>cover</b> of ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). Measurements were carried out on the amount of nitrogen lost from the soil via leaching, lost by denitrification, removed by the pasture plants, and immobilized within the soil organic fraction. Further, a comparison between the fate of nitrogen in LD-DFE irrigated onto land under a "cut and carry" system, as opposed to a "grazed" pasture system was undertaken. Lactose-depleted dairy factory effluent was applied at three-weekly intervals during the summer months at rates of 25 and 50 mm, until nitrogen loading targets of 300 and 600 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ had been achieved. Measured leaching losses of nitrogen averaged 2 and 7 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for Control 25 and Control 50 treatments; 21, 20 and 58 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for 25 and 50 mm "cut and carry" treatments respectively; and 96 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for the 25 mm "grazed" treatment. The range of nitrate-N leaching loss from LD-DFE plus urine is no different from the lactose-rich DFE nitrate leaching loss. Uptake of nitrogen by the growing pasture averaged 153, 184, 340, 352, 483, and 415 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for Control 25, Control 50, LD-DFE 25 and LD-DFE 50 mm "cut and carry" treatments, and the LD-DFE 25 mm "grazed" treatment, respectively. Denitrification losses were 0. 06, 4. 4, 1. 69, 19. 70, and 7. 4 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹ for Control 25, the LD-DFE 25 "cut and carry" treatments, the LD-DFE 25 mm "grazed" treatment, and calculated "paddock losses", respectively. Isotopic nitrogen studies found that 29. 4 and 25. 8 % of applied LD-DFE nitrogen was immobilised in the LD-DFE 25 and LD-DFE 50 "cut and carry" treatments. The results of this experiment confirm the findings of the previous lactose-rich DFE study, in that the effects of grazing stock are of greater environmental concern than the removal of lactose from the effluent waste stream...|$|E
40|$|Lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) {{is a major}} forage legume {{grown in}} {{approximately}} 45 million hectares worldwide. It is an excellent candidate for irrigation and can produce large quantities of quality herbage due to its high water use efficiency and deep root system. However, in New Zealand, {{the growth rate of}} lucerne is reduced in autumn/winter and early spring when temperature and solar radiation decrease. These periods of feed deficit usually provide opportunities for the use of supplementary feed to sustain high dry matter intake (DMI). Supplements are also offered as they may dilute the amount of nitrogen (N) eaten, thereby potentially reducing the quantity of N excreted in dairy cows grazing high N forages such as lucerne. Currently, little data exists on lucerne-supplement interactions in New Zealand dairy systems. This research study investigated the effect of feeding maize or grass silage supplements on dry matter intake (DMI), milk-solids (MS) yield, substitution rate (subR), grazing behaviour and N-output of dairy cows offered fresh lucerne in autumn. A field experiment was conducted at Lincoln University Research Dairy Farm (LURDF), Canterbury, New Zealand, between March and May, 2013. Three diets consisting of: 1. lucerne only; 2. lucerne plus maize silage, and 3. lucerne plus grass silage were allocated to 30 dairy cows in an incomplete randomised crossover design comprising of two periods of 15 days each. The silage supplementation, regardless of silage type, increased both total dry matter intake (DMI) and metabolisable energy intake - MEI (MJ ME/kg DM) compared to the lucerne only treatment, and reduced DM intake of lucerne herbage by up to 1. 36 kg DM/cow/d (P = 0. 04), resulting in a subR of 0. 44 ± 0. 03 kg DMI of lucerne/kg DMI silage and marginal milksolids response (MMR) of 0. 02 ± 0. 01 kg MS per kg DM silage intake. The type of silage had no effect on milk solids or milk and feed conversion efficiency (P > 0. 05). Generally, cows had low utilisation of lucerne herbage per hectare (44 ± 2 %) and high utilisation of lucerne per cow (88. 5 ± 3. 8 %), which had no effect on the rate of liveweight (LWT) gain and body condition (BC). The silage supplements reduced grazing time by up to 7 minutes (P < 0. 001) during the morning grazing session of 4 hours, which could have been the effect of the supplements on physical fill of the rumen. The nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) averaged at 18. 8 ± 0. 5 % for all cows in the three dietary treatments; however, feeding maize or grass silage did not improve the NUE. The supplements reduced the excretion of N via urine by 19 % and increased faecal N output by 8. 7 % and 4. 0 % for cows fed grass and maize silage respectively. The concentration of milk urea nitrogen (MUN) was highest in cows grazing lucerne only (15. 85 ± 0. 39 mmol/L; P = 0. 044) compared to the supplemented cows (15. 12 ± 0. 39 mmol/L). The dietary treatments had no effect on urinary concentrations of creatinine, purine derivatives (PD) i. e. allantoin and uric acid, calculated PD index and the total microbial N supply. Conclusively, findings of this study show that feeding maize or grass silage to mid-late lactation dairy cows grazing lucerne in autumn significantly increased total DMI and MEI; however cow responses to the supplements in terms of milk-solids yield, subR, MMR, FCE, LWT gain and BCs were generally low. This therefore implies that supplementary maize or grass silage feeds can be used in autumn to sustain high DM and ME intakes, and enable substitution of the sown lucerne crop to increase <b>herbage</b> <b>cover</b> on the farm during periods of reduced growth in autumn/winter and early spring. The results also demonstrated the use of either maize or grass silage as a mitigation strategy to reduce nitrogen excretion through urine in dairy cows grazing autumn lucerne. Thus, based on these results, it would be appropriate to recommend the restriction of lucerne allowance when supplements are fed. This would improve the utilisation of lucerne per hectare, reduce the N-intake (particularly from lucerne herbage), and maintain milksolids production, milk yield and liveweight gain in mid lactation...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} controlled ryegrass-white clover herbage availability from day 128 until day 142 of pregnancy in comparison to unrestricted availability, {{on the performance of}} twin-bearing ewes of varying body condition score (BCS; 2. 0, 2. 5, or 3. 0) and their lambs. It was hypothesised that under conditions of controlled herbage availability, the performance of lambs born to ewes with a greater BCS would be greater than those born to ewes with a lower BCS. During the period that the nutritional regimens were imposed, the pre- and post-grazing herbage masses of the Control regimen (1, 070 ± 69 and 801 ± 30 kg dry matter [DM]/ha) were lower than the ad libitum regimen (1, 784 ± 69 and 1, 333 ± 33 kg DM/ha; p 0. 05). The difference in ewe BCSs and back fats observed among body condition groups was maintained throughout pregnancy (p 0. 05). Ewe BCS group had no effect on lamb live weight at birth or weaning or on maximal heat production (p> 0. 05). Serum gamma glutamyl transferase concentrations of lambs born to BCS 3. 0 ewes were higher within 36 hours of birth than lambs born to BCS 2. 0 ewes and BCS 2. 5 ewes (51. 8 ± 1. 9 vs 46. 5 ± 1. 9 and 45. 6 ± 1. 9 IU/mL, respectively [p 0. 05). Lamb survival was the only lamb parameter that showed an interaction between ewe nutritional regimen and ewe BCS whereby survival of lambs born to BCS 2. 5 and BCS 3. 0 ewes differed but only within the Control nutritional regimen ewes (p< 0. 05). These results indicate farmers can provide twin-bearing ewes with pre- and post-grazing ryegrass-white clover <b>herbage</b> <b>covers</b> of approximately 1, 100 and 800 kg DM/ha in late pregnancy, provided that <b>herbage</b> <b>covers</b> are 1400 in lactation, without affecting lamb performance to weaning. The present results also indicate that under these grazing conditions, there is little difference in ewe performance within the BCS range of 2. 0 to 3. 0 and therefore they {{do not need to be}} managed separately...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{reported}} that the trailing shoe application technique reduces phosphorus (P) in the runoff postslurry application {{when compared to the}} traditional splash-plate application technique. However, the effectiveness of the trailing-shoe technique as a means of reducing P losses has not been evaluated when slurry is applied during periods of high soil moisture levels and lower <b>herbage</b> <b>covers.</b> To address this issue, three treatments were examined in a 3 × 4 factorial design split-plot experiment, with treatments comprising three slurry treatments: control (no slurry), splashplate and trailing-shoe, and four slurry application dates: 7 December, 18 January, 1 March and 10 April. Dairy cow slurry was applied at a rate of 20 m 3 /ha, while simulated runoff was generated 2, 9 and 16 days later and analysed for a range of P fractions. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff at day two was 41 % lower when slurry was applied using the trailing-shoe technique, compared to the splash-plate technique (P < 0. 05). In addition, P concentrations in runoff were higher (P < 0. 05) from slurry applied in December and March compared to slurry applied in January or April, coinciding with periods of higher soil moisture contents. While the latter highlights that ‘calendar’-based non-spreading periods might not always achieve the desired consequences, the study demonstrated that further field-scale investigations into the trailing shoe as a mitigation measure to reduced P loss from agricultural soils is warranted. peer-reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A {{decline in}} water quality, caused by {{elevated}} levels of phosphorus (P), {{has resulted in a}} loss of biodiversity in many freshwater ecosystems across Northern Ireland. Agriculture has been identified as the primary driver of P induced eutrophication of surface waters in Northern Ireland, accounting for almost 60 % of P inputs to inland rivers and lakes. Following the introduction of the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000), action is now being taken to improve water quality in rivers and lakes within Northern Ireland. Whilst current mitigation strategies target reductions in P inputs to agricultural systems, there is also a need for on-farm management strategies which seek {{to reduce the risk of}} P transfer from agricultural land to receiving water bodies. Consequently the aim of this research programme was to identify management strategies to reduce P loss in runoff from grassland, with five field studies undertaken. These studies involved measuring P concentrations in runoff following the application of rainfall to hydrologically isolated plots. Experiment 1 examined the impact of early season grazing on soil-derived P losses to runoff while Experiments 2 - 5 examined different management factors affecting slurry associated P losses in runoff. These included investigating alternative slurry application methods, the timing of slurry application, the role of sward cover at slurry application, and the contribution of anaerobically digested slurry to P losses in runoff. The results from these studies highlight a number of on-farm mitigation strategies than reduce the magnitude of P loss in runoff. For example, limiting the duration of individual grazing bouts can be effective at reducing P losses in runoff while, the use of the trailing shoe slurry spreading technique, particularly at times of wetter soil and at higher <b>herbage</b> <b>covers</b> can significantly reduce P losses in runoff, relative to traditional splashplate spreading techniques.

In 1863, Owen requested the Mauritian Bishop Vincent Ryan to spread word {{that he should be}} informed if any dodo bones were found. In 1865, George Clark, the government schoolmaster at Mahébourg, finally found an abundance of subfossil dodo bones in the swamp of Mare aux Songes in Southern Mauritius, after a 30-year search inspired by Strickland and Melville's monograph. In 1866, Clark explained his procedure to The Ibis, an ornithology journal: he had sent his coolies to wade through the centre of the swamp, feeling for bones with their feet. At first they found few bones, until they cut away <b>herbage</b> that <b>covered</b> the deepest part of the swamp, where they found many fossils. The swamp yielded the remains of over 300 dodos, but very few skull and wing bones, possibly because the upper bodies were washed away or scavenged while the lower body was trapped. The situation is similar to many finds of moa remains in New Zealand marshes. Most dodo remains from the Mare aux Songes have a medium to dark brown colouration.|$|R

60|$|Let us {{take another}} instance. No subject {{has been more}} {{frequently}} or exquisitely treated by the religious painters {{than that of the}} Annunciation, though as usual, the most perfect type of its pure ideal has been given by Angelico, and by him with the most radiant consummation (so far as I know) in a small reliquary in the sacristy of St^a. Maria Novella. The background there, however, is altogether decorative; but in the fresco of the corridor of St. Mark's, the concomitant circumstances are of exceeding loveliness. The Virgin sits in an open loggia, resembling that of the Florentine church of L'Annunziata. Before her is a meadow of rich <b>herbage,</b> <b>covered</b> with daisies. Behind her is seen through the door {{at the end of the}} loggia, her chamber with its single grated window, through which a star-like beam of light falls into the silence. All is exquisite in feeling, but not inventive nor imaginative. Severe would be the shock and painful the contrast, if we could pass in an instant from that pure vision to the wild thought of Tintoret. For not in meek reception of the adoring messenger, but startled by the rush of his horizontal and rattling wings, the virgin sits, not in the quiet loggia, not by the green pasture of the restored soul, but houseless, under the shelter of a palace vestibule ruined and abandoned, with the noise of the axe and the hammer in her ears, and the tumult of a city round about her desolation. The spectator turns away at first, revolted, from the central object of the picture, forced painfully and coarsely forward, a mass of shattered brickwork, with the plaster mildewed away from it, and the mortar mouldering from its seams; and if he look again, either at this or at the carpenter's tools beneath it, will perhaps see in the one and the other, nothing more than such a study of scene as Tintoret could but too easily obtain among the ruins of his own Venice, chosen to give a coarse explanation of the calling and the condition of the husband of Mary. But there is more meant than this. When he looks at the composition of the picture, he will find the whole symmetry of it depending on a narrow line of light, the edge of a carpenter's square, which connects these unused tools with an object at the top of the brickwork, a white stone, four square, the corner-stone of the old edifice, the base of its supporting column. This, I think, sufficiently explains the typical character of the whole. The ruined house is the Jewish dispensation, that obscurely arising in the dawning of the sky is the Christian; but the corner-stone of the old building remains, though the builder's tools lie idle beside it, and the stone which the builders refused is become the Headstone of the corner.|$|R

40|$|Grazing {{practices}} in rangelands are increasingly {{recognized as a}} management tool for environmental protection in addition to livestock production. Long term continuous grazing has been largely documented to reduce pasture productivity and decline the protective layer of soil surface affecting environmental protection. Time-controlled rotational grazing (TC grazing) {{as an alternative to}} continuous grazing is considered to reduce such negative effects and provides pasture with a higher amount of vegetation securing food for animals and conserving environment. To research on how the grazing system affects herbage and above ground organic materials compared with continuous grazing, the study was conducted in a sub-tropical region of Australia from 2001 to 2006. The overall results showed that herbage mass under TC grazing increased to 140 % in 2006 compared with the first records taken in 2001. The outcomes were even higher (150 %) when the soil is deeper and the slope is gentle. In line with the results of <b>herbage</b> mass, ground <b>cover</b> under TC grazing achieved significant higher percentages than continuous grazing in all the years of the study. Ground cover under TC grazing increased from 54 % in 2003 to 73 %, 82 %, and 89 % in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively, despite the fact that after the high yielding year of 2004 herbage mass declined to around 2. 5 ton ha− 1 in 2005 and 2006. Under continuous grazing however there was no significant increase over time comparable to TC grazing neither in herbage mass nor in ground cover. The successful outcome is largely attributed to the flexible nature of the management in which grazing frequency, durations and the rest periods were efficiently controlled. Such flexibility of animal presence on pastures could result in higher water retention and soil moisture condition promoting above ground organic material. Full Tex...|$|R
