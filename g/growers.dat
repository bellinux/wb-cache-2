Following the success in Southern California, on 8 September 1965 the Agriculture Workers Organizing Committee voted to strike against grape <b>growers</b> in Delano, California, where the grape season starts in September. This strike became the first time Mexican workers, due to the decision of Cesar Chavez, did not break a strike of Filipinos; later, on 16 September 1965, Chavez's National Farm Workers Association joined the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee on the picket lines. These strikes occurred around the same time when younger Filipino Americans began a period of political self-reflection and awakening.|$|E

40|$|Variety release {{decisions}} {{involve a}} number of tradeoffs, usually between <b>grower</b> and end-user characteristics as well as significant uncertainties about agronomic, quality, and economic variables. In this study, methodologies were developed to value tradeoffs for <b>grower</b> and end-user characteristics for wheat. The models capture effects of variability in agronomic, quality, and economic variables. The models were applied for three experimental varieties which have since been released and for two hypothetical varieties. Results indicate two of the experimental varieties provide improvements in <b>grower</b> and end-use value {{over most of the}} incumbents. Comparison of a risk adjusted portfolio model consisting of characteristics of end-use and <b>grower</b> values with traditional stochastic dominance techniques (tested for level of significance) indicate similar results.

5|$|In {{its natural}} habitat, N. rajah grows in open areas, {{where it is}} exposed to direct {{sunlight}} – it therefore needs to be provided with {{a significant amount of}} light in cultivation as well. To meet this need, many <b>growers</b> have used metal halide lamps in the 500–1000watt range, with considerable success. The plant should be situated a fair distance from the light source, 1 to 2 m is recommended. Depending on location, <b>growers</b> can utilise natural sunlight as a source of illumination. However, this is only recommended for those living in equatorial regions, where light intensity is sufficient to satisfy the needs of the plant. A photoperiod of 12hours is comparable to that experienced in nature, since Borneo lies on the equator.|$|E

5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is <b>growers</b> sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among pests, and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of pests of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of pests, or demonstrations of parasitised pests. In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but <b>growers</b> were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E

40|$|Fifty {{crossbred}} (Large White x Landrace x Duroc) female finisher pigs {{were used}} to determine the effect of nutritional manipulations on intramuscular fat deposition. The main nutritional treatments were (i) Control (pigs fed a commercial <b>grower</b> diet), (ii) - 15 % P:DE (pigs fed a 15 % reduced protein:digestible energy diet during the <b>grower</b> phase), (iii) - 30 % P:DE (pigs fed a 30 % reduced P:DE diet during the <b>grower</b> phase), (iv) + 6 % Fat (pigs fed diet supplemented with 6 % additional fat during the <b>grower</b> phase), and (v) -Vit A (pigs fed a control diet with no supplemented Vit A in the mineral vitamin premix during the <b>grower</b> and finisher phase). Pigs fed the 30 % reduced P:DE diet had an inferior feed to liveweight gain (feed conversion ratio, FCR) for the combined <b>grower</b> and finisher growth period (P = 0. 036) compared with the other dietary treatments. There {{were no significant differences in}} average daily gain (ADG) or voluntary feed intake (VFI) for the <b>grower,</b> finisher, and the combined <b>grower</b> and finisher phases, or liveweight at slaughter between the dietary treatments. Pigs fed the 15 % (1. 9 %) and 30 % (2. 7 %) reduced P:DE diet, and the Vit A-restricted diet (2. 0 %), had significantly higher intramuscular fat (IMF) levels compared with pigs fed the other diets. Pigs fed the control diet had higher (P = 0. 002) carcass dressing percentage compared with pigs fed the other diets. There were no significant dietary effects on total fat tissue (P = 0. 661), total lean muscle tissue (P = 0. 637), and total bone mineral (P = 0. 367) content. In conclusion, these data indicate that feeding pigs <b>grower</b> diets with 15 % and 30 % reduced P:DE, and <b>grower</b> and finisher diets restricted in Vit A, improved the IMF levels in the Longissimus muscle. The increase in IMF levels in pigs fed the 15 % reduced P:DE diet, and <b>grower</b> and finisher diets restricted in Vit A, improved the IMF levels without having a detrimental effect on growth performance and carcass quality...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Using a broiler growout {{simulation}} program {{developed by}} M. B. Timmons and R. S.

Depending on contract terms, temperature settings that maximize returns to the <b>grower</b> can be greatly different from those that maximize returns to the integrator. Optimum winter temperature settings for a typical southeastern location were calculated for a curtain-sided, insulated, and power-ventilated growout building using fixed prices and varying contract terms. After the initial 21 -d brooding period, <b>grower</b> optimum temperatures ranged from 10 C below to 5 C above integrator optimum temperatures. The results indicate {{that there can be}} a wide disparity in <b>grower</b> and integrator optimum growout temperatures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn 80 day {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the growth promoting effects of a unique mannose rich fraction (MRF) derived from yeast cell walls of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, relative to copper and tylosin in commercially housed <b>grower</b> and finisher pigs. 1008 male <b>grower</b> pigs (29. 7 ± 1. 99 kg live weight) were randomly allocated to four treatment groups of 252 pigs. There were 12 replicates for growth rates (21 pigs per pen) and 6 replicates for feed intake and FCR (42 pigs per feeder). The dietary treatments consisted of a control (CON, containing no growth promoting feed additives), copper (COP, containing 200 ppm of copper as copper sulphate in both <b>grower</b> and finisher pigs), MRF (containing 400 ppm and 200 ppm of Actigen™ (Alltech Biotechnology, Nicholasville, KY) in <b>grower</b> and finisher diets respectively), and tylosin (TYL, containing 40 g and 20 g of tylosin in <b>grower</b> and finisher diets respectively). Growth performance and mortality were monitored over the <b>grower</b> (d 0 – 38) and finisher (d 39 – 80) periods. Slaughter characteristics (carcass weight and backfat thickness at the P 2 position) were recorded at d 80. Mannose rich fraction pigs grew faster (P< 0. 01) than CON or COP pigs during the <b>grower</b> phase. Mannose rich fraction and TYL pigs also tended to (P= 0. 08) have better FCR during the <b>grower</b> phase than those on the CON and COP treatments. No significant treatment effects were observed for growth performance during the finisher phase or over the entire study (d 0 – 80). However, MRF pigs had a significantly higher (P< 0. 01) dressing percentage and heavier carcass weight than pig on all other treatments. There was no influence of growth promoting feed additives on backfat thickness. Overall, MRF was as effective as tylosin and more effective than copper as a growth promoter in <b>grower</b> pigs. Mannose rich fraction inclusion was able to enhance the yield of saleable pork, and was the most effective growth promoting option tested...|$|R
