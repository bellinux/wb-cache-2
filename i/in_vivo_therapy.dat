40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Synovectomy {{of small}} joints is a {{therapeutic}} approach in patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined {{the feasibility of}} transdermal photodynamic therapy (tPDT) in a fibroblast-induced model of joint destruction using the novel photosensitizer (PS) tetrahydroporphyrin-tetratosylat that shows strong absorption at the near infra-red spectral region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The functionality of the PDT system was assessed in vitro. Following arthritis induction and PS application, tPDT was applied <b>in</b> <b>vivo.</b> <b>Therapy</b> results were evaluated by measuring joint swelling, serum amyloid A (SAA) and histologically. RESULTS: We were able to present a fully functional PDT in vitro. The <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>therapy</b> modalities were well tolerated by mice. We could demonstrate photodynamic ablation of subcutaneously located tissue (skeletal muscle) without skin damage. CONCLUSION: This study provides the basis for transdermal accessibility of tissue through a photodynamic process which {{may serve as a}} minimally invasive synovectomy strategy...|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: Resistance to {{platinum}} chemotherapy {{remains a}} significant problem in ovarian carcinoma. Here, we examined the biological mechanisms and therapeutic potential of targeting a critical platinum resistance gene, ATP 7 B, using both in vitro and in vivo models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Expression of ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B was examined in ovarian cancer cell lines by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis. ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B gene silencing was achieved with targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) {{and its effects on}} cell viability and DNA adduct formation were examined. For <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>therapy</b> experiments, siRNA was incorporated into the neutral nanoliposome 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphatidylcholine (DOPC). RESULTS: ATP 7 A and ATP 7 B genes were expressed at higher levels in platinum-resistant cells compared with sensitive cells; however, only differences in ATP 7 B reached statistical significance. ATP 7 A gene silencing had no significant effect on the sensitivity of resistant cells to cisplatin, but ATP 7 B silencing resulted in 2. 5 -fold reduction of cisplatin IC(50) levels and increased DNA adduct formation in cisplatin-resistant cells (A 2780 -CP 20 and RMG 2). Cisplatin was found to bind to the NH(2) -terminal copper-binding domain of ATP 7 B, which might be a contributing factor to cisplatin resistance. For <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>therapy</b> experiments, ATP 7 B siRNA was incorporated into DOPC and was highly effective in reducing tumor growth in combination with cisplatin (70 - 88 % reduction in both models compared with controls). This reduction in tumor growth was accompanied by reduced proliferation, increased tumor cell apoptosis, and reduced angiogenesis. CONCLUSION: These data provide a new understanding of cisplatin resistance in cancer cells and may have implications for therapeutic reversal of drug resistance...|$|E

To test the hypothesis that this is of importance to RBC pathobiology, we administered the iron chelator deferiprone (L 1) intraperitoneally to beta-thalassemic mice for 4 wk and then studied RBC survival and membrane characteristics. L 1 therapy decreased membrane free iron by 50 % (P = 0. 04) and concomitantly improved oxidation of membrane proteins (P = 0. 007), the proportion of RBC gilded with immunoglobulin (P = 0. 001), RBC potassium content (P < 0. 001), and mean corpuscular volume (P < 0. 001).

Methods: The microspheres were dispersed in either 2 % (w/v) poloxamer 188 saline solution, or deionized water {{with the help of a}} cell homogenizer to break up particle aggregates, and were administered intravenously or intraperitoneally to B. abortus-infected mice 7 days post-infection. Results: Neither a single intravenous or intraperitoneal dose of 67 [*]μg of gentamicin per mouse, nor three intraperitoneal doses of 100 [*]μg of gentamicin per mouse, reduced the Brucella infection in the spleen compared with untreated mice 1 and 3 weeks post-treatment.
