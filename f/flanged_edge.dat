50|$|Both swish and pang {{have the}} upturned and <b>flanged</b> <b>edge</b> of a china cymbal, {{with a very}} small bell, a thin profile overall with little taper, and a {{relatively}} thick rim for their size and weight. Although principally ride cymbals, they can also serve as exotic crash cymbals, particularly in the smaller sizes and at higher volumes. As a ride they can be mounted either bell up, for a trashier tone, or bell down, for a more mellow tone and better access to the ride area; As a crash {{they tend to be}} mounted bell down, to give a traditional rim angle.|$|E
50|$|Blackbutt has dark fibrous grey-brown spongy bark {{covering}} {{the lower part}} of the trunk, which comes away in strips. The bark higher up and on the branches is a glossy cream, occasionally with scribbles from insect larvae. The branchlets are square in cross section. Juvenile specimens are conspicuous, with pairs of opposite, broad-lanceolate leaves, much paler below the leaf than above which may reach 17 cm long by 4 cm wide. Blackbutt is a Eucalyptus species without a lignotuber. The adult leaves are arranged alternately on the stem, lanceolate to slightly sickle shaped, 9 to 16 cm long, and 1.5 to 3 cm wide. Asymmetrical at the base, they are oblique in shape. The leaves are same shade of glossy to dark green above and below the leaf. The leaf stems are four sided or squarish with a <b>flanged</b> <b>edge</b> in cross section.|$|E
50|$|Like {{other members}} of its genus, the whitefin swellshark can swallow water or air to {{dramatically}} increase its girth, as a defense against predators. It is oviparous; the eggs are enclosed in smooth, light yellow flask-shaped capsules 9.8 - 11.6 cm long and 5 cm wide, with <b>flanged</b> <b>edges</b> and short horns at the corners that support long, coiled tendrils. The smallest known mature males and females measure 70 m and 98 cm long respectively.|$|R
40|$|Tie bars {{instead of}} {{threaded}} fasteners make track throwing less likely. Proposed undercarriage for tank or bulldozer has <b>flanged</b> <b>edges</b> to prevent rocks and other road debris from getting caught in track drive and damaging or casting off track. Improved track has no threaded fasteners to be loosened by road shock and vibration. Continuous chain of floating guide bars articulated at web junctions. Pins replace bolted connections. Guide bars and flanges on vehicle keep out stones...|$|R
40|$|Nearly 200 {{tests were}} made on the {{strength}} of shear webs of 2 _S-T aluminum alloy, with and without lightening holes. The tests were madoin a Jig of the eingle-specimen type, in which the specime_ is free to collapse completely withoutdeveloping diagonal tension. The lightening holes were c:tr_lar and had either <b>flanged</b> <b>edges</b> or beaded edges, the specimens with <b>flanged</b> <b>edges</b> constituting by far the l_rgest test _'oup. The following eguations were found for the shear stresses T causing collspse, all stresses being given in kips per square inch: (a) So 1 d webs: Tcoll = (37 [...] 0. 283 h/t) if h/t 60. The second formula applies only to sheet 0. 036 inch thick; for other thick-nesses, the collapsing stress may be obtained from a graph (b) Webs with flanged holes: Vcoll(net) = k_c r + (Tult [...] Vcr) D/b_ where the shear stress is based on tl _ net section (c) Webs with beaded holes: Tcoll = 4 _ 0 (t/h) s/ * where the shear stress is based on the gross section. Within the rather norrow test range, the size and the spacing of the holes has a practically negligible effect {{on the strength of}} webs with beaded holes. In these equations, h is the width of the sheet; t, the thickness; D, the hole diameter; b, the hole spacing; k, a correction factor (not differing greatly from unity), which depends 2 on the sheet thickness; T. cr, the buckling stress _ and Tult, the ultimate shear strength of the 1 _z_terial° Simple empirical for_:__las are given for the _hoar stiffness appropriate to various 6 _roupsof specimens. For webs with flanged holes, design charts are presonted _ these charts make it possible to determine by inspection the proportions of the lightest web for a given se _ of design conditions...|$|R
50|$|It {{is known}} that Middle Minoan bronze work flourished as an {{independent}} native art. To {{the very beginning of}} this epoch belongs the largest sword of the age, found in the palace of Malia. It is a flat blade, 79 cm long, with a broad base and a sharp point; there is a gold and crystal hilt but no ornament on the blade. A dagger of somewhat later date, now in the Metropolitan Museum of New York is the earliest piece of decorated bronze from Crete. Both sides of the blade are engraved with drawings: bulls fighting and a man hunting boars in a thicket. Slightly later again (MM III) are a series of splendid blades from mainland Greece, which must be attributed to Cretan craftsmen, with ornament in relief, or incised, or inlaid with gold, silver and niello. The most elaborate inlays, pictures of men hunting lions and cats hunting birds, are on daggers from the shaftgraves of Mycenae. These large designs cover the whole of the flat blade except its edge, but on swords, best represented by finds at Knossos, the ornament is restricted to the high midribs which are an essential feature of the longer blades. The type belongs {{to the beginning of the}} Late Minoan (Mycenaean) age. The hilt is made in one piece with the blade; it has a horned guard, a <b>flanged</b> <b>edge</b> for holding grip-scales, and a tang for a pommel. The scales were ivory or some other perishable substance and were fixed with bronze rivets; the pommels were often made of crystal. A rapier from Zapher Papoura (Knossos) is 91.3 cm long; its midrib and hilt-flange are engraved with bands of spiral coils, and its rivet-heads (originally gold-cased) with whorls. Ordinary Mycenaean blades are enriched with narrow mouldings, parallel to the midribs of swords and daggers, or to the curved backs of one-edged knives. The spearheads have hammered sockets. Other tools and implements are oval two-edged knives, square-ended razors, cleavers, chisels, hammers, axes, mattocks, ploughshares and saws. Cycladic and mainland Greek (Helladic) weapons show no ornament but include some novel types. A tanged spearhead has a slit (Cycladic) or slipped (Helladic) blade for securing the shaft; and the halberd, a west European weapon, was in use in the Middle Helladic Greece. There are few remains of Mycenaean metal armour; a plain cheek-piece from a helmet comes from Ialysos in Rhodes, and a pair of greaves from Enkomi in Cyprus. One of the greaves has wire riveted to its edge for fastening.|$|E
50|$|This type of krater, {{defined by}} volute-shaped handles, {{was invented in}} Laconia in the early 6th century BC, then adopted by Attic potters. Its {{production}} was carried on by Greeks in Apulia {{until the end of}} the 4th century BC. Its shape and method of manufacture are similar to those of the column krater, but the handles are unique: to make each, the potter would have first made two side spirals ("volutes") as decorative disks, then attached a long thin slab of clay around them both forming a drum with <b>flanged</b> <b>edges.</b> This strip would then have been continued downward until the bottom of the handle where the potter would have cut a U-shaped arch in the clay before attaching the handle to the body of the vase.|$|R

50|$|The Maschen disc brooch {{lay with}} its face side {{down on the}} woman's chest. The brooch has a {{diameter}} of 30 mm and is made of different colored vitreous enamel in cloisonné technique on a copper plate. The copper base of the brooch is can shaped, and the enamel plate was fixed in the copper base {{on a bed of}} loam by <b>flanging</b> the protruding <b>edges</b> of the bases wall. The needle apparatus was not preserved. The remaining hinges indicate that it was a needle with a coil spring. Both the metal parts and enamel inlays are slightly worn. A radiological examination revealed that the enamel layer has a thickness of 0.4 mm. The front face of the disc brooch depicts a stylized chest portrait on a now red background. The face and neck of the portrayed person are made of now greenish white enamel. Its eyes and nose region is formed by a curved bar made of copper, ending in two loops as stylized eyes. Around the head a kind of halo is shown, made of whitish to light blue enamel. The upper body has a semi-elliptical shape. The body is decorated by two widely arced copper bars from the neck towards the shoulders, which end there in small loops. The area around the neck of the figure is made of now light blue to turquoise enamel. The lower chest area, below the copper bars, is made of a now dark blue enamel.|$|R
