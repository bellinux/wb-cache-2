40|$|Dense media {{separation}} (DMS) {{plays an}} integral part in coal processing {{as well as in}} the upgrade of low grade ore bodies prior to further processing like flotation and leaching. Various separating vessels are used in DMS; of which the dense media (DM) cyclone is the most common. However, the limited materials of construction available for DM cyclones leave the industry with little choice. In addition, the DM cyclones available moved away from the basic principles of classification hydrocyclones which is to reduce the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> in order to achieve improved efficiency. The ceramic tiled DM cyclones available in the market have ceramic tiles installed perpendicular to each other in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber,</b> which increase the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> at the expense of longer equipment life. For that reason, a research project was initiated to establish the current installed base of DM cyclones in Southern Africa and to develop and evaluate a DM cyclone with a laminar spiral <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> design to reduce the turbulence when feeding the cyclone, whilst achieving the same or superior wear properties. Because Cavex is well proven in hard rock mining and coal classification, it was used as basis for the development of a DM cyclone. Individual moulds were developed and produced in order to fabricate a Cavex DM cyclone with the exact laminar spiral <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> that exists when moulded out of rubber. Afterwards, the Cavex ceramic tiled (CVXT) cyclone was manufactured, installed and commissioned. Using the basic operating principles of hydrocyclones, the predicted results were achieved. The 650 CVXT results confirmed that a DM cyclone and a classification cyclone are inherently the same piece of equipment; it is the selection criteria and material of construction that differ. There is a definite benefit in focussing on metallurgical efficiency in conjunction with wear properties, rather than equipment life (wear life) as the only parameter during equipment fabrication. A simple way to achieve improved performance is to reduce the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber.</b> Further work must include the evaluation of the Cavex CVXT DM cyclone in near gravity coal circuits and to investigate whether the same lower operating pressures (6 D compared to conventional 9 D) will result in improved coal yield, as was illustrated successfully in the separation of fluorspar by DMS, whilst achieving the desired ash contents. The work must include detailed studies on the effect of feed pressure vs. yield/recovery, when the turbulence the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> is reduced. Overall energy savings should be quantified by reducing the cyclone feed pressure...|$|R

All animals were inspected daily until the end of the parasitic phase (when the engorgedfemales detached). The average period of engorgement was 25. 1 days on a horse, with larvae requiring 8 days and nymphs 9 days to reach engorgement; the average weight of engorged females was 271. 4 mg;the average weight of egg batches produced was 159. 3 mg, and the feed conversion rate was 56. 8 %.

40|$|Abstract. —A tri-algal diet was fed {{to three}} age-groups {{of the rainbow}} mussel Villosa iris: ages 2 – 3 d, 50 – 53 d, and 3 – 6 years. Changes in the {{relative}} abundance of each algal species were determined in 5 -h feeding trials from <b>feeding</b> <b>chambers</b> and by gut content analyses. All age-groups rejected Scenedesmus quadricauda and preferentially selected Nannochloropsis oculata and Selenastrum capricornutum, principally {{on the basis of}} size. Changes in the relative abundance of algae in <b>feeding</b> <b>chambers</b> did not differ significantly among age-groups. Observed differences in the ingested quantities of the similar-sized N. oculata and S. capricornutum were attributed to other particle-related characteristics. Results indicate that the rainbow mussel can be fed similar-sized algae at all ages in captive propagation facilities. When developing a suitable algal diet for rearing juvenile mussels, one probably need not investigate different species at each stage of development if the algae used are in the 2. 8 – 8. 5 -mm size range. Propagation studies of native freshwater mus-sels (order Bivalvia: family Unionidae) have been used to describe much of their basic life history, including host 2 fish relationships (Neves et al. 1985; O’Connell and Neves 1999), environmental stress thresholds (Dimock and Wright 1993), and habitat and substrate use (Michaelson and Neves 1995). Dietary studies have not been common, and the nutritional requirements for captive unionids, specifically juveniles, remain undetermined. Algae have been the most popular food source for captive juvenile mussels. Various combinations of algal species have been used to culture juveniles (Hud-son and Isom 1984; Gatenby et al. 1996, 1997), and because of their apparent importance in the diet of unionids, algal species have been incor-porated into the design of recirculating culture sys-tems as the primary food source (O’Beirn et al...|$|R

The energy conversion device was a staged rocket thruster comprised of a first stage where propellant is decomposed to create a high temperature, low velocity environment and a second stage downstream where propellant is injected and exothermically decomposed. The operating configurations varied chamber pressure, propellant flow rate ratio of first stage to second stage, and ratio of propellant <b>feed</b> pressure to <b>chamber</b> pressure within the thruster. Chamber pressures of 125, 250, and 500 psi; flow rate ratios of 1 : 3, 1 : 4, and 1 : 5; and <b>feed</b> to <b>chamber</b> pressure ratios of 1. 25 : 1 and 1. 75 : 1 were considered.

50|$|The {{driving force}} for {{transport}} of different components {{is provided by}} a chemical potential difference between the liquid feed/retentate and vapor permeate at {{each side of the}} membrane. The retentate is the remainder of the feed leaving the membrane <b>feed</b> <b>chamber,</b> which is not permeated through the membrane. The chemical potential can be expressed in terms of fugacity, given by Raoult's law for a liquid and by Dalton's law for (an ideal) gas. During operation, due to removal of the vapor-phase permeate, the actual fugacity of the vapor is lower than anticipated on basis of the collected (condensed) permeate. Separation of components (e.g. water and ethanol) is based on a difference in transport rate of individual components through the membrane. This transport mechanism can be described using the solution-diffusion model, based on the rate/ degree of dissolution of a component into the membrane and its velocity of transport (expressed in terms of diffusivity) through the membrane, which will be different for each component and membrane type leading to separation.|$|R
