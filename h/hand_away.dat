25|$|Pixote {{tries to}} gain comfort from Sueli, {{treating}} {{her as a}} mother figure, but she rejects him. He leaves and is seen walking down a railway line, gun in <b>hand,</b> <b>away</b> from the camera, his figure disappearing in the distance, out of the camera's view.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Bahraini writer Abbas Busafwan {{argued that the}} Khawalid {{brothers}} are the king's crew and allegations made against them, including Al Bandar report {{are no more than}} the king's own projects. He argued that the early reforms initiated by the king (known as [...] "the reform project") only aim was [...] "re-concentrating power in his <b>hand,</b> <b>away</b> from the PM, and not {{for the creation of a}} popular partnership and a democratic life". Busafwan added that Khalid bin Ahmed and Ahmed bin Ateyatalla were responsible for the formation and implementation of what he called the [...] "Hamad strategy". He did not conciser the CP a moderate, instead he said the CP was [...] "unable to form a balance with the powerful Al-Khawaled".|$|E
500|$|According to Abu Rahma, {{six minutes}} of his footage {{focused on the}} al-Durrahs. France2 {{broadcast}} 59seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift his <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his face. Enderlin said he had cut this scene {{in accordance with the}} France2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes ("agonie"), which he said was [...] "unbearable" [...] ("J'ai coupé l'agonie de l'enfant. C'était insupportable... Cela n'aurait rien apporté de plus). In 2007 he said he had meant to use the word agony, not agonie. If he were editing the footage again, he said in 2005, he would include that scene.|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, Hutton {{had a brief}} {{affair with}} Howard Hughes in London at the Savoy Hotel, where Hughes spent several afternoons in Hutton's round satin bed. Hughes, at the time, was engaged to Katharine Hepburn and had come to London to meet with {{government}} officials and arrange permission to overfly Europe {{as part of a}} plan to circumnavigate the globe by air. Hutton later recalled that [...] "he saw I had difficulty reaching orgasm and tried desperately to make me do so the first time [...] [...] [...] thereafter pleasing himself and saying that I would not have one anyway. If I touched myself, he angrily brushed my <b>hand</b> <b>away.</b> He could not take it when a woman lost herself in pleasure because he felt he must absolutely be in control of a situation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Underarm bowling was {{effective}} while pitch conditions were difficult for batsmen due to being uneven and uncovered. [...] In time, {{especially after the}} opening of Lord's {{and the development of}} groundsmanship, pitches began to improve and batsmen were able to play longer innings than formerly. [...] In the 1780s and 1790s, one of the best batsmen around was Tom Walker, who was also a very useful slow bowler. [...] Walker was another improviser like Lumpy and he began to experiment by bowling with his <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his body. [...] It is not clear how high he raised his hand {{but it could have been}} waist height. [...] He was accused of [...] "jerking" [...] the ball and so delivering it in an unfair and improper manner. [...] He was suitably censured for his trouble and was forced to return to his normal underarm lobs, but he had sown the seeds of bowling's next revolution.|$|E
2500|$|A pair of [...] long {{self-acting}} mules with 1320 spindles {{each would}} be tended by three employees: the minder or operative spinner, the big piecer, {{and the little}} piecer. The little piecer would start in the mulegate on his fourteenth birthday, and rise {{to the status of}} a minder. All these men worked barefoot, wearing white light cotton trousers. There were four basic tasks: creeling, doffing, cleaning and piecing. Creeling and piecing would both be done while the mule was in motion. Creeling was about replacing the bobbins in the creel while piecing the old disappearing thread with the new; it was done from behind the mule. Piecing was about joining any ends that had broken.The piecer would catch the snarled fuzzy broken end {{at the top of the}} spindle in his right hand and pull out some clean thread and wrap it around the left forefinger. This would be pressed into clean roving emerging from the attenuating rollers, pulling the <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> when the two had twisted together. All this was done while walking back and forth with the carriage, contact being made using the three of four seconds when the piecer was close enough to lean over the frame and reach the rollers. At this moment, left arm and leg forward, his crotch was adjacent to the base of the spindles.|$|E
5000|$|The slappee is on defense, and {{attempts}} to avoid having his hands slapped, by pulling his <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> as the slapper brings his hands over to attempt a slap. However, the slappee cannot flinch too much in attempting to avoid a slap. (On one variation of the game, if the slappee pulls his <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> when the slapper has not brought his hands around, then the slappee must submit to a [...] "free slap" [...] by the slapper.) ...|$|R
60|$|She {{wrenched}} her <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from his. There was a bright, {{red spot}} of colour flaring on her cheeks. Her {{eyes were on}} fire.|$|R
60|$|He hid {{his brow}} {{in his arms}} and groaned aloud. Softly Swanhild crept up to him--softly she drew his <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> holding them between her own.|$|R

6000|$|... "There, John," [...] she said, {{stretching}} her <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> {{over the}} fair plain of the Guadalquivir, {{as soon as}} we stood against the parapet; [...] "is not that lovely?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I haven't the remotest {{intention}} of {{making love to}} you," [...] he said, and pushed her soft face and <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from {{him as if he}} would stand up.|$|R
60|$|She {{pulled her}} <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> quickly, wide-eyed, {{and for some}} moments was silent.|$|E

60|$|She {{pulled her}} <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> and flung {{them up to}} her face, her form shaken by stormy sobs. In {{distress}} {{he put his arm}} about her and drew her closer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep your <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> altogether," [...] said Zeppa; [...] "you only delay me. There now, they're {{as tight}} as two masts. Hold on to me while I raise you up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't know me, papa," [...] said Flora, {{drawing her}} <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from him, and tightly {{clenching}} {{them in one}} another, as thoughts far too terrible for words swept over her.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the swift}} revulsion came, and she drew her <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> and sprang up.|$|E
60|$|The {{intruder}} {{moved his}} <b>hand</b> <b>away</b> from his eyes. His expression {{was full of}} wonder.|$|E

60|$|He disregarded her bidding to {{the extent}} of placing his arm around her waist. He made no attempt, however, to draw her <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from her face, or stop her tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oho, you're at it again! Take your <b>hands</b> <b>away,</b> {{and let me}} {{see your}} eyes. You always do that when I read a letter from her. I will write and tell her." ...|$|R
60|$|He put out {{his hands}} to take her, but she turned perversely from him, and hid her face in Annie's neck, pushing his <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> with a {{backward}} reach of her little arm.|$|R

6000|$|A cry of pain {{broke from}} the lad's lips, and he leaped to his feet, tearing his <b>hands</b> <b>away</b> from Lord Henry's grasp. [...] "Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not true! It {{is a horrible}} lie! How dare you say it?" ...|$|R
