5|$|After the season, disaffection {{within the}} Southern Conference {{prompted}} seven former members, including Maryland, {{to form the}} Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The schism was <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ban on bowl participation, and the vast geographic dispersion of and disparity between the sizes of member schools. Clemson, another founding ACC member, had likewise been forced to play outside the Southern Conference in 1952.|$|E
5|$|At {{no point}} during The Wrath of Khan are Khan and Kirk {{in the same}} location; they {{speak to each other}} only over {{communication}} links such as view screens. This was <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that the set of the Reliant was a redress of the Enterprise bridge, and the two actors' scenes were filmed four months apart. Montalbán recited his lines with a script assistant instead of to William Shatner.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{political}} conditions {{in what would}} become a united Kingdom of Italy only in 1861, the variation of apothecaries' systems and standard weights in this region was enormous.

5|$|During {{the decline}} of the Roman Empire and the Early Middle Ages, much of the quality {{breeding}} stock developed during the classical period was lost due to uncontrolled breeding and had to be built up again over the following centuries.

5|$|In 1956, Ford {{tried to}} revive the Continental brand as a {{standalone}} line of ultra luxury automobiles, but abandoned the attempt after the 1957 model year, by which time around 3000 Mark II cars had been built.

This significant reduction is <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> extensive media coverage that began in March 2012 about the additive.

5|$|In epileptic {{seizures}} a {{group of}} neurons begin firing in an abnormal, excessive, and synchronized manner. This results {{in a wave of}} depolarization known as a paroxysmal depolarizing shift. Normally, after an excitatory neuron fires it becomes more resistant to firing for a period of time. This is <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect of inhibitory neurons, electrical changes within the excitatory neuron, and the negative effects of adenosine.|$|E

5|$|According to Quirky, Wink {{products}} were in 300,000 homes by 2015. In April 2015 Wink experienced a security problem that made {{many of its}} hubs go offline or break, forcing the company to issue a recall. The recall caused a several-month inventory backlog and subsequent shortage of the Wink hub. Due to financial difficulties, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recall, Quirky began looking for buyers to sell Wink to in 2015. That November, after Quirky went through bankruptcy proceedings, it sold Wink for $15 million to Flextronics (now called Flex), to whom Quirky owed $18.7 million. Flex was Wink's primary supplier of firmware and hardware. Wink continues to operate as an independent subsidiary of Flex. As of 2016, 1.3 million devices are connected to Wink.|$|E
5|$|After traffic issues {{during the}} 2008 {{reconstruction}} {{work on the}} Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80million. The total $13.7million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7million, <b>due</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> work delays.|$|E
