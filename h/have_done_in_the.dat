5|$|We {{shot the}} clip in mid-October {{on a cold}} day in New York City. The vibe and feeling was great... It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past... I wanted to try and take everything we <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past and put it to the side.|$|E
25|$|While Via is an {{independent}} federal Crown corporation mandated to operate as a business, it is hindered {{by the fact that}} it was created by an Order in Council of the Privy Council, and not from legislation passed by Parliament. If Via were enabled by legislation, the company could be permitted to seek funding on the open money markets as other Crown corporations such as CN <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. It is largely for this reason that critics say Via is vulnerable to federal budget cuts and continues to answer first to its political masters, as opposed to the business decisions needed to ensure the viability of intercity passenger rail service.|$|E
25|$|Although Ahmadi Muslims {{believe that}} the Quran is the final message of God for mankind, they also believe that God {{continues}} to communicate with his chosen individuals {{in the same way}} he is believed to <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. All of God's attributes are eternal. In particular, Ahmadi Muslims believes that Muhammad brought prophethood to perfection and was the last law-bearing prophet and the apex of humankind's spiritual evolution. New prophets can come, but they must be completely subordinate to Muhammad and {{will not be able to}} exceed him in excellence nor alter his teaching or bring any new law or religion. They are also thought of as reflections of Muhammad rather than independently made into Prophets, like the Prophets of antiquity.|$|E

25|$|Colonel Henry Hildyard became Staff College Commandant in August 1893, {{beginning}} a {{reform of the}} institution, placing more emphasis on continuous assessment (including outdoor exercises) rather than examinations. Wilson also studied under Colonel George Henderson, who encouraged students to think about military history by asking what they would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place of the commanders. Whilst at the College he visited the battlefields of the Franco-Prussian War in March 1893. Rawlinson and Thomas D'Oyly Snow were often his study partners (Aylmer Haldane also claimed the same in his 1948 autobiography, {{but this is not}} corroborated by Wilson’s diary). Launcelot Kiggell was in the year below. Rawlinson and Wilson became close friends, often staying and socialising together, and Rawlinson introduced Wilson to Lord Roberts in May 1893, whilst both men were working on a scheme for the defence of India. Wilson became a protégé of Roberts.|$|E
25|$|In the Solar System both Jupiter and Saturn were {{probably}} crucial in perturbing comets {{into the inner}} Solar System. Here, the comets provided the inner planets with their own source of water and various other ices. In the Alpha Centauri system, Proxima Centauri may have influenced the planetary disk as the Alpha Centauri system was forming, enriching the area around Alpha Centauri A and B with volatile materials. This would be discounted if, for example, Alpha CentauriB happened to have gas giants orbiting Alpha CentauriA (or conversely, Alpha CentauriA for Alpha CentauriB), or if the stars B and A themselves were able to perturb comets into each other's inner system as Jupiter and Saturn presumably <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. Such icy bodies probably also reside in Oort clouds of other planetary systems, when they are influenced gravitationally by either the gas giants or disruptions by passing nearby stars many of these icy bodies then travel starwards. There is no direct evidence yet {{of the existence of}} such an Oort cloud around Alpha CentauriAB, and theoretically this may have been totally destroyed during the system's formation.|$|E
25|$|The post-shooting {{investigation}} found no weapons on Diallo's body; the item {{he had pulled}} out of his jacket was not a gun, but a rectangular black wallet. The internal NYPD investigation ruled the officers had acted within policy, based on what a reasonable police officer would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same circumstances with the information they had. The Diallo shooting led to a review of police training policy {{and the use of}} full metal jacket (FMJ) bullets. On March 25, 1999, a Bronx grand jury indicted the four officers on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment. All four officers' bail were set at $100,000. On December 16, an appellate court ordered a change of venue to Albany, New York, stating that pretrial publicity had made a fair trial in New York City impossible. On February 25, 2000, after two days of deliberation, a jury in Albany acquitted the officers of all charges. Officer Kenneth Boss had been previously involved in an incident where an unarmed man was shot. Another black man, 22-year-old Patrick Bailey, died after Boss shot him on October 31, 1997. As of 2012, Boss is the only remaining officer working for the NYPD. After his acquittal, Boss was disarmed and reassigned to desk duty. In October 2012, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly restored Boss' ability to carry a firearm against the protests of Diallo's family. On December 17, 2015, Kenneth Boss, received a promotion to the rank of sergeant despite objections from the victim’s mother and civil rights activists. Boss was promoted in accordance to police policy, which is not subject to review by top department officials.|$|E

500|$|At {{the heart}} of the castle is the 16th-century Henrician fortification. Built of a {{combination}} of granite ashlar and rubble, it comprises a circular keep surrounded by a gun platform, entered through a bridge and a forebuilding. The keep has [...] thick [...] walls and on in the inside is octagonal. The basement was originally a kitchen, cellar and larder for the castle. The ground floor was initially designed to be a gun room, complete with gun embrasures, but was altered during the initial construction project to form living accommodation for the garrison instead. Another gun room occupies the first floor, with seven gun embrasures, and is dressed to appear as it would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 16th century. The roof has seven gun embrasures and a lookout turret.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Eva Spence {{credited}} {{on how the}} Astraea was a {{lot more}} positive than their previous material due to having time off between tours and being able to relax in the writing process. [...] "I feel happier than I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past few years. I'm seeing things in a positive light and I hope the lyrics will be more uplifting" [...] In an interview with James Spence about the early writing process and how the lyrics have an essence of self-reflection as a common theme in the band's work, [...] "it's not something people normally look at or focus on; self-reflection as a theme, but if you ignore what's happening to you and how it's making you think about things then I don't think that's good." ...|$|E

500|$|We {{wanted the}} video {{to show her}} without artifice, {{in a way that}} her videos may not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past. There is a {{simplicity}} in the concept. For example, we love that she holds the handheld mic within the performance. The single cover was taken on the same day. We didn't want it to be a posed still or a [...] "fashion image", we wanted it to show movement and energy and for it to be about her and her performance. Gaga drove the Bronco herself in the video and her commitment to the performance and her authentic raw energy really came across in the way she drove! For us, as directors, it was scary and exciting at the same time—the energy and emotion were purely authentic.|$|E
500|$|During {{his meeting}} with fellow GE executives, in which Jack {{is not allowed to}} be with them due to his bedbugs condition, a {{telepresence}} system—a television screen in which the executives can be seen—is placed in Jack's office to witness the meeting. One of the executives (Michael Mulheren) asks Jack if he likes the Cisco Systems equipment, which he does, calling it [...] "the gold standard by which all business technology is judged. Cisco: The Human Network", then after an argument with the executives, they mute him, prompting Jack to say [...] "Did you just mute me!? Did you just use Cisco's cutting edge SureMute™ technology to mute me!?" [...] Some reviewers wondered whether or not 30 Rock continued doing more product placement with the addition of Cisco Systems, as they <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past with Snapple, Verizon, and SoyJoy.|$|E
500|$|Burnley {{explained}} that writing for Dark Before Dawn was intermittent and fragmentary, taking place throughout the hiatus, {{though it was}} {{toward the end of}} the hiatus in 2013 when it became cohesive. After growing frustrated with the lack of answers regarding his health condition, Burnley decided to abandon searching for a diagnosis and focus on the album. Recorded and produced at a personal studio of Burnley's, Dark Before Dawn is the first album with the front man credited as the producer. The singer stated that [...] "I would say that I did the same amount of producing on this album as I've done on other albums, just never had my name [...] ", adding, [...] "You know, I'm not doing anything different here than I <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.

500|$|Neither inquiry found {{negligence}} by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (the parent company) or the White Star Line (which owned Titanic) to be a factor. The US inquiry {{concluded that}} those involved had followed standard practice, and the disaster could thus only be categorised as an [...] "act of God", and the British inquiry concluded that Smith had followed long-standing practice {{which had not}} previously {{been shown to be}} unsafe (the inquiry noted that British ships alone had carried 3.5 million passengers over the previous decade with the loss of just 73 lives) and concluded that he had done [...] "only that which other skilled men would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same position". The British inquiry also warned that [...] "What was a mistake {{in the case of the}} Titanic would without doubt be negligence in any similar case in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, Mark Tooley, then {{director}} of the Institute on Religion and Democracy's (IRD) United Methodist committee, wrote an opinion piece about Jesus for President in the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard. Tooley is heavily critical {{of the book and}} of Claiborne, writing, [...] "On so many different levels, Claiborne lacks moral and spiritual perspective." [...] Tooley argues that Jesus for President is selective in its quotations from Church Fathers and instead relies heavily on the teachings of heterodox theologians, naming specifically Walter Brueggemann, John Dominic Crossan, and Walter Wink, people that Tooley writes would not [...] "inspire confidence in orthodox Christians." [...] While praising Claiborne's story of nonviolence in response to personally being trapped with a friend in an alley by criminals who hit them with sticks, Tooley criticizes Claiborne for not explaining what he would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of encountering a pregnant woman who was being similarly treated. Christopher Hitchens, an Anglo-American critic of religion, wrote an article in British tabloid newspaper the Sunday Express in response to Tooley's review. He calls Jesus for President [...] "a terrible-sounding book" [...] and Claiborne [...] "a terrible-sounding person." [...] Hitchens argues that Claiborne and Tooley are attempting to justify their own views by ascribing them to Jesus, with Claiborne arguing that a Jesus would have supported liberation theology and Tooley arguing that Jesus would have supported neoconservatism.|$|E
500|$|Steven Moffat {{contacted}} Chris Chibnall, {{asking him}} to return to writing for Doctor Who. Chibnall had previously written the Doctor Who episode [...] "42" [...] as well as episodes of the spin-off series Torchwood. Moffat and executive producer Piers Wenger gave him the brief of Silurians, a drill, and that it was a two-parter. The Silurians were villains who had previously appeared in the 1970 serial Doctor Who and the Silurians and the 1984 serial Warriors of the Deep. For research, Chibnall read the original novel Doctor Who and the Cave Monsters and watched the original serial, noting the freedom writer Malcolm Hulke took with the novel in things he could not <b>have</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> television format. Chibnall wanted there to be a large Silurian city in contrast to the small human village on the surface. Knowing that the Silurians were not as popular and recurring as other villains, Moffat instructed Chibnall to bring the creatures to a new audience, and Chibnall decided to start out with knowing nothing about them and then introducing them in [...] "the most exciting and scary way possible for people who've never seen them before". Chibnall also considered bringing back the Silurians' amphibious cousins the Sea Devils, but decided that doing two races of monster was much tougher and the story was [...] "so clearly about the Silurians and what the Silurians want".|$|E

50|$|Bulleid {{rejected}} {{a number of}} variants before deciding on CC1's configuration. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> 0-6-6-0 wheel arrangement ultimately chosen, he considered an 0-4-4-0 and a six-axle locomotive with only four axles driven. Before deciding to mount the steam engines on the bogies (as he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Leader), he investigated the idea of engines mounted on the main frame and driving the bogies via shafts or gears (see Geared steam locomotive). Bulleid intended {{to make use of}} sleeve valves, as he <b>had</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Leader, and sought advice from Sir Harry Ricardo on the matter. However, he ultimately reverted to piston valves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of political pressure to make progress on the locomotive's development.|$|R

[...] Following the quick removal of the messages, Berger commented that Carey had been [...] "obviously exhausted and not thinking clearly" [...] when she posted the letters. On July26, she was hospitalized, citing [...] "extreme exhaustion" [...] and a [...] "physical and emotional breakdown". News websites and programs began reporting how Carey threatened to commit suicide by slitting her wrists the night before, and how Patricia, Carey's mother, hastily called for help. When questioned regarding Carey's suicidal rumor, Berger claimed she had broken dishes out of desperation, and as a result, accidentally cut her hands and feet. Carey was inducted at an un-disclosed hospital in Connecticut, and remained hospitalized and under doctor's care for two weeks, followed by an extended absence from the public. Following the heavy media coverage surrounding Carey's publicized breakdown and hospitalization, Virgin Records America and 20th Century Fox delayed the release of both Glitter, as well as its soundtrack of the same name.|$|E
