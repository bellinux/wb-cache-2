5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the <b>hearing</b> <b>room</b> for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E

500|$|In November 1967, Gittings and Kameny worked {{together}} as co-counsel in hearings {{held by the}} Department of Defense to discredit an expert witness named Dr. Charles Socarides, who testified that homosexuals could be converted to heterosexuality, and to call in question the policy held by the Department of Defense that homosexual employees could be fired for being named as homosexuals.

[...] "We held press conferences {{for the benefit of}} sharp-eyed reporters.

A 1926 portrayal of Queen Calafia and her Amazons is found in a mural in the Room of the Dons at the Mark Hopkins Hotel in San Francisco.

Despite the group's many public statements supporting local control of schools, Tuck later remarked {{that the purpose of the}} plan was to prevent integration anywhere in Virginia: [...] "If they [...] won't stand with us then I say make 'em. We cannot compromise. ... If you ever let them integrate anywhere the whole state will be integrated in a short time." [...] Byrd in particular was a vocal supporter of the school closing proposal, and helped draft the other proposals in the plan.|$|E
500|$|The Manhattan Engineer District (MED) was {{formally}} {{established by the}} Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold on 16 August 1942. The name was chosen by Groves and MED's district engineer, Colonel James C. Marshall. Like other engineer districts, it was named after the city where its headquarters was located, at 270 Broadway. Unlike the others, however, it had no geographic boundaries, only a mission: to develop an atomic bomb. Moreover, Marshall had the authority of a division engineer head and reported directly to Reybold. Although Reybold was satisfied with the progress being made, Dr. Vannevar Bush was less so. He felt that aggressive leadership was required, and suggested {{the appointment of a}} prestigious officer as overall project director. Somervell, now Chief of Army Service Forces, recommended Groves. Somervell met Groves outside the <b>hearing</b> <b>room</b> where Groves had been testifying before a United States Congress committee on military housing and informed him that [...] "The Secretary of War has selected you for a very important assignment, and the President has approved the selection... If you do the job right, it will win the war." [...] Groves could not hide his disappointment at not receiving a combat assignment: [...] "Oh, that thing," [...] he replied.|$|E
