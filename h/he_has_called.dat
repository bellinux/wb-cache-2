5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the flagship stations listed above, Rangers games can be heard on affiliates throughout much of Texas, and also in parts of Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louisiana, and New Mexico. Eric Nadel is the primary play-by-play announcer. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> games for the club since 1979 beginning on television broadcasts, then moving exclusively to radio beginning in 1985. He became the primary announcer after the late Mark Holtz moved to television. Currently, Nadel provides play-by-play in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, 8th, and 9th innings, and color commentary for the other innings. On December 11, 2013, {{he was awarded the}} 2014 Ford C.

He joined the broadcast in 2012 after Steve Busby moved from radio to television to replace Dave Barnett.

Jared Sandler hosts the pre-game and post-game shows, and also fills in whenever Nadel or Hicks have a day off.

While Affleck believes paparazzi attention is [...] "part of the deal" [...] of stardom, he has spoken out against paparazzi interest in his children. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> for legislation to require paparazzi to maintain a certain distance from children and to blur their faces in published photos.|$|E

Nesbitt was a vocal opponent of Malcolm Glazer's 2005 takeover of Manchester United, though after the completion of that deal he acted in television advertisements promoting executive boxes at Old Trafford, for which he was criticised by fans.

500|$|Peart {{has often}} been {{categorized}} as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song [...] "Anthem" [...] and the album 2112; the latter specifically credited Rand's work. However, in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, while contending the [...] "individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty," [...] Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview, when asked if Rand's words still speak to him, Peart replied, [...] "Oh, no. That was forty years ago. But {{it was important to}} me at the time in a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile." [...] Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Tryism," [...] which means that anything that one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough.|$|E
500|$|Thorpe's success led to {{allegations}} of drug doping in 2000, which arose again in 2007. Specifically {{he was accused}} of using banned performance-enhancing steroids. Prior to the 2000 Olympics, the head coach and captain of Germany's swimming team accused Thorpe of cheating, that his physical attributes were symptomatic of steroid use and that his ability to exceed prior records believed to be drug-fuelled made his feats worthy of suspicion. In 2007, the French sports newspaper L'Équipe claimed that Thorpe [...] "showed 'abnormal levels' of two banned substances in a doping test". Thorpe denied the charges and the Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) confirmed that they had investigated Thorpe in the past, for abnormal levels of testosterone and luteinising hormone (LH), but had dismissed the result. FINA dropped its investigation and closed the case. Thorpe has never been found to have been doping, and has steadfastly denied the allegations while also being prominent in the campaign against drug use. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>called</b> for the introduction of blood testing, promised to surrender a frozen sample for retrospective testing and repeatedly criticised FINA for drug-testing procedures that he regards as inadequate.|$|E
