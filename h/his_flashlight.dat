5|$|The {{object of}} Silent Hill 2 is to guide player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he {{searches}} for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James {{moving in the}} direction that he is facing when the player tilts the analog stick upwards. Silent Hill 2 does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.|$|E

When Johns asked why he was not stopping, he would change the subject. When the driver finally stopped at an intersection, Johns jumped out with her daughter and hid in a field. The driver searched for her using <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> telling her {{that he would not}} hurt her, before eventually giving up. Unable to find her, he got back into the car and drove off. Johns hitched a ride to the police station in Patterson.|$|E

500|$|The comic {{contains}} many references to events and {{objects in the}} game. In one comic, Frohman makes a clerical error that causes the Combine to order far too many explosive barrels, thus suggesting {{an explanation for the}} barrels' ubiquity throughout City 17 and beyond. In another, he writes a letter to Dr. Breen asking why using <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> reduces his ability to run, a reference to Half-Life 2s flashlight and sprint functions using the same power source. In a further strip, the town of Ravenholm becomes the headcrab-infested ghost town seen in Half-Life 2 after Frohman writes to Breen expressing his happiness with being there, giving away Ravenholm's location. [...] Indeed, Frohman causes (intentionally or accidentally) many of the disastrous circumstances that Gordon Freeman runs across. He accidentally gives Breen the idea of headcrab shells while on a radio, and sets up all of the traps in Ravenholm himself in an attempt to catch Father Grigori.|$|E
500|$|Batman subdues the Joker {{and tells}} him that Gordon survived the Joker's torments, and {{suggests}} that the Joker is alone in his madness. He attempts {{to reach out to}} the Joker and offers to help him recover in order to end their everlasting war, which Batman fears may one day result in a fight to the death. The Joker declines, saying it is too late..."far too late". He then says that this situation reminds him of a joke about two inmates in a lunatic asylum who try to escape. One inmate jumps across a narrow gap between the asylum and the adjoining building, but the other is afraid he will fall. The first inmate offers to shine <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> across the gap so the other can walk across it, but the second inmate replies, [...] "What do you think I am, crazy? You'd turn it off when I was halfway across!" [...] Batman chuckles at the punch line, and the two old foes laugh as the police arrive.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} capture ghosts, Luigi must first use <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> {{to light up}} the ghost and stun it, {{revealing}} their heart. When this happens, players use the Poltergust 3000 to suck them up, steadily reducing the ghost's hit points to zero; the more hit points, the more {{time it takes for}} a ghost to be captured, giving them a chance to break free while leaving Luigi more exposed to being harmed; if his HP is reduced to zero from being hurt by the ghosts, the game is over. Once a ghost's HP is reduced to zero, they are captured. Some ghosts cannot be captured easily until Luigi locates three special medallions, each granting the Poltergust with the ability to suck up certain elements from the rooms and use them to capture special ghosts lying within the mansion. In addition to capturing the regular ghosts in the mansion, Luigi must also draw out special, [...] "portrait ghosts" [...] from some rooms, each requiring a condition be met to make them available for capture. Once all the ghosts in a room are captured, it brightens up; the music also changes, being pleasantly whistled by Luigi, while being haunted and spooky when filled with ghosts, with Luigi humming nervously to the tune.|$|E

2500|$|Lemon's dog ran ahead out {{of sight}} and {{suddenly}} began barking, and moments later ran back to the group with its tail between its legs. After traveling about [...] the group reached the top of a hill, where they reportedly saw a large pulsating [...] "ball of fire" [...] about [...] to their right. They also detected a pungent mist that made their eyes and noses burn. Lemon then noticed two small lights over {{to the left of the}} object, underneath a nearby oak tree and directed <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> towards them, revealing the creature, which May reported as bounding towards them. Other sources describe it as emitting a shrill hissing noise before gliding towards them, changing direction and then heading off towards the red light. At this point the group fled in panic.|$|E

It was difficult as Strand was forced to put down his backpack, drag the sled a distance {{and then return to}} walk back to bring forth the backpack. As he could not wear his skis, it was a strenuous exercise. The hauling proved futile, and instead Strand decided to return to the station for help. [...] He left <b>his</b> <b>flashlight</b> with Olsen so that he could find him again, although even with this aid relocating the stranded survivor proved difficult, as this part of Bjørnøya is flat and there were no visual references to help orient the searchers. Strand did not return until morning, and Olsen was getting wetter and colder as he waited for help. In the end Olsen decided that further help would not come in time and started following Strand's footsteps, but he soon had to give up, having traversed about [...] Three of the four crew at the station returned and transported Olsen to safety. (As the station needed to remain manned at all times, one of the crew was forced to stay behind.) Olsen reached the station at 13:00 on 29 March.|$|E

25|$|After {{fending off}} another coordinated assault, the Marines were low on ammunition, {{and all of}} them had been wounded by that point. While the {{frustrated}} pilots circled the area without being able to see clear targets, a C-47 deployed flares for illumination at around 01:00. Early into the morning, as Marines traded taunts with the enemy, the pilots began dangerously close attack missions, including one Air Force F105, Marine F8U Crusaders, and helicopter gunships.

40|$|First and foremost, I {{thank my}} supervisor, Dr. Daniel Chan. After much {{patience}} on his part, I eventually gained perspective and direction for my {{approach to this}} thesis.

Moments later the deputy is murdered, killed with <b>his</b> own <b>flashlight.</b> Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) later examine the deputy's body: the blow that killed the man was so ferocious that his glasses were pushed {{through the back of}} his skull. They question the suspect, teenager Tony Reed, whose fingerprints were found on the flash light, but he denies any part in the murder. Mulder and Scully agree that Tony is innocent, although Mulder's theory of spirit involvement is not shared by Scully. Scully, on the other hand, suggests they question Tony's friends. Mulder and Scully visit Tony's school and speak with the two teenagers who were with Tony in the woods: the sheriff's son, Max Harden, and his girlfriend Chastity. Chastity seems concerned about Tony when Mulder and Scully tell her he may go to jail. However, Tony is later released when the murder weapon mysteriously goes missing from the evidence room. Mulder and Scully review video footage from the evidence room that shows the flashlight simply disappear. However, a blur on the video footage attracts Mulder's attention and later analysis by an expert reveals the blurred object is solid and matches the local high school's colors.|$|R

And in the midst of the stories of engineering problemsand political deals is a chapter entitled [...] "Alligators in the Sewers" [...] (see pp. 187-189). It is basedon the author's interviews with Teddy May, who had been Commissioner of Sewers in NewYork for some thirty years.According to May, sewer inspectors first reported seeing alligators in 1935, but neither Maynor anyone else believed them. [...] "Instead, he set men to watch the sewer walkers to find outhow they were obtaining whisky down in the pipes." [...] Persistent reports, however, perhaps includingthe newspaper item discovered by Coleman, caused May to go down to find out forhimself. He found that the reports were true. [...] "The beam of <b>his</b> own <b>flashlight</b> had spotlightedalligators whose length, on the average, was about two feet."May started an extermination campaign, using poisoned bait followed by flooding of theside tunnels to flush the beasts out into the major arteries where hunters with [...]22 rifles werewaiting. He announced in 1937 that the 'gators were gone. Reported sightings in 1948 and1966 were not confirmed.However, there is no mention of [...] "blind, albino" [...] alligators, and May suggests that the babyalligators were dumped down storm drains rather than [...] "flushed down the toilet".|$|R
