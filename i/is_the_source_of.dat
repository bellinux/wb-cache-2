5|$|The {{south side}} of the {{mountain}} along Suksdorf Ridge is moderately glacier-free, with the only glaciers being the relatively small Gotchen Glacier and the Crescent Glacier. The south side, however, does have some perennial snowfields on its slopes. The Crescent Glacier <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Morrison Creek; and, although it does not feed it directly, the Gotchen Glacier <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> Gotchen Creek. Both creeks drain to the White Salmon River.|$|E

25|$|Wikileaks has {{promoted}} conspiracy {{theories about the}} murder of Seth Rich. Unfounded conspiracy theories, spread by some right-wing figures and media outlets, hold that Rich <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> leaked emails and was killed for working with Wikileaks. Wikileaks fueled the conspiracy theories by offering a reward of $20,000 {{for information leading to}} the capture of Rich's killer and hinting that Rich may have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaked emails. No evidence supports the claim that Rich <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaks.|$|R

5|$|They {{discover}} that an unknown source of Eichner radiation {{is causing the}} growth. Separately, Ian (R.J. Williams), now appearing as an eight-year-old, confides to Troi that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the crew's problems {{and will have to}} leave. Troi realizes Ian is dying and calls for medical assistance. As Pulaski tries to keep Ian alive, Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) scans him and discovers that he <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> radiation. Ian dies in Troi's arms, and turns into a ball of energy, which settles into Troi's hands, communicating telepathically with her for a moment, then leaves the ship. The lifeform told her that he wished to learn about humans through experiencing standard human development and living among the crew. With Ian gone, the plague sample returns to normal and the crew continues on their mission.|$|E
5|$|Adams <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the {{headwaters}} for two major rivers, the Lewis River and White Salmon River. The many streams that emanate from the glaciers and from springs {{at its base}} flow into two more major river systems, the Cispus River and the Klickitat River. The streams on {{the north and west}} portions of Adams feed the Cispus River, which joins the Cowlitz River near Riffe Lake, and the Lewis River.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake a trail of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the Orionid shower in October.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure {{indicated that the}} longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — {{a tenth of the}} animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture {{of the head and neck}} would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has had a}} broad {{impact on}} popular culture, both in the United States and elsewhere. Dozens of English-language idioms have been derived from baseball; in particular, the game <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> a number of widely used sexual euphemisms. The first {{networked}} radio broadcasts in North America were of the 1922 World Series: famed sportswriter Grantland Rice announced play-by-play from New York City's Polo Grounds on WJZ–Newark, New Jersey, which was connected by wire to WGY–Schenectady, New York, and WBZ–Springfield, Massachusetts. The baseball cap has become a ubiquitous fashion item {{not only in the}} United States and Japan, but also in countries where the sport itself is not particularly popular, such as the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|Satyrs and nymphs form two {{extremes}} in Greek mythology, which are united {{only by their}} instinctive natures.

5|$|Because their {{elliptical}} orbits frequently {{take them}} {{close to the}} giant planets, comets are subject to further gravitational perturbations. Short-period comets have a tendency for their aphelia to coincide with a giant planet's semi-major axis, with the JFCs being the largest group. It is clear that comets {{coming in from the}} Oort cloud often have their orbits strongly influenced by the gravity of giant planets {{as a result of a}} close encounter. Jupiter <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the greatest perturbations, being more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. These perturbations can deflect long-period comets into shorter orbital periods.|$|E
5|$|In the city, Argante and Armida, {{in danger}} {{from a common}} enemy, become {{reconciled}} and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After a struggle for supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.|$|E
5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the durable myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E

5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that G-spot and clitoral orgasms are of the same origin. Masters and Johnson {{were the first to}} determine that the clitoral structures surround and extend along and within the labia. Upon studying women's sexual response cycle to different stimulation, they observed that both clitoral and vaginal orgasms had the same stages of physical response, and found that the majority of their subjects could only achieve clitoral orgasms, while a minority achieved vaginal orgasms. On this basis, Masters and Johnson argued that clitoral stimulation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> both kinds of orgasms, reasoning that the clitoris is stimulated during penetration by friction against its hood.|$|E
5|$|Sophie, a young milliner, {{encounters}} a wizard named Howl {{on her way}} to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the country. She meets a scarecrow, whom she decides to call 'Turnip Head'. He leads her to Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice, Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the castle's energy and magic. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that Calcifer let her in, and she has hired herself as a cleaning lady for the house.|$|E
5|$|The Government runs {{under the}} {{framework}} {{established by the}} Constitution of Japan, adopted in 1947. It is a unitary state, containing forty-seven administrative divisions, with the Emperor as its head of state. His role is ceremonial {{and he has no}} powers related to Government. Instead, it is the Cabinet, composing of the Ministers of State and the Prime Minister, that directs and controls the Government. The Cabinet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> power of the Executive branch, and is formed by the Prime Minister, who is the head of government. He or she is designated by the National Diet and appointed to office by the Emperor.|$|E

5|$|The benevolence of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury also {{extended}} to the ownership and use of Lough Neagh, {{which is the largest}} freshwater lake in the British Isles and ranks among the 40 largest lakes of Europe. Five of the six counties of Northern Ireland have shores on the lough (only County Fermanagh does not), and its area is split among them. The lake <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> 40percent of Northern Ireland's drinking water. While this ownership could feasibly increase the financial outlook of the family estate, at Shaftesbury's insistence, water continues to be extracted from the lough at no charge to either the citizens or civic government of Northern Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The most {{extensive}} {{account of the}} life of Domitian to survive was written by the historian Suetonius, who was born during the reign of Vespasian, and published his works under Emperor Hadrian (117–138). His De Vita Caesarum <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> much of what is known of Domitian. Although his text is predominantly negative, it neither exclusively condemns nor praises Domitian, and asserts that his rule started well, but gradually declined into terror. The biography is problematic however, in that it appears to contradict itself with regards to Domitian's rule and personality, at the same time presenting him as a conscientious, moderate man, and as a decadent libertine.|$|E
5|$|A world {{containing}} {{creatures who}} are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't cause or determine {{them to do}} only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not {{do what is right}} freely. To create creatures capable of moral good, therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil {{and at the same time}} prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> <b>of</b> moral evil. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.|$|E
