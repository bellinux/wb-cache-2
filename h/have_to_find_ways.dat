My family name is Sam Watson, so that’s my legal name, my government name, to me it meant more of me. A lot of people know me from Tech N9ne’s music from the last 13 years you know, so I’ve always been kind of his co-writer, his sidekick, his hypeman. Travis O’Guin, who co founded Strange Music alongside Tech N9ne more than a decade ago, has been the business partner, I’ve always been Tech’s creative partner. So the more I put out albums the more I was becoming an individual artist. So I always wanted to do an album called Son Of Sam because it felt like to me {{a little bit of a}} liberation, not that I needed to be freed from that because that’s been a system that groomed me into being Krizz Kaliko. I’m giving you more of me and that’s pretty much where the title came from." [...] He also explained how he tries to reinvent himself every album, saying: [...] "I think that when you’re an artist like myself or Tech N9ne who have a fanbase and have people that are just loyal to us for years, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>ways</b> to reinvent yourself every album and that’s what I did again with Son Of Sam. I wanna keep that core audience engaged. They love to hear me talk about what I’m going through in my life at the time and that makes it even easier to write, these albums kind of write themselves. I go through mental issues and a lot of people do, I think that’s what ended up engaging a core fanbase for me, I started having songs like ‘Anxiety’ and ‘Bipolar,’ so I just talk about that and all of sudden people are like, ‘Wow, I got the same problem too.’ So I engage them on a common playing field about emotional and mental disorders which I think all creative people have and I try to give them something new." ...|$|E
