5|$|Franklin County, {{which has}} elected Kilroy twice, makes up 87% of the 15th Congressional {{district}}. The 2006 race in Ohio's 15th district gained significant national attention {{as it was}} seen {{as one of a}} handful of seats that Democrats had an opportunity to gain from Republicans. As of mid-October, the race was generally considered to be a toss-up largely due to incumbent Representative Pryce's leadership in the Republican Party. Pryce had not had a close contest since her first election in 1992 and had garnered 10% more of the vote than George W. Bush in 2004. However, Pryce was vulnerable due to Ohio Republican Party (Bob Taft and Bob Ney) scandals, the lagging Ohio economy, her association with controversial <b>Dennis</b> <b>Hastert</b> and Mark Foley, and backlash to Republican support of the Iraq War. Another Ohio Republican scandal in the minds of Ohio voters during the 2006 campaign was the Coingate scandal. Pryce and the Republicans had to keep conservative independent, Charles Morrison, off the ballot to have their best shot at success. A month before the election, Pryce was 12points behind Kilroy. On the eve of the election, some experts, such as Time, considered Pryce the underdog. Kilroy was expected to be the beneficiary of the decade-long migration of conservative voters to suburbs outside of the district.|$|E

After leaving the House and returning to private medical practice, Coburn wrote Breach of Trust, with ghostwriter John Hart, about his experiences in Congress. The book detailed Coburn's perspective on the internal Republican Party debates over the Contract With America and displayed his disdain for career politicians. Some of the figures he criticized (such as Gingrich) were already out of office {{at the time of the}} book's publishing, but others (such as former House Speaker <b>Dennis</b> <b>Hastert)</b> remained influential in Congress, which resulted in speculation that some congressional Republicans wanted no part of Coburn's return to politics.|$|E
