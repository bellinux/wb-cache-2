5|$|Portia de Rossi as Veronica Palmer: Veronica is Ted's {{boss and}} {{immediate}} supervisor at Veridian Dynamics. She maintains a fierce and unapproachable workplace demeanor, and many employees {{have a deep}} fear of her. She seems cold and calculating, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> she has more than grudging respect for Ted, and often recognizes what moral action is necessary to maintain balance in the workplace. An ongoing subplot touched on sporadically in the first season but more frequently in the second sees Veronica becoming a mentor to Linda and, to a lesser degree, Rose.|$|E
5|$|Skara Brae, Maeshowe, the Ring of Brodgar and the Stones of Stenness {{together}} {{form the}} Heart of Neolithic Orkney UNESCO World Heritage Site {{in the western}} part of the Orkney Mainland and which was inscribed in 1999. This small area has provided a rich archaeological heritage in a location that is relatively remote from both the main centres of population in Scotland and from more densely populated parts of Europe. However, it would be a mistake to imagine that because Orkney is so placed today that this was always so. There is a substantial amount of evidence that suggests that a variety of the smaller islands in the British Isles developed an advanced society in the Neolithic that took several centuries longer to develop on the mainland of Great Britain. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> whilst the flow of ideas and technologies in Britain has often been from the south to the north, that at this time, it is evident that Orkney played a significant role in the development of British Neolithic culture.|$|E

50|$|According to McMaster University {{political}} scientist Henry Jacek, political contributions {{tend to come}} from the wealthy, and not the poor. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> from other jurisdictions in the world that political donors typically are people that have more disposable income.|$|R

25|$|Additionally, these {{vascular}} {{interventions are}} often done only after {{an individual is}} symptomatic, often already partially disabled, {{as a result of}} the disease. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> both angioplasty and bypass interventions do not prevent future heart attack.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> {{the tomb}} was re-entered {{at a later}} time, almost {{certainly}} during the 20th Dynasty. At this time, any additional, hypothetical occupants of the tomb would have been removed and (possibly) relocated to KV35, while the remaining mummy {{and some of the}} other artefacts were desecrated and abandoned.|$|E
50|$|These are {{the basic}} {{directives}} of the Sharia regarding the waiting period of a widow. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> from another directive of the Qur'an that during this waiting period, the woman should not be turned out of her house.|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{consider}} x and x+dx along {{a minimum}} cost path. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> from (3) and (23) that θ= 0. Since both x and x+dx {{are on a}} minimum cost path, dx and thus ∇T are tangent to the minimum cost path.|$|R
25|$|Wetti's visions provide {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} Frankish perceptions of the afterlife, its appearance, and the punishments reserved for sinners. Furthermore, what explicitly appears in Wetti's visions not only reveals {{a great deal about}} his perspectives on wealth, lust, gender relations and monastic responsibility, but also the degree to which these issues (excluding monasticism) pervaded all levels of lay and religious officialdom in 9th-century Carolingian France. Clearly, he saw these as something debasing and degrading Frankish society, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> because of his monastic training in humility, he felt all but unable to speak out against them.|$|E
25|$|Increases in the {{security}} surrounding rich infrastructure targets in Britain also had a major effect on IRA team's ability to conduct operations. The seizure of war material and inability to get newly acquired war material into Britain under wartime restrictions meant increased improvisation, which in turn led to increased exposure to discovery. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the campaign generated {{a good deal of}} anti-Irish sentiment, which increased the British public's suspicion of Irish people in general. All these factors led to attacks tapering off around early to mid-1940. The death of Seán Russell on 14 August 1940, (he had already been effectively incommunicado since April 1939), and the succession of Stephen Hayes as IRA Chief of Staff also contributed to the petering out of the attacks.|$|E
25|$|Scott {{relied on}} depots much less {{frequently}} laid out. For one distance where Amundsen laid seven depots, Scott laid only two. Routes {{were marked by}} the walls made at lunch and evening stops to protect the ponies. Depots had a single flag. As a result, Scott has much concern recorded in his diaries over route finding, and experienced close calls about finding depots. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> Scott's team did not travel on several days, because the swirling snow hid their three-month-old outward tracks. With better depot and route marking {{they would have been}} able to travel on more days with a following wind which would have filled the sail attached to their sledge, and so travel further, and might have reached safety.|$|E
50|$|But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> rocket attacks {{devastated the}} morale of enemy troops - many {{vehicles}} were found abandoned intact, or with only superficial damage. Interrogation of captured prisoners showed that even the prospect of rocket attack was extremely unnerving for them.|$|R
50|$|There {{are clearly}} many New Zealanders who do see {{themselves}} as distinctly and distinctively Maori - but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> there <b>are</b> few, if any, fully Maori left here. There {{has been a lot}} of intermarriage and that has been welcome.|$|R

25|$|Failure of the South Vietnamese {{leadership}} {{to develop an}} effective political narrative and civil/military administration. Some of this failure {{grew out of the}} difficult conditions in which South Vietnam was initially established, with a weak political and military organization that compared poorly with the well-oiled machine of the North. This initial weakness was also reflected in political instability, endemic corruption, inefficient administration and military incompetence. Despite these vulnerabilities however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> millions of South Vietnamese opposed the takeover of their society by a communist dictatorship and fought resolutely against this outcome. The American failure was marked by its own set of shortcomings and miscalculations, but was inextricably linked to South Vietnamese difficulties, some historians maintain. Ultimate settlement of the conflict was between the Vietnamese.|$|E
25|$|If {{references}} are made, the Court of Justice {{will give a}} preliminary ruling, {{in order for the}} member state court to conclude the case and award a remedy. The right to an effective remedy is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights article 47. Most of the time Regulations and Directives will set out the relevant remedies to be awarded, or they will be construed from the legislation according to the practices of the member state. It could also be that the government is responsible for failure to properly implement a Directive or Regulation, and must therefore pay damages. In Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state's violation of EU and a claimant's loss, damages must be paid. The fact that the incompatible law is an Act of Parliament is no defence. So, in Factortame it was irrelevant that Parliament had legislated to require a quota of British ownership of fishing vessels in primary legislation. Similarly, in was Brasserie du Pêcheur v Germany the German government was liable to a French beer company for damages from prohibiting its imports, which did not comply with the fabled beer purity law. It was not decisive that the German Parliament had not acted willfully or negligently. It was merely necessary that there was (1) a rule intended to confer rights, (2) that a breach was sufficiently serious, and (3) there was a causal link between the breach and damage. The Court of Justice advised a breach is to be regarded as 'sufficiently serious' by weighing a range of factors, such as whether it was voluntary, or persistent. In Köbler v Republik Österreich the Court of Justice added that member state liability could also flow from judges failing to adequately implement the law. On the other hand, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> EU institutions, such as the Commission, may be liable according to the same principles for failure to follow the law. The only institution whose decisions appear incapable of generating a damages claim is the Court of Justice itself.|$|E
500|$|The {{nature of}} the afterlife which the dead person enjoyed is {{difficult}} to define, because of the differing traditions within Ancient Egyptian religion. In the Book of the Dead, the dead were taken into {{the presence of the}} god Osiris, who was confined to the subterranean Duat. There are also spells to enable the ba or akh of the dead to join Ra as he travelled the sky in his sun-barque, and help him fight off Apep. As well as joining the Gods, the Book of the Dead also depicts the dead living on in the 'Field of Reeds', a paradisiac likeness of the real world. The Field of Reeds is depicted as a lush, plentiful version of the Egypt of the living. There are fields, crops, oxen, people and waterways. The deceased person is shown encountering the Great Ennead, a group of gods, as well as his or her own parents. While the depiction of the Field of Reeds is pleasant and plentiful, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> manual labour is required. For this reason burials included a number of statuettes named shabti, or later ushebti. These statuettes were inscribed with a spell, also included in the Book of the Dead, requiring them to undertake any manual labour that might be the owner's duty in the afterlife. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the dead not only went to a place where the gods lived, but that they acquired divine characteristics themselves. In many occasions, the deceased is mentioned as [...] "The Osiris – [...] " [...] in the Book of the Dead.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> why the Ekklesia appears {{together}} with the Anthropos. With this is associated {{the community of the}} faithful and the redeemed, who are to share the same fate with him. Perfect gnosis (and thus the whole body of Gnostics) is connected with the Anthropos.|$|R

500|$|A women's lodge {{existed in}} Boston {{during the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century. Hannah Mather Crocker, in an apology for Freemasonry written in 1815, claims to have presided over such a lodge, yet her description, [...] "founded on the {{original}} principles of true ancient masonry, as far as was consistent with the female character" [...] leaves the actual constitution open to question. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> St. Anne's lodge was extinct at the time of her writing about it. Crocker’s leadership of this exclusively female Masonic lodge stands as an alternative to historical frameworks that emphasize the formal political exclusion and public silencing of women in the development of republican, liberal political practice in the West.|$|E
500|$|In 1898 {{and again}} in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and {{wrote a book about}} his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, {{enabling}} the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. [...] "For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp what it is that brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> {{from other}} {{writings}} and historical artefacts, that Socrates {{was not simply}} a character, nor an invention, of Plato. The testimony of Xenophon and Aristotle, alongside some of Aristophanes' work (especially The Clouds), is useful in fleshing out a perception of Socrates beyond Plato's work.|$|R

5000|$|Bazargan {{resigned}} {{along with}} his cabinet on 4 November 1979 following the US Embassy takeover and hostage-taking. His resignation was considered a protest against the hostage-taking and a recognition of his government's inability to free the hostages, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> that his hopes for liberal democracy and an accommodation with the West would not prevail.|$|R
500|$|Because {{the first}} forty {{official}} copies {{are made of}} the same alloy as the IPK and are stored under similar conditions, periodic verifications using {{a large number of}} replicas—especially the national primary standards, which are rarely used—can convincingly demonstrate the stability of the IPK. What has become clear after the third periodic verification performed between 1988 and 1992 is that masses of the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes have been slowly but inexorably diverging from each other. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the mass of the IPK lost perhaps 50µg over the last century, and possibly significantly more, in comparison to its official copies. The reason for this drift has eluded physicists who have dedicated their careers to the SI unit of mass. No plausible mechanism has been proposed to explain either a steady decrease in the mass of the IPK, or an increase in that of its replicas dispersed throughout the world. This relative nature of the changes amongst the world's kilogram prototypes is often misreported in the popular press, and even some notable scientific magazines, which often state that the IPK simply [...] "lost 50µg" [...] and omit the very important caveat of [...] "in comparison to its official copies".Even well respected organizations incorrectly represent the relative nature of the mass divergence as being one of mass loss, as exemplified by , and , and [...] The root of the problem is often the reporters' failure to correctly interpret or paraphrase nuanced scientific concepts, as exemplified by [...] by the Associated Press published on PhysOrg.com. In that AP story, Richard Davis—who used to be the NIST's kilogram specialist and now works for the BIPM in France—was correctly quoted by the AP when he stated that the mass change is a relative issue. Then the AP summarized the nature of issue with this lead-in to the story: [...] "A kilogram just isn't what it used to be. The 118-year-old cylinder that is the international prototype for the metric mass, kept tightly under lock and key outside Paris, is mysteriously losing weight— if ever so slightly". Like many of the above-linked sites, the AP also misreported the age of the IPK, using the date of its adoption as the mass prototype, not the date of the cylinder's manufacture. This is a mistake even Scientific American fell victim to in a print edition. Moreover, there are no technical means available {{to determine whether or not}} the entire worldwide ensemble of prototypes suffers from even greater long-term trends upwards or downwards because their mass [...] "relative to an invariant of nature is unknown at a level below 1000µg over a period of 100 or even 50 years". Given the lack of data identifying which of the world's kilogram prototypes has been most stable in absolute terms, it is equally valid to state that the first batch of replicas has, as a group, gained an average of about 25µg over one hundred years in comparison to the IPK.|$|E
2500|$|Harvey {{appointed}} Master Peter Giles Pickernell {{to command}} Alexandria. According to a biography, he commanded her for four years. In her {{he spent much}} of his time carrying despatches for Admiral Harvey, and then later Harvey's successor Lord Hugh Seymour. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> there was apparently a break in his command.|$|E
2500|$|There can be {{no doubt}} that the Heuneburg and its {{associated}} monuments are one of the most important centres of the early Celtic Iron Age in Central Europe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> the site should be seen in a context with other prominent centres of its time, the so-called Fürstensitze (German: [...] "princely seats" [...] - see below).|$|E
