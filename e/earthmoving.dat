25|$|In literature, {{not much}} {{information}} {{can be found on}} the relations between the various regular surface field drainage systems, the reduction in the degree of waterlogging, and the agricultural or environmental effects. It is therefore difficult to develop sound agricultural criteria for the regular surface field drainage systems. Most of the known criteria for these systems concern the efficiency of the techniques of land leveling and <b>earthmoving.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tokoroa's {{man-made}} Lake Moana-Nui {{was created}} in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large <b>earthmoving</b> equipment and a concrete dam wall with a drain valve control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early extreme sport unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.|$|E
25|$|The {{railroad}} {{was originally}} incorporated on September 21, 1882, as the Bellefonte and Buffalo Run Railroad. The {{purpose of this}} line was to connect Bellefonte with Pennsylvania State College, and to tap the iron ore deposits along Buffalo Run. This would replace the inefficient wagons used to haul ore to the iron furnaces at Bellefonte. The local iron and agricultural interests who chartered the road contracted out construction to Frank McLaughlin, a Philadelphia businessman, {{in exchange for a}} majority of the stock; he turned construction over to his business associates, the Collins brothers. Experienced contractors, they were working at the time on the Beech Creek Railroad, and began grading the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run in March 1883. However, the Bellefonte & Buffalo Run was graded to minimal standards of engineering, with little <b>earthmoving</b> and many curves.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, LeTourneau {{sold his}} entire <b>earthmoving</b> {{equipment}} {{line to the}} Westinghouse Air Brake Company. He then applied his ingenuity {{to the development of}} the electric wheel drive concept. In 1958, at the age of seventy, LeTourneau re-entered the <b>earthmoving</b> equipment manufacturing business, offering contractors a range of high capacity <b>earthmoving,</b> transportation, and material handling machines based on the revolutionary electric wheel drive system he had developed. An electric wheel drive is also called an electric Wheel hub motor.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the {{original}} <b>earthmoving</b> bulldozers are still irreplaceable as their tasks {{are concentrated in}} deforestation, <b>earthmoving,</b> ground levelling, and road carving. Heavy bulldozers are mainly employed to level the terrain to prepare it for construction. The construction, however, is mainly done by small bulldozers and loader tractors.|$|E
50|$|The Euclid Crane and Hoist Co, {{owned by}} George A. Armington and his 5 sons, was a large, {{respected}} and profitable operation, when they introduced the Euclid Automatic Rotary Scraper in 1924 - soon {{followed by the}} Euclid Wheeler (wheeled) scraper. These <b>earthmoving</b> products were conceived by George's eldest son, Arthur, who envisioned a good future in designing <b>earthmoving</b> equipment, and steered the company into the <b>earthmoving</b> field. The two models of scrapers were successful, and a third model, the Euclid Contractors Special, designed to cope with hard ground, was even more successful.|$|E
5000|$|Robert Gilmour LeTourneau (November 30, 1888 [...] - [...] June 1, 1969), {{was born}} in Richford, Vermont, and was a {{prolific}} inventor of <b>earthmoving</b> machinery. His factories supplied LeTourneau machines which represented nearly 70 percent of the <b>earthmoving</b> equipment and engineering vehicles used by the Allied forces during World War II, {{and more than half}} of the 1,500 mile Alcan Highway in Canada was built with LeTourneau equipment. Over the course of his life he secured nearly 300 patents relating to <b>earthmoving</b> equipment, manufacturing processes and machine tools.|$|E

5000|$|Known {{throughout}} the construction world as, [...] "The Dean of Earthmoving," [...] LeTourneau {{is considered to}} this day {{to have been the}} world’s greatest inventor of <b>earthmoving</b> and materials handling equipment. Few manufacturers of that era had such a profound effect upon the art of <b>earthmoving</b> as did LeTourneau. Just two years prior to his death, LeTourneau recorded his thoughts about the future of <b>earthmoving</b> equipment: “Within the next few years construction machinery will grow bigger and bigger, and more and more powerful. Instead of 'tons' of capacity, they’ll all be in 'hundreds of tons' and instead of hundreds of horsepower, they’ll all be rated in 'thousands' of horsepower. We’re already seeing it in big hauling units in the mines, and believe me, when the contractor and mining companies start looking for bigger and more profitable hauling units and <b>earthmoving</b> equipment, I’m going to be right there, the firstest with the mostest." ...|$|E

50|$|The Great Depression did {{not appear}} to affect Euclid greatly, and the {{expansion}} of the <b>earthmoving</b> portion of the Euclid business, led to the incorporation of the Euclid Road Machinery Co, on July 11, 1931. This company remained a subsidiary of Euclid Armington Corp, until January 1, 1933, when the companies were separated - and Euclid Road Machinery, became a producer of fast, off-road <b>earthmoving</b> haulers.|$|E
50|$|R. G. LeTourneau founded {{his company}} R.G. LeTourneau, Inc. in 1929 in California as a {{contractor}} of <b>earthmoving</b> equipment. LeTourneau manufactured products in Longview, Texas. During World War II, the company provided 70% of the Allies' <b>earthmoving</b> equipment. In 1954, it {{built the first}} jack-up drilling platform. In 1955, it made the first log-stacker machine. In 1965, the company made the first intermodal crane.|$|E
50|$|GPS {{continues}} to be integrated {{in the construction industry}} and soon will be an industry standard. Autonomous cars that utilize GPS are currently being developed and someday the <b>earthmoving</b> industry could incorporate such features.
