5|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that a '12th century renaissance' occurred in Byzantium. Although the term does not enjoy widespread usage, it is beyond <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> 12th century Byzantium witnessed major cultural developments, which were largely underpinned by rapid economic expansion.|$|E

5|$|According to David Potter, Vaballathus {{inherited}} his father's exact titles. Hartmann {{points that}} there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing. The dedication to Odaenathus would be the using of a Palmyrene equivalent, while the inscription of Vaballathus would be the direct translation. Despite all the arguments, it cannot be certain without <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Odaenathus was a corrector.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, strombid {{gastropods}} {{were believed}} to be carnivores. This erroneous conception was based on the writings of French naturalist Jean Baptiste Lamarck, whose classification scheme grouped strombids with carnivorous sea snails. Subsequent studies have refuted the concept, proving beyond <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> strombid gastropods are herbivorous animals. In common with other Strombidae, Laevistrombus canarium is known to be a herbivore, feeding on algae and occasionally detritus.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{due to a}} {{mounting}} debt {{in funding}} of the athletic program, the university polled its students {{on whether or not}} they would approve an increase in tuition which would be necessary to maintain the athletic program. There was a significant <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the students would approve this increase. Contrary to the predictions, a majority of the students approved a significant addition to their annual tuition to maintain the existence of the athletic program.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both Protestant and Catholic law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|Murray's {{work was}} {{increasingly}} criticised following {{her death in}} 1963, with the definitive academic rejection of the Murrayite witch-cult theory occurring during the 1970s. During these decades, a variety of scholars across Europe and North America– such as Alan Macfarlane, Erik Midelfort, William Monter, Robert Muchembled, Gerhard Schormann, Bente Alver and Bengt Ankarloo– published in-depth studies of the archival records from the witch trials, leaving no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> those tried for witchcraft were not practitioners of a surviving pre-Christian religion.|$|E

5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Jesus actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: that Jesus was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E

5|$|There is {{absolutely}} no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> before the restoration, the whole ceiling was dirtier, more muted and more monochrome than Michelangelo ever intended, but when images of the frescoes are viewed in their stained and unrestored state the subtle washes and intense definitions, described by Beck and Arguimbau, still make their presence known, giving mass and bulk to the forms.|$|E

5|$|There {{is little}} <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> early Christianity {{influenced}} Mingulay (for example the nearby islands of Pabbay and Berneray both have cross-inscribed slabs) but no direct evidence {{has yet been}} found. From circa 871 onwards Viking raids on the Outer Hebrides gathered pace but similarly the Viking graves found on Berneray and Vatersay are not replicated on Mingulay and whilst there are no definite indications of Norse settlement, their presence on the island is confirmed by the many features they named.|$|E
5|$|There is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the phylum Nemertea is {{monophyletic}} (meaning {{that the}} phylum includes all and only descendants of one ancestor {{that was also}} a member of the phylum).

5|$|Today, Beebe's 1915 {{description}} of his hypothetical four-winged bird ancestor is regarded as prescient, {{and there is no}} <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Microraptor looks startlingly similar to the almost-century old Tetrapteryx illustrations. After its discovery, Microraptor had the effect of both reinvigorating the arboreal hypothesis as well as finally putting an end to the widespread acceptance of Heilmann's disregard for the Tetrapteryx theory.|$|E

5|$|Viking {{influence}} in the area commenced in the late 8th century, and whilst there is no <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the Uí Ímair dynasty played {{a prominent role in}} this early period, the records for the dates and details of the rulers are speculative until the mid-10th century. Hostility between the Kings of the Isles and the rulers of Ireland, and intervention by the crown of Norway (either directly or through their vassal the Earl of Orkney) were recurring themes.|$|E
5|$|While {{there is}} no {{reasonable}} <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> McCoy committed the Denver hijacking, the FBI does not consider him {{a suspect in the}} Cooper case because of significant mismatches in age and description; a level of skydiving skill well above that thought to be possessed by the hijacker; and credible evidence that McCoy was in Las Vegas {{on the day of the}} Portland hijacking, and at home in Utah the day after, having Thanksgiving dinner with his family.|$|E
