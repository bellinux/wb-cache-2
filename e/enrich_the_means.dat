40|$|This {{presentation}} {{was a part}} of the session “Developing Successful Partnerships Between Tribal Communities and Non-Tribal Cultural Heritage Institutions” given at the 2013 Association of Tribal Archives, Libraries, and Museums in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The description for the entire sessions is as follows: Collaboration between tribal organizations and non-tribal cultural heritage institutions can create unique alliances and projects that build upon diverse and mutually beneficial partnerships. To encourage collaboration, several funding organizations have developed specialized initiatives for tribal organizations designed to strengthen and <b>enrich</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> for collaboration and project development. This session will highlight successful partnerships involving large repositories and tribal organizations with an emphasis on relationship building, the development of mutual agreements, memorandums of understanding, and other means of formalizing the collaborative process, as well as discussing funding and institutional support for these efforts. This overview of successful models of collaboration will offer a set of best practices for those interested sharing useful skills, knowledge, and resources through partnerships. Session Moderator: Elizabeth Joffrion, Director of Heritage Resources, Western Washington University. Session Presenters: Natalia Fernandez, Oregon Multicultural Librarian, Oregon Multicultural Archives, Oregon State University; Kimberly Christen, Associate Professor, Washington State University; Jennifer O'Neal, University Historian and Archivist, University of Oregon Libraries; Cheryl Hinton, Director Emeritus/ Curator of Collections, Barona Cultural Center & MuseumPresentation about developing relationships between tribal communities and non-tribal cultural heritage institutions with examples from the Oregon Multicultural Archives given at the 2013 Association of Tribal Archives, Libraries, and Museums Conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico...|$|E

60|$|The {{battle was}} over by noon, {{but it was}} evening before all the {{pursuing}} parties returned, {{and the result of}} the victory was then fully known. With less than 8000 men the English had conquered far more than 60,000. On the English side 2000 men-at-arms and 1500 archers had fallen. Upon the French side 11,000 men-at-arms, besides an immense number of footmen, had been killed. A king, a prince, an archbishop, 13 counts, 66 barons, and more than 2000 knights were prisoners {{in the hands of the}} English, with a number of other soldiers, who raised the number of captives to double that of their conquerors. All the baggage of the French army was taken, and as the barons of France had marched to the field feeling certain of victory, and the rich armour of the prisoners became immediately the property of the captors, immense stores of valuable ornaments of all kinds, especially jewelled baldrics, <b>enriched</b> <b>the</b> <b>meanest</b> soldier among <b>the</b> conquerors.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} the stability {{analysis of a}} system of ordinary differential equations coupled with a classic heat equation using a Lyapunov approach. Relying on recent developments in the area of time-delay systems, a new method to study the stability of such a class of coupled finite/infinite dimensional systems is presented here. It consists in a Lyapunov analysis of the infinite dimensional state of the system using an energy functional <b>enriched</b> by <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> value of <b>the</b> heat variable. The main technical step relies on the use an efficient Bessel-like integral inequality on Hilbert space leading to tractable conditions expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The results are then illustrated on academic examples and demonstrate the potential of this new approach...|$|R

Here, we aim to identify a module of WIPF 1 -coexpressed genes and to assess its use as a prognostic signature for colorectal cancer, glioma, and breast cancer patients. Two public colorectal cancer microarray data sets were used for discovery and validation of the WIPF 1 co-expression module. Based on expression of the WIPF 1 signature, we classified more than 400 additional tumors with microarray data from our own experiments or from publicly available data sets according to their WIPF 1 signature expression. This allowed us to separate patient populations for colorectal cancers, breast cancers, and gliomas for which clinical characteristics like survival times and times to relapse were analyzed. Groups of colorectal cancer, breast cancer, and glioma patients with low expression of the WIPF 1 co-expression module generally had a favorable prognosis. In addition, the majority of WIPF 1 signature genes are individually correlated with disease outcome in different studies. Literature gene network analysis revealed that among WIPF 1 co-expressed genes known direct transcriptional targets of c-myc, ESR 1 and p 53 are <b>enriched.</b> <b>The</b> <b>mean</b> expression profile of WIPF 1 signature genes is correlated with {{the profile of a}} proliferation signature. The WIPF 1 signature is the first microarray-based prognostic expression signature primarily developed for colorectal cancer that is instrumental in other tumor types: low expression of the WIPF 1 module is associated with better prognosis...|$|R

50|$|The {{roots of}} this grass are also {{known to have}} notable {{physiological}} responses to enriched soil patches that are treated with varying solutions of nutrients, most notably nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. This exploitation of nutrient-rich soil can affect the nutrient status of the overall plant. In phosphorus <b>enriched</b> environments, <b>the</b> <b>mean</b> root uptake of phosphorus was 5 - 26% higher compared to roots from control soil patches. Results regarding the nutrient uptake capacities of P. spicata potassium enriched environments indicate no apparent difference between enriched and controlled soil.

Drilling was done within a projected mining {{zone of the}} Cathedral Sluffs Mine, located in the Piceance Basin of western Colorado. Methane contents were determined by the modified direct method, which can measure the volumes of several gases released from or reacted with mine rock without destructive sample treatment. Over {{the duration of the}} test, nitrogen was largely unreactive, CO 2 increased slightly, oxygen decreased markedly, and methane increased more than the total increase of all contained gases. The gas volumes were normalized per unit sample mass and are given in cubic centimeters per gram. Common time irzdices for test duration of 3, 40, and 125 days were used to compare methane desorption among samples. <b>The</b> <b>means</b> of <b>the</b> sample populations for these indices were 0. 0316, 0. 114, and 0. 195 cm 3 /g, respectively.

The new calculus, which generalises intuitionistic linear type theory, provides a formalism for ex-pressing linear aspects of computational effects; for example, the linear usage of imperative {{features such as}} state and/or continuations.

Our semantic results include soundness, completeness, the initiality of a syntactic model, and an embedding theorem: every model of the basic effect calculus fully embeds in a model of <b>the</b> <b>enriched</b> calculus. <b>The</b> latter <b>means</b> that our enriched effect calculus is applicable to arbitrary computational effects, answering in the positive a question of Benton and Wadler (LICS 1996). ...|$|R

However, <b>the</b> <b>means</b> for creating semantically enriched structured content are already available and are, although unconsciously, even used by Wikipedia authors. In this article, we present a method for revealing this structured content by extracting information from template instances. We suggest ways to efficiently query the vast amount of extracted information (e. g. more than 8 million RDF statements for the English Wikipedia version alone), leading to astonishing query answering possibilities (such as for the title question). We analyze the quality of the extracted content, and propose strategies for quality improvements with just minor modifications of the wiki systems being currently used. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I have {{researched}} the curriculum enrichment process. By <b>enriching</b> <b>the</b> curriculum I <b>mean</b> enhancing, deepening, improving and developing {{not only the}} syllabus but also other phases of curriculum objectives, like the teaching methodology, {{and the development of}} resources. <b>Enriching</b> <b>the</b> curriculum is a never-ending process; during the process I reflected critically on the implementation of the curriculum. The process progresses from evaluating the existing teaching practice in the classroom, to designing an effective teaching, to implementing new teaching practices and back to evaluating the revised teaching practice. I worked with one teacher from a government school in Karachi, Pakistan. My work experience has been in the government sector schools, so I believed {{it would be better if}} my personal experiences were included in developing the education system. If I enhanced my studies through research in <b>enriching</b> <b>the</b> curriculum in the government school, I would be able to develop my own context, as the focus of my research is the process of curriculum enrichment and its effects on teachers 2 ̆ 7 classroom practice. Another reason for selecting a government school was that government sector teachers have been teaching mathematics using the traditional methods. Also the existing system of the assessment in schools is product-oriented examinations. Teachers have to complete the syllabus irrespective of whether they comprehend the content. On the basis of my experience as a teacher and teacher educator, I realized that teaching mathematics effectively in the classroom has been neglected, therefore mathematics curriculum needs to be enriched in such a way that students understand the problem, take interest, and solve it cognitively, not by rote memorizing. The data is qualitative in nature. I used observations of classroom teaching learning process, semi structured interviews, and pre and post conferences with the teacher. My research findings show the curriculum enrichment is a complicated interconnected process. It has a positive effect on the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s classroom practice. The findings also reveal significant factors, which act as barriers to curriculum enrichment factors...|$|R
