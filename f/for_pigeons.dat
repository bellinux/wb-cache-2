40|$|The {{present study}} was carried out to {{estimate}} growth pattern and examine the best ARIMA model to efficiently forecasting pigeon pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production in Bangladesh. It appeared that the time series data <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea were 1 st order homogenous stationary. Two types of models namely Box-Jenkins type Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and deterministic type growth models, are examined to identify the best forecasting models <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production in Bangladesh. The study revealed that the best models were ARIMA (1, 1 and 1), ARIMA (0, 1 and 0) and ARIMA (1, 1 and 3) <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production, respectively. Among the deterministic type growth models, the cubic model is best <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> pea, chickpea and field pea pulse production.

2500|$|An operant {{conditioning}} chamber (also {{known as a}} Skinner Box) is a laboratory apparatus used in the experimental analysis of animal behavior. [...] It was invented by Skinner {{while he was a}} graduate student at Harvard University. As used by Skinner, the box had a lever (for rats), or a disk in one wall (<b>for</b> <b>pigeons).</b> A press on this [...] "manipulandum" [...] could deliver food to the animal through an opening in the wall, and responses reinforced in this way increased in frequency. By controlling this reinforcement together with discriminative stimuli such as lights and tones, or punishments such as electric shocks, experimenters have used the operant box to study a wide variety of topics, including schedules of reinforcement, discriminative control, delayed response ("memory"), punishment, and so on. By channeling research in these directions, the {{operant conditioning}} chamber has had a huge influence on course of research in animal learning and its applications. It enabled great progress on problems that could be studied by measuring the rate, probability, or force of a simple, repeatable response. However, it discouraged the study of behavioral processes not easily conceptualized in such terms—spatial learning, in particular, which is now studied in quite different ways, for example, by the use of the water maze.|$|E

6000|$|It is by {{no means}} rare to find certain males and females which will not breed together, though both are known to be {{perfectly}} fertile with other males and females. We have no reason to suppose that this is caused by these animals having been subjected to any change in their habits of life; therefore such cases are hardly related to our present subject. The cause apparently lies in an innate sexual incompatibility of the pair which are matched. Several instances have been communicated to me by Mr. W.C. Spooner (well known for his essay on Cross-breeding), by Mr. Eyton of Eyton, by Mr. Wicksted and other breeders, and especially by Mr. Waring of Chelsfield, in relation to horses, cattle, pigs, foxhounds, other dogs, and pigeons. (18/77. <b>For</b> <b>pigeons</b> see Dr. Chapuis 'Le Pigeon Voyageur Belge' 1865 page 66.) In these cases, females, which either previously or subsequently were proved to be fertile, failed to breed with certain males, with whom it was particularly desired to match them. A change in the constitution of the female may sometimes have occurred before she was put to the second male; but in other cases this explanation is hardly tenable, for a female, known not to be barren, has been unsuccessfully paired seven or eight times with the same male likewise known to be perfectly fertile. With cart-mares, which sometimes will not breed with stallions of pure blood, but subsequently have bred with cart-stallions, Mr. Spooner is inclined to attribute the failure to the lesser sexual power of the racehorse. But I have heard from the greatest breeder of racehorses at the present day, through Mr. Waring, that [...] "it frequently occurs with a mare to be put several times during one or two seasons to a particular stallion of acknowledged power, and yet prove barren; the mare afterwards breeding at once with some other horse." [...] These facts are worth recording, as they show, like so many previous facts, on what slight constitutional differences the fertility of an animal often depends.] ...|$|E
60|$|There was the Earl of Castlefort, {{plump and}} luxurious, with a {{youthful}} wig, who, though a sexagenarian, liked no companion {{better than a}} minor. His Lordship was the most amiable man in the world, and the most lucky; but the first was his merit, and the second was not his fault. There was the juvenile Lord Dice, who boasted of having done his brothers out of their miserable 5,000L. patrimony, and all in one night. But the wrinkle that had already ruffled his once clear brow, his sunken eye, and his convulsive lip, had been thrown, we suppose, into the bargain, and, in our opinion, made it a dear one. There was Temple Grace, who had run through four fortunes, and ruined four sisters. Withered, though only thirty, one thing alone remained to be lost, what he called his honour, which {{was already on the}} scent to play booty. There was Cogit, who, when he was drunk, swore that he had had a father; but this was deemed the only exception to in vino Veritas. Who he was, the Goddess of Chance alone could decide; and we have often thought that he might bear the same relation to her as Æneas to the Goddess of Beauty. His age was as great a mystery as anything else. He dressed still like a boy, yet some vowed he was eighty. He must have been Salathiel. Property he never had, and yet he contrived to live; connection he was not born with, yet he was upheld by a set. He never played, yet he was the most skilful dealer going. He did the honours of a rouge et noir table to a miracle; and looking, as he thought, most genteel in a crimson waistcoat and a gold chain, raked up the spoils, or complacently announced après. Lord Castlefort had few secrets from him: he was the jackal to these prowling beasts of prey; looked out <b>for</b> <b>pigeons,</b> got up little parties to Richmond or Brighton, sang a song when the rest were too anxious to make a noise, and yet desired a little life, and perhaps could cog a die, arrange a looking-glass, or mix a tumbler.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Pigeon breeder's {{disease is}} an {{extrinsic}} allergic alveolitis in the lungs of sensitised people, caused by hypersensitivity reactions to inhaled pigeon antigens. Antigens from different sources of the animal are used for diagnostic purposes, with serum being the most widely used. Bloom is rarely used; very little is known of its antigenicity and diagnostic performance, particularly when used with the enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, {{which is the most}} popular test as it permits measurement of the antibody response.  METHODS—To (a) standardise an ELISA for the measurement of specific IgG against pigeon serum and pigeon bloom extract; (b) to establish reference values for specific IgG in 73  non-exposed controls, (c) to show the presence of specific IgG against pigeon serum and bloom in serum samples of 17  patients with bird fancier's lung and 11  asymptomatic fanciers, and (d) to study the similarity of the two antigen sources by cross reactivity experiments.  RESULTS—Reference values of specific IgG were defined with the 97. 5  percentile (367. 9  U/ml <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> serum and 953. 7  U/ml <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> bloom extract). Of symptomatic patients 100 % had values higher than the cut off for both antigens. In asymptomatic fanciers values were higher than the cut off <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> serum in 45 % and bloom extract in 54 %. Cross reactivity experiments showed that the two antigens differed in antigenic content although some components may be common to both.  CONCLUSION—The ELISA methods used proved to be useful tools for evaluating specific IgG antibody responses against both antigens. The diagnostic performance of both ELISA methods performed with these antigen sources was similar, showing very high sensitivity but moderate specificity. Although some antigenic similarity was found between pigeon serum and bloom extract, cross reactivity studies showed that various antigens seemed to be specific to the bloom extract. However, the antigens responsible <b>for</b> <b>pigeon</b> breeder's disease seem to be present in both antigenic sources.    Keywords: antibodies; pigeons; ELIS...|$|R
