5|$|The race {{saw some}} {{incidents}} which caused riders to lose valuable time. Gu Sun-Geun (South Korea) {{lost control of}} <b>her</b> <b>bike,</b> bringing others down with her. She eventually fell into a concrete ditch {{on the side of}} the highway. Natalia Boyarskaya (Russia), who had built a lead of 59seconds over the top of Badaling, had to stop to see which way to choose at a poorly marked intersection.|$|E
5|$|The video opens as {{the protagonist}} (Rihanna) shoots and kills a man while he walks through a busy train station. She flees before a {{flashback}} {{to the previous}} day, when she rides <b>her</b> <b>bike,</b> meets friends and is alone in a bedroom at dusk. At a nightclub the protagonist dances and flirts with another club-goer, who then attacks her when she leaves the club. Disheveled, the woman cries in the street after an implied sexual assault, and the video ends as she runs home to grab a gun hidden in a dresser drawer.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{he invited}} Perrie {{to be his}} date after she fell off <b>her</b> <b>bike</b> while staring at him work out on a field and pouring water over his torso to cool down. He helps her up, and gives her a corsage. Toward {{the end of the}} video, they sit on a bench next to the entrance, and see their date walk in with another girl wearing the same corsage as the ones that he had given each of them. They realise that they have all been two-timed by the same guy, and are all dateless. It ends with the girls being each other's date and solemnly dancing whilst {{everyone}} else has a good time. Metro writer Rebecca Lewis noted that the man in the video strongly resembled Perrie's former fiancé Zayn Malik of One Direction. She also wrote that fans had noticed that she was still wearing her engagement ring in the video, meaning that the video was filmed before they split up in August 2015.|$|E

Buster was understandably cross, but his friends made matters worse when they {{indirectly}} suggested that autorepair is an easy skill to pick up. Enraged {{on behalf of his}} father's profession, Buster shooed his friends out of the garage. After a period of not talking to Buster at school, Jessie surprised Buster by asking him if he would accompany <b>her</b> on a <b>bike</b> ride to the falls.

During the promotional Making of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai TV special, Kajol stated that the accident was her most memorable part of shooting the film because she doesn't remember it. During preparation for the reunion scene where the two leads met after more than 8 years apart, the director told them to improvise and rehearse the reactions that they might use, but he secretly taped them, and was so pleased with the result that it was put into the film.|$|E

In subsequent scenes, the band members are shown racing on motorcycles along a desert road. Following {{the topic of the}} song, the members are seen applying fake tattoos, painting their nails, and blow-drying their hair, all still while riding on their motorcycles. At one point, the girls dismount from their bikes to dance, but eventually they return to the motorcycles and ride off into the distance.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{completion}} of Jaws in 1975, Fields was hired by Universal Studios as an executive consultant. Some insight into Universal's reasons for hiring her can be gleaned from the fact that during the filming of Jaws, in addition to her editing, Fields had been [...] "omnipresent...at Spielberg's beck and call by means of a walkie-talkie. Often she would shuttle back and forth on <b>her</b> <b>bike</b> between the producers in town and Spielberg at the dock for last-minute decisions". The producers of Jaws were David Brown and Richard Zanuck. Along with Brown, Zanuck, and Peter Benchley (the book's author), Fields helped promote Jaws on the [...] "talk show circuit" [...] in the eight months before its saturation release to 464 theaters on 20 June 1975. Fields had plainly earned the confidence of the producers and of the studio executives at Universal.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} footage of Frankie Sandford {{sitting in a}} tree; Mollie King is show riding a bike along a dustry road; while Vanessa White is leaning against {{the walls of a}} {{crumbling}} building; the camera flies past Rochelle Wiseman, who stands on the beach by the water's edge and Una Healy drives a convertible car along a dusty road. As the chorus plays for the first time, the cameras follow the girls as they respectively walk around their surroundings, bar Sandford who remains in the tree and White who does not move from her spot. In the verse following, King is sitting by the road side with <b>her</b> <b>bike</b> and Wiseman is seen sitting on the rocks near the water's edge. Then as the chorus breaks for the second time the girls are seen dancing a choreographed routine on a sandy beach. Each is wearing a flowing maxi dress (see image alongside). The interspliced scenes of Sandford walking through trees gained a mention in The Daily Mail. [...] "Sandford is seen wearing a cropped white top and white shorts, Frankie walks casually through a field in the video, seemingly unaware of the attention her astonishing six pack is receiving." [...] The song's bridge mainly focusses on footage of the girls at a beach party dancing to the DJ, while the final run of the chorus sees the camera rotate around the girls as they dance on the beach. There is a brief view of the seaside villas in the background. It ends by showing the footage from the scenes {{at the start of the}} video, showing each of the girls in turn.|$|E

2500|$|Wildwood is more soft fantasy than hard fantasy, in that {{historical}} and technological consistency and plausibility {{are not a}} high priority, giving the book a whimsical, or stream of consciousness, tone. The factions of The Wood {{use a variety of}} anachronistic technologies, including cutlasses, blunderbusses, and flintlocks, concurrent with howitzers and semi-automatic pistols, and vehicles like animal-drawn wagons and carts alongside bicycles, trucks and trains. No attempt was made to maintain a consistent level of technological advancement or to rationalize why a particular piece of equipment was used; rather, Meloy said, they could [...] "pick coolest version of whatever piece of technology" [...] they wanted, and Ellis said they [...] "just picked whatever we liked." [...] When she first meets the South Wood postman Richard, he threatens her with a shotgun, which in the same paragraph is referred to as a double-barrelled rifle, then on the next page it is called a shotgun again.

40|$|The {{treatment}} of argument realization is rather straightforward for a language like English, {{but for a}} language with relatively free word order, such as Dutch, it is a complex matter. It is not surprising then that the devices which are commonly used {{to deal with it}} show a high degree of computational complexity. They typically include movement, as in transforma-tional grammar, or the dissociation of order-in-the-representation from the surface order, as in certain types of monostratal grammar. For the purpose of natural language description these devices are certainly convenient, but for the purpose of natural language processing they are less attractive. For this reason, I propose an alternative {{treatment of}} argument realization, which is consistently monostratal and surface-oriented. Its cornerstone is the GENERALIZED ARGUMENT REALIZATION PRINCIPLE. It is a generalization of the Ar-gument Realization Principle which is proposed in (Ginzburg and Sag 2000) to deal with English. 1 The argument realization principle The lexical entries of argument taking words commonly include information about the number and the kinds of arguments which they select. Intransitive verbs, for instance, select one NP and transitive verbs two. This information is useful for syntactic and semantic processing, on condition that it is complemented with in-formation on how the arguments are realized in sentences. For a language with a relatively rigid word order, such as English, the constraints on argument realiza-tion are relatively straightforward. In an active English clause, for instance, the first NP argument is realized as the subject and precedes the verb, whereas the other arguments follow the verb in a fixed order. (1) a. They gave <b>her</b> a <b>bike.</b> b. * Gave they <b>her</b> a <b>bike.</b> c. * They <b>her</b> a <b>bike</b> gave. d. * They gave a <b>bike</b> <b>her.</b> To spell this out in formal terms HEAD-DRIVEN PHRASE STRUCTURE GRAM-MAR employs two kinds of features. There is the ARG(UMENT) -ST(RUCTURE) feature, which specifies the syntactic and semantic properties of the arguments which a word selects, and there are the valence features SUBJ(ECT), SP(ECIFIE) R and COMP(LEMENT) S, which spell out how these arguments are realized. The link between them is defined by the ARGUMENT REALIZATION PRINCIPLE (Ginzbur...|$|R
