[...] James Low and Robert Fairweather had set up their foundry in the village {{at the start of}} the nineteenth century and in 1815 developed the first carding machine for flax tow in the area. With the growth of the textile industry in Dundee and Angus the business grew rapidly, and, by the late nineteenth century, James F Low & Co Ltd was producing a wide range of machines used for the processing <b>and</b> spinning of <b>jute,</b> flax <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fibres.</b> As well as building machinery for local use, the firm attracted orders from across the world and by the 1880s the Monifieth Foundry employed about 300 workers. The expansion of Monifieth's industrial economy was aided by the opening of the Dundee and Arbroath Railway on 6 October 1838. This railway, which was originally intended only as a local line, was constructed with an unusual gauge of [...] (shared only with the Arbroath and Forfar Railway), later being converted to standard gauge when it was incorporated into the national Rail system. Between 1861 and 1901, Monifieth's population more than tripled; from 558 to 2,134 and in 1895, Monifieth was registered at Forfar Sheriff Court as a burgh. A tramway service was introduced in 1905, with cars journeying into Dundee City centre at regular intervals. This service was welcomed by the many who travelled daily either from the Burgh into the City on business, or the many hundreds who commuted daily to work in the factories and mills.|$|R

40|$|The {{abdominal}} paraganglia in man {{represent a}} major source of catecholamines, and perhaps peptide hormones, during the fetal period. The nature of the innervation of the abdominal paraganglia was studied immunohistochemically by utilising antibodies to vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, enkephalin, substance-P and somatostatin. The paraganglia showed an abundant network of VIP-immunoreactive <b>fibres,</b> <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> nerve <b>fibres</b> were found within nerve bundles of the preaortic sympathetic plexus. Occasionally, VIP-immunoreactive fibres were seen within the prevertebral ganglia, but stained cell bodies were never observed. It may be suggested that VIP-containing nerves could regulate a secretory response from fetal human abdominal paraganglia...|$|R

Manufacturers are requesting textiles that disassemble and are recyclable; suppliers are being requested to recall their products after use to recycle them (Normand 2008), potentially forcing readjusting their operations to support this new additional element to their business. Many original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) currently use the design for disassembly processes using compatible chemicals, components <b>and</b> <b>similar</b> <b>fibre</b> types to increase their recycling and reuse efficiencies. The automotive industry is interesting because environmental sustainability of textiles is not (yet) {{the main focus of}} the car companies’ sustainability efforts, which centre on fuel efficiency and lightweight cars. OEMs are therefore much more hesitant to make improvements regarding EPD for those ‘peripheral’ parts of the car which customers are less likely to ask about and where the influence on sales and reputation is perceived as uncertain. On the other hand, seating textiles are visible to the customer, and so, {{it is important to understand}} the internal and external pressures which the design team faces. Therefore, the design process is analysed to get a detailed understanding of the factors driving the design decisions.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{quantify}} and map the gross fibre architecture of the cranial dura mater (CDM) using small angle light scattering (SALS). In SALS, HeNe laser light is passed through the tissue, and the resultant scattering pattern is analysed to determine the preferred fibre direction and degree of orientation. The dura mater was found to be a complex structure with fibre orientations ranging from highly aligned to nearly random. In the temporal region, 80 % of the samples (n= 20) were found to have regions composed of highly oriented fibres with a mean fibre direction of 6. 3 °± 0. 8 ° with respect to the sagittal plane (i. e. almost parallel to the superior sagittal sinus). These highly aligned regions were found in symmetric anatomical locations about the median sagittal sinus <b>and</b> had <b>similar</b> <b>fibre</b> orientations over both hemispheres. Although our sample size was small, we found that the size of the symmetric regions, which covered 14. 4 ± 1. 6 % of the total CDM area, was not influenced by subject's age or sex. The presence of these highly oriented fibre regions in CDM may be due to mechanical forces exerted on dura mater during its development. These forces may have induced realignment of the collagen fibres in the direction of tensile pull, although the exact basis for the unique gross fibre architecture of CDM remains unknown...|$|R

40|$|Silk {{is often}} cited as a {{material}} worth imitating, due to its high strength and toughness. In order to produce a synthetic analogue, or enhanced natural version, the microstructural basis of these properties must be understood. Current understanding is that silk deforms through the detachment of nano-scale crystallites, {{in the manner of}} a damaged composite. This picture forms the basis for constitutive models, but validation data is limited to low strain-rates. Here we present a programme of research in which high-rate behaviour is studied through ballistic impact experiments. These have been applied to the silk of the Bombyx mori moth, as harvested from cocoons, and to the major ampullate thread of the golden orb weaver spider Nephila edulis. Longitudinal wave-speeds, and air drag coefficients, have been calculated for selected cases. Differences between the response of various silks <b>and</b> a <b>similar</b> synthetic <b>fibre,</b> nylon, are discussed, and future plans are presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitive}} {{ability of}} jute was measured as aggressivity. About 31 % fibre yield was reduced {{due to the}} competition from the weed when grown together with jute irrespective of time of jute sowing. When the weeds emerged 10 days earlier than the crop, the yield was reduced by 37 % and it was reduced by 16 % when the weeds emerged 10 days later. The effect on total dry matter of jute was also more or less <b>similar</b> to <b>fibre</b> yield. The weed produced 2. 73 kg/m 2 of total dry matter (above ground + below-ground parts) in early-sown and 2. 17 kg/m 2 in late sown conditions irrespective of time of jute sowing. Weed dry matter was reduced by 35 % due to competition with jute. The crop was most aggressive when it was grown early with late-sown weed and was least aggressive when grown as late-emerged crop with early-emerged weeds. The aggressivity of jute was 18 % less when the weeds emerged 10 days earlier than early-sown <b>jute</b> <b>and</b> 35 % less than late-sown jute. It increased by about 66 % when the weeds emerged 10 days later than early-sown <b>jute</b> <b>and</b> by 47 % than late-sown jute...|$|R
