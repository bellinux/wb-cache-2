If sound is addressed at all, only the aspect of noisiness is considered. 9 ̆ 3 Soundscapes 9 ̆ 4 can offer a different view. This notion is used in several ways, many of them too limited in scope. Also because {{a large amount of}} information is available on the 9 ̆ 3 behaviour 9 ̆ 4 of sound and speech communication, these acoustical aspects make a good starting point for an objective description of residential environments. They could be included in the notion of soundscapes. Making a philosophy work requires tools, which means: tools are necessary to put ideas for a better environment into practice. A first step towards a more objective description of soundscapes is the notion of 9 ̆ 4 signal to noise ratio 9 ̆ 4, which can indicate whether a specific sound can be heard in a certain ambient noise. This is the base for understanding communication, privacy and masking. Further it is noted that human speech is a very important sound source, sometimes appreciated (social communication), sometimes not (<b>intruding</b> <b>noise).</b> A holistic approach of soundscapes should be developed including annoyance, auditive privacy and communication as well. Many of the elements required for this approach exist, but have not yet been taken into this new field. For example, it is necessary to determine in each case what is foreground sound (9 ̆ 3 signal 9 ̆ 4, speech) and what is background noise, and to treat them separately; the combination of both determines the rate of communication, ranging from perfect privacy to perfect communication. Calculation models from acoustic science are available for speech privacy and speech communication. Similar models can be developed, to compare different urban plans and create a base of guide lines for soundscapes in urban and architectural design...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{a study of}} the noticeability and annoyance of <b>intruding</b> <b>noises</b> to test participants who were engaged in a distracting foreground task. Ten test participants read material of their own choosing while seated individually in front of a loudspeaker in an anechoic chamber. One of three specially constructed masking noise environments with limited dynamic range was heard at all times. A laboratory computer produced sounds of aircraft and ground vehicles as heard at varying distances at unpredictable intervals and carefully controlled levels. Test participants were instructed to click a computer mouse at any time that a noise distinct from the background noise environment came to their attention, and then to indicate their degree of annoyance with the noise that they had noticed. The results confirmed that both the noticeability of noise intrusions and their annoyance were closely related to their audibility...|$|R

40|$|Several {{relationships}} between <b>intruding</b> <b>noises</b> (largely aircraft) and sleep disturbance have been inferred from {{the findings of}} a handful of field studies. Comparisons of sleep disturbance rates predicted by the various relationships are complicated by inconsistent data collection methods and definitions of predictor variables and predicted quantities. None of the relationships is grounded in theory-based understanding, and some depend on questionable statistical assumptions and analysis procedures. The credibility, generalizability, and utility of sleep disturbance predictions are also limited by small and nonrepresentative samples of test participants, and by restricted (airport-specific and relatively short duration) circumstances of exposure. Although expedient relationships may be the best available, their predictions are of only limited utility for policy analysis and regulatory purposes, because they account for very little variance in the association between environmental noise and sleep disturbance, have characteristically shallow slopes, have not been well validated in field settings, are highly context-dependent, and do not squarely address the roles and relative importance of nonacoustic factors in sleep disturbance. Such relationships offer the appearance more than the substance of precision and objectivity. Truly useful, population-level prediction and genuine understanding of noise-induced sleep disturbance will remain beyond reach for the foreseeable future, until the findings of field studies of broader scope and more sophisticated design become available...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, {{it has become}} common {{practice}} in the United States and other industrialized countries to engineer noise barriers along major highways to protect adjacent residents from <b>intruding</b> roadway <b>noise.</b> The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in conjunction with State Highway Administration (SHA) adopted Federal Regulation (23 CFR 772) requiring each state to adopt their own policy in regards to abatement of highway traffic noise. Engineering techniques {{have been developed to}} predict an effective geometry for the noise barrier design in a particular real world situation. Noise barriers may be constructed of wood, masonry, earth or a combination thereof. One of the earliest noise barrier designs was in Arlington, Virginia adjacent to Interstate 66, stemming from interests expressed by the Arlington Coalition on Transportation. Possibly the earliest scientifically designed and published noise barrier construction was in Los Altos, California in 1970.|$|R

5000|$|A {{score for}} the film was {{composed}} by the British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, but it is now lost. A reconstructed score arranged by Phillip Lane and performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in March 2016. The DNL reserved their criticism for Vaughan Williams's score feeling that it was [...] "execrable" [...] and that [...] "One is conscious only of obtrusive and disagreeable <b>noise</b> <b>intruding</b> between the audience and a moving story". This {{was the last of}} the British propaganda films that Vaughan Williams scored. Jeffrey Richard in his 1997 book Films and National British Identity wrote that Vaughan Williams's score could [...] "stand on its own" [...] as [...] "an atmospheric and economical but musically sophisticated and multi-layered evocation of the various facets of post-war reconstruction".|$|R
40|$|Two {{seats and}} a small sofa all facing forwards. The three piece suite of the {{conventionally}} designed car. A little living room. It is supplied with a stereo for playing music and a radio. More commonly now, DVD players for the occupants of the sofa. No curtains. No coffee table. Not {{much in the way}} of shelves. No room to walk around; sitting is all there is on offer. A lot of windows though, and a lot of doors. The view from the windows changes pretty much constantly as does where you will alight if you leave by one of the doors. It is hard to write there and conversation can be difficult when traffic <b>noise</b> <b>intrudes.</b> The neighbours are always changing, sometimes they’re teenagers, sometimes they’re families, sometimes lone men and sometimes buses. They can be nuisances at times and almost never come round for a cup of sugar. A little living room that is hardly like a living room at all. The car interior. Its chairs and windows have been a constant feature of my life as I’m sure they have been for most of us here today. Early memories of staring at the windscreen wipers creating their distinctive asymmetrical shapes on the windscreen. The clunk of car doors. The smell of vinyl seating. Teenage kicks in a rusty runaround. Near misses and accidents. Conversations about love, death and insurance. Beloved offspring kicking the backs of the seats. Old age arriving in the persistent urge to drive well below the speed limit on the motorway. So much of life is there in that second smallest room, sitting side by side, with a road ahead...|$|R
40|$|Unlike other pollutants, many of {{the noise}} effects on people have a clear {{subjective}} component that go beyond the objective physiological effects that the physical phenomenon causes. Among them, annoyance is the most documented subjective response to noise, it being defined as a feeling of discomfort or displeasure that occurs when <b>noise</b> <b>intrudes</b> our everyday activities. For decades it {{has been one of}} the hot topics of environmental acoustics. But, while many studies have focused on the possible correlation between sound metrics and the adverse reaction of the population, the effect of non-acoustic factors on the annoyance response has recently emerged as a hot topic in international transport research groups. The aim of this paper is to present a novel approach to the assessment of noise impacts that could be of value to railway operations, complementing traditional approaches based on the reduction of exposure. Awareness comprises several non-acoustical factors pointed out in the past as affecting annoyance: information (accessibility, transparency and understanding), trust, influence/voice, attitude towards the source, predictability of the noise situation, awareness of negative effects [...] . The project aims to obtain knowledge of this factor, analyse its influence, and take advantage of it to mitigate annoyance. This is an approach that has not been exploited in depth in the past, and does not imply the reduction of noise emissions at all, so that it can be managed together with other noise control measures. It is based on the hypothesis that "bringing information closer to residents will reduce noise annoyance", and tries to answer the following question: How does Awareness Influence Noise Annoyance? To what extent can Communication or other Non-Acoustical measures modify Awareness in order to help residents to cope with Noise...|$|R
40|$|In the {{acoustic}} consulting, testing, design and engineering {{work of the}} Fraunhofer-Institute of Building Physics (IBP) the low-frequency end of the noise spectra and the room acoustic conditioning has gained tremendous importance over the years. For solving the long-ranging noise pollution from e. g. exhaust stacks and chimneys, a series of low- frequency sound attenuators with minimum flow resistance were developed. Its first representative was a novel membrane absorber [Ackermann U., et al., Sound absorbers of a novel membrane construction. Applied Acoustics 1998; 25 : 197 - 215]. Thanks to its slenderness and ruggedness {{it could also be}} employed for noise control and reverberation adjustment purposes in relatively narrow enclosures and harsh environments [Ver IL. Enclosures and wrappings. In: Harris C. M., editor. Handbook of acoustical measurements and noise control. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1991; Fuchs H. V., Hunecke J. ] The room plays its part at low frequencies. Das Musikinstrument 1993; 42 : 40 - 6 (in German). Meanwhile a new type of panel absorber has been optimized for both kinds of application. Its absorption efficiency at frequencies far below 100 Hz could be demonstrated and quantified by a special measuring procedure based on the reverberation of a small rectangular room at its eigenfrequencies (Zha X, et al. Measurements of an effective absorption coefficient below 100 Hz. Acoustics Bulletin 1999; 24 : 5 - 10). With the aid of this novel tool it is now possible to qualify reverberation rooms and anechoic chambers for frequencies down to 63 and 31 Hz, respectively (Fuchs HV, et al. Qualifying freefield and reverberation rooms for frequencies below 100 Hz. Applied Acoustics 2000; 59 : 303 - 22). In a companion paper in this same journal [4] [Fuchs H. V., et al. : Creating low-noise environments in communication rooms. Applied Acoustics (in print) ] appropriate experience is reported in creating low-noise environments in multi-purpose rooms like offices, restaurants, foyers and seminars. A number of representative case studies (Drotleff H., et al. : Attractive acoustic design of multi-purpose halls. 1. Chinese-German Platform Innovative Acoustics 2000 (October, 21 - 25. 2000)) show ample evidence that the low-frequency performance of the rooms has a strong influence on both the amplification of <b>intruding</b> external <b>noise</b> and the development of internally generated noise emanating from communication processes provoked by the users themselves. At work places where producing sound (by voices or/and instruments) is the main or only purpose for their existence, {{the acoustic}} qualification of the room at low frequencies turns out to be of the utmost importance, especially when musicians are forced to work in extremely narrow spaces like orchestra pits and rehearsal halls for many hours a day and often under extreme physical and mental pressure. The measures taken and described herein have proven to mitigate if not remove some of the acoustic burden put on musicians employed in states theatres...|$|R
5000|$|Filming {{took place}} in various {{locations}} including inside the apartment Cassavetes shared with his wife Gena Rowlands, and {{on the streets of}} New York. Using a 16 mm camera borrowed from Shirley Clarke, and monochrome film stock, Kullmar was forced to shoot scenes in which the actors could move in any direction they wished, making for unpredictable zoom and focus requirements. No filming permits were obtained, so the cast and crew were necessarily ready to pack quickly and leave a location. The lighting was a general wash rather than specific effects. The microphone was placed by Jay Crecco (who was also an actor in the film), and dialogue was recorded to tape with street <b>noises</b> <b>intruding.</b> Even though Cassavetes said [...] "print it!" [...] after he was satisfied with a scene, there was nobody on the crew keeping track of the film takes, so all of the exposed film had to be printed. The editing of the film was made much more difficult by the lack of notes taken during shooting, and by the sound recorded [...] "wild" [...] on tape, not synchronized with the film. The microphone failed to pick up some of the dialogue, requiring lip-readers to watch the footage and write down what had been said, so that the actors could re-record their dialogue. Editors Len Appelson, Maurice McEndree and Wray Bevins began work while shooting was still underway, editing the film in an office next door to the Variety Arts Theatre, the office which is seen hosting a rock 'n roll party in the film. Primary photography was finished by mid-May 1957, with 60000 ft of film exposed, but the editing took more than a year. Cassavetes was not available during much of this time; starting in June he was on location working as an actor first in Saddle the Wind, then he was acting in Virgin Island (both 1958). At the end of 1957, the editors moved to a professional editing suite to complete the task.|$|R
40|$|The sound {{insulation}} demands for dwellings and public building has {{increased over the}} years as the number of sound sources has grown. From the outside our homes are exposed to noise from cars, trains, airplanes, etc. <b>Noise</b> <b>intrudes</b> from our neighbours and their television and stereo equipments. Also noise from spaces for mechanical services systems tends to become more important due to increasing energy saving demands. This thesis presents new analytical models for predicting the sound reduction index of single or double plate systems. In the single plate case, a theoretical and experimental analysis of the air-borne sound transmission through a single plate is presented. The plate is assumed to be excited by a diffuse sound field and the velocity distribution of the plate is derived from the Kirchoff plate equation in the frequency domain. The resulting Fourier transform is evaluated using residue calculus and the solution is verified numerically. The analytical model is valid for a wide frequency range, both below, above and at the critical frequency. Special interest is paid to the area dependency of the sound reduction index. This technique is further expanded for the double plate case by adding another plate and an intermediate layer which is modelled as a locally reacting spring. The model is valid and continuous through both the mass-spring-mass resonance and the coincidence region. The results from the analytical models show good agreement with measured results in both the single and double plate case. A simplified model is also presented for the sound reduction index of finite size floating floors. The model is valid for two elastic plates with a resilient layer in between where the bottom plate, the load-bearing slab, is assumed to be excited with a diffuse airborne sound field. The top plate and the resilient layer compose the floating floor. The problem is solved for frequencies below, between and above the critical frequencies of the plates. Above the critical frequency of the load-bearing plate, but below that of the floating slab, the main coupling between the plates will occur at the coincidence angle of the load-bearing plate. Above the critical frequency of both plates, the main transmission will occur at the angle of coincidence of each plate. As the plates will interact, the {{sound insulation}} improvement will to some extent depend on the properties of the load-bearing slab. It is shown how the sound reduction index depends on the physical parameters and the geometry of the plates. QC 2010110...|$|R
40|$|The modern soundscape buzzes with noise. In the 1930 s, telephones, radios, and gramophones filled {{domestic}} spaces with technological noise, while crowds {{shouting in}} the streets created political clamour. During {{the war in the}} 1940 s, bombs and sirens broke through buildings and burst through consciousness. This dissertation examines the response of three British modernist writers to the cultural shifts brought about by technology and politics, which altered everyday experience and social relations. Elizabeth Bowen, Evelyn Waugh, and George Orwell represent noise in their fiction and nonfiction as a trope of power. Noise, as a palpable emblem of discontent and the acoustic unconsciousness of the period, infiltrates sentences and rearranges syntax, as in the invention of Newspeak in Nineteen Eight-Four. Noise cannot leave listeners in a neutral position. The "culture racket" of the 1930 s and 1940 s required urgent new ways of listening and listening with ethical intent. Chapter One provides a reading of Elizabeth Bowen's audible terrains in her novels of the 1930 s, where silences and sudden <b>noises</b> <b>intrude</b> on human lives. In Bowen's novels, technological noise has both comedic and tragic consequences. Chapter Two examines noise as a political signifier in The Heat of the Day, Bowen's novel of the blitz. Chapter Three takes up the significance of the culture racket to Evelyn Waugh's novels and travel writing of the 1930 s; noise assumes a disruptive, if highly comedic, value in his works, an ambiguity that expresses {{what it means to be}} modern. Chapter Four examines Waugh's penchant for satirizing the phoneyness of contemporary culture [...] -its political vacillations [...] -especially in Put Out More Flags, set during the Second World War. Chapter Five considers Orwell's engagement with the emerging social and political formations amongst working, racial, and warring classes in the 1930 s. Documenting noise in his reportage, Orwell sounds alarms to alert readers to the mounting social and political crises in his realist novels of the decade. Chapter Six argues that Orwell's final two novels of the 1940 s, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, represent the politics of noise in as much as they announce the noise of politics in totalitarian futures. Noise demarcates the insidiousness of propaganda as it screeches from telescreens, the keynote in Big Brother's ideological symphony of domination. Noise, throughout Orwell's writing, signifies the struggle for power. In its widest ramifications, noise provides an interpretive paradigm through which to read Bowen's, Waugh's, and Orwell's fiction and non-fiction, as well as modernist texts generally...|$|R
