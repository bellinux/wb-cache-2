25|$|The First Test between Australia and England {{is played}} {{nowadays}} a Brisbane. Nobody {{seems to know}} why, {{and all sorts of}} arguments are ventilated for and against more cricket Tests on the Woolloongabba ground. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> in favour of robbing Queensland of its greatest cricketing occasion, for the ground depresses. It is not a cricket ground at all. It is a concentration camp! Wire fences abound. Spectators are herded and sorted out into lots as though for all the world this was a slave market and not a game of cricket. The stands are of wood and filthy to sit on. The dining rooms are barns, without a touch of colour or a picture on the wall. Everywhere there is dust and dirt...The field is rough, although the wicket is usually a good one until it rains. Then it is a strip of turf with thousands of demons prancing up and down...at Brisbane only a Hutton could stay, let alone score runs.|$|E
500|$|Kapoor is {{also known}} for her {{assertive}} and moody nature, and her outspoken views and independence have been singled out for making major contributions to her career; they [...] "add to her superstar aura". In an early interview, she confessed to being an [...] "introvert, yet [...] extremely candid and blunt", reasoning: [...] "Total faith and complete belief in myself is my attitude towards life, films and virtually everything else. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> about doing what I feel is right. It {{is not easy to}} pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions." [...] Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it [...] "makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner." [...] Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor's demeanour is an act; she is [...] "cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her".|$|E
2500|$|Despite such friction, their {{relationship}} {{continued to be}} close. When Stanton died in 1902, Anthony wrote to a friend: [...] "Oh, this awful hush! It seems impossible that voice is stilled which I have loved to hear for fifty years. Always I have felt I must have Mrs. Stanton's opinion of things before I knew where I stood myself. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> at sea..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following Vinokourov's exit, Patrice Clerc {{president}} of Tour organisers Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) stated: [...] "I am not downcast and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> the more {{determined to go}} all the way in this fight...It may seem paradoxical but we are closing in on victory. I have been saying we have started a merciless war against doping...We live in dark times and it is out of the question to give up, it is out of the question to leave the place to those who cheat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Fox made a {{statement}} about her personal life: [...] "I have slept with other women but I've not been in love before Myra Stratton. People say I'm gay.... I don't know what <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>All</b> I know is that I'm in love with Myra [...] I love her completely and {{want to spend the}} rest of my life with her." [...] Fox said that she had been reluctant to come out because, having already dealt with obsessed fans and stalkers, she feared fans' possible reactions. In 2009, she announced her plans to form a civil partnership with Stratton.|$|E
2500|$|One professor, Dale Brigham, was at {{the center}} of {{controversy}} when he chose to administer a planned exam for Nutritional Science 1034, saying, [...] "If you don’t feel safe coming to class, then don’t come to class... I will be there, and there will be an exam administered in our class," [...] while allowing students an option to take a make-up exam. After some students complained that the professor was not taking the threats seriously, Brigham apologized and offered his resignation, saying, [...] "If my leaders think that my leaving would help, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> for it. I made a mistake, and I do not want to cause further harm." [...] However, the university turned down the resignation later that day.|$|E

2500|$|An anecdote of {{the battle}} that has some {{dramatic}} interest has it that Farragut was lashed to the mast during the passage of Fort Morgan. The image that it brings to mind is of absolute resolve: if his ship were to be sunk in the battle, he would go down with her. The truth, however, is more prosaic. He was indeed lashed to the rigging of the mainmast, {{but it was a}} precautionary move rather than an act of defiance. It came about after the battle had opened and smoke from the guns had clouded the air. In order {{to get a better view}} of the action, Farragut climbed into Hartfords rigging and soon was high enough that a fall would certainly incapacitate him and could have killed him. Seeing this, Captain Drayton sent a seaman aloft with a piece of line to secure the admiral. He demurred, saying, [...] "Never mind, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> right," [...] but the sailor obeyed his captain's orders, tying one end [...] of the line to a forward shroud, then around the admiral and to the after shroud.|$|E
2500|$|In {{describing}} himself, he said, [...] "I am {{not sure}} that I exist, actually. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> the writers that I have read, all the people that I have met, all the women that I have loved; all the cities that I have visited, all my ancestors." [...] As a young man, he visited the frontier pampas which extend beyond Argentina into Uruguay and Brazil. Borges said that his father wished him [...] "to become a citizen of the world, a great cosmopolitan," [...] in the way of Henry and William James. Borges lived and studied in Switzerland and Spain as a young student. As Borges matured, he traveled through Argentina as a lecturer and, internationally, as a visiting professor; he continued to tour the world as he grew older, finally settling in Geneva where he had spent some of his youth. Drawing on the influence of many times and places, Borges's work belittled nationalism and racism. Portraits of diverse coexisting cultures characteristic of Argentina are especially pronounced in the book Six Problems for don Isidoro Parodi (co-authored with Bioy Casares) and Death and the Compass. Borges wrote that he considered Mexican essayist Alfonso Reyes to be [...] "the best prose-writer in the Spanish language of any time." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Black Cat" [...] has {{influenced}} {{the production of}} numerous songs and inspired various artists to foray into the rock genre. Record producer RedOne was inspired by [...] "Black Cat" [...] for several songs on Nicole Scherzinger's debut album, Killer Love. Jessica Simpson considers the song an influence, saying [...] "Janet's music rocks," [...] citing [...] "Black Cat" [...] and [...] "Rhythm Nation" [...] specifically, adding [...] "Janet affects my music." [...] Fefe Dobson said the song was a primary influence for her third album Joy, saying [...] "I heard Janet’s ‘Black Cat,’ with its rock guitar riff. That’s what this album reflects." [...] Dobson explained, “Black Cat” incorporated a bunch {{of different types of}} music into one song. It was pop. It was punk. It was rock and roll. And <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>all</b> of those things. I think it hit me as a kid really hard, because I love to experience a fusion of musical genres." [...] Mexican singer Selena cited Jackson among her main influences; with Chris Pérez stating, [...] "Selena especially loved Jackson's song [...] "Black Cat" ... I can't even count how many times Selena and I listened to that single." [...] Solange Knowles also called the song an influence, saying, [...] "I remember I had a solo dance for a song of hers called 'Black Cat', and that was the start of my Janet love affair," [...] wearing a black unitard and cat ears. [...] Rihanna's single [...] "Rockstar 101" [...] was considered reminiscent of Jackson's pursuit, and she also worked with Nuno Bettencourt, the guitarist on the single edit of [...] "Black Cat," [...] during the song's live performances. Alanis Morissette's transition from dance-pop into alternative rock with Jagged Little Pill was partially inspired by the song, with author Paul Cantin writing, [...] "She may have been a fan of dance music, but when the band covered Janet Jackson's rock-flavoured song [...] "Black Cat," [...] her bandmates could see how eager she was to let go." [...] Singer-songwriter BJ the Chicago Kid cited Jackson's performance on the Rhythm Nation World Tour as an inspiration to enter the music industry, saying [...] "I remember seeing the Black Cat tour with Janet Jackson as a kid. They were wheeling a cage out on stage and there’s a black panther in there! I’m like a kid in the photographers pit like, ‘Woah.' She’s beautiful and I’m seeing a real live fucking cat.. [...] would later be signed to Motown Records and do the same thing. So they were instilling and pouring into my soul the whole time." ...|$|E
