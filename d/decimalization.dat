25|$|Radhanpur {{came under}} British control in 1813. Even so, the Nawabs minted their own coins until 1900, {{when the state}} adopted the Indian currency; a {{particularly}} forward-looking Nawab briefly introduced <b>decimalization,</b> with 100 fulus equaling one rupee. Still, India did not decimalize its currency until 1957.|$|E
25|$|The mill {{was used}} with the Cypriot pound, {{starting}} with <b>decimalization</b> in 1955, and lasting until 1983. However, coins smaller than 5 mils were not used since the mid 1960s. When switched to cents in 1983, a ½-cent coin was struck that was abolished a few years later.|$|E
25|$|The 10 {{shilling}} {{note was}} replaced by the 50 new pence coin in the run up to <b>decimalization.</b> 10 pound notes were introduced in 1975, followed by 20 pounds in 1980 and 50 pounds in 1994. Although 1 and 2 pound coins have been introduced, the 1 pound note still circulates.|$|E
25|$|The dollar {{replaced}} the pound {{at a rate}} of 1 dollar = 7 shillings in 1966, 7 years before independence. This rate allowed the establishment of parity with the U.S. dollar, due to the sterling/dollar rate then being fixed at £1 = $2.80. To aid in <b>decimalization,</b> three-dollar bills and fifteen-cent coins were created, as three dollars was roughly equivalent to one pound, and fifteen cents to a shilling, at the time of transition.|$|E
25|$|Coinage with {{explicit}} denominations in decimal {{fractions of}} the franc also began in 1795. <b>Decimalization</b> of the franc was mandated by {{an act of}} 7 April 1795, which also dealt with of weights and measures. France led the world in adopting the metric system and it was the second country to convert from a non-decimal to a decimal currency, following Russia’s conversion in 1704, and the third country to adopt a decimal coinage, also following the United States in 1787. France’s first decimal coinage used allegorical figures symbolizing revolutionary principles, like the coinage designs the United States had adopted in 1793.|$|E
500|$|Although {{there was}} no {{specific}} decree regarding angular measure which was also decimalised during the 1790s, it {{is reported to have}} been used in 1794, but was not mentioned in the metric system decree of 1795. In particular, the [...] repeating circle, invented in about 1787 by Borda, himself a strong proponent of <b>decimalization,</b> was adapted to use decimal angles.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to Talleyrand's proposal of 1790, the Assemblée {{set up a}} new committee {{under the auspices of the}} Académie to investigate weights and measures. The members were five of the most able scientists of the day—Jean-Charles de Borda, Joseph-Louis Lagrange, Pierre-Simon Laplace, Gaspard Monge and Condorcet. [...] The committee, having decided that counting and weights and measures should use the same radix (numerical base), debated the use of the duodecimal (base 12) system as an alternative to the decimal system. Eventually the committee decided that the advantages of divisibility by three and four was outweighed by the complications of introducing a duodecimal system and on 27 October 1790 recommended to the Assemblée that currency, weights and measures should all be based on a decimal system. They also argued in favour of the <b>decimalization</b> of time and of angular measures. The committee examined three possible standards for length – the length of pendulum that beat with a frequency of once a second at 45° latitude, a quarter of the length of the equator and a quarter of the length of a meridian. [...] The committee also proposed that the standard for weight should be the weight of distilled water held in cube with sides a decimal proportion of the standard for length. The committee's final report to the Assemblée on 17 March 1791 recommended the meridional definition for the unit of length. Borda, inventor of the repeating circle was appointed chairman. The proposal was accepted by the Assemblée on 30 March 1791.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{abbreviation}} d. {{derived from}} the Latin [...] It followed the amount after a space. It has been replaced since <b>decimalization</b> by p, usually written without a space or period. From this abbreviation, {{it is common to}} speak of pennies and values in pence as [...] "p". In North America, it is common to abbreviate cents with the currency symbol ¢. Elsewhere, it is usually written with a simplec.|$|E
2500|$|The Carolingian penny was {{originally}} a [...]940-fine silver coin weighing 1/240 pound. It {{was adopted by}} Offa of Mercia and other English kings and remained the principal currency in Europe {{over the next few}} centuries until repeated debasements necessitated the development of more valuable coins. The British penny remained a silver coin until the expense of the Napoleonic Wars prompted the use of base metals in 1797. Despite the <b>decimalization</b> of currencies in the United States and, later, throughout the British Commonwealth, the name remains in informal use.|$|E
2500|$|The mill or mille (₥) (sometimes mil in the UK, when {{discussing}} property {{taxes in the}} United States, or previously in Cyprus and Malta) is a now-abstract unit of currency used sometimes in accounting. In the United States, it is a notional unit equivalent to [...] of a United States dollar (a one-hundredth of a dime or {{a tenth of a}} cent). In the United Kingdom it was proposed during the decades of discussion on the <b>decimalization</b> of the pound as a [...] division of the pound sterling. [...] Several other currencies used the mill, such as the Maltese lira.|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century, coins {{were issued}} by the various provinces. There were copper 1 duit, silver 1, 2, 6 and 10 stuivers, 1 and 3 guilders, [...] and 1 rijksdaalder and [...] and 1 ducaton. Gold 1 and 2-ducat trade coins were also minted. Between 1795 and 1806, the Batavian Republic issued coins in similar {{denominations}} to the earlier provincial issues. The Kingdom of Holland minted silver 10 stuivers, 1 florin and 1 guilder (equivalent), 50 stuivers and [...] guilder (also equivalent) and 1 rijksdaalder, along with gold 10 and 20 guilders. Before <b>decimalization,</b> the Kingdom of the Netherlands briefly issued some 1 rijksdaalder coins.|$|E
2500|$|Formerly, the rupee (11.66g, [...]917 fine silver) {{was divided}} into 16 annas, 64 paise, or 192 pies. Each {{circulating}} coin of British India, until the rupee was decimalised, had a different name in practice. A paisa was equal to two dhelas, three pies and six damaris. Other coins for two paisas (taka), two annas (dawanni), four annas (a chawanni, or {{a quarter of a}} rupee), eight annas (an atthanni, or half a rupee) were widely in use until <b>decimalization</b> in 1961. The names of these coins denote the numeral of their value in annas in Urdu, except taka (two paisas or half an anna). While the word taka was commonly used in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), alternatively for rupee, the two-paise coin was called a taka in West Pakistan.|$|E
2500|$|In British English, {{prior to}} <b>decimalization,</b> values {{from two to}} eleven pence and of twenty pence are often written and spoken as a single word, as twopence or tuppence, threepence or thruppence, [...] (Other values were usually {{expressed}} in terms of shillings and pence or written as two words, {{which may or may not}} be hyphenated.) Where a single coin represented a number of pence, it was treated as a single noun, as a sixpence or two eightpences. Thus, [...] "a threepence" [...] would be single coin of that value whereas [...] "three pence" [...] would be its value and [...] "three pennies" [...] would be three penny coins. In British English, divisions of a penny were added to such combinations without a conjunction, as sixpence-farthing, and such constructions were also treated as single nouns. Adjectival use of such coins used the ending -penny, as sixpenny.|$|E
2500|$|As in the UK, 5 and 10 new pence coins were {{introduced}} in 1968, followed by 50 new pence coins in 1969, before <b>decimalization</b> took place in 1971 and the ½, 1 and 2 new pence coins {{were introduced}}. These coins were {{the same size and}} composition as the corresponding British coins. The word [...] "new" [...] was dropped in 1977. The £1 coin was introduced in 1981, two years before its introduction in the UK, although the 20 pence and £2 coins were introduced {{at the same time as}} in the UK: 1982 and 1998, respectively. The thickness of the 1981 coin was significantly thinner than the modern version and the diameter also measured slightly less. The 1 pound coin will cease to be legal tender on 15 October 2017 to coincide with the withdrawal of the circular £1 coin in the UK. The UK's new 12-sided £1 coin will be the only £1 coin that is legal tender in the Island..|$|E
2500|$|The slash (as the [...] "shilling mark" [...] or [...] "solidus") was the {{currency}} {{sign of the}} shilling, a former coin of the United Kingdom and its former colonies. Before the <b>decimalization</b> of currency in Britain, its currency symbols (collectively £sd) represented their Latin names, derived from a medieval French modification of the late Roman libra, solidus, and denarius. Thus, one penny less than two pounds was written [...] During the period when English orthography included the long s , the s. (that is, ſ.) came to be written as a single slash. When the d. fell out of general use, one penny less than two pounds was written [...] Similarly, [...] "2/6" [...] meant two shillings sixpence. In Britain, five shillings even was typically written [...] "5∕-" [...] while, in East Africa, it was more common to mark it with a double hyphen as [...] "5/=". The same style was also used under the British Raj and early independent India for the predecimalization [...] rupee/anna/pie system.|$|E
2500|$|Penny {{is first}} attested in a 1394 Scots text, {{a variant of}} Old English , a {{development}} of numerous variations including , , and [...] The etymology of the term [...] "penny" [...] is uncertain, although cognates are common across almost all Germanic languages and suggest a base *pan-, *pann-, or *pand- with the individualizing suffix -ing. Common suggestions include that it was originally *panding as a Low Franconian form of Old High German [...] "pawn" [...] (in {{the sense of a}} pledge or debt, as in a pawnbroker putting up collateral as a pledge for repayment of loans); *panning as a form of the West Germanic word for [...] "frying pan", presumably owing to its shape; and *ponding as a very early borrowing of Latin [...] ("pound"). Recently, it has been proposed that it may represent an early borrowing of Punic [...] (Pane or Pene, [...] "Face"), as the face of Carthaginian goddess Tanit was represented on nearly all Carthaginian currency. Following <b>decimalization,</b> the British and Irish coins were marked [...] "new penny" [...] until 1982 and 1985, respectively.|$|E
2500|$|In French, the {{currency}} is also called Canadian French slang terms include [...] or [...] (the original word used in 18th-century French to translate [...] "dollar") and [...] (equivalent to [...] "loonie", since [...] is French for [...] "loon," [...] the bird {{appearing on the}} coin). The French pronunciation of [...] (pronounced similarly to English as [...] or , not like the word for hundred, [...] or [...] ) is generally used for the subdivision; [...] is another, informal, term for 1¢. 25¢ coins in Quebec French are often called [...] ("thirty cents") because {{of a series of}} changes in terminology, currencies, and exchange rates. After the British conquest of Canada in 1760, French coins gradually went out of use, and [...] became a nickname for the halfpenny, which was similar in value to the French sou. Spanish dollars and U.S. dollars were also in use, and from 1841 to 1858, the exchange rate was fixed at $4 = £1 (or 400¢ = 240d). This made 25¢ equal to 15d, or 30 halfpence (...) [...] After <b>decimalization</b> and the withdrawal of halfpence coins, the nickname [...] began to be used for the 1¢ coin, but the idiom [...] for 25¢ endured.|$|E

50|$|The coin was {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a short-lived attempt at <b>decimalization</b> of the currency, after an earlier attempt had spawned the florin. As with the sixpence, Shilling, and Florin the coin was not demonetized as part of the 1971 <b>decimalization.</b> Unlike those coins it has not been subsequently called in, and it remains legal tender for 20 pence. The coins are not likely spent, though, as the silver content of each coin is worth far more than 20 pence.|$|E
