40|$|PaperPg. 71 - 78. The paper {{discusses}} the fundamental relationships between turbine overspeed {{and the time}} constant of the rotor. The amount of overspeed is shown to be related {{not only to the}} time lag of the <b>emergency</b> <b>tripping</b> devices, but also to the amount of thermal energy stored in piping to the turbine. Methods of protecting against overspeed are described and discussed. The use of red 1 mdant and "fail-safe" designs is given as a way of arriving at a system to give reliable protection of the turbine against overspeed...|$|E
40|$|Stuck pipe {{incidents}} {{are a major}} operational concern during most drilling operations. Even when stuck pipe situations are resolved, they usually {{require a lot of}} resources. In the worst case scenario stuck pipe causes loss of the borehole. This Thesis is an investigation of a stuck pipe incident that ultimately led to the loss of an on-shore well drilled in Slovakia. Percussion air hammer technology was used for drilling the hole and foam was occupying the annulus {{at the time of the}} incident. The drillstring became stuck during an <b>emergency</b> <b>tripping</b> out of hole following an accident which led to a personal injury at the site. After the hole was abandoned the cause for becoming stuck was still unclear. 	The thesis aims to decide what caused the pipe to get stuck. First an overview of the situation is established by describing the course of events and essential information about the operation. Acquired information is then analyzed and discussed, noting indications of various stuck pipe causes. The acquired information included hook load logs and cuttings sampled from the well. The cuttings were analyzed with regards to shape, size and type of formation. Cuttings from selected parts of the well were also tested for water reactivity. The indications that were discovered were summarized and compared to possible stuck pipe causes. Fractured formations and reactive formations received the most support from the information that had been provided. Of the two, reactive formations seems more likely due to effectively accounting for type of material found in plug as well as the timing of the incident. Conclusive evidence of a particular cause for the incident could not be determined with confidence. Recommendations for further studies include:&# 149; Further study of stuck pipe cause if additional information exists at a future 		time. &# 149; Creating a diagnostic tool for use in air hammer drilling would help avoiding future stuck pipe incidents. Looking into the correct actions for different stuck pipe causes could also be a part of this study. &# 149; An evaluation of the protocols for air hammer drilling and tripping could uncover potential risks involved in currently used procedures. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{most urgent}} {{recommendation}} expressed by physicians, Red Cross officials, ambulance operators and others polled in this ambulance survey {{was to make}} much more emergency medical care training available to ambulance personnel. Very few sick and injured receive first aid before an ambulance arrives. Therefore {{there is also an}} urgent need to train and motivate the public to provide first aid {{at the scene of the}} emergency. Urban ambulances usually respond within 10 minutes, but often rural ambulances take more than 30 minutes to reach an emergency. It is during this interim that lives which could be saved by prompt first aid are lost. Little use has been made of aircraft as emergency ambulances; in 1968, only one <b>emergency</b> <b>trip</b> in 1500 was made by helicopter.

40|$|McNeil, SueTransportation {{systems are}} {{a class of}} {{critical}} civil infrastructure systems that {{must be able to}} respond to disruptions while continuing to provide mobility as well as reduce both human and property loss when disasters occur. " In the aftermath of these catastrophic events, <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> are among those most sensitive to delay. Considering the importance of the <b>emergency</b> <b>trips</b> and the special case of a damaged network after a disaster, the goal of this research is to develop a method to evaluate the performance of the transportation system, specifically for <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips,</b> after an earthquake. The first step in reaching this goal is to understand the particulars of the hazard itself and how the transportation system should be prepared. A limited number of earthquake scenarios, representing specific historical data and the possible events that occur in the aftermath, have been chosen to represent the hazard. The impact of each of these scenarios on the transportation components - specifically, bridges - is estimated in this research. In the following step, models predicting a number of <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> have been developed, followed by both supply and demand side is simulated with a macro simulation software. Travel delay and other measures to evaluate the performance of the transportation system are also calculated. Lastly, areas susceptible to the greatest delay for <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> are identified and countermeasures to reduce the delay are proposed. This method is used for two case studies: one in Newark, Delaware, and one in the San Fernando Valley of California. The Newark case study is used to understand the application of the methodology using a familiar network even though the area is not inherently vulnerable to earthquakes. The results of the analysis are as expected with relatively minor impacts. The San Fernando Valley case study used forty-nine earthquake scenarios. The analysis underscored the difficulties of accessing some of the more remote parts of the network, identifying areas underserved by medical and fire centers, and identified bridges that could impact the effectiveness of emergency response. While <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> are relatively small in number, the analysis demonstrates that in some areas these trips may be significantly impacted by disruption to the transportation network. These disruptions require understanding the demand for <b>emergency</b> response <b>trips</b> and understanding how these trips use the transportation network.

Traditionally, feline asthma has been managed with oral corticosteroids to decrease underlying inflammation and brochodilators (selective beta 2 adrenergic agonists or methylxanthines) to reverse smooth muscle contraction.

Both corticosteroids and selective beta 2 adrenergic agonists are available as MDI preparations. The benefits of aerosolized therapy include increased drug concentration at the site of action and decreased systemic absorption, leading to few side effects. In addition, the faster onset of action facilitated by the aerosolized delivery of bronchodilators offers owners an in-home treatment for acute asthmatic attacks, reducing <b>emergency</b> <b>trips</b> to the veterinarian or helping to stabilize the patient during transport.

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 96 The {{catastrophic failure}} of a high {{pressure}} centrifugal air compressor utilizing air-pressurized bearing housings dictated the redesign of its sister compressor. The modification of this early 1950 's compressor involved elements of both practical and analytical design. The project included the design of new bearings and seals and the alteration of various support systems to permit operation with non-pressurized bearing housings. The project was undertaken as risk minimization, with all performance and reliability improvements being additional benefits. The matching of the computer model with the field data of the existing system {{was the key to}} its successful evaluation. It was found that a case seal was acting as an additional bearing during certain operating conditions. This third bearing caused the compressor to behave differently than had been predicted with the initial two-bearing models. With the system properly modeled, changes were proposed to optimize the rotor dynamics. The main objectives were to achieve reliable rotor dynamic characteristics and to maintain the integrity of the process labyrinth seals. The changes were made in April, 1982, with the normal hardware fitting considerations. The subsequent start-up and operation were without incident. The modified compressor has performed well through a number of <b>emergency</b> <b>trips</b> and subsequent restarts, exhibiting exceptional rotor stability and overall reliability...|$|R
