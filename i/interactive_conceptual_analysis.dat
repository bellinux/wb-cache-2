Among other things, the article argues that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is necessary but not sufficient to a full {{understanding of the nature of}} law.

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> {{has undergone a}} revival in recent years. Although the extent of its role in philosophy is controversial, many now accept that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> has at least some role to play. Granting this, I consider the relevance of empirical investigation to <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis.</b> I do so by contrasting an extreme position (anti-empirical <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis)</b> with a more moderate position (non-empirical <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis).</b> I argue that anti-empirical <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is not a viable position because it has no means for resolving conceptual disputes that arise between seemingly competent speakers of the language. This is illustrated by considering one such dispute that has been pressed by a prominent advocate of anti-empirical conceptual analysis: Bennett and Hacker (2003) assert that psychological predicates only logically apply to whole living animals, but many scientists and philosophers use the terms more broadly. I argue that to resolve such disputes we need to empirically investigate the common understanding of the terms at issue. I then show how {{this can be done}} by presenting the results of three studies concerning the application of “calculates ” to computers. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> as a topic of philosophical discussion has seen something of a resurgence over the past decade.

40|$|While <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{traditionally}} {{seen as a}} prototypical armchair, or a priori, project, this view {{has come under fire}} from a number of directions. Externalists have claimed that important facts about natural kind terms (among others) are a posteriori (Kripke, 1972). Others have argued that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> must be informed by empirical findings on how concepts are structured in our minds (Ramsey, 1998, Stich & Weinberg, 2001). And experimental philosophers have tried to show that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> should be based in part on data gathered from the folk, which of course must be obtained outside of the armchair (e. g. Knobe, 2003). Each of these, however, has been disputed by defenders of traditional armchair <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> (e. g. Fumerton, 1999, Wheatherson, 2003, Kauppinen, 2007), and none has been entirely successful in convincing conceptual analysts to abandon their armchairs. This is because each relies on premises that those staunchly committed to the a priori nature of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> will find controversial. In this paper, I provide a new line of argument for the conclusion that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is not an armchair project. My argument does not start from disputed claim...|$|R
40|$|This article argues, against {{contemporary}} experimentalist criticism, that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> has epistemic value, with {{a structure}} that encourages the development of interesting hypotheses which are of the right form to be valuable in diverse areas of philosophy.

40|$|According to Tim Crane, {{his version}} of psychologism {{is not based on}} the {{familiar}} opposition between <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> and empirical science. His point is not simply to consider phenomenological and empirical data in the science of the mind. Challenging the idea that investigation of the mind has to be understood “as an autonomous investigation solely into the concepts embodied in our psychological discourse”, Crane tries to argue for a more realistic picture of the mental. His rejection of “autonomous investigation”, however, is based in the end on its impermeability to empirical evidence and on the consequent reduction of philosophy of mind to <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> of ordinary intentional vocabulary. This seems clear as far as <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> goes, but perhaps has some undesired consequences in terms of common sense vocabulary. In fact, with respect to folk psychological discourse about the mind, all that Crane is saying is that — besides <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> — we have to take into consideration empirical evidence in order to reconsider common sense discourse on the mind.

40|$|Abstract: A priori <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is {{once again}} part of the {{philosophical}} mainstream. Unlike their verificationist predecessors, modern conceptual analysts deny that we have armchair access to the essential nature of the objects and properties we think about. Instead, they claim we have access to how the reference of our words and thoughts is fixed. This position seems to resolve the apparent tension between semantic externalism and privileged access to one’s own meanings. However, I argue that our grasp of reference-fixing conditions is as fallible as our understanding of essences. It {{would be nice if}} good old a priori <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> were possible. For many years <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> was out of fashion, {{in large part because of}} the excessive ambitions of verificationist theories of meaning. However, those days are over.

40|$|Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> is a {{proposed}} methodology for attributing correct application conditions, or 'meanings', to concepts. This methodology involves two stages: first, we seek an empirical {{understanding of the}} ways in which usage of a given concept has regularly delivered benefits, and, second, we seek an explication of that concept which is optimally capable of delivering benefits in these ways. Such an explication captures the 'pragmatic meaning' of a given concept. Chapters 1 - 3 articulate Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> and the notion of pragmatic meaning, and show how these are related to other philosophical methodologies and accounts of concept-meaning. Chapter 4 uses a 'bootstrapping argument' to establish that Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> has two important virtues. The first phase of this argument establishes that Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> has normative authority - it reveals explications that we have practical and epistemic reason to adopt, whether we take these explications to be semantically revisionary or not. This normative authority licenses using Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis,</b> in the second phase, to explicate our shared concept of concept-meaning. This yields the conclusion that we have epistemic reason to adopt the notion of pragmatic meaning as our explication of 'concept-meaning'. Having explicated our concept in this way, we see that Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> also has descriptive authority - it is a semantically conservative tool that reveals concept-meaning, thus explicated. The initial presentation of the bootstrapping argument considers only one sort of work that our concept of concept-meaning does - helping to guide our application of other concepts. But this concept also regularly delivers benefits in a second way - by helping us to give good explanations for the behavior and behavioral success of various concept-users. Chapter 5 uses the normative authority of Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> to justify a particular account of how good explanations work. Chapter 6 draws upon this account to argue that, in order best to explain people's behavioral successes, we need an explication of concept-meaning that is closely related to the one presented in Chapter 4. Chapter 7 considers several objections and hard cases, and argues that Pragmatic <b>Conceptual</b> <b>Analysis</b> weathers these storms in good shape...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. December 2016. Major: Philosophy. Advisor: Brian Bix. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); viii, 283 pages. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> has {{been central to}} philosophy, {{at least in the}} analytic tradition. The nature of this method, its possibilities and limits, however, are not well understood. Furthermore, <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> as a methodology for philosophy has been criticized in multiple ways in recent years, especially {{under the influence of the}} so-called “Naturalistic Turn” in philosophy. All of these raise questions about the nature and grounding of a philosophical inquiry. In this dissertation, I respond to those criticisms of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> and defend it as a legitimate methodology in the context of jurisprudence. In the first half of the thesis, I analyze some prominent arguments about the nature of law and examine their methodological commitments. I argue that those criticisms of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> in jurisprudence relying on W. V. O. Quine’s attack on the analytic-synthetic distinction and on empirical/psychological discoveries about the use of intuitions are misguided. Accepting them would miss the opportunity to reflect on the methodology of philosophy, and blind us to the insights of the past generations of philosophers. A case study of how the method of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is actually at work in a theory of criminalization shows that this method is much richer and subtler than its critics have assumed. In the second half of the thesis, as a way of preparing for a positive view of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis,</b> I propose a new way of understanding necessary truths in a changing human institution such as law, and offer a series of reflections on the nature of concepts as related to the meta-discussions of legal theorizing. Drawing on materials from the recent history of analytic philosophy, I go on to show that the term “conceptual analysis” has been used in different ways. I argue that the contemporary dominant conception of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is a hangover from logical positivism. Finally, borrowing a term from P. F. Strawson, I characterize <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> as “connective analysis. ” I then clarify its features in relations to necessity, analyticity, meaning, a prioricity, ordinary usage, and historical understanding...|$|R

40|$|Those {{working in}} {{experimental}} philosophy have raised {{a number of}} arguments {{against the use of}} <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> in philosophical inquiries. But they have typically focused on a model that pursues <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> by taking intuitions as a kind of (defeasible) evidence for philosophical hypotheses. Little attention has been given to the constitutivist alternative, which sees metaphysical modal facts as reflections of constitutive semantic rules. I begin with a brief overview of the constitutivist approach and argue that we can defend a role for <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis,</b> so understood, in ontological disputes against both the general skepticism about the relevance of intuitions, and against the specific worries raised by experimental results. Finally, I argue that even if the constitutivist view is adopted, experimental philosophy may still have quite a useful role to play, though purely empirical inquiries cannot in principle do the ontological work alone. What are the proper methods for attempting to resolve ontological and modal disputes—taken as disputes about what ontological sorts of thing entities of various kinds (properties, numbers, statues, symphonies) are, what their existence and persistence conditions are, and so forth? To what extent are these questions resolvable at all? One venerable method of approaching such questions—pursued in ordinary language philosophy and (arguably) phenomenology—is to go by way of <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis,</b> considering, for example, whether a variety of actual and hypothetical cases would be situations in which a symphony was created or the same person survived. 1 Although <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> became less popular in neo-Quinean metaphysics, there have been several recent attempts at reviving and defending <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> as a method for ontology (Jackson 1998, Chalmers and Jackso...|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of personality and}} individual differences constructs is testament to the vibrancy of research in this field. Furthermore, all such constructs would make some claim to receiving empirical support. However, while additional empirical research will help further determine the merit of these conceptions, this paper proposes that <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> is another tool available to researchers to help critically evaluate our constructs of interest. <b>Conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> involves assessing both the clarity and coherency of our constructs as well as examining the relations between them. A useful direction here is scrutinising constructs in terms of intrinsic properties (what something is) and relations (what something does) to help both clarify and evaluate the coherency of these constructs, as well as build bridges between apparently disparate concepts. Given the perceived need for unification in psychology, <b>conceptual</b> <b>analysis</b> provides yet another tool for assessing the relationship of constructs {{to one another and}} contributing to a coherent account of 'persons'.

The particular area that this paper seeks to connect public law with is that of feminist critiques.
