50|$|Poor thermal insulation:The late 1960s was age {{of cheap}} energy, {{consequently}} the dwellings {{on the estate}} were not designed to be energy efficient. Some gains have been made through estate-wide programmes to install cavity wall insulation and <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> <b>units.</b> There is a particular problem with the roofs. In order to allow light into the four metre wide pathways between rows of terraces, the roof lines are low, {{and there are no}} lofts. This makes upgrading the roof installation more costly than the same job on a standard house.|$|E
40|$|Daylight is a {{valuable}} resource for both energy and human health. However, this resource is often underutilized in buildings due {{to the difficulty of}} controlling the changing qualities of daylight. Deep-plan building spaces pose an especially challenging problem because traditional sidelighting strategies are only effective for workplanes adjacent to the facade. Infrequently adjusted shading systems can also limit the availability of daylight. A number of advanced daylighting systems have been developed that attempt to address these challenges with varying priorities and success. This thesis proposes a new technology named the Soralux Daylighting System. The system is passive, requires no shading adjustments, even under direct sunlight, and works well with deep-plan spaces on the order of 8 to 15 m deep. The Soralux system presents itself as a <b>double-glazing</b> <b>window</b> <b>unit,</b> allowing it to be easily integrated into curtain wall facades typical of deep-plan offices in large cities. Computer simulations using the ray tracing programs Radiance and TracePro were conducted to estimate the annual performance of the system. Variables such as facade orientation, sky obstruction, and climate were evaluated for their effect on system performance. The system was found to increase light levels by a factor of 2 to 10 compared to an unshaded window at depths between 8 and 15 m from the facade. Two physical mockups of the Soralux system were fabricated for testing. The first mockup tested was a small proof-of-concept prototype, while the second was a full-scale mockup which was installed in a Tokyo office building. The physical mockups were used to evaluate visual comfort and appearance. A monitoring campaign was also conducted for the Tokyo mockup and the measured data were compared with a Radiance model of the building space to validate the accuracy of the simulation results. The average error between simulated and measured illuminance values was 16 %. Based on these results, recommendations are provided identifying which scenarios are well-suited for the system. The Soralux Daylighting System is scheduled to be permanently installed into a Tokyo office building in 2012. by Kevin W. Thuot. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|For {{the active}} control of {{structural}} vibrations, {{knowledge about the}} controllability of the actuators is mandatory. To improve the sound transmission properties of <b>double-glazed</b> <b>windows,</b> the coupled dynamics of structure and cavity have to be considered. The radiating pane is isolated from the other one by the compressible gas inside the cavity. Depending on the geometry of the double partitioned walls, the coupled mode shapes may yield to high radiation coefficients because of their special shapes, which are less symmetric than pure structural ones. In order to investigate such phenomena and to find a straightforward design strategy for an actively controlled <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window,</b> an acoustic test stand has been prepared with an asymmetric <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window.</b> Besides an already existing finite element model, this paper describes an analytical model of the coupled system.

Thermally induced {{switching}} temperature, {{spectral transmittance}} {{of a new}} kind of thermotropic material developed by a different mixing proportion of hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), Sodium Chloride (NaCl) and pure water was measured. The optimum mixing proportion of samples for application was determined by solar radiation and outdoor temperature measurements. Radiation transmittance was tested on samples of a thermotropic double glazing window, double glazing window and Low-E double glazing window. Results show that thermotropic <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> with the optimum mixing proportion of HPMC, NaCl and pure water of 2 : 10 : 100 by mass reduces radiation transmittance at fully turbid state by up to 72 % and 32 %, respectively, compared to the ordinary <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> and Low-E <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> which do not have adjustable radiation transmittance, and its radiation transmittance changed from transparent state to light scattering state is up to 60 %, indicating a high performance on switching solar radiation and a great potential for energy efficient windows.

40|$|Saving {{fossil fuels}} {{and the use of}} clean sources of energy lead to reduce in {{building}} operating costs, protect the environment and people's health. Windows are the most vulnerable part of building where energy loss occurs. <b>Double-glazed</b> <b>windows</b> are very effective in keeping inside temperature isolated from outside; thereby, saving electrical and thermal energy. The current study estimates the numerical changes in cooling and heating load in case of replacement <b>double-glazed</b> <b>window</b> with single-glazed window and calculates saving level for this replacement. In this context, this paper presents a model of real samples taken in Mashhad climate. To ensure the accuracy of the simulation results, real results were compared with electricity and gas bills. To calculate energy related parameters such as cooling load, heating load, the consumption of gas and electricity, the energy simulation software (Design Builder) was used. The research method was a quantitative analysis based on energy consumption modeling, associated with building windows which comes in four sections. The field study was also used to compare with real electricity and gas bills. As the first stage, samples of the plan were identified, based on the observation of climate models and library studies. Then, simulation parameters such as window materials and internal and external walls were considered. The simulation was performed based software’s parameters and model limitations were determined based on thermal, lighting, climatic and architectural parameters. Finally, the experimental and practical data were used to determine the validity of the model under Mashhad climate conditions. Overall, the results indicated that <b>double-glazed</b> <b>windows</b> could save 50 % of entire building loads, 0. 2 % on power consumption, 16. 2 % on gas and 12. 4 % on overall households’ energy consumption...|$|R
