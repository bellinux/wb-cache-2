Nonetheless, Brussels does not have its own community; rather the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> and the French Community both have {{jurisdiction}} in Brussels. The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> Commission (VGC) and the French Community Commission (COCOF) were to act on their respective Communities' behalf in Brussels. Brussels divides its funding for the Communities between them, with 20% going to the VGC, and 80% to the COCOF.|$|E
25|$|The French Community and the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> {{exercise}} their powers in Brussels through two community-specific public authorities: the French Community Commission (French: Commission communautaire française or COCOF) and the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> Commission (Dutch: Vlaamse Gemeenschapscommissie or VGC). These two bodies each have an assembly {{composed of the}} members of each linguistic group of the Parliament of the Brussels-Capital Region. They also have a board composed of the ministers and secretaries of state of each linguistic group in the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region.|$|E
25|$|The French Community Commission {{has also}} another capacity: some {{legislative}} {{powers of the}} French Community have been devolved to the Walloon Region (for the French language area of Belgium) and to the French Community Commission (for the bilingual language area). The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community,</b> however, did the opposite; it merged the Flemish Region into the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community.</b> This is related to different conceptions in the two communities, one focusing more on the Communities and the other more on the Regions, causing an asymmetrical federalism. Because of this devolution, the French Community Commission can enact decrees, which are legislative acts.|$|E

40|$|In 1997, the <b>Flemish</b> Deaf <b>community</b> officially {{refused to}} impose {{standardisation}} on Flemish Sign Language.

In this article we shall discuss the choices the <b>Flemish</b> Deaf <b>community</b> has made with respect to standardisation of their sign language and explore why the <b>Flemish</b> Deaf <b>community</b> has decided to reject standardisation imposed from above (or standardisation as action noun). The foremost reasons are bad experiences with a former lexical unification scheme within the “Signed Dutch” project and a lack of in-depth lexicological research into Flemish Sign Language. At the same time it has become clear that in the past decades there has been a form of spontaneous standardisation of VGT (or standardisation as process noun). While the <b>Flemish</b> Deaf <b>community</b> has rejected to impose standardisation from above they have opted to try and find ways to support this on-going standardisation process. We shall look at which actions have been proposed and have been taken to that end...|$|R
50|$|Flemish Sign Language (Vlaamse Gebarentaal; VGT) is {{the deaf}} sign {{language}} of Belgium, {{a country in}} Western Europe.

40|$|This chapter {{deals with}} {{linguistic}} ideologies and deaf people’s attitudes towards Flemish Sign Language (VGT), in the past, in the present, {{and to some}} extent also in the future. In its historical evolution, VGT has developed from complete linguistic erasure (Irvine & Gal 2000) to symbolic recognition by mainstream society and legal recognition by Flemish Parliament, via implicit recognition within the VGT linguistic minority community. This has gone hand in hand with changing attitudes within the Deaf community towards the status of VGT. The 2006 recognition has unmistakably had an empowering effect in the <b>Flemish</b> Deaf <b>community,</b> even though the actual knowledge as to the contents of the recognition decree may be rather meager.

25|$|The {{ambiguity}} {{between this}} wider area {{and that of}} the County (or the Belgian parts thereof), still remains. In most present-day contexts however, in general the term Flanders is taken to refer to either the political, social, cultural, and linguistic community (and the corresponding official institution, the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community),</b> or the geographical area, one of the three institutional regions in Belgium, namely the Flemish Region.|$|E
25|$|Amidst tension {{throughout}} the country, the sociolinguistic neglect of Dutch began to fade. The recognition of Dutch {{as the sole}} language of Flanders, the expansion of a well-functioning Flemish educational system, {{the development of the}} Flemish economy, and the popularization of Standard Dutch were responsible for its revitalization. The <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> saw that if it wanted Dutch to have a prominent place in Brussels, it would need to make investing in Dutch language education its primary concern.|$|E
25|$|Education is {{compulsory}} from 6 to 18 {{years of}} age for Belgians.

Though an estimated 99% {{of the adult population}} is literate, concern is rising over functional illiteracy. The Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), coordinated by the OECD, currently ranks Belgium's education as the 19th best in the world, being significantly higher than the OECD average.

40|$|Based on {{research}} in three <b>Flemish</b> <b>communities,</b> the author concluded {{that during the}} course of the second part of the nineteenth century, there was an increasing trend toward choosing family members as witnesses to the marriage ceremony (of first marriages). This was interpreted as an aspect of the "familiarization" of marriage. It might also, however refer to changing family contexts and social networks, to switching roles of parents and youth, to shifting intergenerational power and to new family situations of solidarity and conflict. In this follow-up study, the author demonstrates that the former conclusions also hold true for other Flemish regions, for all social groups, and for remarriages. It also appears that marrying people increasingly selected brothers and brothers-in-law as witnesses, rather than descending or ascending kin. These observations support the thesis of the increasing familiarization of family relations {{during the course of}} the nineteenth century. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The {{number of}} Dutch-speaking Flemish {{people in the}} Capital Region is {{estimated}} to be between 11% and 15% (official figures do not exist as there is no language census and no official subnationality). According to a survey conducted by the Université catholique de Louvain in Louvain-la-Neuve and published in June 2006, 51% of respondents from Brussels claimed to be bilingual, even if they do not have Dutch as their first language. They are governed by the Brussels Region for economics affairs and by the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> for educational and cultural issues.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Flemish {{institutions such}} as the Flemish Parliament and Government, represent the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community</b> and the Flemish Region. The region and the community thus de facto share the same parliament and the same government. All these institutions are based in Brussels. Nevertheless, both types of subdivisions (the Community and the Region) still exist legally and the distinction between both is important for the people living in Brussels. Members of the Flemish Parliament who were elected in the Brussels Region cannot vote on affairs belonging to the competences of the Flemish Region.|$|E
25|$|The Brussels-Capital Region {{is one of}} {{the three}} federated regions of Belgium, {{alongside}} the Walloon Region and the Flemish Region.

Almost all of the inhabitants of the Capital region speak French as either their primary language (50%) or as a lingua franca (45%). There are also many Flemish people who speak French as a second language. Belgian French is in most respects identical to standard, Parisian French, but differs in some points of vocabulary, pronunciation, and semantics.|$|E
25|$|Belgium {{currently}} {{operates a}} complex federal system {{between the two}} main groups: Flemish and Walloons. There's a division of Belgium into three regions, where Brussels-Capital Region is an independent region, next to Flanders and Wallonia. The regions are mostly responsible for the economy, mobility and other territory-related matters. But there's also a division of Belgium into three communities: the <b>Flemish</b> <b>Community,</b> the French Community and the German-speaking Community. These communities are responsible for language-related matters like culture or education. Brussels doesn't belong to any community, but has a bilingual status. So the Brussels inhabitants may enjoy education or cultural affairs or education organised by the Flemish and/or the French community.|$|E
