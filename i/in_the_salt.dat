40|$|Cations {{derived by}} {{protonation}} of the ligand title compound (L¹) have been structurally characterized in their di- and tetra- protonated forms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salts</b> [H₂L¹][ClO₄]₂· 4 H₂O and [H₄L¹][ZnCl₄]₂· 4 H₂O. In both structures, {{one half of}} the formula unit comprises the asymmetric unit of the structure, the macrocycle being centrosymmetric, with the two macrocycles adopting similar conformations. In both salts, a pair of diagonally opposed macrocyclic secondary amine groups are protonated; <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [H₄L¹]⁴⁺ <b>salt,</b> <b>the</b> additional pair of protons are accommodated on the exocyclic pendant amine groups. The dispositions of the pendent amines differ between the two structures, being equatorial with respect to <b>the</b> macrocyclic ring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [H₂L¹]²⁺ <b>salt,</b> and axial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> [H₄L¹]⁴⁺ <b>salt.</b> <b>In</b> other structurally characterized compounds containing [H₄L¹]⁴⁺ the equatorial disposition was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ferricyanide adduct, while <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tetraperchlorate <b>salt</b> <b>the</b> axial disposition was identified. <b>The</b> differences <b>in</b> disposition of <b>the</b> exocyclic groups are ascribed to <b>the</b> extensive H-bonding <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lattices...|$|R

5|$|According to Sarma, Gandhi {{recruited}} {{women to}} participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> tax campaigns and the boycott of foreign products, which gave many women a new self-confidence and dignity {{in the mainstream}} of Indian public life. However, other scholars such as Marilyn French state that Gandhi barred women from joining his civil disobedience movement because he feared he would be accused of using women as political shield. When women insisted that they join the movement and public demonstrations, according to Thapar-Bjorkert, Gandhi asked the volunteers to get permissions of their guardians and only those women who can arrange child-care should join him. Regardless of Gandhi's apprehensions and views, Indian women joined the Salt March by the thousands to defy the British salt taxes and monopoly on salt mining. After Gandhi's arrest, the women marched and picketed shops on their own, accepting violence and verbal abuse from British authorities for the cause in a manner Gandhi inspired.|$|E
5|$|After Leafs General Manager Pat Quinn {{was unwilling}} to give Joseph a {{four-year}} contract (he offered three years), he left after the 2001–02 season to sign with the Detroit Red Wings. Some also speculated {{that the relationship between}} Quinn and Joseph was frosty because Quinn had benched Joseph <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City Olympics after the first game, although Joseph himself denied the rumours, saying that he played a bad first game against Sweden (losing 5–2) and that Martin Brodeur played very well {{for the rest of the}} tournament, earning his spot as the starter. Joseph had also hinted at wanting to play for a team that could win it all, implying the Leafs were not such a team. Joseph's move to Detroit was highly publicized and unpopular in Toronto.|$|E

5|$|Groves and Parsons {{met with}} Lauritsen and Bruce Sage, who {{had built the}} China Lake Pilot Plant where the rockets were made, and {{it was agreed that}} Caltech would build and operate the plant. A site was chosen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Wells Valley and work {{commenced}} on 80 buildings, 52 of them permanent, at a cost of $13 million. Groves wanted the plant working within 100 days. While Site S had sufficient capacity to make explosive components for one or two bombs, it was unlikely that it could meet the expected demand in the months to come. Complicating the construction program was the fact that Los Alamos had not finalized what processes would be used.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Monson {{joined the}} United States Naval Reserve and {{anticipated}} participating in World War II in the Pacific theater. He {{was sent to}} San Diego, California, for training, but was not stationed overseas {{before the end of}} the war. His tour of duty lasted six months beyond the end of the war, then he returned to the University of Utah. Monson graduated cum laude in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in business management. Monson did not serve a mission as a youth. At age 21, on October 7, 1948, he married Frances Beverly Johnson <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Temple. The couple eventually had three children: Thomas Lee, Ann Frances, and Clark Spencer.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the unrest in Sicily, a wave of rioting spread through Italy in August 1893, triggered by {{the killing of a}} number of migrant workers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salt</b> pans of Aigues Mortes in southern France escalated into a more generalized working-class revolt supported by anarchists and violent riots in Rome and Naples. Italy seemed to be slipping to a revolution. By the time Crispi returned to power in December 1893, Italy appeared to many to be on the brink of collapse. Crispi promised important measures of land reform for the near future. He was not blind to the misery and the need for social reform. Before 1891 he had been the patron of the Sicilian working-class and many of their associations had been named after him. Colajanni, the chief architect of Giolitti’s fall by exposing the Banca Romana scandal, was first offered the Ministry of Agriculture, which he refused, then sent to Sicily on a mission of appeasement.|$|E
40|$|By {{considering}} {{the structures of}} many salts derived from extended TTF analogues, relationships between the molecular architecture of the donors with their electrochemical properties and their stacking mode <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salts</b> are presented <b>in</b> this critical review. Three categories of donors corresponding to their extension modes have been considered. Firstly, for linearly extended TTFs the crucial role of <b>the</b> spacer <b>in</b> modifying <b>the</b> electrochemical properties and <b>the</b> packing mode <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salts</b> is presented. Secondly, bidimentional extension of the donors obtained by linking several dithiafulvenyl units on a TTF core led to materials with increased dimensionality. Finally, the last class corresponds to the fusion, directly or across a benzene ring, of TTF frameworks. The former are the base of many salts with metallic behaviour...|$|R

5|$|On July 22, 1847, {{the first}} party of Mormon pioneers arrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Valley, where they founded Salt Lake City, the first European {{settlement}} in Utah. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains {{and settled in}} Utah. Initial colonization along the Wasatch Front was mostly made by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) with no direct involvement from it. Outside the Wasatch Front, most settlements were directed, planned, organized, and dispatched by leaders of the LDS Church. Settlements were also founded by the railroads, mining companies and non-Mormons. Many settlements were named after leaders, history or from scriptures of the LDS Church. Natural features of the region, including rivers, mountains, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for names.|$|E
5|$|When the Latter Day Saints {{began to}} migrate west in 1846, James {{prepared}} {{to move as}} well. Although many of her immediate family members, including her mother, three brothers, and two sisters, had joined the church, {{she was the only}} one who chose to move West with the main body of saints from Nauvoo. At the time of the James family's departure, she was pregnant with a second son, Silas James, who was born at Hogg Creek, Iowa in June 1846. James, her husband Isaac, and Sylvester were part of the original group of Latter Day Saints to spend the winter of 1846–1847 at Winter Quarters, Nebraska. They were also part of the Ira Eldredge company, the first Mormon pioneer company to enter the Salt Lake Valley in September 1847. At the time of their settlement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Valley, they made up a third of the 12 African Americans living in Utah, and were the only ones who were free.|$|E
5|$|Sharon Elizabeth Hall {{was born}} on November 30, 1939, in Independence, Missouri. When she was in junior high, Doris and Eugene Hall moved the family to Washington, {{but by the time}} Sharon was fifteen they had {{returned}} to Missouri, where Sharon attended William Chrisman High School. Sixteen-year-old Sharon met twenty-two-year-old college student James Kinne at a church function in the summer of 1956, and the couple dated regularly until Kinne returned to Brigham Young University in the fall. Sharon, reportedly deeply interested in finding a partner with prospects and who could take her away from Independence, soon wrote a letter to Kinne at school informing him that she was pregnant by him. Kinne took leave from his college and returned to Independence, where he married Sharon on October 18, 1956. The couple's marriage license identified sixteen-year-old Sharon as being eighteen and a widow; though she later refused to address the assertion, Sharon told people at the time that she had been married when she lived in Washington, to a man who later died in a car accident. The new couple held a second, more formal wedding the next year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Temple, after Sharon had completed the process of converting to Mormonism.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had been called to fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E

Mineralization of 2. 0 micrograms of phenol per liter by P. acidovorans was delayed 16 h by 70 micrograms of acetate per liter, and the delay was lengthened by increasing acetate concentrations, whereas phenol and acetate were utilized simultaneously at concentrations of 2. 0 and 13 micrograms/liter, respectively. Growth of Pseudomonas sp. <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inorganic <b>salts</b> solution was not affected {{by the addition of}} 3. 0 micrograms each of glucose and aniline per liter, nor was mineralization of the two compounds detected during the initial period of growth. However, mineralization of both substrates by this organism occurred simultaneously during the latter phases of growth and after growth had ended {{at the expense of the}} uncharacterized dissolved organic compounds <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salts</b> solution. <b>In</b> contrast, when Pseudomonas sp. was grown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>salts</b> solution supplemented with 300 micrograms each of glucose and aniline, the sugar was mineralized first, and aniline was mineralized only after much of the glucose carbon was converted to CO 2.
