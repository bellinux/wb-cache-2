25|$|Many {{important}} nonfood oils are {{extracted from}} seeds. Linseed oil {{is used in}} paints. Oil from <b>jojoba</b> and crambe are similar to whale oil.|$|E
25|$|Perfume oils {{are often}} diluted with a solvent, {{though this is}} not always the case, and its {{necessity}} is disputed. By far the most common solvent for perfume oil dilution is an alcohol solution typically a mixture of ethanol and water or a rectified spirit. Perfume oil can also be diluted by means of neutral-smelling oils such as fractionated coconut oil, or liquid waxes such as <b>jojoba</b> oil.|$|E
25|$|There are few {{local tree}} species {{suitable}} for planting in the desert, which are slow growing. Therefore, exotic tree species were introduced for plantation. Many species of Eucalyptus, Acacia, Cassia and other genera from Israel, Australia, US, Russia, Zimbabwe, Chile, Peru and Sudan {{have been tried}} in Thar Desert. Acacia tortilis {{has proved to be}} the most promising species for desert afforestation and the <b>jojoba</b> is another promising species of economic value found suitable for planting in these areas.|$|E
25|$|When {{people think}} of the desert southwest, the {{landscape}} of the Sonoran Desert is what mostly comes to mind. The Sonoran Desert makes up the southwestern portion of the Southwest; most of the desert lies in Mexico, but its United States component lies on the southeastern border of California, and the western 2/3 of southern Arizona. Rainfall averages between 4–12 inches per year, and the desert's most widely known inhabitant is the saguaro cactus, which is unique to the desert. It is bounded on the northwest by the Mojave Desert, to the north by the Colorado Plateau and to the east by the Arizona Mountains forests and the Chihuahuan Desert. Aside from the trademark saguaro, the desert has the most diverse plant life of any desert in the world, and includes many other species of cacti, including the organ-pipe, senita, prickly pear, barrel, fishhook, hedgehog, cholla, silver dollar, and <b>jojoba.</b> The portion of the Sonora Desert which lies in the Southwestern United States is the most populated area within the region. Six of the top ten major population centers of the region are found within its borders: Phoenix, Tucson, Mesa, Chandler, Glendale, and Scottsdale, all in Arizona. Also within its borders are Yuma and Prescott Arizona.|$|E
2500|$|Virgin oil {{feedstock}} – rapeseed and soybean oils {{are most}} commonly used, soybean oil [...] accounting {{for about half}} of U.S. production. It also {{can be obtained from}} Pongamia, field pennycress and jatropha and other crops such as mustard, <b>jojoba,</b> flax, sunflower, palm oil, coconut and hemp (see list of vegetable oils for biofuel for more information); ...|$|E
2500|$|Handmade soap {{from the}} cold process also differs from industrially made soap in that an excess of fat is used, beyond that needed to consume the alkali (in a cold-pour process, this excess fat is called [...] "superfatting"), and the {{glycerol}} left in acts as a moisturizing agent. However, the glycerine also makes the soap softer and less resistant to becoming [...] "mushy" [...] if left wet. Since {{it is better to}} add too much oil and have left-over fat, than to add too much lye and have left-over lye, soap produced from the hot process also contains left-over glycerol and its concomitant pros and cons. Further addition of glycerol and processing of this soap produces glycerin soap. Superfatted soap is more skin-friendly than one without extra fat. However, if too much fat is added, it can leave a [...] "greasy" [...] feel to the skin. Sometimes, an emollient additive, such as <b>jojoba</b> oil or shea butter, is added [...] "at trace" [...] (i.e., {{the point at which the}} saponification process is sufficiently advanced that the soap has begun to thicken in the cold process method) in the belief that nearly all the lye will be spent and it will escape saponification and remain intact. In the case of hot-process soap, an emollient may be added after the initial oils have saponified so they remain unreacted in the finished soap. Superfatting can also be accomplished through a process known as [...] "lye discount" [...] in which the soap maker uses less alkali than required instead of adding extra fats.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> esters are proper waxes; {{there is}} no {{triglyceride}} component of <b>jojoba</b> esters.Chemically, <b>jojoba</b> esters are a complex mixture of long chain (C36-C46) fatty acids and fatty alcohols joined by an ester bond. <b>Jojoba</b> esters are produced by the interesterification of <b>jojoba</b> oil, hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil, or a mixture of the two. Pure <b>jojoba</b> oil and pure hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil are also correctly described as <b>jojoba</b> esters. The CTFA does not regard partially-hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil as <b>jojoba</b> esters. For this reason, <b>jojoba</b> esters must not contain any trans-unsaturation. <b>Jojoba</b> esters' chemical structure {{is very similar to}} that of human sebum and of whale oil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> esters {{are mainly}} used as emollients in {{cosmetics}} such as lipsticks, shampoos and moisturizing lotions. <b>Jojoba</b> esters may be ethoxylated to form such water-soluble materials as PEG-150 <b>Jojoba,</b> PEG-120 <b>Jojoba</b> or PEG-80 <b>Jojoba.</b> <b>Jojoba</b> esters are excellent botanical substitutes for whale oil and its derivatives, such as cetyl alcohol and spermaceti.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> {{alcohol is}} the alcohol {{fraction}} {{obtained by the}} saponification of <b>jojoba</b> oil. <b>Jojoba</b> alcohol is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|Hydrolyzed <b>jojoba</b> esters are the {{hydrolysate}} of <b>jojoba</b> esters {{derived by}} acid, enzyme or other method of hydrolysis. Hydrolyzed <b>jojoba</b> esters {{are commonly used}} in cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|Simmondsia chinensis (<b>jojoba)</b> seed powder is {{a powder}} {{of the ground}} seeds of the <b>jojoba,</b> Simmondsia chenensis. Simmondsia chinensis (<b>jojoba)</b> seed powder is {{commonly}} used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> {{is grown}} for the liquid wax, {{commonly}} called <b>jojoba</b> oil, in its seeds. This oil {{is rare in}} that it is an extremely long (C36-C46) straight-chain wax ester and not a triglyceride, making <b>jojoba</b> and its derivative <b>jojoba</b> esters more similar to human sebum and whale oil than to traditional vegetable oils.|$|E
50|$|PEG-150 Hydrogenated <b>Jojoba</b> is an {{ethoxylated}} {{version of}} fully hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> wax {{and the most}} water soluble form of <b>jojoba</b> available. This versatile emollient functions as a secondary emulsifier and provides viscosity adjustments in hair care formulas and fragrance oil solubilization in aqueous solutions. PEG-150 Hydrogenated <b>Jojoba</b> is commonly used in cosmetics formulations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> esters are the {{hydrogenation}} or interesterification {{product of}} <b>Jojoba</b> oil. <b>Jojoba</b> Esters {{are commonly used}} in cosmetic formulations as an emollient, due to its remarkable similarity to the natural oils produced by the human skin, and its high oxidative stability. Fully hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> esters are most often small beads used to exfoliate the skin.|$|E
50|$|PEG-80 <b>Jojoba</b> is the {{polyethylene}} glycol derivative of the acids and alcohols {{obtained from the}} saponification of <b>jojoba</b> oil with an average ethoxylation value of 80. PEG-80 <b>Jojoba</b> is commonly used in cosmetic formulations.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil is the {{end product}} of the {{complete}} hydrogenation of <b>jojoba</b> oil.|$|E
50|$|PEG-120 <b>Jojoba</b> is the {{polyethylene}} glycol derivative of the acids and alcohols {{obtained from the}} saponification of <b>jojoba</b> oil with an average ethoxylation value of 120. PEG-120 <b>Jojoba</b> is commonly used in cosmetic formulations such as toothpaste.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> {{is grown}} commercially to produce <b>jojoba</b> oil, a liquid wax ester {{extracted}} from its seed.|$|E
50|$|Isopropyl jojobate is the {{isopropyl}} ester of the unfractionated saponification {{product of}} <b>jojoba</b> oil. It {{consists of a}} mixture of <b>jojoba</b> alcohols and the esters of isopropyl alcohol and <b>jojoba</b> acids. There are typically also unsaponified wax esters present in isopropyl jojobate.|$|E
50|$|A botanical {{alternative}} to spermaceti is a derivative of <b>jojoba</b> oil, <b>jojoba</b> esters, C19H41COO-C20H41, a solid wax which is chemically and physically {{very similar to}} spermaceti and {{may be used in}} many of the same applications. Esters of cetyl alcohol and <b>jojoba</b> oil are used as a substitute for spermaceti.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil is a {{straight-chain}} wax ester of 36 to 46 carbons in length, an {{ester bond}} in the approximate {{middle of the}} chain, no branching, no points of unsaturation, and terminal methyl groups at each end. As with <b>jojoba</b> oil, there is no triglyceride component of hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil.|$|E
50|$|Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil is a hard, {{crystalline}} wax ester. The {{melting point}} is 68-70 °C and the iodine value is < 2.0, {{making it one of}} the very few commercially available, high-melting-point wax esters of botanical origin. Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil is relatively colourless and odourless. Hydrogenated <b>jojoba</b> oil contains no trans isomers.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the first}} wax synthase in plants was {{identified}} in the <b>jojoba</b> plant, the <b>jojoba</b> wax synthase could not be functionally expressed in microorganisms like E. coli and S. cerevisiae.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, natural {{resources}} of the U.S, including <b>jojoba</b> oil, were used during war as additives to motor oil, transmission oil and differential gear oil. Machine guns were lubricated and maintained with <b>jojoba.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jojoba</b> is {{used for}} skin care {{because it is a}} natural moisturizer for the skin. <b>Jojoba</b> is {{actually}} a liquid wax that becomes solid below room temperature, but is known as an oil.|$|E
50|$|Native Americans {{extracted}} the {{oil from}} <b>jojoba</b> seeds to treat sores and wounds. The collection and processing of the seed from naturally occurring stands {{marked the beginning}} of <b>jojoba</b> domestication in the early 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Native Americans {{also used}} the salve to soften and {{preserve}} animal hides. Pregnant women ate <b>jojoba</b> seeds, believing they assisted during childbirth. Hunters and raiders ate <b>jojoba</b> on the trail to keep hunger at bay.|$|E
50|$|Unrefined <b>jojoba</b> oil {{appears as}} a clear golden liquid at room {{temperature}} with a slightly nutty odor. Refined <b>jojoba</b> oil is colorless and odorless. The melting point of <b>jojoba</b> oil is approximately 10 °C and the iodine value is approximately 80. <b>Jojoba</b> oil is relatively shelf-stable when compared with other vegetable oils mainly because it contains little triglycerides, unlike most other vegetable oils such as grape seed oil and coconut oil. It has an oxidative stability index of approximately 60, which means {{that it is more}} shelf-stable than safflower oil, canola oil, almond oil or squalene but less than castor oil and coconut oil.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> alcohol {{has shown}} {{efficacy}} against cold sores, genital herpes, and {{varicella zoster virus}} (shingles). This is described in US Patent: 6,858,232. It is believed the <b>Jojoba</b> alcohol works as a viral fusion inhibitor, which suppresses viral entry into host cells.|$|E
50|$|Native Americans {{discovered}} {{the importance and}} versatility of <b>jojoba.</b> During the early 18th century Jesuit missionaries on the Baja California Peninsula observed indigenous peoples heating <b>jojoba</b> seeds to soften them. They then used {{a mortar and pestle}} to create a salve or buttery substance. The latter was applied to the skin and hair to heal and condition. The O'odham people of the Sonoran Desert treated burns with an antioxidant salve made from a paste of the <b>jojoba</b> nut.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jojoba</b> prefers light, coarsly {{textured}} soils. Good drainage {{and water}} penetration is necessary. It tolerates salinity and poor-nutrient soils. Soil pH should be between 5 and 8. High temperatures are tolerated by <b>jojoba,</b> but frost can damage or kill plants. [...] Requirements are poor because <b>jojoba</b> plants {{do not need}} an intensive cultivation. Weed problems only occur {{during the first two}} years after planting and there is little damage by insects. Supplemental irrigation could maximize production if rainfall as less than 400 mm. There is no need for high fertilisation, but, especially in the first year, nitrogen increases growth. <b>Jojoba</b> is normally harvested by hand because seeds do not all mature in the same time. Yield is around 3.5 t/ha depending on the age of the plantation.|$|E
50|$|Hydrolyzed <b>jojoba</b> esters are {{a mixture}} of the free fatty acids, free fatty {{alcohols}} and wax esters resulting from the saponification reaction (cleaving the ester bond) of <b>jojoba</b> oil. These free fatty acids and free fatty alcohols are unbranched aliphatic monounsaturates with a chain length of C18 to C22.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> oil {{is found}} as an {{additive}} in many cosmetic products, especially those marketed as being made from natural ingredients. In particular, such products commonly containing <b>jojoba</b> are lotions and moisturizers, hair shampoos and conditioners. The pure oil itself {{may also be}} used on skin, hair, or cuticles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Jojoba</b> oil is {{interesting}} {{for the industry}} because it is odorless {{and it has a}} viscosity which is temperature-independent. Applications vary from engine lubricating oil to cooking oil. <b>Jojoba</b> wax is used predominantly for pharmaceutical compounds, specially for skin products. After polymerization, factice can be used for rubber production.|$|E
