5|$|The British Army's basic {{infantry}} {{weapon is}} the L85A2 assault rifle, sometimes {{equipped with an}} L17A2 under-barrel <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> or other attachments with the Picatinny rail. The rifle has several variants, including the L86A2, the Light Support Weapon (LSW) and the L22A2 carbine (issued to tank crews). These weapons are usually equipped with iron sights or an optical SUSAT, although optical sights have been purchased to supplement these.|$|E

50|$|The Japanese {{military}} used spigot-type <b>grenade</b> <b>launchers.</b> These <b>grenade</b> <b>launchers</b> {{were used}} by Japanese Naval Landing Forces to launch an anti-tank (hollow-charge) finned grenade. They were also used to propel Type 91 hand grenades fitted with tail-fin assemblies. These grenades had wood-bulleted launching cartridges stored in their tail-fin assemblies. The cartridges are fired from the rifle and the wooden bullets are trapped by the tail-fin assemblies launching and arming the <b>grenade.</b> These <b>launchers</b> are not numbered, and production figures are not available and examples of spigot <b>grenade</b> <b>launchers</b> are rarely encountered.|$|R
50|$|<b>Grenade</b> <b>launchers</b> {{can either}} {{come in the}} form of {{standalone}} weapons (either single-shot or repeating) or attachments mounted to a parent firearm, usually a rifle. Larger crew-served automatic <b>grenade</b> <b>launchers</b> such as the Mk 19 are mounted on tripods or vehicles.|$|R
5|$|Weapon turrets were {{mounted at}} {{the nose and}} the middle of {{aircraft}} underbelly. The nose turret could rotate +/- 100° from the aircraft's centerline and could mount either a 40mm (1.57in) <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher,</b> or a 7.62mm (0.308in) minigun. The belly turret included a 30mm (1.18in) automatic cannon with 360° of rotation. Mechanical stops prevented the belly turret from aiming at {{any part of the}} helicopter.|$|E
5|$|The game also {{includes}} vehicle sections, where Drake must protect the jeep he and Elena are in using a mounted turret, and where Drake and Elena ride a jet ski along water-filled routes while avoiding enemy fire and explosive barrels. While players direct Drake in driving the jet ski, {{they may also}} switch to Elena by aiming the gun {{in order to use}} her weapon — either the <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher</b> or the Beretta, depending on the chapter — in defense, or to clear the barrels from their path.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, both of {{them leave}} the planetarium, as Yumemi insists on escorting {{him back to his}} vehicle outside the city walls. The protagonist plans to {{transport}} Yumemi out of the city after her battery runs out {{and find a way to}} reactivate her. A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came from, and he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher.</b> After his initial plan fails and he is forced to face the machine front on, Yumemi tries to protect the protagonist, but is blown in half by the war machine's machine guns.|$|E
25|$|The K200 has six {{electrically}} operated smoke <b>grenade</b> <b>launchers</b> mounted {{across the front}} of the hull as countermeasures against electro-optical and infrared targeting.

5|$|Like its {{predecessor}} , Seeds of Evil is a first-person shooter where the player assumes {{the role of}} Turok from a first-person perspective. As Turok, the player can run, jump, climb ladders, swim and dive underwater for a limited period of time. The player can carry an unlimited number of weapons, ranging from bows and arrows to pistols, rifles, a shotgun, a <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher,</b> a flamethrower, a speargun, and more advanced weapons such as the Cerebral Bore, which fires a homing projectile capable of latching onto enemy's heads, killing them by drilling into their skulls and exploding. Turok has {{a certain amount of}} health which decreases when attacked by enemies. If Turok's health is fully depleted, the player loses one Life Force point and has to continue the game from a previous checkpoint. If the player loses all Life Force points, the game will be over. Ammunition, health, and Life Force suppliers can be collected throughout the game to increase the player's resources.|$|E
5|$|To defeat enemies, {{the player}} {{can use a}} variety of weapons, {{including}} dual pistols, dual Uzis, a Desert Eagle, a shotgun, an MP5 submachine gun, a <b>grenade</b> <b>launcher,</b> a rocket launcher, and a harpoon gun for underwater use. The dual pistols have infinite ammunition and are Lara's default weapons, while the other weapons have finite ammunition and must be found in the levels. At one point in the game, Lara will be stripped of all her weapons, leaving the player defenceless and forced to use stealth, before recovering her pistols later. Lara has a certain amount of health that decreases if she falls from a great height or when she is attacked by enemies. If Lara's health is fully depleted, the player must start the game again from a previous save point. Saving the player's progress on the PlayStation version of the game requires a memory card and consumes a Save Crystal from Lara's inventory. These can be found throughout each level and do not require the player to save the game at the pick-up spot.|$|E
