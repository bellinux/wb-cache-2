6000|$|... "Not very likely," [...] Surajah agreed; [...] "but {{a body of}} {{travellers}} {{might turn}} <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> halt {{in the middle of}} the day, and it would look strange were they to find two of the Palace officers, and their attendants, all fast asleep." ...|$|E

6000|$|Agnes {{turned to}} Henry, before she replied. 'You {{remember}} Emily Bidwell, my favourite pupil {{years ago at}} the village school, and afterwards my maid?

6000|$|... "You're wrong, mister. That ain't a durned good notion you've got. It's durned bad. Look here!" [...] He pointed {{steadily}} out {{of doors}} until we were both forced to follow his finger. [...] "You're <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> more'n <b>a</b> week yet."

6000|$|... 'I say,' {{he began}} hurriedly, 'do {{you mind if}} I come <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> little? I'm a bit edgy.' I must have shown surprise. 'I'm ever so much better about liquor than I used to be, but--it's the whisky in the {{suitcase}} that throws me. For God's sake, old man, don't go back on me to-night! Look at my hands!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must come}} <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment," [...] she said, opening the nearest door.

6000|$|... "So {{she is just}} a lay sister, a sort of servant, you know, but she is a {{favourite}} {{and often}} goes to market for them, and when she does she generally drops <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes for a talk; for though {{she was only a}} child when I was at the farm we were great friends, and she hears from me how all the people she used to know are getting on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think that}} is all,' said Merton. 'You understand, Mrs. Bower, that I am going away dressed as your grandson, while your grandson, dressed as myself, returns to his house to-night, and to work to-morrow. But {{it is not to}} be known that I have gone away. I am to be {{supposed}} ill <b>in</b> bed <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> day or two.

6000|$|... "'Directly,' I said. No. If we {{just stopped}} it--over there--there'd be no {{improvement}} <b>here.</b> <b>In</b> fact, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{time it would}} mean dislocations.

6000|$|... "Bears it well enough, sir; but {{a changed}} man. Never {{speaks to a}} soul, if he can help it. Some folk say he's not right in his head; or turned miser, or somewhat, and takes naught but bread and water, and sits up all night in the room as was hers, turning over her garments. Heaven knows what's on his mind--they do say he was over hard on her, and that drove her to it. All I know is, {{he has never been}} <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> drop of liquor (and he came as regular every evening as the town clock, sir) since she went, except a ten days ago, and then he met young Mr. Cary at the door, and I heard him ask Mr. Cary when you would be home, sir." ...|$|E

As Hobgood-Chittick would recall in 2012,I had no footing at all with that franchise, so I stood outside Bill Polian's door in my dirty sweats, saying a prayer. I walked in and said, [...] "There's a guy selling electrical supplies in Raleigh right now who whipped all those first-round draft choices at North Carolina every day."

40|$|The {{availability}} {{of social and}} recreational activities in assisted living provides older adult tenants with opportunities for physical activity and socialization in later life. This thesis explores the factors and attributes that influence tenants’ desire and ability {{to participate in the}} scheduled activities offered in assisted living and the role participation has on their Quality of Life. Qualitative methods were used to examine features of the organizational, physical, and social environment in two assisted living residences. Four substantive themes were identified: 1) “I’m <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reason”: The intersection of home and health, 2) Negotiating boundaries, 3) Opportunities and choices: Blending needs and wants, and 4) Nuanced social life: The continuum of goers to noers. The findings reveal the complexity of participatory behaviours in assisted living and the intersections between multiple levels of the environment. Implications for recreation programming and assisted living policy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|In European-American concert dance {{world of}} the last century or so, female impersonation, or dancing en travesti, has been done mostly for laughs. In the larger sense of {{theatrical}} history, female impersonation extends back to ancient Greece where women were excluded from the stage. During the era of Shakespeare, boys studied and seriously trained in the craft of female impersonation. As women gradually gained access to the stage, the need for such artful impersonation diminished. Female impersonation in concert dance shifted toward the burlesque, with exaggerated characterizations. (Female impersonation stands <b>in</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole range of diverse and contested terminology regarding the performance of gender.) Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, founded in 1974, knows and loves the ballet world and it knows and loves humor. The company of men performs abbreviated versions of classic ballets – both the male and female roles – to great comic effect and popular acclaim. Over the 35 -year history of the Trocks, as they are affectionately known, they have shifted from novelty act to serious art, all on their own terms. More than simply a historical analysis, this paper argues that the company has reinscribed concert dance history {{while at the same time}} dismantling the historical canon and rewriting it to include a history of embodied gender identities. In the 21 st century, Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo demonstrates multiple performances of gender, a thorough understanding of camp and parody, seriously researched dance history, all danced with wicked attention to dance technique and virtuosic performance...|$|E

[...] "Dick," [...] he said, [...] "keep me an eye upon these men; I leave you <b>in</b> charge <b>here.</b> <b>As</b> <b>for</b> the priest, he shall clear himself, or I will know the reason why.

"Accept me, Captain Colenso, {{for your}} passenger: I {{will not say}} comrade-in-arms--naval warfare being so far beyond my knowledge, which it would perhaps be more {{descriptive}} to call ignorance.
