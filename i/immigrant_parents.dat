40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is on Chinese <b>immigrant</b> <b>parenting.</b> By drawing on the discourses of Chinese <b>immigrant</b> <b>parenting</b> beliefs and practices, it {{provides}} an analysis of the childrearing stories told by Amy Chua (2011), an American Chinese mother. Chua shared in her book ‘Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother’ how she created excellence for her daughters through the use of Chinese parenting approaches. Chua’s ‘tiger mother’ practice, with its emphasis on parenting control, unyielding imposition of parenting rules, and strong focus on children’s success, captured my interest. In the context of her immigrant background and Chinese ethnicity, one would suppose that the ‘tiger mother’ book presented a standard account of Chinese <b>immigrant</b> <b>parenting.</b> Through reviewing relevant literature, and portraying an example of New Zealand Chinese immigrant parents’ beliefs and practices, this paper sketches some general patterns of Chinese <b>immigrant</b> <b>parenting.</b> I argue that Chua’s approach embodies traditions and ideologies of Chinese culture, but is not a typical example...|$|R

5|$|Still, Finley & Figg {{remains in}} bad shape. The Krayoxx affair has left them deep in debt {{instead of the}} {{expected}} big profit, their office building – the firm's sole asset – heavily mortgaged and the two partners ailing, in bad shape physically and mentally. Meanwhile, David manages to complete his lead poisoning product liability case, finding that the destructive toys were imported from China by a subsidiary of Sonesta Games, the third-largest toy producer in the U.S. Unlike the Krayoxx case, this provides David with an air-tight case. A jury seeing the poor child, completely disabled as a direct provable result of using the toy, would be certain to grant a high sum in compensations. Knowing this, the Sonesta CEO and his senior executives hasten to meet with David, seeming to show genuine remorse, aside from being aware of the grave damage which the publicity around such a case could cause their corporation. They readily agree to give David's clients, the child's Burmese <b>immigrant</b> <b>parents</b> $5 million in out-of-court compensation, provided that the case remain secret. David insists, however, that $1.5 million in legal fees would not {{come out of his}} clients' compensation but be paid separately by Sonesta; knowing himself to have the upper hand, Zinc is a tough negotiator and the Sonesta directors {{have no choice but to}} agree to pay a total of $6.5 million. In parting, a Sonesta executive discreetly slips Zinc an unmarked envelope with information on lead poisoning caused by the products of Sonesta's competitors.|$|E

40|$|A {{distinction}} is often made between collectivistic and individualistic cultures. These cultures differ regarding parenting styles and socialization of the self. Recent {{years have seen}} ever-increasing immigration from non-Western countries to Western countries. Such immigration often involves a transition from collectivistic cultures to individualistic cultures. This results in a mismatch regarding parenting style, resulting in {{a specific type of}} <b>parenting</b> for <b>immigrants.</b> This article will discuss the consequences of <b>immigrant</b> <b>parenting</b> for the parental socialization of the self. It is proposed that <b>immigrant</b> <b>parenting</b> differs from parenting in the country of origin, as well as from parenting in the host culture.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} culture – measured by aggregate levels of an <b>immigrant</b> <b>parent’s</b> home country educational attainment – on the educational attainment of second-generation immigrants in America. I use 2005 - 2014 October U. S. Current Population Surveys (CPS) data and the Barro-Lee data set to match the educational attainment of second-generation immigrants to the educational attainment averages of the respective home country from which their parents emigrated. Overall, I find that second-generation immigrants’ educational attainment is significantly and positively affected by their <b>immigrant</b> <b>parent’s</b> home country educational attainment. This suggests that cultural norms, particularly those regarding education, may persist in immigrant families even after resettling in America. I also find {{that the effects of}} home country educational attainment on second-generation outcomes do not differ by the gender of the second-generation immigrant...|$|R
