5|$|Al-Maʿarri was an ascetic, renouncing worldly {{desires and}} living secluded from others while {{producing}} his works. He opposed {{all forms of}} violence. In Baghdad, while being well received, {{he decided not to}} sell his texts, which made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to live. This ascetic lifestyle has been compared to similar thought in India during his time.|$|E

5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media scholars argue that a lengthy relationship with the government makes <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> the agency to become an unbiased news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E

5|$|The French {{invasion}} of Russia, where poor traction conditions for ill-shod horses made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> supply wagons {{to keep up}} with troops. That campaign was also strongly affected by cold, whereby the retreating army reached Neman River in December 1812 with only 10,000 of the 420,000 that had set out to invade Russia in June of the same year.|$|E

5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt to Hitler in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> Rommel to achieve his task. He {{was not allowed to}} give orders to the Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{problems}} in maintaining {{control over his}} people worsened during the siege of Ticinum. The nature of the Lombard monarchy made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> a ruler to exert {{the same degree of}} authority over his subjects as had been exercised by Theodoric over his Goths, and the structure of the army gave great authority to the military commanders or duces, who led each band (fara) of warriors. Additionally, the difficulties encountered by Alboin in building a solid political entity resulted from a lack of imperial legitimacy, as unlike the Ostrogoths, they had not entered Italy as foederati but as enemies of the Empire.|$|E
5|$|Although Chaplin {{still had}} plans for future film projects, by the mid-1970s {{he was very}} frail. He {{experienced}} several further strokes, which made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> him to communicate, {{and he had to}} use a wheelchair. His final projects were compiling a pictorial autobiography, My Life in Pictures (1974) and scoring A Woman of Paris for re-release in 1976. He also appeared in a documentary about his life, The Gentleman Tramp (1975), directed by Richard Patterson. In the 1975 New Year Honours, Chaplin was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II, though he was too weak to kneel and received the honour in his wheelchair.|$|E
5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made <b>it</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> land speculators to entice immigration to the area to turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
