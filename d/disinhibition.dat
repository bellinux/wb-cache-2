5|$|Paradoxical reactions, such as {{increased}} seizures in epileptics, aggression, violence, impulsivity, irritability and suicidal behavior sometimes occur. These reactions have been explained as consequences of <b>disinhibition</b> {{and the subsequent}} loss of control over socially unacceptable behavior. Paradoxical reactions are rare in the general population, with an incidence rate below 1% and similar to placebo. However, they occur with greater frequency in recreational abusers, individuals with borderline personality disorder, children, and patients on high-dosage regimes. In these groups, impulse control problems {{are perhaps the most}} important risk factor for disinhibition; learning disabilities and neurological disorders are also significant risks. Most reports of <b>disinhibition</b> involve high doses of high-potency benzodiazepines. Paradoxical effects may also appear after chronic use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to <b>disinhibition.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral <b>disinhibition</b> occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial {{because of concerns about}} adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at an increased risk of suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action. They include drowsiness, dizziness, and decreased alertness and concentration. Lack of coordination may result in falls and injuries, in particular, in the elderly. Another result is impairment of driving skills and increased likelihood of road traffic accidents. Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and <b>disinhibition</b> may emerge. Hypotension and suppressed breathing (hypoventilation) may be encountered with intravenous use. Less common side effects include nausea and changes in appetite, blurred vision, confusion, euphoria, depersonalization and nightmares. Cases of liver toxicity have been described but are very rare.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. Depression and anxiety appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and <b>disinhibition.</b> Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E
25|$|The {{long-term}} effects of clonazepam can include depression, <b>disinhibition,</b> and sexual dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of the primary-secondary psychopathy {{distinction}} and triarchic model {{argue that}} there are neurological differences between these subgroups of psychopathy which support their views. For instance, the boldness factor in the triarchic model is argued {{to be associated with}} reduced activity in the amygdala during fearful or aversive stimuli and reduced startle response, while the <b>disinhibition</b> factor is argued to be associated with impairment of frontal lobe tasks. There is evidence that boldness and <b>disinhibition</b> are genetically distinguishable.|$|E
25|$|Post-traumatic stress disorder, Parkinson's disease, REM {{behavior}} disorder: Patients {{with these}} syndromes exhibit a significant (>50%) {{decrease in the}} number of locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, resulting is increased <b>disinhibition</b> of the PPN.|$|E
25|$|The orbital frontal cortex {{has been}} thought {{to play a}} role in {{behavioral}} <b>disinhibition,</b> and damage to the right inferior frontal gyrus, a specific subregion of the PFC, has been associated with deficits in stop-signal inhibition.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{basal ganglia}} often have many {{connections}} with the frontal lobe of the brain, hyperkinesia {{can be associated with}} neurobehavioral or neuropsychiatric disorders such as mood changes, psychosis, anxiety, <b>disinhibition,</b> cognitive impairments, and inappropriate behavior.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine antagonizes {{adenosine}} A2A receptors in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), {{thereby reducing}} inhibitory GABA neurotransmission to the tuberomammillary nucleus, a histaminergic projection nucleus that activation-dependently promotes arousal. <b>Disinhibition</b> of the tuberomammillary nucleus {{is the chief}} mechanism by which caffeine produces wakefulness-promoting effects.|$|E
25|$|Toxicology reports {{confirmed}} Sandra's {{statement that}} she had given Travis Xanax-laced tea {{the day of the}} attack, which could have exacerbated his aggression. Xanax is a short acting potent anti-anxiety drug that can cause <b>disinhibition</b> and disorientation and occasionally paradoxical reactions of hallucination, aggression, rage and mania.|$|E
25|$|<b>Disinhibition.</b> Poor impulse control {{including}} {{problems with}} planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints. Similar to PCL-R Factor 2 and PPI Impulsive antisociality. May correspond to impairments in frontal lobe {{systems that are}} involved in such control.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which voluntary urination is initiated remains unsettled. One possibility is that the voluntary relaxation of {{the muscles of the}} pelvic floor causes a sufficient downward tug on the detrusor muscle to initiate its contraction. Another possibility is the excitation or <b>disinhibition</b> of neurons in the pontine micturition center, which causes concurrent contraction of the bladder and relaxation of the sphincter.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{pathways}} involving basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, both {{of which}} originate in the neostriatum. The direct pathway projects to the internal globus pallidus (GPi) and to the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr). These projections are inhibitory and {{have been found to}} utilize both GABA and substance P. The indirect pathway, which projects to the globus pallidus external (GPe), is also inhibitory and uses GABA and enkephalin. The GPe projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which then projects back to the GPi and GPe via excitatory, glutaminergic pathways. Excitation of the direct pathway leads to <b>disinhibition</b> of the GABAergic neurons of the GPi/SNr, ultimately resulting in activation of thalamic neurons and excitation of cortical neurons. In contrast, activation of the indirect pathway stimulates the inhibitory striatal GABA/enkephalin projection, resulting in suppression of GABAerigc neuronal activity. This, in turn, causes <b>disinhibition</b> of the STN excitatory outputs, thus triggering the GPi/SNr inhibitory projections to the thalamus and decreased activation of cortical neurons. While deregulation of either of these pathways can disturb motor output, hyperkinesia is thought to result from overactivity of the direct pathway and decreased activity from the indirect pathway.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} pathophysiology {{involved in}} this frequently debilitating condition is still under investigation; the primary pathogenic mechanisms of PBA remain controversial. One hypothesis, established by early researchers such as Wilson and Oppenheim, placed emphasis {{on the role of}} the corticobulbar pathways in modulating emotional expression in a top-down model, and theorized that PBA occurs when bilateral lesions in the descending corticobulbar tract cause failure of voluntary control of emotion, which leads to the <b>disinhibition,</b> or release, of laughing/crying centers in the brainstem. Other theories implicate the prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{overdose}} {{can result}} in a state of central nervous system over-stimulation called caffeine intoxication (DSM-IV 305.90). This syndrome typically occurs only after ingestion of large amounts of caffeine, well over the amounts found in typical caffeinated beverages and caffeine tablets (e.g., more than 400–500mg at a time). The symptoms of caffeine intoxication are comparable to the symptoms of overdoses of other stimulants: they may include restlessness, fidgeting, anxiety, excitement, insomnia, flushing of the face, increased urination, gastrointestinal disturbance, muscle twitching, a rambling flow of thought and speech, irritability, irregular or rapid heart beat, and psychomotor agitation. In cases of much larger overdoses, mania, depression, lapses in judgment, disorientation, <b>disinhibition,</b> delusions, hallucinations, or psychosis may occur, and rhabdomyolysis (breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) can be provoked.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines all bind unselectively to the GABAA receptor. Some theorize {{that certain}} benzodiazepines (hypnotic benzodiazepines) have {{significantly}} higher {{activity at the}} α1 subunit of the GABAA receptor compared to other benzodiazepines (for example, triazolam and temazepam have significantly higher activity at the α1 subunit compared to alprazolam and diazepam, making them superior sedative-hypnotics– alprazolam and diazepam, in turn, have higher activity at the α2 subunit compared to triazolam and temazepam, making them superior anxiolytic agents). Modulation of the α1 subunit is associated with sedation, motor impairment, respiratory depression, amnesia, ataxia, and reinforcing behavior (drug-seeking behavior). Modulation of the α2 subunit is associated with anxiolytic activity and <b>disinhibition.</b> For this reason, certain benzodiazepines may be better suited to treat insomnia than others.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the combination of early-onset conduct disorder and ADHD may be associated with life-course-persistent antisocial behaviors as well as psychopathy. There is evidence that this combination is more aggressive and antisocial than those with conduct disorder alone. However, it is not a particularly distinct group since the vast majority of young children with conduct disorder also have ADHD. Some evidence indicates that this group has deficits in behavioral inhibition, similar to that of adults with psychopathy. They may not be more likely than those with conduct disorder alone to have the interpersonal/affective features and the deficits in emotional processing characteristic of adult psychopaths. Proponents of different types/dimensions of psychopathy have seen this type as possibly corresponding to adult secondary psychopathy and increased <b>disinhibition</b> in the triarchic model.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} {{possibility is}} disinhibited feedback, or {{a reduction in}} the amount of inhibition along normally existing feedback pathways. Normally, excitation and inhibition are balanced. However, if normal feedback were not inhibited as usual, then signals feeding back from late stages of multi-sensory processing might influence earlier stages such that tones could activate vision. Cytowic and Eagleman find support for the <b>disinhibition</b> idea in the so-called acquired forms of synesthesia that occur in non-synesthetes under certain conditions: temporal lobe epilepsy, head trauma, stroke, and brain tumors. They also note that it can likewise occur during stages of meditation, deep concentration, sensory deprivation, or with use of psychedelics such as LSD or mescaline, and even, in some cases, marijuana. However, synesthetes report that common stimulants, like caffeine and cigarettes do not affect the strength of their synesthesia, nor does alcohol.|$|E
25|$|It is {{not known}} what causes KLS, but several {{mechanisms}} have been proposed. One possible explanation is hypothalamic or circadian dysfunction. The thalamus probably {{plays a role in}} the out-of-control sleeping, and patients with diencephalic–hypothalamic dysfunction caused by tumors experience symptoms similar to those of KLS patients. Specifically, the medial temporal regions of the thalamus may be involved, although examinations of KLS patients have not consistently found abnormalities in this area. The temporal lobe also appears {{to play a role in}} the condition, possibly causing cognitive difficulties. The apathy and <b>disinhibition</b> found in some KLS sufferers suggest that the condition may include frontal lobe dysfunction as well. The involvement of the thalamus, temporal lobe, and frontal lobe of the brain suggests that there is a multifocal, localized encephalopathy. There are also persistent subclinical abnormalities in KLS sufferers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the final}} {{few years of}} his life Guthrie was largely alone except for family. The {{progression}} of Huntington's threw Guthrie into extreme emotional states causing him to lash out at those nearby and to damage a prized book collection of Anneke's. These actions mirrored common symptoms of Huntington's including uncharacteristic aggression, emotional volatility, and social <b>disinhibition.</b> Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated, {{because of a lack of}} information about the disease. His death helped raise awareness of the disease and led Marjorie to help found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the Huntington's Disease Society of America. None of Guthrie's three remaining children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's. Mary Guthrie's son Bill died in an auto-train accident in Pomona, California, at the age of 23. Mary's other children, Gwendolyn and Sue, suffered from the disease and both died at 41years of age.|$|E
25|$|A {{risk for}} both {{individuals}} and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking websites, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users. This is also a risk in relation to controversial offline behavior, if it is widely made known. The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and hate speech, to, in extreme cases, rape and death threats. The online <b>disinhibition</b> effect describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person. A significant number of feminist women have {{been the target of}} various forms of harassment in response to posts they have made on social media, and Twitter in particular has been criticised in the past for not doing enough to aid victims of online abuse.|$|E
25|$|GHB is {{a central}} nervous system {{depressant}} used as an intoxicant, although it produces a stimulant effect at lower doses due to its action on the GHB receptor. It has many street names, including G, Liquid G, Liquid X, Liquid E, Georgia Home Boy, Juice, Mils, and Fantasy. Its effects have been described anecdotally as comparable with ethanol (alcohol) and MDMA use, such as euphoria, <b>disinhibition,</b> enhanced libido and empathogenic states. At higher doses, GHB may induce nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, agitation, visual disturbances, depressed breathing, amnesia, unconsciousness, and death. When death is associated with GHB, it is sometimes in conjunction with other drugs, such as alcohol or benzodiazepine which influence the same neurotransmitter (gamma-aminobutyric acid, GABA). The effects of GHB can last from 1.5 to 4 hours, or even longer if large doses have been consumed. Consuming GHB with alcohol is dangerous as it can lead to respiratory arrest and vomiting in combination with unrouseable sleep, a potentially lethal combination.|$|E
25|$|Executive {{dysfunction}} {{appears to}} consistently involve disruptions in task-oriented behavior, which requires executive {{control in the}} inhibition of habitual responses and goal activation. Such executive control is responsible for adjusting behaviour to reconcile environmental changes with goals for effective behaviour. Impairments in set shifting ability are a notable feature of executive dysfunction; set shifting is the cognitive ability to dynamically change focus between points of fixation based on changing goals and environmental stimuli. This offers a parsimonious explanation for the common occurrence of impulsive, hyperactive, disorganized, and aggressive behaviour in clinical patients with executive dysfunction. Executive dysfunction, particularly in working memory capacity, may also lead to varying degrees of emotional dysregulation, which can manifest as chronic depression, anxiety, or hyperemotionality. Russell Barkley proposed a hybrid model {{of the role of}} behavioural <b>disinhibition</b> in the presentation of ADHD, which has served as the basis for much research of both ADHD and broader implications of the executive system.|$|E
25|$|Similar {{approaches}} {{refer to}} the overall 'architecture' or 'meta-structure', particularly {{in relation to the}} development of the DSM or ICD systems. Five proposed meta-structure groupings were recently proposed in this way, based on views and evidence relating to risk factors and clinical presention. The clusters of disorder that emerged were described as neurocognitive (identified mainly by neural substrate abnormalities), neurodevelopmental (identified mainly by early and continuing cognitive deficits), psychosis (identified mainly by clinical features and biomarkers for information processing deficits), emotional (identified mainly by being preceded by a temperament of negative emotionality), and externalizing (identified mainly be being preceded by <b>disinhibition).</b> However, the analysis was not necessarily able to validate one arrangement over others. From a psychological point of view, it has been suggested that the underlying phenomena are too complex, inter-related and continuous– with too poorly understood a biological or environmental basis– to expect that everything can be mapped into a set of categories for all purposes. In this context the overall system of classification is to some extent arbitrary, and could be thought of as a user inferface which may need to satisfy different purposes.|$|E
500|$|In {{susceptible}} individuals, midazolam {{has been}} known to cause a paradoxical reaction, a well-documented complication with benzodiazepines. When this occurs, the individual may experience anxiety, involuntary movements, aggressive or violent behavior, uncontrollable crying or verbalization, and other similar effects. This seems {{to be related to the}} altered state of consciousness or <b>disinhibition</b> produced by the drug. Paradoxical behavior is often not recalled by the patient due to the amnesia-producing properties of the drug. In extreme situations, flumazenil can be administered to inhibit or reverse the effects of midazolam. [...] Antipsychotic medications, such as haloperidol, have also been used for this purpose.|$|E
500|$|TBI {{may cause}} emotional, social, or {{behavioral}} problems {{and changes in}} personality. [...] These may include emotional instability, depression, anxiety, hypomania, mania, apathy, irritability, problems with social judgment, and impaired conversational skills. [...] TBI appears to predispose survivors to psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder, substance abuse, dysthymia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders. In patients who have depression after TBI, suicidal ideation is not uncommon; the suicide rate among these persons is increased 2- to 3-fold. Social and behavioral symptoms that can follow TBI include <b>disinhibition,</b> inability to control anger, impulsiveness, lack of initiative, inappropriate sexual activity, asociality and social withdrawal, and changes in personality.|$|E

2500|$|Extracellular {{dopamine}} in the {{basal ganglia}} {{has been linked}} to motivational states in rodents, with high levels being linked to satiated [...] "euphoria", medium levels with seeking, and low with aversion. [...] The limbic basal ganglia circuits are influenced heavily by extracellular dopamine. [...] Increased dopamine results in inhibition of the Ventral pallidum, entopeduncular nucleus, and substantia nigra pars reticulata, resulting in <b>disinhibition</b> of the thalamus. [...] This model of direct D1, and indirect D2 pathways explain why selective agonists of each receptor are not rewarding, as activity at both pathways is required for <b>disinhibition.</b> [...] The <b>disinhibition</b> of the thalamus leads to activation of the prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum, selective for increased D1 activity leading to reward.|$|E
2500|$|One theory {{states that}} the mirror neuron system is {{important}} in giving rise to the intruder hallucination and out-of-body experiences during sleep paralysis. [...] The mirror neuron system {{is believed to be}} modulated by sensory afferents and the prefrontal cortex, and interact with the right superior parietal lobule. These circuits may in turn allow for a theory of mind—seeing the world from another person's perspective. A functional disturbance of these circuits would interfere with the feeling of being anchored in one's body. According to this theory, sleep paralysis leads to <b>disinhibition</b> of the mirror neuron system, paving the way for hallucinations of human-like shadowy beings. The deafferentation of sensory information during sleep paralysis is proposed as the mechanism for such mirror neuron <b>disinhibition.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The direct pathway, {{originating}} in the dorsal striatum inhibits the GPi and SNr, resulting in a net <b>disinhibition</b> or excitation of the thalamus. [...] This pathway consist of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) that express dopamine receptor D1, muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M4, and adenosine receptor A1. [...] The direct pathway has been proposed to facilitate motor actions, timing of motor actions, gating of working memory, and motor responses to specific stimuli.|$|E
2500|$|The pallidum {{consists}} of a large structure called the globus pallidus ("pale globe") together with a smaller ventral extension called the ventral pallidum. [...] The globus pallidus appears as a single neural mass, but {{can be divided into}} two functionally distinct parts, called the internal (or medial) and external (lateral) segments, abbreviated GPi and GPe. Both segments contain primarily GABAergic neurons, which therefore have inhibitory effects on their targets. The two segments participate in distinct neural circuits. The GPe, receives input mainly from the striatum, and projects to the subthalamic nucleus. The GPi, receives signals from the striatum via the [...] "direct" [...] and [...] "indirect" [...] pathways. Pallidal neurons operate using a <b>disinhibition</b> principle. These neurons fire at steady high rates in the absence of input, and signals from the striatum cause them to pause or reduce their rate of firing. Because pallidal neurons themselves have inhibitory effects on their targets, the net effect of striatal input to the pallidum is a reduction of the tonic inhibition exerted by pallidal cells on their targets (<b>disinhibition)</b> with an increased rate of firing in the targets.|$|E
2500|$|Triazolam is {{frequently}} prescribed as a sleep aid for passengers travelling on {{short to medium}} duration flights. [...] If this use is contemplated, {{it is especially important}} the user avoids the consumption of alcoholic beverages, and tries a ground based [...] "rehearsal" [...] of the medication to ensure that the side effects and potency of this medication are understood by the user prior to using it in a relatively more public environment (as <b>disinhibition</b> can be a common side effect, with potentially severe consequences).|$|E
2500|$|Multiple {{models of}} basal ganglia {{circuits}} and function have been proposed, however {{there have been}} questions raised about the strict divisions of the direct and indirect pathways, their possible overlap and regulation. [...] The circuitry models has evolved since the first proposed model in the 1990s by DeLong in the parallel processing model, in which the cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta project into the dorsal striatum giving rise to an inhibitory indirect and excitatory direct pathway. [...] The inhibitory indirect pathway involved the inhibition of the globus pallidus externus, allowing for the <b>disinhibition</b> of the globus pallidus internus allowing it to inhibit the thalamus. [...] The direct or excitatory pathway involved the <b>disinhibition</b> of the thalamus through the inhibition of the GPe/SNr. [...] However {{the speed of the}} direct pathway would not be concordant with the indirect pathway in this model leading to problems with it. [...] To get over this, a hyperdirect pathway where the cortex sends glutamatergic projections through the subthalamic nucleus exciting the inhibitory GPe under the center surround model, as well as a shorter indirect pathway have been proposed. [...] Generally, the basal ganglia circuitry is divided into a limbic, two associative(prefrontal), an oculomotor and one motor pathway. [...] The motor and oculomotor are sometimes grouped into one motor pathway. [...] The 5 general pathways go as follows: ...|$|E
