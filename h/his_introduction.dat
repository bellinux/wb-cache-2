5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically testable mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E

5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. He felt {{he was the best}} villain he had ever created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E
5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} art and literature. His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and illuminating in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical in <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Mahesh's seven-year-old son, Gautham Krishna, {{was chosen}} to play the younger version of the protagonist in his Telugu cinema debut. According to Sukumar, Gautham looked like the actor did as a child. When the {{director}} approached Mahesh and his wife, Namrata Shirodkar, Gautham Krishna was only six and they were apprehensive. <b>His</b> <b>introduction</b> scene was filmed silently by Peter Hein, since the boy was afraid of gunfire. Naveen Polisetty played a supporting role as Mahesh's friend in the film, and Vikram Singh was signed as an antagonist. Nassar, Pradeep Rawat, Kelly Dorji, Sayaji Shinde and Anu Hasan were cast in other supporting roles.|$|E

5000|$|He and his brother, Thomas Lobb, {{were the}} first {{collectors}} to be sent out by the Veitch nursery business, with the primary commercial aim of obtaining new species and large quantities of seed. <b>His</b> <b>introductions</b> of the monkey-puzzle tree, Wellingtonia and many other conifers to Europe earned him the sobriquet [...] "messenger of the big tree".

5|$|The Sundance Channel airings {{attracted}} more viewers in the 18-to-24 age range than was usual for their audience, which typically comprised men over age 25. After the second episode aired, cultural critic Lee Siegel {{wrote about the}} show for The New Republic. He pontificated on transgender experience, and characterized the story as a unique form of drama or tragedy. In <b>his</b> <b>introduction,</b> he commented on the general absence of reviews for the show in major news publications.|$|E
5|$|At {{an early}} stage, in {{documents}} {{written in the}} paleo-Hebrew script, words were divided by short vertical lines and later by dots, as reflected by the Mesha Stone, the Siloam inscription, the Ophel inscription, and paleo-Hebrew script documents from Qumran. Word division was not used in Phoenician inscriptions; however, there is not direct evidence for biblical texts being written without word division, as suggested by Nahmanides in <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the Torah. Word division using spaces was commonly used {{from the beginning of}} the 7th century BCE for documents in the Aramaic script. In addition to marking vowels, the Tiberian system also uses cantillation marks, which serve to mark word stress, semantic structure, and the musical motifs used in formal recitation of the text.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{attended}} Stanmore Public School and, {{although not}} a scholar, was a keen participant in sporting activities. <b>His</b> <b>introduction</b> to cricket came via his older brother, Horrie; Horrie was a useful batsman who played in the local Western Suburbs Churches league and paid Sid sixpence to bowl to him after he finished work. Taking {{an interest in the}} game, Sid had trials for the school team and was eventually selected in the first XI. An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an umpire's decision. Successes for both his school team and his local club team, St. Augustine, saw him acquire the nickname The Governor-General—the nickname of Australian Test player, Charlie Macartney, and he was selected for New South Wales Schoolboys to play teams from Victoria and Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Beebe {{undertook}} {{an expedition}} to Brazil in 1915, {{for the purpose of}} capturing more birds for the zoo. This expedition was an important turning point for Beebe in several ways. Beebe had far more field experience than either of the two others accompanying him on the expedition, G. Inness Hartler and Herbert Atkins, making this <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the role of a mentor. During this expedition, Beebe was also amazed to discover the number and variety of organisms living under a single tree, and pioneered the method of studying a small area of wilderness for an extended amount of time. This expedition marked the beginning of a shift for Beebe from ornithology to the study of tropical ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, he was {{assigned}} to several positions that would qualify him for the high commands he was to hold in later years. He was promoted to first lieutenant on June 4, 1920 and spent two years at Marine Barracks, Quantico, Virginia, as the Adjutant-Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute, after which he was sent on a short tour in Louisiana guarding the mail. His interest in military aviation prompted him to apply for flight training at NAS Pensacola, Florida and he earned his gold wings as a Naval Aviator in 1922. Soon after, he was ordered to the Marine Air Station at Guam where he had <b>his</b> <b>introduction</b> to the semitropical islands of the Marianas with which his name was later to become so closely linked.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Want was {{published}} with an essay by Carlos Bulosan {{as part of}} the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked <b>his</b> <b>introduction,</b> and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.|$|E

Due to numerous past violent crimes, Gamma {{is one of the most}} wanted criminals in the Zombiepowder. universe, with a bounty to match. This high bounty was one of the first things determined about Gamma's character by Tite Kubo, dating back to a pre-draft rendition of the character who was a sort of samurai. Gamma's personal history is never expounded upon, but it is implied by Balmunk that he was once a mercenary, but reformed and became a powder hunter following the death of a woman.|$|E
5|$|Goater {{was born}} in the Bermudian capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his {{grandmother}} and two aunts. <b>His</b> <b>introduction</b> to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his education in the United States, where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, who invited him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his mother, who was a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing so. At this time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.|$|E
5|$|<b>His</b> <b>introduction</b> to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived}} in Brooklyn {{opposite}} Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
