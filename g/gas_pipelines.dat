40|$|Abstract. Fire risk of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage is high. The factors {{contributing}} to <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage most are third party damage, corrosion, design and incorrect operation. The accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage and quantitative risk assessment method of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage consequence are analyzed. In order to achieve quantitative fire risk assessment of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and thermal radiation damage criterion are analyzed. Firstly, the gas leakage quantity is estimated. Then, the heat radiation estimate flux, the thermal dose and damage range are got by using flash fire model, vapor cloud explosion model and the thermal radiation damage criterion respectively. Combined with an example of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline,</b> damage ranges of different disaster patterns are estimated according to different <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage pattern. Through comparing the accident consequences of <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> leakage, this paper provides some reliable scientific references for <b>gas</b> <b>pipeline</b> management departments...|$|R

5|$|It was {{not until}} the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially. Brazil is the leading {{producer}} of niobium and ferroniobium, an alloy of niobium and iron which has a niobium content of 60-70%. Niobium is used mostly in alloys, the largest part in special steel such as that used in <b>gas</b> <b>pipelines.</b> Although these alloys contain a maximum of 0.1%, the small percentage of niobium enhances the strength of the steel. The temperature stability of niobium-containing superalloys is important for its use in jet and rocket engines.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and {{cooperation with the}} Taliban. Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy policies in the mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipelines</b> to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through Afghanistan to an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban, raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise of Taliban control in Afghanistan to advance U.S. energy interests in the region.|$|E

5|$|On September 7, Paul {{called for}} a vote of no {{confidence}} in United States Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner. Later that month, Paul blocked legislation that would strengthen safety rules for oil and <b>gas</b> <b>pipelines,</b> because, he stated, the bill was not strong enough. In October, Paul blocked {{a bill that would}} provide $36million in benefits for elderly and disabled refugees, saying that he was concerned that it could be used to aid domestic terrorists. This was in response to two alleged terrorists who came to the United States through a refugee program and were receiving welfare benefits when they were arrested in 2011 in Paul's hometown of Bowling Green. Paul lifted his hold on the bill after Democratic leaders promised to hold a Congressional hearing into how individuals are selected for refugee status and request an investigation on how the two suspects were admitted in the country through a refugee program. In June 2012, Paul endorsed Mitt Romney after it became apparent that he would be the Republican nominee for the 2012 presidential election. However, he was later vocal about his disagreements with Romney on a number of policies.|$|E
