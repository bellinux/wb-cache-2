5000|$|The {{discovery}} {{of this relationship}} started in 1855, when Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch determined {{that there was a}} quantity related to electricity and magnetism, [...] "the ratio of the absolute <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>unit</b> of charge to the absolute electrostatic unit of charge" [...] (in modern language, the value [...] ), and determined that it should have units of velocity.

However, Weber and Kohlrausch did not make the connection to the speed of light. Towards the end of 1861 while working on part III of his paper On Physical Lines of Force, Maxwell travelled from Scotland to London and looked up Weber and Kohlrausch's results. He converted them into a format which was compatible with his own writings, and in doing so he established the connection to the speed of light and concluded that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation.|$|E

The conductivity of PANI-Ni is about 10 – 1 S cm– 1.

The nanoparticles were prepared using the sol-gel method and were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), a scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-Edx), a particle sizer and a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). The results showed that synthesized nanoparticles were in the size range of 40 - 300 rim, had purity of about 90 percent, and had magnetization of 36. 5 <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>unit</b> per gram (emu/g). In conditions including pH 2, Cr (VI) concentration of 10 mg/L, nanomagnetite concentration of 1 g/L, a shaking speed of 250 rpm and a 20 minute retention time, 82 % of Cr(VI) was removed. Competition from common coexisting ions such as Na(+), Ni(2 +), Cu(2 +), NO(3) (-), SO(4) (2 -), and Cl was negligible. The adsorption data was well fitted by the Freundlich isotherm.

The synthesis resulted in nanoparticles having an average diameter of 6828 nm. The x-ray diffraction pattern confirmed the presence of nickel metal, {{as well as the}} presence of unreacted nickel (II) hydroxide Ni(OH) 2. Magnetic characterization showed that a magnetization saturation of 39. 3 <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>unit</b> (emu) /g at 20, 000 Oersted (Oe) was reached rapidly and that the material exhibited ferromagnetic behavior. Protein purification results showed that the synthesized NNPs were highly selective for binding to a His 6 -tagged recombinant protein single-domain antibody ToxA 5. 1. In addition, NNPs were used for four adsorption cycles without significant binding capacity losses. These particles have shown great potential such as being easily synthesized, cost-effective, and highly selective magnetic adsorbents for the purification of His 6 -tagged recombinant proteins. 9 Copyright 9 Materials Research Society 2012.
