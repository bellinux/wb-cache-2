40|$|Porphyria cutanea tarda is a {{disorder}} of porphyrin metabolism, of which familial and sporadic forms have been described. Factors such as iron seem necessary for {{porphyria cutanea tarda}} to become clinically manifest. To study the relationship between iron and uroporphyrins in hepatocytes of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda, a morphological and morphometrical study was performed in 13 liver biopsies of patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (eight with {{sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda}} and five with <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda).</b> In addition, possible differences in clinical and biochemical features and in histopathological findings between patients with sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda and <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> were investigated. <b>Familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients presented at a younger age than sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda patients (42. 4 +/- 5. 3 vs. 57. 3 +/- 8. 6 years). Biochemical features were not different between sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda and <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients. Uroporphyrin crystals and a variable degree of liver siderosis were detected in the biopsies of all 13 patients. Uroporphyrin crystals were often found close to ferritin-like iron deposits. The morphometrical analysis showed that an increased mean area fraction of ferritin iron was associated with an increased mean area fraction of uroporphyrin crystals in hepatocytes of sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda and <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients. Moreover, the amount of uroporphyrin crystals was significantly higher in livers of <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> than sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda patients. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that uroporphyria is precipitated by an iron-dependent process. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E

40|$|Both <b>familial</b> and {{sporadic}} <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (PCT) are iron dependent diseases. Symptoms of PCT resolve when iron {{stores are}} depleted by phlebotomy, and a sequence variant of HFE (C 282 Y, c. 843 G>A, rs 1800562) that enhances iron aborption by reducing hepcidin expression {{is a risk}} factor for PCT. Recently, a polymorphic variant (D 519 G, c. 1556 A>G, rs 11558492) of glyceronephosphate O-acyltransferase (GNPAT) was shown to be enriched in male patients with type I hereditary hemochromatosis (HFE C 282 Y homozygotes) who presented with a high iron phenotype, suggesting that GNPAT D 519 G, like HFE C 282 Y, is a modifier of iron homeostasis that favors iron absorption. To challenge this hypothesis, we investigated the frequency of GNPAT D 519 G in patients with both familial and sporadic PCT. Patients were screened for GNPAT D 519 G and allelic variants of HFE (both C 282 Y and H 63 D). Nucleotide sequencing of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) identified mutant alleles. Patients with low erythrocyte URO-D activity or a damaging URO-D variant were classified as familial PCT (fPCT) and those with wild-type URO-D were classified as sporadic PCT (sPCT). GNPAT D 519 G was significantly enriched in the fPCT patient population (p = 0. 0014) but not in the sPCT population (p = 0. 4477).

40|$|Hepatoerythropoietic {{porphyria}} is {{a severe}} cutaneous porphyria caused by deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase {{and is considered}} to be the homozygous form of familial (type II) porphyria cutanea tarda. To elucidate further the relation between these conditions, we studied five Spanish families with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria and nine unrelated Spanish patients with <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda.</b> Immunoreactive and catalytic uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase was decreased by greater than 95 % in the five patients with hepatoerythropoietic porphyria.

40|$|Uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) is a cytosolic heme-biosynthetic {{enzyme that}} {{converts}} uroporphyrinogen to coproporphyrinogen. Defects at the uroporphyrinogen decar-boxylase locus cause the human genetic disease familial por-phyria cutanea tarda. A splice site mutation {{has been found}} in a pedigree with <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> that causes exon 6 to be deleted from the mRNA. The intron/exon junc-tions on either side of exon 6 fall between codons, so the re-sulting protein is shorter than the normal protein, missing only the amino acids coded by exon 6. The shortened protein lacks catalytic activity, is rapidly degraded when exposed to human lymphocyte lysates, and is not detectable by Western blot anal-ysis in lymphocyte lysates derived from affected individuals.

The half-life of the abnormal protein was 12 times shorter than that of the normal enzyme. The results indicate that the enzyme defect is due to a rapid degradation of the protein in vivo.

40|$|The {{molecular}} defect of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) {{was examined}} {{in a patient}} with mild hepato- erythropoietic porphyria. To elucidate the UROD defect, we cloned UROD cDNAs from EBV-transformed lympho- blastoid cells of the proband using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned UROD cDNAs revealed two separate missense mutations, each occurring in a separate allele. One mutation was a Val 134 â†’ Gin transition, and was due to three sequential point mutations (T 417 G 418 T 419 â†’ CCA); the other mutation was a His 220 â†’ Pro transition (A 677 â†’ C). UROD pheno- type studies demonstrated that the TGT â†’ CCA mutation was inherited from the father, and the A â†’ C mutation was inherited from the mother. In contrast to the null activity previously described for a mutant UROD from a patient with <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda,</b> these mutant URODs had subnormal but substantial enzyme activities, when expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells.

40|$|<b>Familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (f-PCT) {{results from}} the half-normal {{activity}} of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D). Heterozygotes for this autosomal dominant trait are predisposed to photosensitive cutaneous lesions by various ecogenic factors, including iron overload and alcohol abuse. The 3. 6 -kb URO-D gene was completely sequenced, and a long-range PCR method was developed to amplify the entire gene for mutation analysis. Four missense mutations (M 165 R, L 195 F, N 304 K, and R 332 H), a microinsertion (g 10 insA), a deletion (g 645 Delta 1053), and a novel exonic splicing defect (E 314 E) were identified. Expression of the L 195 F, N 304 K, and R 332 H polypeptides revealed significant residual activity, whereas reverse transcription-PCR and sequencing demonstrated that the E 314 E lesion caused abnormal splicing and exon 9 skipping. Haplotyping indicated {{that three of the}} four families with the g 10 insA mutation were unrelated, indicating that these microinsertions resulted from independent mutational events. Screening of nine f-PCT probands revealed that 44 % were heterozygous or homozygous for the common hemochromatosis mutations, which suggests that iron overload may predispose to clinical expression. However, there was no clear correlation between f-PCT disease severity and the URO-D and/or hemochromatosis genotypes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> is {{the most}} common form of porphyria, {{characterized}} by the decreased activity of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme. Several reports associated HFE gene mutations of hereditary hemochromatosis with <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> worldwide, although up to date only one study has been conducted in Brazil. OBJECTIVES: Investigation of <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> association with C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations in the HFE gene. Identification of precipitating factors (hepatitis C, HIV, alcoholism and estrogen) and their link with HFE mutations. METHODS: An ambispective study of 60 patients with PCT was conducted during the period from 2003 to 2012. Serological tests for hepatitis C and HIV were performed and histories of alcohol abuse and estrogen intake were investigated. HFE mutations were identified with real-time PCR. RESULTS: <b>Porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> predominated in males and alcohol abuse was the main precipitating factor. Estrogen intake was the sole precipitating factor present in 25 % of female patients. Hepatitis C was present in 41. 7 %. All HIV-positive patients (15. 3 %) had a history of alcohol abuse. Allele frequency for HFE mutations, i. e., C 282 Y (p = 0. 0001) and H 63 D (p = 0. 0004), were significantly higher in <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> patients, compared to control group.

40|$|A {{deficiency}} in uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) enzyme activity, the fifth enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway, {{is found in}} patients with {{sporadic porphyria cutanea tarda}} (s-PCT), <b>familial</b> <b>porphyria</b> <b>cutanea</b> <b>tarda</b> (f-PCT), and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP). Subnormal UROD activity is due to mutations of the UROD gene in both f-PCT and HEP, but no mutations have been found in s-PCT. Genetic analysis has determined that f-PCT is transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. In contrast, HEP, a severe form of cutaneous porphyria, is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HEP is characterized by a profound deficiency of UROD activity, and the disease is usually manifest in childhood. In this study, a strategy was designed to identify alleles responsible for the HEP phenotype in three unrelated families. Mutations of UROD were identified by direct sequencing of four amplified fragments that contained the entire coding sequence of the UROD gene. Two new missense mutations were observed at the homoallelic state: P 62 L (proline-to-leucine substitution at codon 62) in a Portuguese family and Y 311 C (tyrosine-to-cysteine substitution at codon 311) in an Italian family. A third mutation, G 281 E, was observed in a Spanish family. This mutation has been previously described in three families from Spain and one from Tunisia. In the Spanish family described in this report, a paternal uncle of the proband developed clinically overt PCT as an adult and proved to be heterozygous for the G 281 E mutation.
