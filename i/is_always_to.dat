In the single player campaign mode the player works {{through a series of}} missions, the objective of which varies, but usually involves building a small town, harvesting resources, building an army and then leading it to victory. In multiplayer games, the objective <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> destroy the enemy players' forces. Some scenarios are complicated by the presence of wild monsters, but sometimes these monsters can be used as troops. The game plays in a medieval setting with fantasy elements. Both sides have melee units and ranged units, and also spellcasters.|$|E

While describing the music that marked Todd's prominent 1996 [...] "return from the dead" [...] storyline (which documented his return to town after being presumed dead), Nichtern addressed the broader aspect of his composition for the character: [...] "All of Todd's music has had a certain 'vibe' to it, especially since the character is so well-drawn," [...] he stated. [...] "It also has seemed particularly well-suited to my guitar style, so I've enjoyed 'becoming' Todd musically. The key <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> represent his dark side, but with the possibility of redemption and power behind the whole thing." [...] Nichtern added, [...] "That's what makes him such an interesting character.

[...] Talk show host and media personality Ellen DeGeneres deemed Blaine [...] "a very confident gay teen, which is something you don't see much on television." [...] However, Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times assessed that [...] "despite the image he projects, he, too, is just a kid trying to figure things out as he goes along." [...] Criss feels that Blaine's confidence is an important aspect of his character, as it is rare for gay teenagers on television to be so [...] "sure of themselves."

Ferriter commented: [...] "Rogan has to be admired for his perseverance and determination {{when it comes to}} chronicling {{the life and times of}} contrary musical giants – having previously tackled Morrissey. Well-researched biography <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> be encouraged, particularly when dealing with a difficult and elusive character". David Sinclair, author of Wannabe: How The Spice Girls Reinvented Pop Fam, reviewed the book for The Guardian, and commented: [...] "Rogan's scrutiny of Morrison's work is undertaken with no less care than that devoted to the details of the singer's life story, and the analysis and appreciation of Morrison's very real accomplishments as a musician provide some welcome ballast to a personal portrayal that is otherwise almost comically unflattering. Rogan's book certainly sheds new light on the life and times of this puzzling and reclusive performer." [...] Sinclair also noted the book takes a negative tone towards some of Morrison's mannerisms, and concluded his review with: [...] "But it may be as well to get hold of a copy before Morrison's legal representatives have had a chance to get out their fine-tooth combs." ...|$|E

The first Atlantic proa was the , designed in 1968 by boat designer Dick Newick for the 1968 OSTAR solo translatlantic race, in which it placed third. Newkirk's designs are primarily trimarans, and the Atlantic proa's buoyant outrigger follows naturally from a conversion of a trimaran from a tacking to a shunting vessel.|$|E

2500|$|Both sports play an {{important}} part in the cultures of the societies in which they are popular. Baseball is deeply ingrained in the American psyche, and is known in the United States as [...] "the national pastime". It is one of the sports most readily identified with the United States. Baseball references abound in American English, and the sport is well represented in American cinema in numerous baseball movies. Baseball also plays {{an important}} cultural role in many parts of Latin America, (specifically Cuba, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Puerto Rico and Venezuela), as well as in East Asia. Many terms and expressions from the sport have entered the English lexicon. Examples are [...] "getting to first base," [...] "out of left field", [...] "having two strikes against him/her", [...] "swinging for the fences", [...] "he struck out", [...] "that's a home run", and [...] "southpaw" [...] (baseball diamonds are traditionally built with home plate to the west so hitters do not have to fight the setting sun as well as the pitch, a pitcher's left arm <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> the south).|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting {{the modern}} {{position}} since unfair terms legislation was enacted, the most quoted passage in English courts on the canons of interpretation {{is found in}} Lord Hoffmann's judgment in ICS Ltd v West Bromwich BS. Lord Hoffmann restated the law that a document's meaning is {{what it would mean}} (1) to a reasonable person (2) with knowledge of the context, or the whole matrix of fact (3) except prior negotiations (4) and meaning does not follow what the dictionary says but meaning understood from its context (5) and the meaning should not contradict common sense. The objective <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> give effect to the intentions of the parties. While it remains the law for reasons of litigation cost, there is some contention over how far evidence of prior negotiations should be excluded by the courts. It appears increasingly clear that the courts may adduce evidence of negotiations where it would clearly assist in construing the meaning of an agreement. This approach to interpretation has some overlap with the right of the parties to seek [...] "rectification" [...] of a document, or requesting from a court to read a document not literally but with regard to what the parties can otherwise show was really intended.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{treating}} people equally is not {{by itself}} enough to achieve equality for everyone, the law requires that employers owe positive duties to disabled people to give preferential treatment. According to Chacón Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA disabilities involve an impairment [...] "which hinders {{the participation of the}} person concerned in professional life". This includes all varieties of mental and physical disabilities. Because treating disabled people equally based on ability to perform tasks could easily result in persistence of exclusion from the workforce, employers are bound to do as much as reasonably possible to ensure participation is not hindered in practice. Under the Equality Act 2010 sections 20 to 22, employers have to make [...] "reasonable adjustments". For example, employers may have to change physical features of a workplace, or provide auxiliary aids to work, or adjust their working habits and expectations. In effect, the law views society as being the cause of the [...] "disability" [...] if it fails to ensure people are accommodated, rather than seeing the person's handicap as being merely a personal misfortune. EA 2010 Schedule 8 lists more examples of reasonable adjustments, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission provides guidance. In the leading case, Archibald v Fife Council, it was held that the council had a duty to exempt a lady from competitive interviews for a new job. Mrs Archibald, previously a road sweeper, had lost the ability to walk after complications in surgery. Despite over 100 applications for grades just above a manual worker, in her submission, the employers were fixated on her past history as a sweeper. The House of Lords held it could be appropriate, before such an ordeal, for a worker to fill an existing vacancy without a standard interview procedure. By contrast, in O’Hanlon v Revenue and Customs Commissioners the Court of Appeal rejected {{that it would be a}} reasonable adjustment, as Ms O'Hanlon was requesting after falling into clinical depression, for an employer to increase sick pay to full pay, after the expiry of a six-month period that applied to everyone else. The aim <b>is</b> <b>always</b> <b>to</b> ensure that disabilities are not a barrier to full participation in working life, as much as possible.|$|E
