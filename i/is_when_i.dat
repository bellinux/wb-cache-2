He continued there for 17 years. According to Crane's daughter, at Rochester's annual auto show his dealership's exhibit featured a pool table at which Crane would run balls while answering questions. [...] "Working" [...] for a living was purely a choice of survival. In an interview with Sports Illustrated in 1969, Crane said, [...] "If I had to make a choice between selling cars and playing pool, I'd choose pool... The only time I've ever been really happy <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was at a pool table." ...|$|E

[...] He organized the first national trapshooting organization, a forerunner to today's Amateur Trapshooting Association (ATA). Sousa remained active in the fledgling ATA for some time after its formation. Some credit Sousa as the father of organized trapshooting in United States. He also wrote numerous articles about trapshooting. Sousa was a regular competitor representing the United States Navy in trapshooting competitions, particularly against the United States Army. [...] Available records indicate that Sousa registered more than 35,000 targets during his shooting career. A quote from his Trapshooting Hall of Fame biography says it best: [...] "Let me say that just about the sweetest music to me <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> call, 'pull,' the old gun barks, and the referee in perfect key announces, 'dead'." ...|$|E

He later {{had a major}} role {{as part of the}} supporting cast of the series, though he did not appear regularly during the following seasons as he was attempting to repair his marriage with Khloé. Kim's current husband Kanye West made his first appearance on Keeping Up with the Kardashians in July 2012 during the seventh season when he started dating Kim. However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the amount of backlash I got from it <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get." [...] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about the way how the show is filmed. In the eighth season, Caitlyn Jenner's sons Brandon and Brody Jenner, as well as Brandon's wife Leah, joined the cast for regular appearances.|$|E

500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its {{psychiatric}} {{evidence on the}} third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

The AP article also said [...] "Renzi made much of his money while living in Burke, Virginia, about 20 minutes from downtown Washington.

2500|$|John Snow {{wrote that}} Lou Rowan was 'utterly unable to {{distinguish}} between a delivery short of a length which rise around {{the height of the}} rib cage and a genuine bouncer which goes through head high'. and believed that chest high balls were not intimidatory. However, English umpire Dickie Bird wrote [...] "as far as I am concerned, intimidatory bowling is the fast, short pitched ball into the region of the batsman's ribcage. When such a ball is fired in it is then that I feel an umpire must be firm...and tell the bowler to cut it out...that's the killer ball, and that <b>is</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> always step in". As Snow hit tailenders Garth McKenzie and Terry Jenner on the head in the series and continually bowled short at the other Australian batsmen it was not unreasonable for the umpires to intervene. Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth.|$|E
