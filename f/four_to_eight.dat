5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} branch line from <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to allow more services to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E
5|$|All of the colleges, {{except for}} Kresge, have both {{residence}} halls and apartments. Kresge is all apartments. Apartments are typically shared by <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> students, have common living/dining rooms, kitchens and bathrooms, and {{a combination of}} shared and private bedrooms. Apartments at colleges other than Kresge are generally reserved for students above the freshman level.|$|E
5|$|By 1991, {{development}} was behind schedule. Development slowed even more when Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory cancelled its {{order for the}} first machine, {{in favor of the}} C90. Several executives, including the CEO, left the company. The company then announced they would be looking for a customer that needed a smaller version of the machine, with <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> processors.|$|E

5|$|Metformin has an oral {{bioavailability}} of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and {{is absorbed}} slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within {{one to three}} hours of taking immediate-release metformin and <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000l after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached {{in one or two}} days.|$|E
5|$|Ascension is {{the only}} {{installment}} in the series to feature online multiplayer for both competitive and cooperative play. Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players (or a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> player deathmatch) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods. Players can also fight each other in one-on-one matches. Players must sell their champion's soul to either Zeus, Hades, Ares, or Poseidon, which allows players to try different weapons, armor sets, and powers inspired by the god of their choice, and extras can be unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Basic indoor venues may {{be adapted}} gymnasiums, which can easily {{accommodate}} high jump competitions and short track events. Full-size indoor arenas (i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area {{is surrounded by}} a 200-metre oval track with <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. Some have a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the straights of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors.|$|E

5|$|Forecasts of {{hurricane}} activity are issued before each hurricane season by noted hurricane experts such as Dr. William M. Gray {{and his associates}} at Colorado State University. A normal season as defined by NOAA has six to fourteen named storms of which <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> reach hurricane strength and one to three become major hurricanes. The June 1988 forecast was that eleven storms would form and that seven would reach hurricane status. The forecast did not specify how many hurricanes would reach major hurricane status.|$|E

5|$|Rotaviral {{enteritis}} is a mild {{to severe}} disease characterised by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and low-grade fever. Once {{a child is}} infected by the virus, there is an incubation period of about two days before symptoms appear. The period of illness is acute. Symptoms often start with vomiting followed by <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> days of profuse diarrhoea. Dehydration {{is more common in}} rotavirus infection than in most of those caused by bacterial pathogens, and is {{the most common cause of}} death related to rotavirus infection.|$|E

5|$|During late 1990 {{and early}} 1991 the Australian {{government}} considered deploying F-111Cs {{to expand the}} Australian contribution to the 1991 Gulf War, which mainly comprised a Royal Australian Navy task group. The Department of Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade's (DFAT) preferred option if the government decided to expand Australia's commitment was to deploy at least two RF-111s, though these aircraft would need to have their electronic warfare equipment upgraded to operate in this war zone. Due to {{the small size of}} the RF-111 force, the loss of any of these aircraft in combat would have inflicted a heavy blow on Australia's reconnaissance capability. The second preference in the advice put to the government was to deploy a squadron of <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> F-111Cs, though Defence did not support this. In the event, the government decided to not expand the Australian force. As a result, the F-111Cs' contribution to the war was limited to conducting intensive exercises with the Naval ships as they sailed through Australian waters en route to the Persian Gulf.|$|E

The forecast did not specify how many of the hurricanes would reach major hurricane status. However, the predictions proved to be too high, with only four named storms forming {{by the end of the}} season and three of those reaching hurricane status.|$|E
5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely {{buried in the}} ground. As the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E

5|$|On September 2, 2008, the French yacht Carré d'As IV and its two {{crew were}} {{captured}} in the Gulf of Aden by seven armed Somali pirates, who demanded the release of six pirates {{captured in the}} April MY Le Ponant raid and over one million dollars in ransom. On September 16, 2008, on the orders of President Nicolas Sarkozy, French special forces raided and recovered the yacht, rescued the two hostages, killed one pirate, and captured the other six. The pirates were flown to France to stand trial for piracy and related offenses; ultimately, five of them were {{convicted and sentenced to}} <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> years in prison, while a sixth was acquitted. The incident marked the second French counter-piracy commando operation of 2008 (after the recovery of the MY Le Ponant), as well as the first-ever French trial of Somali pirates.|$|E
5|$|On average, IIH {{occurs in}} about one per 100,000 people, and {{can occur in}} {{children}} and adults. The median age at diagnosis is 30. IIH occurs predominantly in women, especially in the ages 20 to 45, who are <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> {{times more likely than}} men to be affected. Overweight and obesity strongly predispose a person to IIH: women who are more than ten percent over their ideal body weight are thirteen times more likely to develop IIH, and this figure goes up to nineteen times in women who are more than twenty percent over their ideal body weight. In men this relationship also exists, but the increase is only five-fold in those over 20 percent above their ideal body weight.|$|E
5|$|When {{development}} {{began in}} December 2007, the studio had employed five full-time team members. Development took eight weeks, though {{creation of the}} Velociraptor and jeep models had already been started before development began. Other staff {{were working on the}} title before then, but two key members were involved in the Independent Games Festival. A teaser trailer was released on January 18, 2008; quickly garnering interest from gaming blogs such as Kotaku and Destructoid. In an interview the developers hinted that a non-free downloadable version with extra content may be produced, or that advertisements may be introduced to the site. The company also revealed plans to continue developing free games with a development time of <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> weeks. The most popular of these games will be further developed and released on platforms such as WiiWare, PlayStation Network or Xbox Live Arcade.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Stabæk {{announced}} they had signed an eleven-year sponsorship {{agreement with the}} telecommunications company Telenor, where the latter would pay up to NOK115 million for the sole naming rights for the arena, in addition to tickets and access to executive boxes. In March 2009, the retailing property was sold from Scandinavian Property Development to KLP Eiendom. The plans called for twenty to twenty-five football games, <b>four</b> <b>to</b> <b>eight</b> concerts, three to four large sports events and two other large events and conventions per year. Because of larger seating capacity, an all-seating arrangement, higher attendance and VIP facilities, Stabæk is able to generate three times the matchday revenue from Telenor Arena as Nadderud. The stadium is plagued with traffic problems on matchdays, with large crews hired to create temporary barriers to direct the crowds. The bus stops closest to the venue are closed, {{and a large number}} of police officers have to direct the traffic. These are costs which have to be carried by the arena company, and contrasts to matches at the nearly twice as large Ullevaal, where no such measures are necessary.|$|E
