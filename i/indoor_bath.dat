50|$|The Amateur Swimming Association {{was founded}} in 1869 in England, and the Oxford Swimming Club in 1909. The {{presence}} of <b>indoor</b> <b>baths</b> in the cobbled area of Merton Street might have persuaded the less hardy of the aquatic brigade to join. So, bathers gradually became swimmers, and bathing pools became swimming pools.. In 1939, Oxford created its first major public indoor pool at Temple Cowley.|$|R

50|$|Documents {{dating back}} to 1219 mention a Benedictine monastery in Tapolca; it stood until the 16th century, but during the Ottoman {{occupation}} of Hungary the monastery was attacked several times and the monks left. Tapolca remained without permanent residents until the 19th century, although it {{was used as a}} holiday resort already in the early 18th century. At this time it belonged to the monastery of Görömböly. The bishop of Vác asked the monastery to develop Tapolca as a holiday resort; three pools were built for the thermal water, and an inn was built too. By 1830 there was an <b>indoor</b> <b>bath</b> too.|$|E

50|$|In {{terms of}} {{passenger}} comfort, Syracusia {{would be the}} equivalent of Titanic compared to other ships of the era. Her innovative design and sheer size allowed for the creation of various recreational spaces aboard, including a garden and an <b>indoor</b> <b>bath</b> room with hot water. The lower levels of the ship were reserved for the crew and the soldiers on board, while the upper levels were for the use of passengers. According to Athenaeus, the ship was beautifully decorated using materials such as ivory and marble, while all public spaces were floored with mosaics depicting the entire story of the Iliad. The ship was also equipped with a library, a drawing room and a gymnasium for use by the passengers, as well as a small temple dedicated to Aphrodite.|$|E

2500|$|From the 1730s, Brighton entered {{its second}} phase of development—one which brought a rapid {{improvement}} in its fortunes. The contemporary fad for drinking and bathing in seawater as a purported cure for illnesses was enthusiastically encouraged by Dr Richard Russell from nearby Lewes. He sent many patients to [...] "take the cure" [...] in the sea at Brighton, published a popular treatise on the subject, {{and moved to the}} town soon afterwards (the Royal Albion, one of Brighton's early hotels, occupies the site of his house). Others were already visiting the town for recreational purposes before Russell became famous, and his actions coincided with other developments which made Brighton more attractive to visitors. From the 1760s it was a boarding point for boats travelling to France; road transport to London was improved when the main road via Crawley was turnpiked in 1770; and spas and <b>indoor</b> <b>baths</b> were opened by other entrepreneurial physicians such as Sake Dean Mahomed and Anthony Relhan (who also wrote the town's first guidebook).|$|R
50|$|The {{studio was}} created in 1978 at a disused cinema theatre {{on the ground floor}} of a {{building}} known as Sportpalatset (Palace of Sports) in central Stockholm.

The house, dating to around 1840, had two rooms down, a staircase and entry hall, two rooms up with a closet. A birds-eye map from 1867, showing structures and other town features, verifies the existence of the house with the larger house moved to this site. It was in the later 1800s, after George's death, that other improvements and additions were made including an <b>indoor</b> toilet and <b>bath,</b> dining room, living room fireplace.The front porch was likely enlarged at that time and an uncovered side porch was also built.

50|$|The Romans conquered and annexed the Eravasci around 12 BC. There, {{they turned}} the {{existing}} settlement into Aquincum {{and made it a}} military and civilian hub. The territory of the Eravasci became the Roman providence of Pannonia Inferior with Aquincum as its capital. The Eravascian culture continued to thrive throughout the early Roman occupation. Evidence of this is found on tombstone reliefs, which pictures Celtic dress and jewelry. Aquincum eventually stationed one legion of 6,000 men and 500 cavalry by 89 AD as part of the Roman border protection system. The town prospered in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. In 106 AD, Aquincum was given full Roman privileges. This gave them <b>indoor</b> heating, public <b>baths,</b> mosaics (which are on display in the museum), and two Amphitheaters (which are also on display).

25|$|The Cadburys were {{particularly}} {{concerned with the}} health and fitness of their workforce, incorporating park and recreation areas into the Bournville village plans and encouraging swimming, walking and indeed all forms of outdoor sports. In the early 1920s, extensive open lands were purchased at Rowheath and laid to football and hockey pitches together with a grassed running track. Rowheath Pavilion was designed and built {{in accordance with the}} instructions of George Cadbury and opened in July 1924. At that time, it served as the clubhouse and changing rooms for the acres of sports playing fields, several bowling greens, a fishing lake and an outdoor swimming lido, a natural mineral spring forming the source for the lido's healthy waters. The Rowheath Pavilion itself, which still exists, was used for balls and dinners and the whole area was specifically {{for the benefit of the}} Cadbury workers and their families with no charges for the use of any of the sporting facilities by Cadbury employees or their families. The lido was eventually closed in the 1970s after complaints of noise disturbance were made by residents of the newly built Oak Farm estate, coupled with new and stringent health and safety regulations relating to outdoor public swimming facilities. Cadbury's also built the Bournville <b>indoor</b> swimming <b>baths</b> on Bournville Lane (separate buildings for 'girls' and men), the Valley pool boating lake and the picturesque cricket pitch adjacent to the factory site, that was made famous as the picture on boxes of Milk Tray chocolates throughout the 1950s and early 1960s.|$|R

40|$|From 1870 to the present, {{the city}} of New York has built and {{maintained}} municipal bathing places including river <b>baths,</b> <b>indoor</b> bathhouses, indoor pools, and outdoor pools, designed around competing motivations of hygiene, recreation, and play. In this paper, I consider {{what it means for}} different groups to play in public space using Caillois 2 ̆ 7 s division of ludus [...] competitive, rule-bound play, and paidia [...] exuberant, unstructured play. First, using historical examples, I show how these notions of play were expressed in two shifts in the construction of municipal swimming and bathing infrastructure in New York City. In 1870, the enclosure of formerly unstructured bathing spaces at the riverbanks, and the establishment of floating baths in the rivers was meant to structure both time and behavior in the water; in 1936, the construction of 11 enormous swimming pools under Parks Commissioner Robert Moses provided bathing spaces, with recreation at the center of their design program and social function. Second, I offer contemporary ethnographic data from two outdoor pools in Brooklyn to demonstrate how rules around acceptable play are differentially enforced inside of the same institution. Through these historical shifts and contemporary variations, I demonstrate how both the construction and everyday use of municipal bathing infrastructure has been the site of an ongoing tension between ludus and paidia, inflected with urban problematics of class and race...|$|R
40|$|Background The ageing {{population}} poses {{a tremendous}} challenge {{in understanding the}} sources of inequalities in health. Though {{they appear to be}} far removed, childhood conditions are known to be inextricably linked with adult health, and in turn on health in later life. The long arm of childhood conditions hypothesis is often tested using recollection of childhood cir-cumstances, but such subjective recall can yield potentially inaccurate or possibly biased inferences. We tested the long arm hypothesis on three outcomes in later life, arrayed from objective to subjective health, namely: gait speed, episodic memory and mental health. Methods and Findings We used the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing 2006 enriched with retrospective life his-tory (N = 5, 913). To deal with recall problems two solutions, covariate measurement and endogenous treatment models, were applied. Retrospective childhood material lack includes growing up without running hot or cold water, fixed <b>bath,</b> <b>indoor</b> lavatory and central heating. Adjustment is made for an extensive set of confounders including sex, age, adult health, wealth, education, occupation, social support, social connections, chronic condi-tions, smoking, drinking, and physical exercise. It is found that material poverty when grow-ing up shows no association with health when growing old, assuming accurate recall. Once recall problems are controlled, we found that childhood material poverty changes inversely with later life health. Conclusion A poorer childhood goes with slower gait, poorer memory and more depression in later life. This result provides a further impetus to eliminate child poverty...|$|R
