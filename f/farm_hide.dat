Findings are expected to help farmers, insurance agents, lenders, and those in academia better understand and evaluate insurance policies that trigger indemnity payments based on county indexes. Case studies are provided to facilitate understanding of tracking between farm and county yields and the importance of the farm-county yield correlation. A protocol is developed to standardize county and farm yields to better illustrate tracking and rules-of- thumb are developed to aid in crop insurance purchase decisions. Cumulative probability distributions of net yields with and without insurance are used to show the effects of county and farm trigger insurance policies on risk transfer. The farm location and spatial diversification in a county result in variations in the farm-county yield correlations and yield basis risk. These measures are directly related to the risk transfer performance of county trigger policies relative to no insurance and to farm trigger insurance policies.

40|$|Purpose - The {{emergence}} of the fast fashion trend has exerted a great pressure on fashion designers who are urged to consider customers' preferences in their designs and develop new products in an efficient manner. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) approach for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of new product development (NPD) in fast fashion. Design/methodology/approach - The <b>FARM</b> identifies the <b>hidden</b> relationships between product styles and customer preferences. The knowledge discovered help the fashion industry design new products which are not only fashionable, but are also saleable in the market. Findings - To evaluate the proposed approach, a case study is conducted in a Hong Kong-based fashion company in which a real-set of data are tested to generate fuzzy association rules. The results reveal that the FARM approach can provide knowledge support to the fashion industry during NPD, shorten the NPD cycle time, and increase customer satisfaction. Originality/value - Compared with traditional association rule mining, the proposed FARM approach takes the fuzziness of data into consideration and the knowledge represented in the fuzzy rules is in a more human-understandable structure. It captures the voice of the customer into fashion product development and provides a specific solution to deal with the challenges brought by fast fashion.

40|$|Human {{labor input}} is {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most important inputs in the economy, especially in the agricultural sector, that contributes in increasing production and employment, so the cycle of economic development must be pushed to achieve the most economic efficiency from the agricultural labor input. 	The main research problem and the objective of the study, can be summarized in the nature of demand on the labor input, and the relations among labor input with the other inputs. 	To achieve and exploring the objectives, the study used the dual approach of profit and cost functions, and estimated two types of models to each one, the first is: Cobb-Douglas and Transcendental Logarithmic profit functions, that take into account including the prices of variable inputs only, i. e., labor wage, and the quantities of fixed inputs, i. e., capital and land. The second is: Cobb-Douglas and Transcendental Logarithmic cost functions, that take into account including the prices of variable and fixed inputs, i. e., labor wage and price of capital, in addition inclusion the value of production. To derive the demand on labor input, the study used Zellner’s method of restricted seemingly unrelated regressions (RSUR), to capture the restrictions available among different equations in the model. 	Data were collected from different sources, through the period subject to analysis (1990 - 2006). The general wholesale price index (2000 = 100), was used to deflate the price variables. 	The results of the study, showed that, there was a negative relation between the wage and labor, according to the own price elasticities of demand, also there was substitution between labor and capital, according to the cross price elasticities of demand, tended to the labor input, as a result of labor intensity, and may be due to increasing the cost of technology, especially in the Egyptian small <b>farms.</b> 	The <b>hidden</b> unemployment in the Egyptian agricultural sector didn’t exist. 	The results indicated that, the value of marginal product of labor, was greater than the labor farm wage, so this reflects the fact of efficiency of using human labor input in the Egyptian agriculture. 	Finally, the study recommended to apply technological tools with non intensive capital, to encourage the demand on human labor, investing in the agricultural projects that capture human labor, and increasing the wages that reflect the real value of marginal product of labor and his productivity to achieve the efficiency of human labor input in the Egyptian agricultural sector. ...|$|R

The third narrative concerns Mengele’s fascination with a Gypsy boy at Auschwitz and the fourth a film used to accustom German audiences to mercy-killing. A survey of key developments in the history of eugenics theory in Germany and the United States follows, and a thesis is developed that the same racial-purification impulses that drove German science during the 1930 s and 1940 s were present in American documents and legal procedings.

40|$|AEE Working Paper. Soil erosion is an {{increasingly}} important problem in Zimbabwe. Whitlow (1988) states that 4. 7 % of the country or 1. 8 mio hectares of land are actually eroded, the bulk (1. 5 mio hectares) located in the Communal Lands. Arable and grazing lands are equally effected by erosion. The influence of human factors, especially population density and tenure system explained most of the variations of erosion in the Communal Lands (Whitlow 1988). At present most of the arable lands {{are more or less}} protected against rill and gully erosion through countor ridges, mostly built in the late sixties. Contours, however, do not sufficiently reduce. sheet erosion so that high soil losses from arable land still occur. The farmers crops are thereby not only affected by the loss of fertile topsoil and fertilizers washed away but the infiltration capacity of the soil is reduced and water-runoff increases, leaving the crops with less water to grow. Also, the structural stability of the soil may collapse (Elwell,l 989). Stocking (1986) estimates that in average 75 t/ha of topsoil are lost every year from the communal grazing areas and about 50 t/ha from the arable lands in communal areas. If the loss of top soil is calculated in terms of nutrients, farmers would yearly lose nitrogen and phosphorus worth Z$ 120 from grazing lands and Z$ 80 from cropland, calculated in 1985 fertilizer prices. This is more than the average application of fertilizers that amounted up to Z$ 55 /ha in 1989 / 90 and often more than the gross margin per hectare (MLARR 1990).

40|$|I {{present a}} simple model of intra-household {{allocation}} between spouses {{to show that}} when the quantity of resources available to the household is not perfectly observed by both spouses, hiding of income can occur even when revelation of the additional resources increases bargaining power. From the model, a test to identify income hiding empirically is derived. For the empirical application, a household survey conducted in Southern Ghana is used. I exploit the variation {{in the degree of}} asymmetric information between spouses, measured as the difference between the husband’s own reporting of farm sales and the wife’s reporting of his farm sales, to test whether the allocation of resources is consistent with hiding. For identification, the wife’s clan and the husband’s bride-wealth payments upon marriage are used as instruments for asymmetric information. My findings indicate that allocations are suggestive of men <b>hiding</b> <b>farm</b> sales income in the form of gifts to extended family members, which are not closely monitored. It is unclear whether hiding has negative consequences in the long run because hiding occurs in the form of gifts, instead of expenditure in alcohol or tobacco. If the gifts represent a form of risk-sharing, then these gifts will return to the household in the future, and hiding is not necessarily inefficient. However, if these gifts are motivated by social pressure then hiding can result on poverty traps caused by kin system. The wife’s response is also suggestive of hiding. As information asymmetries increase, she reduces her expenditure in non-essential items, such as prepared foods and oil, but increases personal spending.

40|$|Water plays a {{fundamental}} role in Balinese culture. The Balinese religion known as Agama Tirta, “the religion of holy-water,” enforces {{the philosophy of}} tri hita karana, which instills an interrelationship of spirit, human, and nature. The physical manifestation of this philosophy is Bali’s cultural landscape, a landscape shaped by an ancient social organization and system of water irrigation, known as the subak, for the cultivation of wet rice (sawah) over the past millennium. Fundamental to the agricultural infrastructure is the network of water temples which intangibly connects each subak sharing the same water sources. The temples sanctify water from its mountain source, through numerous rice terraces, and eventually emptied into the ocean. Due to the cultural significance of Bali’s water culture, Bali’s networks of water temples, subak organizations and engineered landscape have recently been deemed an UNESCO World Heritage site. The subak, and its mastering of water hydrology, has allowed Balinese civilization to reach the heights it has today. However, as modernization and globalization, spurred by tourism, continues to pave over Bali’s natural and cultural landscape, the subak and Bali’s inland water sources have greatly suffered in urbanizing areas. As a result, Bali’s waters have become heavily polluted and neglected, a stark contradiction to the philosophy of tri hita karana. Kuta, a coastal district in southern Bali, is Indonesia’s most popular tourist destination welcoming nearly six million foreign and domestic visitors annually. Once a quiet fishing and <b>farming</b> village <b>hidden</b> within a dense coconut grove, Kuta's seemingly endless white sand beach, tropical environment, and holiday atmosphere attract travelers from around the world. In response to growing visitor numbers and the desire to modernize, a large boom of unrestricted and unplanned development has transformed the once lush coastline into a bustling commercial zone forever altering the traditional village-scape and landscape due to minimal effort in preserving and reinforcing traditional Balinese sociospatial qualities, subak infrastructure, and important natural ecological systems, especially the Tukad Mati River and Prapat Benoa mangrove forest, both of which are for the most part out of view and inaccessible for the general public. Furthermore, a lack of public space prevents any synergistic interaction between tourists and the local population, augmenting the social and economic disparities between the parties. In reaction to the issues currently facing Kuta, I explore the intricacies of Bali’s complex culture, which have shaped its built and natural environments, the impact and influences of tourism in Bali, and contemporary theories of place-making, urban identity, and landscape urbanism.
