25|$|Abydos had {{a special}} {{significance}} for her, because it <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> believed Bentreshyt had lived and served in the Temple of Seti. She had made short pilgrimages to the site before, during which she had demonstrated her advanced knowledge. At one of these trips to the temple, the chief inspector from the Antiquities Department, who knew about her claims, had decided to test her by asking her to stand at particular wall paintings in complete darkness.

500|$|Writing for The New Republic, James Wood {{classified}} Middlesex {{as a story}} {{written in}} the vein of hysterical realism. He said the novel is influenced by its own recounting of [...] "excitements, patternings, and implausibilities that lie on the soft side of magical realism". Such moments in the book include how two cousins conceive [...] "on the same night {{and at the same}} moment" [...] and how years later, those children marry each other. Woods also pointed out the seeming coincidences that involved locales. Smyrna is the burning city from which she flees to start a new life; New Smyrna Beach <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> spends her retirement. Effectively serving as a double entendre, {{the title of the book}} refers to the name of the street where Cal stays at and describes his situation: a hermaphrodite brought up as a girl but who decides to become a boy. Cal's condition is also reflected in his choice of locale to narrate the novel: Berlin is a city formerly of [...] "two halves or sexes" [...] (East and West).|$|E
500|$|Nan stumbles through London {{trying to}} find Florence, which she {{eventually}} does; Florence is now melancholy, however, with a child. Nan stays with Florence and her brother Ralph, working as their housekeeper. Nan and Florence grow closer during the year they live together, and Nan learns that the [...] previous boarder with Florence and Ralph had a child and died shortly after giving birth. Florence was deeply {{in love with the}} boarder but her affections were not returned. During an outing to a women's pub, Nan is recognised by former fans, to Florence's astonishment, and Nan divulges her own spotty past to Florence. Cautiously, they begin a love affair. Putting her theatrical skills to use, Nan assists Ralph in preparing a speech at an upcoming socialist rally. At the event Nan jumps onstage to help Ralph when he falters, and is noticed once more by Kitty, who asks her to come back so they can continue their affair in secret. Realising how much shame Kitty continues to feel, how much of herself was compromised during their affair, and that her truest happiness <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> is now, Nan turns Kitty away and joins Florence.|$|E
500|$|When Milian {{moved to}} Los Angeles, her only desire {{was to be}} an actress. She {{always wanted to be}} in the record business, but did not know how to obtain a {{recording}} contract. During this time, she was also a host for Disney Channel. After living in Los Angeles for six months, Milian moved into the same apartment complex as songwriter and producer Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins. Jerkins heard about Milian from a boy band he was working with and once he heard her sing, they began working together. For a year and a half, Milian went into a studio every day and worked with Jerkins, which <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> started meeting people in the record business. She began writing songs at the age of 17 because she needed a demo to help her obtain a recording contract. According to Milian, every time she recorded a song, the producer would refuse to give her the demo, or would write lyrics that she did not agree with. She felt that she had to write a song, record a demo, and send it out on her own.|$|E

Spice Girls member Melanie C said [...] "Madonna {{was doing the}} girl power thing {{a long time before}} the Spice Girls... 'Express Yourself' is one of the routines that I know and I used to really like doing that one because it <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> shows her bra and holds her crotch." [...] In 2010, singer Christina Aguilera paid tribute to [...] "Express Yourself" [...] with the music video of her single, [...] "Not Myself Tonight". She commented [...] "One of my favorite videos ever is 'Express Yourself' by Madonna which came across as really strong and empowering which I always try to incorporate through my expression of sexuality... I love the direct reference I made to Madonna with the eye glass moment and the smoke and stairs. I was paying tribute to a very strong woman who has paved the way before." [...] James Montgomery from MTV deemed [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as the primary influence of Aguilera's video with scenes like Aguilera displaying a monocle, standing atop a flight of stairs and crawling across the floor while pouring a black liquid over herself. Similarities were also noted between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and singer Lady Gaga's 2011 single [...] "Born This Way" [...] both in subject matter and composition.|$|E
500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic commented, [...] "If 2001's Britney was a {{transitional}} album, capturing Spears {{at the point}} when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman." [...] Erlewine compared Spears to her peer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but while Aguilera [...] "comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is {{the girl next door}} cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since {{this is the first time}} she can indulge herself." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine stated, [...] "For a girl who's always seemed too sexed-up for her age, In the Zone finds Britney finally filling her britches, so-to-speak. Her little girl coquettishness actually works now—maybe because, at 21, she's finally a woman." [...] Jason King of Vibe said the album showcased a transformed Spears, [...] "no longer a girl, and all the woman any man can handle." [...] In 2009, Amy Schriefer of NPR listed the album on The 50 Most Important Recordings of the Decade list. Calling it [...] "a primer on the sound of pop in the '00s", she deemed Spears as the ideal vehicle for a futuristic sound, since she was still trying to break away from her teen pop past. Schriefer praised [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime", and also stated, [...] "While the decade's history of celebrity obsession, paparazzi voyeurism and conflicted constructions of female sexuality and motherhood are written on Spears' body, the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work." ...|$|E

Although the sexual abuse she was believed to have been subjected to had centred on kebab shops in the promenade area, which <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was heading when last seen, police continued to consider her as a missing person rather than a murder victim for more than a year. The search for Downes as a 'missing person' came to involve a large police team.

2500|$|Three cities {{make the}} {{claim to be}} Nell Gwyn's birthplace: Hereford, London (specifically Covent Garden), and Oxford. Evidence for {{any one of the}} three is scarce. The fact that [...] "Gwyn" [...] is a name of Welsh origin might support Hereford, as its county is on the border with Wales; The Dictionary of National Biography notes a {{traditional}} belief that she was born there in Pipe Well Lane, renamed to Gwynne Street in the 19th century. London is the simplest choice, perhaps, since Nell's mother was born there and that <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> raised her children. Alexander Smith's 1715 Lives of the Court Beauties says she was born in Coal Yard Alley in Covent Garden and other biographies, including Wilson's, have followed suit. Beauclerk pieces together circumstantial evidence to favor an Oxford birth. The time of Nell's birth is given in a horoscope, with perhaps spurious precision, as Saturday, 2 February 1650, at six o'clock in the morning, though it has also been suggested that a birth around 1642 may be more likely.|$|E
