5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to <b>destroy</b> <b>them</b> without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E

5|$|Andromeda is also {{associated}} with the Mesopotamian creation story of Tiamat, the goddess of Chaos. She bore many demons for her husband, Apsu, but eventually decided to <b>destroy</b> <b>them</b> in a war that ended when Marduk killed her. He used her body to create the constellations as markers of time for humans.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{then moved}} to the offensive, in early May 1951 {{they were used to}} scout for Chinese {{concentrations}} and then call in artillery to <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b> These actions have been viewed by historians as one of few instances where Rangers in Korea were effectively employed, used as a stealthy infiltration force for terrain too difficult for conventional units.|$|E
5|$|The Nanman {{are absent}} {{from both the}} Yellow Turban Campaign and the War against Dong Zhuo. Instead, they are living peacefully in the south, but are {{defeated}} several times by Shu invaders. King Meng Huo is infuriated, but his wife Zhu Rong invigorates him to send {{them back to their}} lands and <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b> After a single battle for Nanzhong, Meng Huo forces Zhuge Liang's army out of his home.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins in}} a New Republic outpost where Katarn is {{training}} Jade, when Imperial forces attack the base. The player takes control of Katarn {{to defend the}} base from the stormtroopers {{and get to the}} command center. Once there, it is revealed that an evacuation cannot take place because of bombardment by large weapons from two nearby asteroids. Katarn leaves Jade behind as he travels to the asteroids to <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien {{inhabitant}} of the Moon, {{named after}} one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force. More Selenites appear and it becomes increasingly difficult for the astronomers to <b>destroy</b> <b>them</b> as they are surrounded. The Selenites capture the astronomers and take them to the palace of their king. An astronomer lifts the Selenite King off his throne and throws him to the ground, causing him to explode.|$|E
5|$|By the Korean War, {{jet engines}} had {{replaced}} propellers on aircraft, which severely limited {{the ability of}} the 20 mm and 40 mm AA batteries and their gun systems to track and shoot down enemy planes. Consequently, the AA guns and their associated fire-control systems were removed when reactivated. New Jersey received this treatment in 1967, and the others followed in their 1980s modernizations. In the 1980s, each ship also received a quartet of Phalanx Close in Weapon System (CIWS) mounts which made use of a radar system to locate incoming enemy projectiles and <b>destroy</b> <b>them</b> with a 20mm Gatling gun before they could strike the ship.|$|E

After <b>destroying</b> <b>them,</b> he finds Old Man Logan, Sabretooth and Domino who {{tell him that}} the robots were created by the Weapon X program to exterminate them. While researching the metal samples gathered by the mutants, Amadeus remembers that the robots {{were able to get}} a sample of his DNA after he <b>destroyed</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1982, {{the band}} {{released}} {{one of their}} most popular, controversial and acclaimed albums, The Number of the Beast. The artwork and title track led to Christian groups in the United States branding the band as Satanists, encouraging people to destroy copies of the release. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to <b>destroy</b> <b>them</b> with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E
5|$|It was the Ottomans' {{skill with}} {{dealing with their}} opponents that made them very {{powerful}} very quickly. They would subjugate their opponents as vassals rather than <b>destroy</b> <b>them,</b> otherwise they would have exhausted themselves in the process. The exacting of tribute from conquered states {{in the form of}} children and money was effective in forcing subjugation over conquest. Coupled with this, the entire region was composed of many states (Bulgaria, Serbia, Latin states) who would just as soon fight each other as the Ottomans and realized too late that the Ottoman forces defeated them by integrating them in a network of subordinate states.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1956 two FDA {{officials}} {{arrived at}} Orgonon {{to supervise the}} destruction of the accumulators. Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to <b>destroy</b> <b>them,</b> only to supervise the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E

5|$|On April 11, Hambleton (Bat 21 Bravo) was {{too weak}} to move any farther. Norris was well aware of the {{overwhelming}} North Vietnamese presence, but decided to proceed upriver again. He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he {{would have to go to}} him. North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to <b>destroy</b> <b>them</b> before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 27 June, Prpić {{launched}} a three-pronged assault to clear the routes to Nevesinje. Prohaska commanded the push east along the Mostar–Nevesinje road by a force close to two battalions, Francetić led his unit of Ustaše north from Berkovići through the mountains via Odžak to approach Nevesinje from the south, and two companies of the 11th Battalion thrust southwest along the road from Plužine. Once this task was complete, the NDH forces were to vigorously pursue the rebels and <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The North Vietnamese {{response}} to {{the threat posed by}} the sensors was swift. If PAVN troops could detect the general location of a sensor, they immediately began to search out others and <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b> Another response was to simply avoid them. The final evolution of anti-sensor measures was to attempt to deceive them. The chief protection of the sensors proved to be the dense foliage that covered the majority of the logistical system, turning the enemy's chief protection against him. Doubtless, PAVN troops negated the effects of many sensors, but so many of them were sown over such {{a long period of time}} that the majority survived.|$|E

5|$|The {{chief of}} {{construction}} of Auschwitz II-Birkenau was Karl Bischoff. Unlike his predecessor, {{he was a}} competent and dynamic bureaucrat who, {{in spite of the}} ongoing war, carried out the construction deemed necessary. The Birkenau camp, the four crematoria, a new reception building, and hundreds of other buildings were planned and constructed. Bischoff's plans called for each barrack to have an occupancy of 550 prisoners (one-third of the space allotted in other Nazi concentration camps). He later changed this to 744 prisoners per barrack. The SS designed the barracks not so much to house people as to <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} and weight would have {{rendered}} the tank unable to cross bridges {{at the risk of}} collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b> Though its top intended speed was 40kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels.|$|E
5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} <b>destroy</b> <b>them.</b> With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from racing {{to start a new}} life as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
