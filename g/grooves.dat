Between 10 and 20µm wide, these <b>grooves</b> indicate that hair moved repeatedly across the teeth. Inside these <b>grooves</b> were even finer <b>grooves,</b> less than 1µm, created by abrasion with the cuticular layer of the hair.|$|E

30|$|With {{the typical}} {{structure}} of a rotor spiral <b>groove,</b> the component is equipped with the function of a <b>grooved</b> cylindrical cam. The curve of the <b>groove</b> {{was designed to be}} a trade–off between a sinusoid and an exponential curve. The left and right sides of the curve intersect, and a curve connection is employed at the reverse location for a transition, forming a closed cycle. As a result, its <b>groove</b> shape is much more complicated than that of a common rotor spiral <b>groove</b> [21]. Therefore, it is of universal significance for the polishing of a rotor spiral <b>groove</b> to verify the <b>groove</b> drum.|$|R

50|$|The DNA {{double helix}} polymer of nucleic acid, held {{together}} by nucleotides which base pair together. In B-DNA, the most common double helical structure found in nature, the double helix is right-handed with about 10 - 10.5 base pairs per turn. This translates into about 20-21 nucleotides per turn. The double helix structure of DNA contains a major <b>groove</b> and minor <b>groove.</b> In B-DNA the major <b>groove</b> is wider than the minor <b>groove.</b> Given the difference in widths of the major <b>groove</b> and minor <b>groove,</b> many proteins which bind to B-DNA do so through the wider major <b>groove.</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{quantitative}} analysis of <b>groove</b> spacing on Ganymede is described. Fourier transforms {{of a large}} number of photometric profiles across <b>groove</b> sets are calculated and the resulting power spectra are examined for the position and strength of peaks representing topographic periodicities. The geographic and global statistical distribution of <b>groove</b> wavelengths are examined, and these data are related to models of <b>groove</b> tectonism. It is found that <b>groove</b> spacing on Ganymede shows an approximately long-normal distribution with a minimum of about 3. 5 km, a maximum of about 17 km, and a mean of 8. 4 km. <b>Groove</b> spacing tends to be quite regular within a single <b>groove</b> set but can vary substantially from one <b>groove</b> set to another within a single geographic region...|$|R
5|$|The rose petal's micro- and {{nanostructures}} {{are larger}} in scale {{than those of}} the lotus leaf, which allows the liquid film to impregnate the texture. However, as seen in Figure 9, the liquid can enter the larger-scale <b>grooves,</b> but it cannot enter into the smaller <b>grooves.</b> This is known as the Cassie impregnating wetting regime. Since the liquid can wet the larger-scale <b>grooves,</b> the adhesive force between the water and solid is very high. This explains why the water droplet will not fall off even if the petal is tilted at an angle or turned upside down. This effect will fail if the droplet has a volume larger than 10 µl because the balance between weight and surface tension is surpassed.|$|E

5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel <b>grooves,</b> in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel <b>grooves</b> conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E

5|$|Egyptologist and {{archaeology}} pioneer Sir Flinders Petrie {{surveyed the}} Giant, probably during the First World War, and published his {{results in a}} Royal Anthropological Institute paper in 1926.

He also notes a row of pits suggesting {{the place of the}} spine. He concludes that the Giant {{is very different from the}} Long Man of Wilmington, and that minor <b>grooves</b> may have been added from having been repeatedly cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of {{tectonics}} on Enceladus is also {{derived from}} grooved terrain, consisting of lanes of curvilinear <b>grooves</b> and ridges. These bands, first discovered by Voyager 2, often separate smooth plains from cratered regions. Grooved terrains {{such as the}} Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede. However, unlike those seen on Ganymede, grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex. Rather than parallel sets of <b>grooves,</b> these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned, chevron-shaped features. In other areas, these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running {{the length of the}} feature. Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots (125 and 750 m wide) located parallel to the narrow fractures. Currently, these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts.|$|E
5|$|However, a close {{examination}} of the excavated tracks may give a more differentiated picture. While there is agreement that the <b>grooves</b> {{in the eastern part}} were cut deliberately into the stone slabs to guide cart wheels, those in the western section are interpreted by some authors as a result of wear or do not appear at all. On the other hand, the marked cambers of this road section may point at deliberate tracks as well. Generally, varying forms of the <b>grooves</b> can also be explained by the long period of operation of the Diolkos, during which modifications and repairs must have significantly changed the appearance of the trackway.|$|E

The tests showed that larger <b>groove</b> angles resulted in lower moisture content. No consistent effect was found for <b>groove</b> pitch. The results also showed that larger compression pressure, larger sample mass and lower compression speed contributed to lower bagasse moisture for both prepared cane and bagasse samples...|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear <b>grooves</b> first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear <b>grooves</b> can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, they are among the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear <b>grooves</b> have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E
