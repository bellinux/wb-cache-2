60|$|It {{would be}} unjust to speak lightly of {{any part of}} the French Academy, without a passing remark in honour of those {{sections}} of it to which honour is due. In these sections may be included, I think, that of the arts, {{as well as that of}} the sciences. The number of respectable artists that exist in this country is perfectly astonishing. The connoisseurs, I believe, dispute the merits of the school, and ignorant as I am, in such matters, I can myself see that there is a prevalent disposition, both in statuary and painting, to sacrifice simplicity to details, and that the theatrical is sometimes mistaken for the grand; but, after admitting both these faults, and some <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>colouring,</b> there still remains a sufficient accumulation of merit, to create wonder in one, like myself, who has not had previous opportunities of ascertaining the affluence of a great nation in this respect.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{method is}} {{presented}} to detect <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> random <b>colour</b> textures which requires only a very few normal samples for unsupervised training. We decorrelate the colour image by generating three eigenchannels in each of which the surface texture image is divided into overlapping patches of various sizes. Then, a mixture model and EM is applied to reduce groupings of patches to {{a small number of}} textural exemplars, or texems. Localised defect detection is achieved by comparing the learned texems to patches in the unseen image eigenchannels...|$|R
40|$|THIS is {{an attempt}} to {{describe}} the disability in red-green blindness. It is not an account of the physiology of normal colour vision, nor of the abnormality of the cone cells of the retina in red-green blindness, nor of the genetics of the trait. It does not consider total colour blindness, or <b>colour</b> agnosia, or <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> memory. It must be remembered however that the trait is borne as a recessive on the X chromosome. We are dealing with that 6. 9 per cent, 1 in 14, of all men who have imperfect, but not absent, perception of red and green (Johnston, Cheeseman and Merrett 1957). For this purpose it is defined as inability to read the figures in the Ishihara test boo-k in good daylight as do normal individuals, and further as misinterpretation of the Ishihara figures in a way standard for the defect or defects. This test seems to identify a group of men each with a similar disability, though the disability cannot be identical because the group seems to include a few pure red blind, a few pure green blind, and a much greater number of men with lesser <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> red and green vision (Rushton, 1975). A more discriminating test would separate these groups and enable one to describe separately the disability in each...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Previous {{studies have}} shown that ophthalmologists using blue-green argon laser may suffer subtle <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> their <b>colour</b> vision. A {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> contrast sensitivity <b>in</b> the tritan <b>colour</b> confusion axis, an early manifestation of blue cone photoreceptor injury by the high energy photons of the laser, has been demonstrated and has prompted a reappraisal of laser safety in ophthalmology. Argon laser is also frequently used in scientific research, often at higher power output and for longer periods than is used in clinical practice. The scientists operating these lasers are at risk of developing similar phototoxic retinal injury. METHODS [...] The colour contrast sensitivity of 18 scientists who regularly use short wavelength argon laser was investigated. RESULTS [...] Eye protection was infrequently used and individuals had been subjected to between 580 and 7200 hours of cumulative laser exposure during the course of their research. CONCLUSION [...] The use of blue-green argon laser by the scientists investigated was not associated with a significant reduction <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> contrast sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Defects</b> causing <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> nitrogen-doped {{chemical}} vapour-deposited (CVD) diamond can {{adversely affect}} the exceptional optical, electronic and spintronic {{properties of the}} material. Several techniques were used to study these defects, namely optical absorption spectroscopy, thermoluminescence (TL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). From our studies, the <b>defects</b> causing <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> nitrogen-doped CVD diamond are clearly {{not the same as}} those causing similar <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> natural diamonds. The brown colour arises due to a featureless absorption profile that decreases in intensity with increasing wavelength, and a broad feature at 360 nm (3. 49 eV) that scales in intensity with it. Another prominent absorption band, centred at 520 nm (2. 39 eV), is ascribed to the neutral nitrogen–vacancy–hydrogen defect. The defects responsible for the brown colour possess acceptor states that are 1. 5 eV from the valence band (VB) edge. The brown colour is removed by heat treatment at 1600 [*]° C, whereupon new defects possessing shallow (< 1 eV) trap states are generated...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Dementia is {{associated}} with various alterations of the eye and visual function. Over 60 % of cases are attributable to Alzheimer's disease, {{a significant proportion of}} the remainder to vascular dementia or dementia with Lewy bodies, while frontotemporal dementia, and Parkinson's disease dementia are less common. This review describes the oculo-visual problems of these five dementias and the pathological changes which may explain these symptoms. It further discusses clinical considerations to help the clinician care for older patients affected by dementia. Recent findings: Visual problems in dementia include loss of visual acuity, <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> vision and visual masking tests, changes in pupillary response to mydriatics, <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> fixation and smooth and saccadic eye movements, changes in contrast sensitivity function and visual evoked potentials, and disturbance of complex visual functions such as in reading ability, visuospatial function, and the naming and identification of objects. Pathological changes have also been reported affecting the crystalline lens, retina, optic nerve, and visual cortex. Clinically, issues such as cataract surgery, correcting the refractive error, quality of life, falls, visual impairment and eye care for dementia have been addressed. Summary: Many visual changes occur across dementias, are controversial, often based on limited patient numbers, and no single feature can be regarded as diagnostic of any specific dementia. Nevertheless, visual hallucinations may be more characteristic of dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia than Alzheimer's disease or frontotemporal dementia. Differences in saccadic eye movement dysfunction may also help to distinguish Alzheimer's disease from frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson's disease dementia from dementia with Lewy bodies. Eye care professionals need to keep informed of the growing literature in vision/dementia, be attentive to signs and symptoms suggestive of cognitive impairment, and be able to adapt their practice and clinical interventions to best serve patients with dementia...|$|R
40|$|The texture {{analysis}} of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> fundus images is a promising tool for early glau-coma diagnosis. This paper describes model-based method for detection {{of changes in the}} RNFL. The method utilizes Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRF) and the least-square error (LSE) estimate for the local RNFL texture modelling. The model parameters are used as a texture fea-tures and non-linear classifier based on the Bayesian rule is used for classification of healthy and glaucomatous RNFL tissue. The proposed features are tested in the sense of clas-sification errors and also they are applied for segmentation of RNFL <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> a high-resolution <b>colour</b> fundus-camera images. The results are also compared with the Optical Co-herence Tomography images regarded as a gold standard for our application due to the possibility of quantitative RNFL thickness measurement. 1...|$|R

40|$|Parkinson's disease (PD) is {{a common}} {{disorder}} of middle-aged and elderly people, {{in which there is}} degeneration of the extra-pyramidal motor system. In some patients, the disease is associated with a range of visual signs and symptoms, including <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> visual acuity, <b>colour</b> vision, the blink reflex, pupil reactivity, saccadic and smooth pursuit movements and visual evoked potentials. In addition, there may be psychophysical changes, disturbances of complex visual functions such as visuospatial orientation and facial recognition, and chronic visual hallucinations. Some of the treatments associated with PD may have adverse ocular reactions. If visual problems are present, they can have an important effect on overall motor function, and quality of life of patients can be improved by accurate diagnosis and correction of such defects. Moreover, visual testing is useful in separating PD from other movement disorders with visual symptoms, such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Although not central to PD, visual signs and symptoms can be an important though obscure aspect of the disease and should not be overlooked...|$|R
40|$|AIM—To {{determine}} if the City University Tritan Test is a useful addition to visual function assessment in rural communities in northern Nigeria.  METHODS—The study was a cross sectional survey. The participants were 8394  people, aged 5  years and over, living in 37  rural communities, mesoendemic and non-endemic for onchocerciasis, in Kaduna State in northern Nigeria. The main outcome measures were the detection of a <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> blue-yellow <b>colour</b> vision by two criteria: (1) failure with the City University tritan screening plates; (2) failure with the City University grading plates to identify severe tritan defects.  RESULTS— 91 % of those aged 10  years and above could perform the test. Below this age, there were difficulties in comprehension. The test showed good inter- and intraobserver agreement. After adjustment for confounders the odds of failing the screening plates were significantly increased {{in the presence of}} optic atrophy or glaucoma (3. 55  (2. 48 - 5. 08) and 15. 9  (4. 22 - 60. 2) respectively). There was a greater increase in the adjusted odds of failing the grading plates in the presence of optic atrophy or glaucoma (5. 30  (2. 97 - 9. 45) and 8. 87  (1. 61 - 48. 7) respectively). Cataract had a smaller effect on the screening plates, adjusted odds 1. 63  (0. 95 - 2. 80).  CONCLUSION—Blue-yellow colour vision testing is a useful addition to visual function assessment in those aged 10  years and above in rural northern Nigeria, particularly in the detection of optic nerve disease.    Keywords: tritan defects; optic nerve disease; onchocerciasis; visual function assessmen...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of an imperfect interface on exchange bias (EB) properties is investigated. Within {{the framework of}} the domain state model, the EB field HEB and the coercive field HC are determined using computer simulations, and they are found to depend strongly on the details of the interface structure. This dependence is sensitive to the dilution of the antiferromagnet (AFM) with non-magnetic <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the bulk. For the optimal interface structure, giving greatest EB, the optimal dilution is found to be much less than that for an ideal-interface system, taking a value in better agreement with experimental results. Even without any <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the bulk of the AFM the interface roughness leads to EB for thin antiferromagnetic layers, in accordance with the model by Malozemoff. Finally, the thickness dependence of rough-interface systems is found to differ significantly from that of ideal-interface systems.

40|$|AIMS—Abnormalities <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> {{perception}} occur {{early in}} the development of diabetic retinopathy. Whether these changes can be influenced by increasing circulating oxygen saturation was studied in comparison with non-diabetic controls.  METHODS—Protan and tritan colour thresholds were measured using a computer graphics system in 37  insulin dependent diabetic subjects, with no or minimal background retinopathy, and 27  matched controls. Colour thresholds were performed after subjects inhaled either gaseous air or 100 % oxygen for a minimum of 5  minutes.  RESULTS—Diabetic subjects had higher colour vision thresholds when inhaling air when compared with controls (protan (mean 3. 93  (SEM 0. 39), v 2. 36  (0. 16), p< 0. 0002) and tritan (8. 15  (0. 62) v 5. 42  (0. 31), p < 0. 002)). The colour vision thresholds observed in diabetic subjects inhaling air fell when they inhaled oxygen (protan (3. 93  (0. 39) v 3. 57  (0. 33), p < 0. 025) and tritan (8. 15  (0. 62) v 7. 35  (0. 59), p< 0. 005)). No fall <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> thresholds was seen in non-diabetic controls who inhaled oxygen.  CONCLUSION—A small improvement <b>in</b> the <b>colour</b> vision thresholds was observed using computer graphics in diabetic subjects, with minimal or no retinopathy, who inhaled oxygen. This study supports a hypothesis that reduced retinal oxygenation contributes to the <b>colour</b> vision <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> diabetes. ...|$|R
