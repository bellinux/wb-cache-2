2500|$|Nina Arkadyevna Shatskaya {{was born}} in Rybinsk to the jazz musician, singer and {{conductor}} Arkady Shatsky. It was in his band Raduga (Радуга, Rainbow) that she has made her singing debut. A strict disciplinarian (who for many years was unwilling to support her ambition to become a professional singer), he proved in retrospect to be a perfect mentor and a major inspiration. [...] "I {{was kind of a}} homely girl; I liked to knit and sew. Besides, I was overweight. All this irritated him immensely: he was sure this way I'd turn out fat, lazy and stupid. He criticized me mercilessly but somehow managed to help me shape up with this criticism. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to prove I was worthy of his praise," [...] she later remembered.|$|E
2500|$|For reasons I never understood, some {{friction}} {{developed between}} President Hoover and my friend, Governor Landon, {{who had a}} summer place in Evergreen, Colorado....I {{was in and out}} of Colorado during the summers and visited frequently with Governor Landon. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to get him and the President together in hopes of bringing about a reconciliation that would benefit them personally and the Republican Party. All of us were at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs for a meeting, which I saw as an opportunity to get them together ... for dinner, but whatever undercurrent existed remained, and they continued to be cool toward each other. President Hoover was one of the great Americans of this century. He was competent, compassionate, and a man of unequaled qualifications. The country paid an awful price when he was sacrificed by political caprice.|$|E
2500|$|Paul and Clara adopted Jobs's sister Patricia in 1957 and {{the family}} moved to Mountain View, California in 1961. It was during this time that Paul built a {{workbench}} in his garage for his son in order to [...] "pass along his love of mechanics." [...] Jobs, meanwhile, admired his father's craftsmanship [...] "because he knew how to build anything. If we needed a cabinet, he would build it. When he built our fence, he gave me a hammer so I could work with him ... I wasn't that into fixing cars ... but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to hang out with my dad." [...] By the time he was ten, Jobs was deeply involved in electronics and befriended many of the engineers who lived in the neighborhood. He had difficulty making friends with children his own age, however, and was seen by his classmates as a [...] "loner." ...|$|E

60|$|Myself, I was amazed. For {{here was}} a Lord Giovanni I seemed never to have known, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to behold the sequel to so fine a prologue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Once <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{to persuade}} {{you to come}} to church to hear me; will you think it strange if I ask you not to come on this occasion?" ...|$|E
60|$|Not {{without a}} severe mental {{struggle}} did I decide to smother my pride and follow Paul's advice; but once having settled upon {{a course of}} action, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to pursue it.|$|E
60|$|Jerry and <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>eager</b> to land, and, {{without even}} {{stopping}} to thank Jim {{for the news}} he brought, we went over the rail into our canoe, pulling in hot haste for the shore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, Sir Patrick. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{more than}} ready, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> to go on. No words can say how anxious <b>I</b> feel to <b>be</b> of some use to you, if I can. It rests entirely with your {{experience}} {{to show me}} how." ...|$|R
6000|$|With instant {{perception}} of my {{wish to have}} him know my future wife, he replied, [...] "My dear fellow, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> to meet her. Perhaps my gray hairs will excuse your bringing her to call upon me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{to make my}} {{way toward}} {{that part of the}} village where the horses of Simcoe's Rangers were stabled, hoping I might get a glimpse of poor little Silver Heels, and, therefore, not averse to {{following}} the old negro's advice.|$|E
60|$|It did {{not take}} me long to dress after Captain Flagg made the {{announcement}} that the jolly-boat had been sighted. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{to find out how}} the occupants had fared, and what Mr. Henshaw, the government officer, would do with them.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} have stopped him, for he was off before I had time to so much as open my mouth, and there I stood leaning against the canoe, giving the people of Benedict to believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to be {{fighting}} for my country.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm {{afraid for}} daddy. I'm sure he wounded one of them, {{and if he}} did they may follow us. You are very good and brave, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> to reach the train. I want to get away." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> {{enough to}} go, so I went with him, and left Captain Merlotte {{to go back}} to the tent to my patron, the Spaniard, and the Spanish doctor, who had not so much share in the curiosity; he did so, and they {{followed}} soon after.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to {{be alone}} with Mary; yet it was not till after supper, and then but for a short while, that I could have a word with her. I lost no time beating about the bush, but spoke out plainly what was on my mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said he, [...] "here {{is a fine}} soldier lost to glory." [...] And as he spoke, he half {{turned to}} a young man who sat beside him, a man at whom <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to take a fuller look, for his face was most strangely {{familiar}} to me.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am glad of that. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{afraid you}} might think me unsympathetic, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here this morning to offer you my cordial assistance, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>eager</b> to see this people put into art.

60|$|He {{left the}} room abruptly, as if he dare not trust himself to say more. It is better not to dwell on what I felt after this last repulse. I ordered the {{carriage}} at once. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to find a refuge from my own thoughts in movement and change.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no reason}} why we should linger under the old wharf, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to be alone {{despite the fact that}} I craved Hiram's companionship, for it seemed as if I must work out some scheme by which it would be {{possible}} to prevent Seth Jepson from playing us false.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Draper {{had heard}} of the circumstance. [...] "Bad news travel quick, Mr. Warrington," [...] he said; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to offer my humble {{services}} as soon as ever you should require them.

6000|$|... "That I've {{still to}} discover. You inform me that Hucks is eager {{for money and}} acts like a miser.

60|$|In {{order that}} Seth should not believe <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>eager</b> to leave him, I loitered in the {{vicinity}} a full half hour talking of this and that which was of no particular importance, except that all the while I strove to trap the lad into betraying his traitorous desire, if so be he had one, by some hasty word.|$|E
6000|$|... "Among {{them was}} a {{collection}} of celebrated Trials. I thought of my grandfather; consulted the index; and, finding his name there, bought the work.

60|$|We {{were not}} rich tourists, {{and we all}} took lodgings in a small hotel to which we had been recommended.
