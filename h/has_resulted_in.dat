5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> an increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> an increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E

5|$|Although the Environment Agency {{have made}} {{plans for the}} regular winter flooding, still in recent years this <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a number of villages— {{including}} Langport, Muchelney and Westonzoyland — being cut off. In November 2012, during the 2012 Great Britain and Ireland floods, after six days Somerset County Council-funded BARB rescue boats reached Muchelney on 29 November, rescuing nearly 100 people.|$|E
50|$|The short-haul {{operation}} {{was to have}} brand-new aircraft as well, which would <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> replacing BCal's ageing BAC One-Eleven 500s with the new Boeing 737-300s Air Europe had on order. It would also <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> adopting the Air Europe short-haul inflight product.|$|R

5|$|As B.menziesii is not {{similar to}} any other Banksia, hybrids are {{unlikely}} to occur. The only reported hybrid is a sterile hybrid with B.hookeriana (Hooker's banksia), found north of Badgingarra by Greg Keighery. Manual cross-fertilisation with B.attenuata <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> germination, indicating that these two species are genetically compatible, but natural hybrids are extremely unlikely because the two species flower at different times.|$|E
5|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} {{is among}} the most common complications of prematurely born infants and its incidence has grown as the survival of extremely premature infants has increased. Nevertheless, the severity has decreased as better management of supplemental oxygen <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> the disease now being related mainly to factors other than hyperoxia.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{examples}} are {{found at the}} Banff townsite proper: Mount Rundle is a classic dip slope mountain. Just {{to the north of}} the Banff townsite, Castle Mountain is composed of numerous Cambrian age rock formations. The uppermost section of the peak consists of relatively harder dolomite from the Eldon Formation. Below that lies the less dense shales of the Stephen Formation and the lowest exposed cliffs are limestones of the Cathedral Formation. Dogtooth mountains, such as Mount Louis, exhibit sharp, jagged slopes. The Sawback Range, which consists of nearly vertical dipping sedimentary layers, has been eroded by cross gullies. The erosion of these almost vertical layers of rock strata in the Sawback Range <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> formations that appear like the teeth on a saw blade. Erosion and deposition of higher elevation rock layers <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> scree deposits at the lowest elevations of many of the mountains.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, taro-production {{shortages}} (resulting from {{pests and}} labor shortages) <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> {{higher prices for}} poi in Hawaii. At the same time, innovations <b>in</b> poi production <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> poi that stays fresh longer and tastes sweeter. However, such products generally sell at a premium price and require refrigeration.|$|R

50|$|The {{numerous}} {{habitat types}} <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> high species diversity.|$|R
5|$|Despite harsh conditions, the {{vegetation}} {{on the island}} is fairly diverse. Following the island's grazing ban, vegetation has become very thick and <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> it becoming {{a breeding ground for}} waterfowl. There is large reed bed in the small lagoon area.|$|E
5|$|Dioxins from Agent Orange have {{persisted in}} the Vietnamese {{environment}} since the war, settling {{in the soil}} and sediment and entering the food chain through animals and fish which feed in the contaminated areas. The movement of dioxins through the food web <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> bioconcentration and biomagnification. The areas most heavily contaminated with dioxins are former U.S. air bases.|$|E
5|$|Extensive {{deforestation}} <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> loss {{of trees}} such as acacias, baobab, dates and palm trees. This has also caused loss of natural habitat for wild animals; {{one of the}} main reasons for this is also hunting and livestock farming by increasing human settlements. Populations of animals like lions, leopards and rhino have fallen significantly.|$|E

5000|$|On June 1970, Rogers {{initiated}} a ceasefire plan, {{sometimes called the}} second rogers plan Egypt accepted the ceasefire plan. Israel eventually accepted it, which <b>had</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> the right-wing Gahal party leaving Golda Meir's government in August 1970. The acceptance <b>had</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> the August 7, 1970, [...] "in place" [...] cease-fire.|$|R

5|$|Geothermal {{activity}} and the emission of volcanic gases are ongoing, and the volcano has been prospected {{for the possibility of}} obtaining geothermal energy. The geothermal activity <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> widespread rock alteration and the formation of sulfur deposits, which were mentioned in a 1909 report and later mined. Koh-i-Sultan also has deposits of other minerals.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these natural attractions, human involvement in the area is also responsible for making tourism {{a large part of}} the regional economy. Every year, around 6.5—7million people visit the Zenkō-ji Buddhist template in Nagano. It is believed that visiting the template will grant salvation. This <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> the head temple of the Tendai sect being a significant attraction for tourists throughout its 1,400-year history.|$|E
5|$|In early June 2013 Hezbollah has now {{committed}} {{fighters to}} the battle in Aleppo, some 2,000, reportedly putting strain on the organisation. This <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> Hezbollah introducing a change to its rotation policy for its fighters from 7 days fighting followed by 7 days leave, Hezbollah has increased it to 20 days fighting and followed by 7 days leave for its fighters.|$|E
50|$|While many events <b>have</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> {{arrests for}} minor misdemeanors, {{the general public}} and news media have taken {{increasing}} notice of their activities and <b>have</b> often <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> responses made by congressional leaders with some local success.|$|R

5|$|John Knight Bostock {{says that}} {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} that the Fulla may at one time have been an aspect of Frigg. As a result, this notion <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> theory that a similar situation may have existed between the figures of the goddesses Sinthgunt and Sunna, in that the two may have been understood as aspects of one another rather than entirely separate figures.|$|E
5|$|Renewed popular {{interest}} in Old Polish cuisine <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> reprints being made {{since the turn}} of the 21st century, including a limited bibliophile edition of 500 numbered leather-bound volumes published in 2002 in Jędrzejów. In 2009, the Wilanów Palace Museum in Warsaw published a critical edition with a broad introduction by food historian Jarosław Dumanowski presenting Czerniecki's life and work.|$|E

The effort indicates the strength of and commitment to the unique shared heritage present in the towns. This restoration <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> a revival of local traditions and a qualified workforce.|$|E
