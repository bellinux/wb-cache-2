50|$|In the United States, an interagency <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew</b> (IHC), {{or simply}} <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew,</b> is a Type 1 handcrew of 20 firefighters {{specially}} trained in wildfire suppression tactics. Hotshot crews are considered an elite group among wildland firefighters, {{due to their}} extensive training, high physical fitness standards, and ability to undertake difficult, dangerous, and stressful assignments. They often respond to large, high-priority fires and are trained and equipped to work in remote areas for {{extended periods of time}} with little logistical support.|$|E

50|$|As an interagency resource, <b>hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> can be {{requested}} {{to respond to}} wildland fire incidents in any jurisdiction. As of 2009, there are 107 IHCs in operation in the United States, organized by diverse {{agencies such as the}} United States Forest Service, National Park Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Land Management, as well as state, county, and city governments. The National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho coordinates <b>Hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> on the national level.|$|R
50|$|On July 6, 1994, nine {{members of}} a <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew</b> based in Prineville, Oregon, died after being {{overtaken}} by the fast-moving Storm King fire west of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Five other firefighters, three smokejumpers and two helitack firefighters, also died in the conflagration.|$|E
50|$|On June 30, 2013, {{nineteen}} {{members of}} the Prescott Fire Department were killed fighting the Yarnell Hill Fire. The fatalities were {{members of the}} Granite Mountain Hotshots, a <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew,</b> of whom only one survived as they were working in another location.|$|E
50|$|Sipchen {{was born}} in Chicago. He paid his way through college as a interagency <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew</b> {{firefighter}} and patrolman with the U.S. Forest Service. He graduated with a B.A. in 1976 from the University of California, Santa Barbara, which granted him the school's Distinguished Alumni Award in 2006.|$|E
50|$|While not {{fighting}} fires, <b>hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> typically {{work in their}} home units to meet resource goals such as thinning, prescribed fire operations, habitat improvement, and trail construction projects. <b>Hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> can also respond to other emergency incidents, including search and rescue and disaster response. For example, in 2009 the Cherokee IHC was assigned to clear trees downed by rare tornadoes in Prospect Park and Kissena Park in New York City, their first employment in an urban setting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> {{are known}} for their {{extensive}} training, and are expected to display proficiency in the full range of fire suppression tactics. Like other handcrews, IHCs are primarily tasked with constructing, firing out, and holding handline, through the use of chainsaws, hand tools, ignition devices, and water delivery equipment. <b>Hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> can engage in all phases of wildfire response, from initial attack to mop-up. They are also trained in specialized operations, such as hot spotting, spot fire attack, tree felling, and structure protection.|$|R

5000|$|In 1980, {{the term}} [...] "Interagency Hotshot Crew" [...] {{was adopted by}} all IRFS crews. In the mid-1990s, an Interagency <b>Hotshot</b> <b>Crew</b> Operations Guide was {{developed}} to standardize the training, responsibilities, and recognition process of IHCs. The number of IHCs has grown to 107 as of 2009, with crews sponsored by diverse federal, state, tribal, and local agencies.|$|E
50|$|The Granite Mountain Hotshots were a group {{within the}} {{department}} whose mission was to fight wildfires. Founded in 2002 as a fuels mitigation crew, it transitioned to a handcrew (Type 2 I/A) in 2004, and ultimately to a <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew</b> in 2008. The crew had their own fire station, station 7, where equipment was housed including two 10-person crew carriers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> {{trace their}} history to Southern California {{in the late}} 1940s on the Cleveland and Angeles National Forest. The term [...] "hotshot" [...] comes from their having been {{assigned}} to the hottest parts of the fire. In American English, the term also connotes [...] "a person who is conspicuously talented or successful".|$|R
50|$|The National Interagency Fire Center {{hosts the}} National Interagency Coordination Center (NICC). NICC's primary {{responsibility}} is positioning and managing national resources (i.e. <b>Hotshot</b> <b>Crews,</b> smokejumpers, air tankers, incident management teams, National Caterers, mobile shower units, and command repeaters). NICC {{also serves as}} clearing house for the dispatch ordering system. Reporting to NICC are 10 Geographic Area Coordination Centers (Alaska, Great Basin, Northern Rockies, Rocky Mountains, Southern California, Northern California, Eastern, Southern, and Southwest). Under each GACC are several dispatch zones.|$|R
5000|$|On July 2, {{more than}} 3,000 people {{attended}} a public memorial service at an indoor stadium in Prescott Valley. Vice President Joe Biden, Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, and the team's lone surviving firefighter, Brendan McDonough, {{spoke at a}} memorial in Prescott on Tuesday, July 9, 2013. That memorial was attended by thousands, including representatives from over 100 <b>hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> across the country, and was streamed live by several media outlets. [...] Individual memorial services were scheduled for later in the hometowns of the 19 firefighters.|$|R
50|$|On June 30, 19 firefighters {{with the}} Prescott Fire Department's interagency Granite Mountain Hotshots were overrun {{and killed by}} the fire. Initial reports {{indicated}} {{that one of the}} firefighters was {{not a member of the}} <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew,</b> but Prescott Fire Chief Dan Fraijo later confirmed that all 19 were from the Granite Mountain Hotshots. The firefighters had apparently deployed fire shelters, but not all of the bodies were found inside them. The city of Prescott released the names of the 19 firefighters on July 1.|$|E

50|$|Born in Western Montana as a fifth {{generation}} {{descendant of}} Swedish homesteaders, Nelson {{grew up on}} a small farm {{at the foot of the}} Bob Marshall Wilderness. Upon graduating high school, he enlisted in the US Navy and served four years as a guided missile technician. After completing his service, he enrolled in Montana State University, working summers as a fire guard and hotshot with the National Interagency <b>Hotshot</b> <b>Crew.</b> Nelson received his Bachelor of Architecture in from Montana State University as a member of the Delta Phi Delta Art and Architecture Honorary Society. He continued to study architecture and ceramic design at the Technical University and Ateneum Fine Arts Academy in Finland, and received a Master of Architecture from the University of California under Christopher Alexander. At the University of California he continued to study the interface of systems thinking and design and received his Ph.D. with distinction in 1979. His dissertation focused on a systems approach to the impact on rural communities of large-scale resource development projects with an emphasis on value distribution assessment.|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesTo {{assess the}} {{association}} between exposure, oxidative stress, symptoms, and cardiorespiratory function in wildland firefighters.

An oxidative stress score comprising the average of z-scores created for 8 -OHdG and 8 -isoprostane was calculated. ResultsMean augmentation index...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{effectively}} perform their duties, Hotshots must maintain {{a high level}} of physical fitness. Whenever they are not on a fire assignment, crews devote at least one hour a day to physical training (PT). This training can include steep hikes, weight lifting, and long-distance runs. Traditionally, 5- to 10-mile runs were the favored PT for <b>hotshot</b> <b>crews.</b> Recently, there has been a shift towards more hiking. On these hikes, Hotshots may climb without stopping for over an hour while carrying upwards of 60 lbs. in gear and tools.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least one}} of the first crews {{carrying}} the name [...] "hotshots" [...] grew out of a former CCC camp in the San Bernardino National Forest in Southern California. Conflicting sources report the first <b>hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> as starting in 1946 (Del Rosa and Los Padres Hotshots) or 1947 (Del Rosa and El Cariso Hotshots). In 1961, the Interregional Fire Suppression (IRFS) program was developed, establishing six 30-man crews across the Western U.S. These IRFS crews were stationed near airports for quick transportation to high-priority fires. Due to their effectiveness and value in fire management, the program expanded to 19 IRFS crews by 1974.|$|R
50|$|On August 11, a {{total of}} 348 people were working to {{extinguish}} the fire, who had four helicopters, nine fire engines, and one bulldozer to their disposal. Moreover, the firefighters were assisted by a DC-10 Air Tanker, that dropped fire retardant on the Strawberry Fire, the next day. During the following days, the Strawberry Fire started to grow less fast, and the containment rate increased. While fighting the Strawberry Fire, a firefighter of the Lolo Hotshots, a <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew</b> of the U.S. Forest Service based in Montana, lost his life after a tree fell on him on August 13. The U.S. Forest Service started an investigation to his death as a result. He was honored by dozens of firefighters and police officers on August 17 at a funeral procession between a Las Vegas funeral home and North Las Vegas Airport after a private memorial service was held. Afterwards, his body was flown to his hometown, Bellows Falls, Vermont, where another memorial service was held. A third memorial service was held in Missoula, Montana.|$|E

Except {{for a couple of}} seasons as a <b>hotshot</b> <b>crew</b> member followed by another season with the Forest Service in wilderness fuel inventory capped off by some slash burning, all that time has been spent in fire research. Even as a wildland fire researcher, I’ve kept actively involved in observing and analyzing free-burning wildfires over the years, and I’ve occasion-ally served as an operational fire behavior specialist on major fires and multifire incidents in north-ern Alberta and the Northwest Territories. This focused fire background has helped me under-stand that wildland fires are not always easily observed, monitored, explained, or documented.

5000|$|The Carpenter 1 Fire {{was a large}} {{wildfire}} on Mount Charleston, [...] {{northwest of}} Las Vegas, Nevada. The fire began on July 1, 2013 near Pahrump, Nevada, before spreading eastward. Carpenter 1 was seen for miles across the Las Vegas metropolitan area, and was the largest fire to occur on Mount Charleston in decades. After eight weeks of battling the fire, Carpenter 1 was fully contained on August 18, 2013. [...] The fire consumed nearly 28000 acre, causing parts of Nevada State Route 156 and 157 to be closed, resulting in the evacuation of residents and closure of businesses and portions of the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area. The fire, stretching between 5000 - 11000 ft elevations, was fought by hundreds of firefighters and eight <b>Hotshot</b> <b>crews,</b> as well helicopters, fire engines, water tenders, and a DC-10 tanker plane. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, the Carpenter 1 fire was considered [...] "the highest ranked priority fire in the nation" [...] {{at the time of}} its occurrence.|$|R
5000|$|On July 9, {{the fire}} grew to over 10000 acre and began moving towards lightly {{populated}} areas outside of Kasilof and Soldotna. More resources {{were ordered to}} protect these areas. By June 11, over 400 persons were fighting the fire, and <b>hotshot</b> <b>crews</b> and bulldozers were utilized to create fire breaks. Air tankers and helicopters were also used to dump water and fire retardant near homes threatened by the fire. A temporary [...] "tent city" [...] was established at Skyview High School to house firefighters and support staff, and a no fly zone was established around the fire area. Smoke from the fire and others blazing simultaneously in Interior Alaska contributed to a visible haze of smoke over Anchorage and much of south-central Alaska. Fire managers began to take crews off the fire and reassign them after light but sustained rain fell on the fire for several days starting on July 18. By July 21, the fire had stopped expanding, and around 200 staff remained at the fire to monitor and conduct mop-up operations of remaining hot spots near populated areas.|$|R

50|$|Drought {{conditions}} {{throughout the}} state of Washington resulted in many devastating wildfires throughout 2015. On June 29th, 2015, lightning sparked a fire in Wolverine Creek, which expanded toward Lucerne and {{became part of the}} Chelan Complex fire, resulting in the evacuation of the Village (residents, guests, and mine remediation workers) on August 1st and 2nd, just before the fire cut off road access. A small crew of 4-5 Villagers remained behind to tend the fire defense sprinklers (which operated 24 hours a day using river water), serve meals to the <b>hotshot</b> firefighter <b>crews</b> working in the nearby mountains, protect the wooden structures from falling embers, and assist with cutting and clearing a protective burn ring around the Village and mine remediation site. The Chelan Complex Fire continued to spread downlake, resulting in the evacuation of the Holden Bed & Breakfast and Lake House on August 15th and threatening the cities of Chelan and Manson. By August 28th the fire had moved on enough to allow some staff members to return, and on September 7th all Villagers were cleared to return.|$|R
5000|$|On Friday, April 16, 2016, a 200 acre {{forest fire}} was first {{reported}} in Shenandoah National Park in the U.S. state of Virginia. The fire {{originated in the}} area around Rocky Mount, a mountain in the south district of the park, in a remote region south of Elkton, Virginia. The fire was west of Skyline Drive, the scenic byway that runs through the park. By April 17, the fire had spread to over 500 acre, prompting closures of Skyline Drive from mile markers 65 at Swift Run Gap to 79 at Loft Mountain. Additionally, more than a dozen hiking trails were closed, including a section of the Appalachian Trail. By Monday April 18, officials reported that the fire had spread to over 2000 acre and that a Type 1 incident management team (highest priority) and several <b>hotshot</b> firefighting <b>crews</b> had been dispatched to address the situation. By Wednesday April 20, more than 200 firefighters were on scene or en route, supported by two helicopters carrying water buckets and eight fire engines. National Park Service officials reported on the morning of April 20 that the fire had spread to 4000 acre and that 250 firefighting personnel were engaged in establishing firelines in an effort to control the blaze. By that evening, officials had reported that the fire had expanded to roughly 5616 acre and that at mile marker 76 on Skyline Drive, the fire had crossed the road and burned another 80 to 100 acre. The fire was only 1 percent contained and full containment was not anticipated until April 30 because of ongoing weather conditions favoring fire growth. By the evening of Thursday, April 21, the fire had expanded to 7935 acre and more than 300 firefighting and support personnel had been assigned to the fire. The fire expanded to 8952 acre and 342 firefighters were assigned to the fire by the evening of April 22. Skyline Drive road closure was extended further south to mile 87 on April 22. By the evening of April 24, the fire had expanded slightly from the previous day to 9386 acre. The fire was 60 percent contained and 356 firefighting and support personnel were assigned to the fire. On April 25, total acreage burned expanded to 10376 acre, partly due to back burn efforts to burn out vegetation {{in the path of the}} main fire. The back-burn was created by dropping [...] "ping pong balls" [...] from a helicopter; these are spheres the size of a ping pong ball filled with a flammable substance that ignites as they impact the ground. On April 28 the fire was 90 percent contained and rainfall and fog made for difficult fireline work for the firefighters, however the fire was deemed to be well within containment lines and a third of the firefighting personnel were demobilizing. Mop up of firelines and rehabilitation of trails and natural resources was expected to continue until May 3. The final figure for acreage burned was determined to be 10326 acre; the second largest forest fire in the history of Shenadoah National Park. On April 29 the fire was fully contained and while most hiking trails that has been closed to public access would remain closed for a few more days, Skyline Drive was reopened to public vehicular traffic. Smoke from the fire was reportedly visible in satellite imagery, drifting southeast and causing smoke haze over portions of central Virginia. The cause of the fire is unknown, but officials report it is likely human-caused. The fire's expansion has mainly been caused by relatively hot and dry conditions compounded by low humidity levels and moderate to occasionally gusty winds. Smoke from the fire that was drifting to the southeast on April 19 shifted to the northwest on the 20th and again to the northeast on the 21st, spreading particulates into the air over Washington, D.C.. The wind shift was due to an approaching weather front that brought only [...] of rain. To accommodate hikers attempting to use the Appalachian Trail, a shuttle service was set up to run every hour during normal business hours for the duration of the fire and trail closure. A no fly zone was also enacted, including prohibiting private drones from flying anywhere near the fire. The fire burned a region that has not previously experienced a fire since the creation of the park, so the area was full of dead and down wood, deep duff and overgrowth that was overdue for a large fire.|$|R
