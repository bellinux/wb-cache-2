Other regular tunings include all-fourths, augmented-fourths, and all-fifths tunings. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and advanced players' improvisation.|$|E

5|$|Samson went out, {{gathered}} 300 foxes, {{and tied}} {{them together in}} pairs by their tails. He then attached a burning torch to <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why Samson burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E
5|$|The Ignudi, {{although}} all seated, are less physically constrained than the Ancestors of Christ. While the pairs of the monochrome {{male and female}} figures above the spandrels are mirrors of each other, these Ignudi are all different. In the earliest paintings, they are paired, their poses being similar but with variation. These variations become greater with <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> until the postures of the final four bear no relation to each other whatsoever.|$|E

The officers berthed {{in the rear of}} the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|Built in 1897, it {{is a rare}} {{surviving}} {{example of}} a late Victorian orangery in the Classical style, constructed from ashlar and red brick. It has a seven-bay east/west plan with central entrances and three bays north/south, topped by a fully glazed ironwork hipped-roof. An entablature with protruding horizontal geison sits above Ionic half-column supports and corner pilasters. The centre entrance bay on the west front towards the kitchen garden breaks forward as a portico, with pairs of giant engaged columns and broken pediment with a small oculus. Between <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of columns are large round-headed windows with Gibbs surrounds and keystones.|$|E
5|$|<b>Each</b> <b>pair</b> of antennas was {{connected}} to a motorized switch that rapidly switched between the pairs, a technique known as lobe switching. Both signals were then sent to a cathode ray tube (CRT) for display, {{with one of them}} passing through a voltage inverter. If the target was to the left, the display would show a longer blip on the left than the right. When the target was dead ahead, the blips would be equal length. There was an inherently limited accuracy to such a solution, about five degrees but it was a practical solution in terms of limiting the antenna sizes.|$|E

5|$|Gender roles, {{especially}} {{the figure of}} the ideal woman, are central to La Cousine Bette. The four leading female characters (Bette, Valérie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. <b>Each</b> <b>pair</b> of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Valérie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.|$|E
5|$|In a real vector space, a {{non-empty}} setQ {{is defined}} to be convex if, for <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of its points, every {{point on the}} line segment that joins them is a subset ofQ. For example, a solid disk is convex but a circle is not, {{because it does not}} contain a line segment joining its points; the non-convex set of three integers{0,1,2} is contained in the interval, which is convex. For example, a solid cube is convex; however, anything that is hollow or dented, for example, a crescent shape, is non-convex. The emptyset is convex, either by definition or vacuously, depending on the author.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of injury to the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} injury to the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E

5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
5|$|Noisy {{binary search}} {{algorithms}} solve {{the case where}} the algorithm cannot reliably compare elements of the array. For <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of elements, {{there is a certain}} probability that the algorithm makes the wrong comparison. Noisy binary search can find the correct position of the target with a given probability that controls the reliability of the yielded position. The noisy binary search problem can be considered as a case of the Rényi-Ulam game, which Alfréd Rényi introduced in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Plastromancy: The {{earliest}} use of turtle shells {{comes from}} the archaeological site in Jiahu site. The shells, containing small pebbles of various size, colour and quantity, were drilled with small holes, suggesting that <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of them was tied together originally. Similar finds have also {{been found in the}} Dawenkou burial sites of about 4000–3000 BC, as well as in Henan, Sichuan, Jiangsu and Shaanxi. The turtle-shell shakers for the most part are made of the shell of land turtles, identified as Cuora flavomarginata. Archaeologists believe that these shells were used either as rattles in ceremonial dances, shamantic healing tools or ritual paraphernalia for divinational purposes.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{applications}} of 2-satisfiability {{have been made}} for other geometric placement problems. In graph drawing, if the vertex locations are fixed and each edge must be drawn as a circular arc with one of two possible locations (for instance as an arc diagram), then the problem of choosing which arc to use for each edge {{in order to avoid}} crossings is a 2-satisfiability problem with a variable for each edge and a constraint for <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> of placements that would lead to a crossing. However, in this case it is possible to speed up the solution, compared to an algorithm that builds and then searches an explicit representation of the implication graph, by searching the graph implicitly.|$|E

It {{was cast in}} 1603 and is the largest bronze gun in Malaysia. In front of the dolphin handles is a decorative band featuring three pairs of heraldic lions with long, spiralling tails. <b>Each</b> <b>pair</b> faces a vase containing flowers. Between the handles and the Dutch East India Company's seal is a Javi inscription, inlaid with silver, celebrating the gun's capture in 1613. The base ring is incised with the gunsmith's signature and date of manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnetic}} field produced by an atom—its magnetic moment—is determined by these {{various forms of}} angular momentum, just as a rotating charged object classically produces a {{magnetic field}}. However, the most dominant contribution comes from electron spin. Due {{to the nature of}} electrons to obey the Pauli exclusion principle, in which no two electrons may be found in the same quantum state, bound electrons pair up with each other, with one member of <b>each</b> <b>pair</b> in a spin up state and the other in the opposite, spin down state. Thus these spins cancel each other out, reducing the total magnetic dipole moment to zero in some atoms with even number of electrons.|$|E
