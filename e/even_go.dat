5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, <b>even</b> <b>go</b> so far as to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E

25|$|After the 1965 India-Pakistan War, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Foreign {{minister}} at that time, began {{to lobby for}} a nuclear weapons option. 'If India builds the bomb, we will eat grass or leaves, <b>even</b> <b>go</b> hungry, but we will get one of our own. We have no other choice'. 'In October 1965, Bhutto visited Vienna to attend the International Atomic Energy Agency meeting. While there, he met with Munir Ahmad Khan, and other Pakistani scientists working at IAEA. Pakistani IAEA scientists briefed Bhutto on the rapid development of Indian nuclear programme. According to Munir Ahmad Khan, the nuclear facility at Trombay consisted of a plutonium production reactor, a reprocessing plant, and other facilities associated to weapon production. Bhutto quickly arranged a meeting with Ayub Khan. After this meeting, Ayub Khan remained unconvinced, and rejected the proposal made by Munir Ahmad Khan. Khan notified Bhutto immediately and told him about what had happened.|$|E
25|$|A {{challenge}} {{most critical}} to analog IC design involves {{the variability of}} the individual devices built on the semiconductor chip. Unlike board-level circuit design which permits the designer to select devices that have each been tested and binned according to value, the device values on an IC can vary widely which are uncontrollable by the designer. For example, some IC resistors can vary ±20% and β of an integrated BJT can vary from 20 to 100. In the latest CMOS processes, β of vertical PNP transistors can <b>even</b> <b>go</b> below 1. To add to the design challenge, device properties often vary between each processed semiconductor wafer. Device properties can even vary significantly across each individual IC due to doping gradients. The underlying cause of this variability is that many semiconductor devices are highly sensitive to uncontrollable random variances in the process. Slight changes {{to the amount of}} diffusion time, uneven doping levels, etc. can have large effects on device properties.|$|E

He ruled the Romans with great leadership and splendor."

500|$|While most critics {{agree that}} the Boom started {{some time in the}} 1960s, there is some {{disagreement}} as to which work should be considered the first Boom novel.

[...] Fernando Alegria considers Augusto Roa Bastos' Hijo de hombre the inaugural work of the Boom even though, as Shaw notes, [...] "it was published in 1959."

However, the two soon resume their relationship with each other.

She feels Shuichi is an interesting person, and once says Shuichi is like a cute little sister. Anna spends {{a lot of money on}} clothes, and enjoys modifying them.|$|E

500|$|The Postman Always Rings Twice {{became a}} major box office success, which {{prompted}} the studio to take more risks on Turner, casting her outside of the glamorous sex symbol roles {{she had come to}} be known for. In August 1946, it was announced Turner was set to replace Katharine Hepburn in the big-budgeted historical drama Green Dolphin Street (1947), a role for which she darkened her hair and lost 15 pounds. It was Carey Wilson who insisted on casting Turner based on her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice. Turner later recalled she was surprised about replacing Hepburn, saying: [...] "I'm about the most un-Hepburnish actress on the lot. But it was just what I wanted to do." [...] It was her first starring role that did not center on her looks. In an interview, Turner said: [...] "I <b>even</b> <b>go</b> running around in the jungles of New Zealand in a dress that's filthy and ragged. I don't wear any make-up and my hair's a mess."

[...] That same year, Joe Martin of Bit-tech ranked Dogmeat as the sixth top PC game NPC of all time, commenting: [...] "There are a lot of computer game characters we like and a few we’d <b>even</b> <b>go</b> {{so far as to say}} we love. Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, just so he could stand a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: Though your needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong provided you protect him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011. Dogmeat was included in numerous lists of best video game dogs, including by Lisa Foiles of The Escapist in 2010, Michael Perry of PlayStation Official Magazine in 2012, Gergo Vas of Kotaku in 2013, and Benjamin Abbott of Metro, Brian Taylor of Paste, and the staff of Bild in 2014.

In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. Cassie becomes hospitalized and escapes to find Daniel to tell him she was driving, but is soon re-admitted. During the May 24 episode, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Case also found taping the scenes devastating: [...] "It was too real for Joshua and me to <b>even</b> <b>go</b> through it. We did it in one take. [...] The scene is still devastating in my mind and Joshua’s. [...] It’s almost not watchable. [...] If it comes on, I can’t get through it". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. According to Case, when Sharon loses something in her life it [...] "reminds her and reactivates Cassie’s death for her". After Nick cheats on Sharon following Cassie's death, Case said it [...] "makes you so fearful {{that you are going to}} be alone for the rest of your life; that no matter what you go out in life to create, it’s going to be ruined anyway". The actress also believed that Sharon lost her identity after Cassie's death.
