In the forging process, the procedures must be strictly followed; the forging temperature must be strictly controlled with the temperature difference not exceeding 300  °C. After forging, the forging part must be normalized under more than 950  °C and tempered less than 600  °C to eliminate forging stress and improve cutting performance. After a rough-machining of the gear blank, each part underwent an ultrasonic <b>defect</b> <b>check.</b> A grinding undercut large radius hob {{was used for}} gear grinding to increase gear root fillet, and improve the impact resistance and bearing capacity of gears. In the carburizing and quenching heat treatment process, the carbon potential concentrations were strictly controlled at 0.8  %– 1.0  %.

All gears were ground in high precision grinding machine NILES, and some of the key components, such as planetary gear and sun gear, were under tip relief operation. At the same time, the accuracy of gear machining was one level higher than the specified level on the drawings to ensure a good meshing of the gears. The ground gears were treated by strengthened shot blast to eliminate the burns on the tooth surface and increase residual compressive stress, thereby enhancing the gear’s contact fatigue strength and bending fatigue strength.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTools {{based on}} static {{analysis}} {{can be used}} to find defects in programs. Tools that do shallow analyses based on pattern matching have existed since the 1980 's and although they can analyze large programs they have the drawback of producing a massive amount of warnings that have to be manually analyzed to see if they are real defects or not. Recent technology advances has brought forward tools that do deeper analyses that discover more defects and produce a limited amount of false warnings. These tools can still handle large industrial applications with millions lines of code. This article surveys the underlying supporting technology of three state-of-the-art static analysis tools. The survey relies on information in research articles and manuals, and includes the types of <b>defects</b> <b>checked</b> for (such as memory management, arithmetics, security vulnerabilities), soundness, value and aliasing analyses, incrementality and IDE integration.

40|$|Many organisations are {{becoming}} increasingly aware that the usefulness of their data is limited by its poor quality. Surprising (and sometimes alarming) proportions of data in databases are inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent or out of date. One-off data cleaning methods can help {{the situation in the}} short term, but they are costly and do little to improve data quality in the long term. However, in order to plan and monitor the progress of long term data quality improvement programmes, it is necessary to be able to assess the quality of data across an organisation. Since resources for such programmes are generally limited, and since much of the data in question resides in mission critical systems, it is vital that these assessment activities do not intrude on normal day-to-day business processing. In this paper, we present an approach to assess organisational data quality on a regular basis, which does not delay or disrupt revenue-generating data processing activities. We have adapted techniques from distributed query processing and distributed integrity checking to produce a system that takes account of the workload at each local site when distributing the <b>defect</b> <b>checking</b> work in the distributed information system. The approach assesses the data quality during the periods of low system activity, and ships data defects found to a global site, which time stamps them and records them for later analysis. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} theory that predicts low levels of {{protection}} during periods of "normal" trade volume coupled with episodes of "special" protection when trade volumes surge. This dynamic pattern of protection emerges from a model in which countries choose levels of protection in a repeated game facing volatile trade swings. High trade volume leads to a greater incentive to defect unilaterally from cooperative tariff levels. Therefore, as the volume of trade expands, the level of protection must rise in a cooperative equilibrium to mitigate the rising trade volume and hold the incentive to <b>defect</b> in <b>check.</b> Copyright 1990 by American Economic Association. ...|$|R
40|$|Bibliography: p. 150 - 160. Wood is {{a popular}} {{constructional}} material; annually the world uses approximately 10 ⁹ tons of it, {{which is more than}} twice that of steel. It is a little surprising, therefore, that in comparison to steel, little {{progress has been made in}} research on the mechanical properties of wood. This is particularly so in the field of fracture, which has relevance not only to the structural use of timber, but also to the important processes of machining and cutting. One of the reasons for this relative lack of knowledge concerning the fracture behaviour of wood, is that wood has such good specific toughness properties that the designer has little recourse to rigorous brittle fracture criteria. In addition, attempts to relate gross mechanical properties to the micromechanical behaviour have been hampered by insufficient knowledge of the microstructure itself. However, with the advent of electron microscopy, much of the nature of this complicated cellular composite has been established, and the Materials Science approach to the assessment of the mechanical and fracture properties of wood is now possible. Wood contains many types of strength reducing <b>defects.</b> <b>Checks</b> for instance, are cracks, usually in the radial-longitudinal plane, and are caused by preferential shrinkage during seasoning. Knots, on the other hand, are far from being crack-like and involve much grain disturbance and also a loss in load bearing area. There is some attraction, therefore, in attempting to use a quantitative fracture mechanics approach to assess the strength of flawed timber, since this is a method of analysis which has been developed to deal with fracture which initiates from inherent flaws. Although, as will be reviewed in Chapter 2, this approach has been the subject of various recent studies, it is shown in subsequent chapters to have serious limitations as a practical fracture criterion for wood. This is particularly so in the most common structural situations where wood is stressed parallel to the grain, in which case failure from inherent crack-like <b>defects,</b> such as <b>checks,</b> is only of secondary importance. Nevertheless the general fracture mechanics methodology is relevant to an investigation such as this one, combining as it does a consideration of the microstructural behaviour, and its effect on the gross mechanical properties...|$|R
