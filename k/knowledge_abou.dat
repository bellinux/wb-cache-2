40|$|Abstract Many estuarine {{and coastal}} marine {{ecosystems}} have increasingly experienced degradation caused by multiple stressors. Anthropogenic pressures alter natural ecosystems and the ecosystems {{are not considered}} to have recovered unless secondary succession has returned the ecosystem to the pre-existing condition or state. However, depending upon the scales of time, space and intensity of anthropogenic disturbance, return along the historic trajec-tory of the ecosystem may: (1) follow natural restoration though secondary succession; (2) be re-directed through ecological restoration, or (3) be unattainable.

40|$|Why are attentional {{processes}} {{important in}} the driving of anticipations? Anticipatory processes are fundamental cognitive abilities of living systems, in order to rapidly and accurately perceive new events in the environment, and to trigger adapted behaviors to the newly perceived events. To process anticipations adapted to sequences of various events in complex environments, the cognitive system {{must be able to}} run specific anticipations on the basis of selected relevant events. Then more attention must be given to events potentially relevant for the living system, compared to less important events. What are useful attentional factors in anticipatory processes? The relevance of events in the environment depend on the effects they can have on the survival of the living system. The cognitive system must then be able to detect relevant events to drive anticipations and to trigger adapted behaviors. The attention given to an event depends on i) its external physical relevance in the environment, such as time duration and visual quality, and ii) on its internal semantic relevance in memory, such as <b>knowledge</b> <b>abou...</b>|$|E
40|$|Draft version. Please do not quote. The celebrated ”small-world ” and ”scale-free ” network {{structures}} {{have recently}} been prominently proposed as models of large networks {{in a variety of}} substantive realms. However, it remains unclear to what degree the mechanisms of ”preferential attachment ” and ”random rewiring ” that have been argued to underlie the emergence of these networks are sociologically plausible. First, these mechanisms require the sociologically implausible assumption of globally available knowledge about structural positions. Second, individual goals and cognitions that motivate actors ’ decisions to make or break ties remain implicit. In this paper we present a computational model of the emergence of complex networks (such as small-world or power-law) that is grounded in social exchange theory and assumptions of bounded rationality. More specifically, we draw on previous work by Flache and Hegselmann and assume that agents seek to find and keep attractive exchange partners in a population where actors differ in attractiveness, for example in their expertise in knowledge exchange. Agents pursue their goal under imperfect, local information without initial <b>knowledge</b> <b>abou...</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the diversity}} of oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms present in eight hypersaline microbial mats {{on the basis of}} three cultivation-independent approaches. Morphological diversity was studied by micros-copy. The diversity of carotenoids was examined by extraction from mat samples and high-pressure liquid chromatography analysis. The diversity of 16 S rRNA genes from oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms was investigated by extraction of total DNA from mat samples, amplification of 16 S rRNA gene segments from cyanobacteria and plastids of eukaryotic algae by phylum-specific PCR, and sequence-dependent separation of amplification products by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis. A numerical approach was introduced to correct for crowding the results of chromatographic and electrophoretic analyses. Diversity estimates typically varied up to twofold among mats. The congruence of richness estimates and Shannon-Weaver indices based on numbers and proportional abundances of unique morphotypes, 16 S rRNA genes, and carotenoids unveiled the underlying diversity of oxygenic phototrophic microorganisms in the eight mat communities studied. Due to their physiological diversity, microorganisms play major roles in the cycling of chemical elements within the biosphere, but this relevance for environmental processes is only fragmentarily reflected in our current <b>knowledge</b> <b>abou...</b>|$|E

Despite its importance, there is little empirical knowledge about the spatial pattern of Internet growth. Using the number of ISPs (Internet service providers) as an indicator of Internet diffusion and adoption, the authors attempt to understand the spatial pattern of Internet adoption and the factors responsible. Specifically, they seek to answer three research questions: Do U. S. counties exhibit differences in Internet adoption? If so, what is the pattern of adoption? and How do county-level socioeconomic and geographical factors affect the adoption of Internet services? For the spatial analysis, polygon pattern analysis is used to see the pattern of Internet adoption. Three spatial error models (for all counties, metro counties, and nonmetro counties) are used to investigate the relationship between various county-level demand indicators and Internet service status. The result shows that market demand is the driving force as counties that are more urban, have more educated people, more business establishments, and higher housing value also have higher ISP presence. This finding implies that the remote and rural areas will continue to suffer from poor Internet access.

40|$|Because of some {{theories}} which emphasize on {{the explanation}} {{of the relation between}} geographical space and power in the direction of control and domination of the world by the great powers, geopolitics was accused that domination seeking behavior of the power is justified by it, and it helps to development of dispute and war, and basically geopolitics is a knowledge which is used by the owners of political power. Perhaps for this reason, somebody believes that geopolitics is an applied knowledge in nature. Also somebody believes that geopolitics is guilty in appearance of the first and second world wars, so they challenge the traditional geopolitics, especially its negative dimension as the imperialist geopolitics. Appearance of the other approaches such as Critical geopolitics, Environmental geopolitics and anti-geopolitics can be evaluated in this direction. The writer of this text recognizes geopolitics as a branch of political geography with scientific nature, which similar to the other scientific disciplines has two dimensions: Basic and Applied. In the basic approach, scientific theorems, propositions and theories can be produced, so the theoretical knowledge and scientific literature of geopolitics can be developed. According to this approach the writer has compiled and published the book of: "The Principle and Concepts of Geopolitics"(Hafeznia, 2006). The applied dimension, emphasizes on the application of geopolitical knowledge {{to meet the needs of}} human societies, and to some extent is under the influence of world view, ideology, interest and attitudes of the users.

40|$|Practice-oriented Ethical Models to Bridge Animal Production, Ethics and Society A {{seemingly}} unbridgeable distance {{has grown}} between contemporary animal {{production and the}} ideals living in society. This work delivers a new et hical concept, and describes a practical framework and three concrete ex amples of how {{to close the gap}} between animal production and social and ethical concerns, in day-to-day situations. It should be possible to app ly this concept and this framework to other areas in which technology is at odds with societys expectations. Next to normative and applied ethical theories, there is a third level o f ethical deliberation. This level has been named practice-oriented ethi cs (praktijkethiek). It deals with ethical assessment, evaluation or d ecision-making at a very practical level. In contrast to normative ethic s, which theorises about ethical concepts, and applied ethics, which the orises about practical issues, practice-oriented ethics is not about the orising, but about taking decisions and acting. Therefor, it seems bette r to talk about (practice-oriented) ethical tools than theories. The lay ered model or goal-indicator model is an elegant and powerful way to rec oncile the need for conciseness with the need for accuracy in such tools. The first tool developed through the layered model is a on-farm animal w elfare assessment system. This system integrates existing <b>knowledge</b> <b>abou</b> t the assessement of animal welfare in a framework based on three compon ents: housing, stockholder and animal. Using a newly created Stockholder Assessment System (SAS), much emphasis is lead upon the role of the sto ckholder, duly recognising his or her pivotal role in the animal product ion environment. Feedback and transparency are key elements throughout t he entire assessment system, not the final score. In {{order to be able to}} close the gap between the different stakeholders in the animal welfare debate, it is necessary to develop a common langua ge. A set of Societal Animal Welfare Indicators (SAWI) is presented, off ering a way to inform society about the evolution of animal welfare. Mor eover, the SAWI can be a bridge between the different stakeholders expe ctations. This SAWI system is developed through an intensive dialogue pr ocess with all stakeholders. Such dialogue, if continued and nutured, wi ll prove to be a much better candidate to deliver progress in animal wel fare than any other. As a third ethical tool, an Animal Disease Intervention Matrix (ADIM) is described specifically designed to assist in the evaluation and compari son of animal disease control scenarios. The ADIM can be used to compare existing intervention scenarios in specific situations, but it also is a scenario-building instrument. As an example, the ADIM is applied to H 5 N 1 AI, showing that a 100 % preventive vaccination policy has significant ethical advantages. Cooperation and multistakeholder dialogue are two important concepts in this book. While discussions tend to emphasise differences, dialogue pro cesses are more about looking for similarities and  in the longer term  they can help to create some form of mutual understanding between stak eholders. The strive for more farm animal welfare will not be an unidirectional mo vement, as there are very few certainties in animal welfare issues. This will inevitably slow progress, but it should not be allowed to stop it. In certain cases, stepping back from certainty is taking a step forward. Using objective-indicator systems such as those in this work will be a n important part of this strategy, as they may be an important bridge be tween scientific, ethical and social concerns. Nevertheless, allowing di alogue and looking for cooperation will be the most important step. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Until now, ale strains were {{a unique}} {{industrial}} resource. They display {{a wide range}} ofphenotypes allowing the production {{a great variety of}} beer types, each with their uniquecharacteristics. One of these defi ning characteristics is ester production. Unfortunately,the switch f rom traditional to modern production methods such as cylindroconical tan ksand high gravity brewing resulted in loss of the delicate balance between the differentesters. To solve the problem of un balanced ester profiles, it is necessary to understand why andhow ye ast cells produce esters. It is essential to understand the genetic basi s of esterbiosynthesis in S. cerevisiae. Previous research has tackl ed this problem starting fromthe genome, an approach called reverse genetics. Several ester biosynthesis genes, such asEEB 1, were identi fied in this way. However, analysis of the phenotype of deletion strains,in which all known ester biosynthesis genes were deleted, indicated the presence of at leastone more ethyl acetate synthase. It did not provide additional knowledge on the upstreampart of ethyl ester syn thesis. Also, no biological function could be described for esterbio synthesis in general. In the end, exploration of all available leads usi ng this approachno longer resulted in significantly new information. In this work, a different approach to understand ester bio synthesis and its regulation wastaken. Instead of starting from the genome, the phenotype was used as a starting pointin what is called a forward genetic approach. Ten commercially used ale strains (IS 1 - IS 10) were chosen from the CMBS collection based on previous results, fi ngerprinted usinginterdelta analysis to exclude duplicates and ferme nted in identical conditions accordingto the EBC tall tube fermentat ion protocol. The results from this experiment showed thatthe small selection of ten strains was very diverse, both in fermentation characte ristics andin aroma production. This variation in phenotypes allowed for the selection of two strainswith an ester profile suited for fu rther use, IS 9 and IS 10. To link the phenotype of these str ains with specific locations in the genome, the AMTEMtechnology was used as a genetic mapping method. For this study, the AMTEM methodwa s chosen. The Artificial Marker Track Exclusion Mapping (AMTEM) method m akesuse of a set of unique artificial markers, inserted at equidista nt neutral places in the yeastgenome, resulting in a fixed resolutio n. The resulting artificially marked strain (AMS) canthen be used in mapping experiments without the need for determining a genetic map, since the artificial markers are only present in the AMS. S ince ale strains are known to be aneuploid and/or polyploid, have a poor sporulationcapacity and extremely low spore viability, the segregan t selected for further analysis hasto meet the basic requirements for application of the AMTEM technology: a phenotypeof interest clearl y {{different from that of the}} AMS; no extreme aneuploidy; a stablemat ing type; sufficient mating capacity; sufficient sporulation capacity an d sufficient sporeviability. For both IS 9 and IS 10, segregants could be isolated that showed these properties. Unexpectedly, mating type switching was already inactivated in these strains and the ploidyof the segregants was within the usable range. We have selecte d a segregant for each of these two strain, with each segregant showingthe highest deviation in ester production from the control strain and from each other, andfulfilling the requirements for application of the AMTEM technology. However, when thesesegregants were used with a n AMS containing 101 markers covering five chromosomes,an unexpected outcome was encountered. When the presence of markers in the entire population of segregants derived from hybrids of the AMS and the industr ial segregantswas analysed, it was noticed that the expected 50 / 50 r atio between presence and absenceof the markers was not present. Ins tead, the percentage of each marker was clearly biasedtowards that o f the AMS, except around the mating type locus, where the bias was towar dsthe industrial segregant. Apparently, the spores containing propor tionally more DNA fromthe AMS than from the industrial segregant sho wed higher spore viability and thereforewere selected preferentially in the random spore selection method. In order to cope wit h this bias, two strategies were explored: in a first, the statisticalanalysis was adjusted to filter results and eliminate the bias. This e limination was possibletaking the real marker presence into account instead of the expected marker presence. when testing for linkage in both a high and a low ethyl caproate producing subpopulation,the bia s was eliminated, however, with the sacrifice of possible <b>knowledge</b> <b>abou</b> t linkagewith the strain towards which the bias is situated, in this case the AMS. After removal ofthe bias in the marker distribution, no significant linkage with loci for either high or lowethyl caproat e production could be found in the chromosomes covered by the markers. The second strategy tried to eliminate the bias by backcrossing. A seg regant from ahybrid between an AMS and an industrial segregant was b ackcrossed with the AMS andthe resulting hybrid was sporulated. When the presence of the markers was tested inthe segregants, it could b e noticed that in some chromosomes the bias had completelydisappeare d, which was not expected to happen after only one backcross. The majordrawback of this strategy is the dilution of the DNA originating from the industrial strain. This could lead to only identifying the loci with a major effect, while missing the loci witha minor effect. & nbsp;In an attempt to find another lead for research into ester biosynthesis, a strain coming froma saturation mutagenesis experiment pr oducing high concentrations of ethyl acetate wasclosely examined. Wh ile the strain was identified as Pichia anomala, the data from theph enotyping and from the whole genome sequencing validated this strain as a new lead foridentifying genes involved in ethyl acetate synthesis, since a possible identification of theethyl acetate synthase for P. anomala in future experiments could lead to the identificationof or thologues in S. cerevisiae. In conclusion, this work has pr oven that ale strains can also be used in fundamental yeastresearch and validated the use of ale strains with the AMTEM technology. While no locicould be linked with ethyl caproate biosynthesis in this limite d experiment covering fivechromosomes, the segregants used in this s tudy are good candidates for future use witha more advanced AMTEM te chnology or other genetic mapping technologies covering thewhole gen ome. With the data gathered during the phenotyping and sequencing of P. anomala, a second lead has been identified. In the future, this lead could help in findingthe unknown ethyl acetate synthase in S. cerevi siae if the ethyl acetate synthase in P. anomala could be identified. A study of orthologues of this ethyl acetate synthase in S. cerevisi ae might provide new insight in the genetic basis of ethyl acetate biosy nthesis. status: publishe...|$|E
