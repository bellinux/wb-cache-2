Using appropriate energy-efficient light fittings with dimming controls and proper daylighting schemes can help reduce the electrical demand and contribute to visual comfort and green building development. This paper presents a study on the energy and lighting performances for <b>energy-efficient</b> fluorescent <b>lamps</b> associated with electronic ballasts and high frequency photoelectric dimming controls installed in a school building. Electricity expenditures and indoor illuminance levels for a workshop and a classroom employing high frequency dimming controls were analyzed.

40|$|The {{results showed}} that the rooms that can be delamped are the studios, the {{computer}} labs at the ground floor of Building A, and most perimeter offices in Building A and C. The results also showed that, while the illuminance levels in some of the rooms were not high, the lighting power density was actually very high. This is caused by the type of the inefficient fixtures and the non <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>lamps</b> and ballasts that are currently installed. It was previously estimated that 30 % of the current fixtures could be delamped, resulting in an estimated annual energy cost savings of $ 9, 200. However, several other strategies should be included with the delamping, such as adding more task lighting, lowering the position of the indirect fixtures in the studios, replacing the current fixture covers, and changing the current lamps and ballasts with the <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>lamps</b> and ballasts. This report presents the results of a survey conducted to measure the illuminance levels in all rooms in the Langford Architecture Center buildings. The purpose of this survey was to investigate which rooms are over illuminated, and thus present a potential to be delamped.

If nearly every driver had their headlights on during the daytime, close to 30 road deaths and 500 serious road injuries per year could be saved in the Netherlands.

40|$|Most nocturnal Lepidoptera can be {{attracted}} to artificial light sources, particularly to those that emit {{a high proportion of}} ultraviolet radiation. Here, I describe a newly developed LED lamp set for the use in the field that is lightweight, handy, robust, and energy efficient. The emitted electromagnetic spectrum corresponds to the peak sensitivity in most Lepidoptera eye receptors (ultraviolet, blue and green). Power LEDs with peaks at 368 nm (ultraviolet), 450 nm (blue), 530 nm (green), and 550 nm (cool white) are used. I compared the irradiance (Ee) of many commonly used light-trapping lamps at a distance of 50 cm. Between wavelengths of 300 and 1000 nm, irradiance from the new lamp was 1. 43 W m- 2. The new lamp proved to be the most energy efficient, and it emitted more radiation in the range between 300 and 400 nm than any other lamp tested. Cold cathodes are the second most <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>lamps.</b> Irradiation from fluorescent actinic tubes is higher than from fluorescent blacklight-blue tubes. High-wattage incandescent lamps and self-ballasted mercury vapour lamps have highest irradiance, but they mainly emit in the long wave spectrum. The use of gauze and sheets decreases the proportion of UV radiation and increases the share of blue light, probably due to optical brighteners. Compared with sunlight, UV irradiance is low at a distance of 50 cm from the lamp, but (safety) glasses as well as keeping sufficient distance from the lamp are recommended. In field tests, the new LED lamp attracted large numbers of Lepidoptera in both the Italian Alps and in the Peruvian Andes...|$|R
5000|$|The University of Pittsburgh {{acquired}} the former Masonic Temple on December 23, 1993 for $8.5 million ($ in [...] dollars). [...] A two-year, $16 million ($ in [...] dollars) {{renovation of the}} structure and its adaptation {{for use by the}} University departments began in November 1998 and was completed in February 2000. During the initial design process, a study was performed to evaluate the architectural and historic significance of each major area of the building. As a result, four main lobbies, the ballroom and three main entrances, and portions of several two-story spaces on the third and fifth floors were kept and restored. Special attention was given to restore the Masonic Templeâ€™s original historic condition. As such, approximately 95% of the existing historical light fixtures were rewired, retrofitted with <b>energy-efficient</b> <b>lamps,</b> refinished, and rehung in their original locations. Nearly all of the original wood doors, window casings and baseboards were refinished and reinstalled. Five new automatic elevators were installed and original bronze and stainless steel cabs were retrofitted to two of the new elevator platforms. Approximately 100 original bronze door hardware sets were modified to ADA compliance, refinished and reinstalled. One thousand square feet of marble flooring originally from Pennsylvania Hall (the previous home of Pittâ€™s medical school since torn down) was utilized in vestibules, corridors, elevator lobbies and cabs. Marble from the Masonic Templeâ€™s original marble restroom stalls was also recycled for use in these areas. The building was decorated and furnished in a color scheme of primarily blues, mauves and burgundy to complement the mahogany woodwork.|$|R

40|$|The {{opportunities}} to {{significantly reduce the}} electricity consumption in an illuminated strawberry cultivation has been analysed in a desk study. Special <b>energy-efficient</b> LED <b>lamps</b> {{can be used to}} steer plant growth and development. By replacing HPS-lamps by the latest LEDs with an energy efficiency of 2. 7 Î¼mol/W, the power consumption can be reduced by more than 30 %. It seems possible to reduce this consumption in illuminated strawberries by another 10 % in a greenhouse with high light transmission in the winter months and using artificial lighting more in relation to different growth stages. Light colour (spectrum) affects the growth, production and quality of strawberries. A high amount of red light stimulates production and blue light enhances the sugar and vitamin C content. The light and energy consumption can be further decreased by improved space utilization and by reducing the leaf/fruit ratio. Gas savings are possible by minimizing the use of the minimum heating pipe and closing the energy screen during cold weather. However, this requires special attention with respect to the prevention of fungal diseases and maintaining fruit quality...|$|R

The electronic load cell device developed for measurement of HLU behavior of piglets could accurately and automatically record the number of piglets utilizing the heat lamp for the entire trial period, but it could not determine the lying patterns of the piglets;Dynamic HLU of piglets exposed to 250 W, 175 W, or 125 W heat lamps was measured during four production seasons. The results indicated that there was a consistent circadian pattern in HLU for all the heat lamps tested. HLU was significantly higher during the day than at night. The dynamic HLU behavior was greatly affected by the heat lamp size. The 175 W heat lamp produces the best piglet resting pattern. The thermal needs of neonatal piglets declines with increasing age;The effects of the lamp output and color on piglet behavior and performance were evaluated at two air temperatures of 18 (Â± 1. 5) Â°C and 27 (Â± 1. 5) Â°C, respectively.

The ambient temperature in farrowing unit significantly affects heat lamp usage of the piglets;A mathematical model describing the thermal interactions between the environment and piglets was developed. The model predictions indicated that the heat lamp need of piglets was affected by the piglet age and ambient temperature, and the ambient temperature was the most important factor affected the heat lamp needs of piglets. The heat lamp needs of piglets was gradually decreasing with age and the average decreasing of heat lamp needs of piglets was 1 W per day, the decreasing of heat lamp needs of piglets was sharp as 10. 5 W/Â°C with ambient temperature.
