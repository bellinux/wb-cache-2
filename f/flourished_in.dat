In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them.

5|$|Anton Rubinstein was {{a famous}} Russian pianist who had lived, {{performed}} and composed in Western and Central Europe before he returned to Russia in 1858.

5|$|Attempts by fans {{to write}} in Quenya began in the 1970s, when the total corpus of {{published}} Elvish comprised {{only a few hundred}} words. Since then, the use of Elvish has <b>flourished</b> <b>in</b> poems and texts, phrases and names, and even tattoos. But Tolkien himself never made his languages complete enough for conversation. As a result, newly invented Elvish texts require conjecture and sometimes the coinage of new words. The use of Quenya has expanded over the years as new words have been created, forming a Neo-Quenya language that is based on Tolkien's original Quenya but incorporates many new elements.|$|E

A decline in league bowling starting in the 1980s was also blamed for the downturn, but an AMF Bowling official argued that the customer base remained steady because an increase in open bowling made up for fewer league bowlers.|$|E
