500|$|David's {{interest}} in cooking was sparked by a 21st birthday gift {{from her mother}} of The Gentle Art of Cookery by Hilda Leyel, her first cookery book. She later wrote, [...] "I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes." ...|$|E
500|$|From Oxford, David {{moved to}} the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park, London, the {{following}} year. She rented rooms in a large house near the park, spent a generous 21st birthday present on equipping the kitchen, and learned to cook. A gift from her mother of The Gentle Art of Cookery by Hilda Leyel was her first cookery book. She later wrote, [...] "I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from, instead of the romantic Mrs Leyel with her rather wild, imagination-catching recipes." ...|$|E

"Timodemus of Aphidnae, {{who was one}} of Themistocles' enemies but not a man of note, was crazed {{with envy}} and spoke bitterly to Themistocles of his visit to Lacedaemon, saying that the honors he had from the Lacedaemonians were paid him for Athens' sake and not for his own. This he kept saying until Themistocles replied, 'This is the truth of the matter: <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a man of Belbina I would not have been honored in this way by the Spartans, nor would you, sir, for all you are a man of Athens.' Such was the end of that business." ...|$|E

500|$|During the war, {{relations}} between writers in Nigeria and Biafra were strained. Achebe and John Pepper Clark had a tense confrontation in London over their respective support for opposing {{sides of the}} conflict. Achebe demanded that the publisher withdraw the dedication of A Man of the People he had given to Clark. Years later, their friendship healed and the dedication was restored. Meanwhile, their contemporary Wole Soyinka was imprisoned for meeting with Biafran officials, and {{spent two years in}} jail. Speaking in 1968, Achebe said: [...] "I find the Nigerian situation untenable. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> a Nigerian, I think I {{would have been in the}} same situation as Wole Soyinka is– in prison." ...|$|E
500|$|.....as soon as I got out I {{climbed on}} to the railing and threw myself out to the wire-netting, a {{distance}} of between 20 and 30 feet. The idea in my mind was [...] "one big tragedy may save many others". I realised that my best means of carrying out my purpose was the iron staircase. When a good moment came, quite deliberately I walked upstairs and threw myself from the top, as I meant, {{on to the}} iron staircase. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> successful I should undoubtedly have been killed, {{as it was a}} clear drop of 30 to 40 feet. But I caught {{on the edge of the}} netting. I then threw myself forward on my head with all my might.|$|E

And this record is my payment. This is me giving back what I was given, or took. [...] If you believe in some mythology, and you want to live by those rules, then I had to say myself: 'I'm not really doing what I set out to do,' even though I tried to convince myself that I was. I'm not regretting the last few records that I've made, but since Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death), I've not made something with [...] sheer utter fearlessness and anger and force.|$|E

500|$|In {{modern times}} Mrs. Beeton's {{practice}} has been criticised as plagiarism; Beeton's modern biographer Kathryn Hughes talks of her [...] "lifting" [...] and [...] "brazenly copying" [...] recipes from others, {{and says that}} this was [...] "the way that cookery books had been put together from time immemorial ...". The New York Times said, [...] "Isabella [...] plagiarised only the best". [...] This led to the comment that [...] "Mrs Beeton couldn't cook but she could copy". Hughes recounts that Beeton's [...] "first recipe for Victoria sponge was so inept that she left out the eggs" [...] and that her work was [...] "brazenly copied... almost word for word, from books {{as far back as}} the Restoration". The influential 20th-century food writer Elizabeth David dismissed her as [...] "a plagiarist" [...] and later wrote: [...] "I wonder if I would have ever learned to cook at all <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> given a routine Mrs Beeton to learn from".|$|E
500|$|While {{performing}} at the 1998 KROQ Weenie Roast in Irvine, California, Third Eye Blind bassist Arion Salazar ran onstage and [...] "bear-hugged" [...] Dirnt, who was caught off-guard. [...] The incident escalated into an on-stage scuffle before Salazar {{was taken away}} by security. [...] After the performance, Dirnt confronted Salazar backstage, and as the two were arguing, a beer bottle struck Dirnt in the head, causing a small fracture in his skull. [...] Eyewitnesses later attributed the bottle throwing to a fan of Third Eye Blind. [...] Salazar and the band's management soon released a statement: [...] "I am sorry that my attempt at doing something I thought would be funny escalated into Mike getting hurt. That was never my intention. I simply {{had too much to}} drink and made a very bad decision. [...] <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in Mike's place, I am sure I would have acted similarly. My heart goes out to him and I hope he recovers quickly." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{making his}} way there he ran into the French fleet on 9 June, the French having sailed from Toulon some days earlier and headed east along the coast. Despite {{pressing}} on sail Speedy was overrun and captured. Eyre was taken aboard one of the French ships, and later transferred to the flagship of the fleet's commander, Rear-Admiral Pierre Martin. Martin {{asked him if he}} had heard of the decree from the National Convention which declared that 'no quarter should be given to either the English or the Hanoverians'. Eyre replied that they had not, on which he was told by Martin that [...] "...I must tell you that it is now un guerre à mort and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> the first to come alongside of you, I should have instantly sent you to the bottom." [...] At this point the main British fleet was seen approaching, and Eyre was hurried back to the first ship he had been brought onto, and the French hurried into Gourjean roads, taking Speedy and the captured British crew with them.|$|E

500|$|In 1910, Alexandra {{became the}} first queen consort to visit the British House of Commons during a debate. In a {{remarkable}} departure from precedent, for two hours {{she sat in the}} Ladies' Gallery overlooking the chamber while the Parliament Bill, a bill to remove the right of the House of Lords to veto legislation, was debated. Privately, Alexandra disagreed with the bill. Shortly afterward, she left to visit her brother, King George I of Greece, in Corfu. While there, she received news that King Edward was seriously ill. Alexandra returned at once and arrived just the day before her husband died. In his last hours, she personally administered oxygen from a gas cylinder to help him breathe. She told Frederick Ponsonby, [...] "I feel as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> turned into stone, unable to cry, unable to grasp the meaning of it all." [...] Later that year, she moved out of Buckingham Palace to Marlborough House, but she retained possession of Sandringham. The new king, Alexandra's son George, soon faced a decision over the Parliament Bill. Despite her personal views, Alexandra supported her son's reluctant agreement to Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's request to create sufficient Liberal peers after a general election if the Lords continued to block the legislation.|$|E
500|$|Connotations was {{the first}} orchestral work in which Copland used serial {{principles}} of composition. Serial or twelve-tone music, Copland stated, carried [...] "a built-in tenseness... a certain drama... a sense of strain or tension" [...] inherent in its extended use of chromaticism. [...] "These are new tensions," [...] he continued, [...] "different from what I would have dreamt up <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> thinking tonally." [...] To composer John Adams, Copland's embrace of serial technique was not really such as stretch [...] "because ever since the 1920s, he'd already a piss-'n-vinegar penchant for sour intervals, like {{he did in the}} Piano Variations." [...] Contrary to the charge that would be made after Connotations premiere that Copland wrote a twelve-tone work to impress younger composers, he had actually begun using the method at a time when few other American composers were doing so. While Copland's first expressly serial works were his Piano Quartet of 1950 and Piano Fantasy and he noted that some critics (whom he did not name) had traced a similarity in those pieces to his Piano Variations of 1930, he claimed in his 1967 [...] "conversation" [...] with Edward T. Cone that the Variations were [...] "the start of my interest in serial writing... Although it doesn't use all twelve tones, it does use seven of them in what I hope is a consistently logical way." [...] Prior to that interview, few had related Copland's early work to that of the founder of twelve-tone composition, Arnold Schoenberg.|$|E
500|$|Giving {{evidence}} [...] to the tribunal, S. O. Davies said he {{had long}} suspected that the Aberfan tips were unstable, but had kept quiet for fear that if tipping was stopped on the mountainside the Coal Board would close the colliery. Davies added: [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> asked to do so, I would have done it". His testimony was strongly challenged by the NUM, whose counsel Brian Gibbens QC said that [...] "f Mr Davies is to be accepted as truthful and accurate in his recollection... then he bears what {{must be one of}} the largest personal burdens of responsibility for the disaster". However, Gibbens found it incredible that a man in Davies's unique local position of authority and influence would not have mentioned his fears to any of the formal bodies—borough council, Coal Board, union or local Labour Party: [...] "If anyone could have exercised influence to overcome an obdurate or ignorant monolith like the Coal Board, [...] was well placed to do so." [...] Gibbens submitted that Davies's testimony should be rejected, on the grounds that he [...] "never appreciated what in fact was the import of his words". The tribunal concurred, accepting that Davies had not fully understood the gravity of his admission, and adding that had they been convinced otherwise, he could not have escaped censure. The tribunal's findings, published in July 1967, placed responsibility for the disaster firmly on the National Coal Board, specifically on the absence of any tipping policy.|$|E

2500|$|Shore {{spent her}} last years in poverty. She {{had to sell}} her Weston {{photographs}} to survive and became increasingly depressed. Sometime in the late 1950s her neighbors had her institutionalized. Her very dear friend Jehanne Bietry Salinger said about the matter, [...] "some so-called 'do-gooders' went to her studio, found it disorganized, and had Henrietta committed to an asylum. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> in Carmel, I would never have permitted it, since she {{was in no way}} insane.

In his memoir, Dublin Made Me, Andrews {{described}} Clancy's personality: [...] "I was overcome by the extraordinary impact which Clancy’s personality had on me.
