5|$|At {{the head}} of his army, Simeon I marched from Preslav through the Balkan Mountains and the valley of the river Tundzha and besieged Adrianople. While the bulk of the Bulgarian forces were {{concentrated}} in Thrace, the Byzantines bribed the Serbian prince Pavle Branović, who was a Bulgarian protégé, to switch sides. The Bulgarians answered with a successful intervention in Serbia, easily <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the country and placed in power another Bulgarian candidate, Zaharija Pribisavljević. The conflict in Serbia distracted the Bulgarian military operations against the Byzantine Empire for the rest of 921.|$|E

Although not enamoured of Barclay, Bagration turned to him for aid, {{ignoring}} Kutuzov altogether; Barclay, to his credit, responded quickly, sending three guard regiments, eight grenadier battalions, and twenty-four 12-pounder cannon at their best pace to bolster Semyаnovskaya. Colonel Toll and Kutuzov moved the Guard Reserve units forward as early as 09:00 hours.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 18th century, Bombay began to grow into a major trading town, and {{received}} a huge influx of migrants from across India.

The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776), and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle the outcome of the First Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E

One example can be provided by the value of Mobile's exports during this period of depression. The value of exports leaving the city fell from $9 million in 1878 to $3million in 1882.|$|E
5|$|He entrenched his {{position}} in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd, the daughter of Ealdred, Earl of Bamburgh. After killing Ealdred's successor Eadulf in 1041, Siward <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> all Northumbria. He exerted his power in support of Cnut's successors, kings Harthacnut and Edward, assisting them with vital military aid and counsel. He probably <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s, {{and there is some}} evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland. In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ("Macbeth"). Despite the death of his son Osbjorn, Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054. More than half a millennium later the Scotland adventure earned him a place in William Shakespeare's Macbeth. Siward died in 1055, leaving one son, Waltheof, who would eventually succeed to Northumbria. St Olave's church in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward.|$|E

Most Texian soldiers in Béxar left to join a planned invasion of Matamoros, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|In the 1946 elections, Republicans wrested {{control of}} both houses of Congress from the Democrats {{for the first time}} since the Great Depression and <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the {{majority}} of state governments. The power of labor unions had expanded under Roosevelt and the Democrats, and when a 1946 railroad worker strike exacerbated a post-war recession the Republican majorities – over Barkley's objection – curbed union power via the Taft–Hartley Act. They also passed the Twenty-second Amendment, limiting the president to two terms, a posthumous slap at Roosevelt.|$|E

5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that {{became a part of}} Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. The specifics of that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from the time when the English <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Bjaðmunjo was a {{daughter}} of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland (died 1119).

In so doing, he <b>gained</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Norse-Gaelic Kingdom of Dublin, and as a result began to extend his influence into the nearby Kingdom of the Isles. There is uncertainty concerning the political situation in the Isles in {{the last decade of the}} eleventh century.
