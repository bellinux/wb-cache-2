50|$|In 2011, Ken Clark, then Minister for Justice, {{proposed}} {{increasing the}} sentencing <b>discount</b> <b>awarded</b> to defendants who {{plead guilty to}} a maximum of 50%. Public debate on this idea was impossible due to his comments made {{at the time of the}} announcement about some rapes being more serious than others. However, McGlynn has argued that while he was wrong on distinguishing between rapes, he was right to start a debate on sentencing discounts for very early guilty pleas. McGlynn argues that early guilty pleas may save some victims the trauma of pursuing a case through to court.|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} {{a structure}} of pre-effort conditions associated with ESOPs. Since we can observe shareholder returns at award we infer incentive effects in a setting where premium and discounted executive stock options are regularly <b>awarded.</b> <b>Discounted</b> (premium) <b>awards</b> {{are associated with the}} highest (lowest) exercise rates, implying a successful incentive (disincentive) effect. Exercise restrictions (comprising hurdles and vesting restrictions) necessarily lower exercise rates, but may be preferred in combination with a <b>discounted</b> or premium <b>award.</b> Typically, a <b>discount</b> choice is associated with hurdles but not vesting restrictions. Empirically, shareholders benefit most from regular <b>awards</b> which are <b>discounted</b> and do not have hurdle price restrictions. Shareholders also benefit from hurdle provisions in irregular awards which may expose shareholders to CEO opportunism...|$|R

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} results from {{simulation}} studies that compare {{the efficiency of}} allocations via our combined pricing method to the efficiency of allocations using conventional on-demand scheduling. We find that using options contracts can offer significant efficiency improvements, but only when usage is above a particular threshold: when it is below that threshold, using options can actually make things worse. Nevertheless in Section 4 we go on to show how options can be combined with provision-point contracts to create an improved method that reduces utilisation losses. Furthermore, we show how provision-point forward contracts can deliver significant gains in efficiency, while preventing <b>discounts</b> being <b>awarded</b> where no gain in efficiency is realised.|$|R
40|$|A high {{proportion}} of senior library professionals will retire in the near future. In addition, due to better career possibilities outside libraries, it is getting harder to recruit young people. Consequently, {{it will become a}} great challenge to find active professionals and leaders to develop our profession, and to sustain the foundation for national and international organisations. This workshop aims to encourage LIS new professionals to take active part in the development of our profession. It will discuss professional development challenges faced by individuals in various countries as they enter the profession as well as suggestions how to rise to these challenges and to solve problems. At first, the workshop participants will be introduced to IFLA, its digital activities and current initiatives for and by new professionals such as the New Professionals Special Interest Group (NPSIG). Afterwards, the audience will split up in several working groups that will brainstorm on the following topics: Suppor t on a national level Are there groups for new professionals in your country? What does your national organisation(s) do to support new professionals (scholarships, <b>discounts,</b> <b>awards,</b> special conferences and so on) and are you satisfied with this support? How can this support be improved? Recrui tment on an international level How can new professionals become more motivated and involved in professional activities? What are the challenges for new information professionals {{and what can be done}} to meet them? What should be the main goals and activities of IFLA / NPSIG? Web-based component / digital platform What would new professionals like to do in the digital area of the international IFLA network? Which kind of web-based component would be useful to help new professionals getting more involved in the IFLA community? The final result will be a recommendation on how to have more students being active in the international library world. The results will be used as basis for re-defining the mission and objectives of the NPSIG. The outcomes will also help to improve the work of the NPSIG. Hopefully by suggesting new activities and by coming up with information about new professionals groups in various countries workshop findings can be published on the NPSIG’s website...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 15 th May 2018. This paper {{addresses}} the stochastic lot-sizing problem with quantity discounts. In particular, {{we examine the}} uncapacitated finite-period economic lot-sizing problem in which the parameters in each period are random and discrete. When an order is placed, a fixed cost is incurred and an all-unit quantity <b>discount</b> is <b>awarded</b> based on the quantity ordered. The lead time is zero and the order is delivered immediately. First we study the case with overstocks by which the excess inventory incurs a holding cost. The objective {{in this case is}} to minimize the expected total cost including ordering and holding costs. The stochastic dynamics is modeled with a scenario tree. We characterize properties of the optimal policy and propose a polynomial time algorithm with complexity O (n 3) for single discount level, where n is the number of nodes in the scenario tree. We extend the results to cases allowing stockout and multi-discount levels. Numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the algorithm and to gain the man- agement insights...|$|R

40|$|AbstractDomestic {{water heating}} in Australia {{conventionally}} uses electric resistance heating storage or gas fuelled water heaters. The Australian electricity supply {{has some of}} the highest greenhouse gas emissions factors in the world. Consequently, water heating is responsible for approximately 24 percent of residential sector greenhouse gas emissions in Australia. To assist households to move towards an energy efficient, low carbon future, a suite of market intervention programs to support solar hot water uptake have been introduced at both state and federal levels. These programs aim to improve the capacity of industry to deliver solar solutions, reduce the emissions intensity and net cost of household water heating, and increase the market share of the solar water heating sector. Incentives include:•Point of sale rebates and certificate-based programs for energy efficiency and renewable energy;•Regulations for new houses that encourage solar water heating installations;•Community awareness programs; and•Training programs for installers to ensure that tradespeople have the competencies to size systems and the skills to install them correctly. In some jurisdictions the incentive programs were performance-based, but in others a fixed rebate amount was available for all systems having performance above a minimum threshold. These programs have lead to the widespread expansion of the industry, with an almost doubling of the proportion of households with solar water heaters between 1999 and 2011. Installations in new homes have seen an even more marked increase: For example, regulations for new homes in the state of Victoria require the installation of a solar water heater or rainwater tank. This program has seen the adoption of solar water heaters in new homes increase fro m around 5 % in 2004 to over 70 % in 2011. Across most of Australia there are proposed regulations limiting the emissions intensity of replacement water heaters which will effectively ban resistance electric water heaters in most situations. Recently both South Australia and Queensland commenced their program for existing houses. It is expected that in the future these programs will drive an even greater uptake, which will go some way to insulating Australian households from price increases that may result from carbon driven future increases in the cost of energy. This paper discusses the various approaches and outcomes of the different programs and provides analysis of the basis of program success or improvements. Learning relevant to market interventions worldwide include•Continuity in program operation is necessary to allow industry to grow in a sustainable way. •Basing the incentive on independently derived performance results provides industry with a means of differentiating better products and provides purchasers with appropriate guidance. •Rebate program design should consider the consumer's purchasing priorities. For example, a point of sale <b>discount</b> <b>awarded</b> as part of the purchase transaction aligns with the urgency of the purchasing process and does not require additional cash to be available from the purchaser. •Design of the schemes can not only produce a greater market share, but can also encourage the manufacture of lower greenhouse gas emissions products. •Market interventions can have unintended consequences, so the programs need to be monitored and flexibility maintained to changes to avoid poor outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Recent data {{implicate}} impulsivity as {{a personality}} trait associated with obesity, binge eating and restrained eating. However, impulsivity is recognised as having multiple dimensions, {{and it remains}} unclear which aspects of impulsive behaviour best predict disordered eating. To try and elucidate further the relationship between impulsivity and eating behaviour, 147 women completed a behavioural measure and two self-report measures of impulsivity along with the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). Overall scores on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-II), along with scores on the Non-planning and Motor Subscales of the BIS-II, were higher in women scoring high on the TFEQ disinhibition (TFEQ-D) scale. Likewise, women scoring high on the TFEQ-D showed more impulsive choice when <b>discounting</b> hypothetical monetary <b>awards.</b> However, responses to measures of functional relative to dysfunctional impulsivity did not differ depending on TFEQ-D score. No measure of impulsivity was related to scores on the TFEQ restraint scale. These data suggest that a tendency to act impulsively {{is associated with a}} tendency to overeat, and may be a factor which predicts the likelihood of the development of binge eating and the breakdown of dieting...|$|R

40|$|In 2000, a STARS radwaste {{team was}} formed to pur-sue cost reductions. The team was {{challenged}} to obtain a 10 percent savings in radwaste costs. That year, radwaste team members from the original five STARS plants met to discuss joint contracting of rad-waste services. They de-cided to pursue savings in offsite waste process-ing services first, be-cause this would be quick to implement and would have the least impact on plant prac-tices. They also decided to team with USA plants (another plant al-liance) to {{increase the size of}} the pool and to better leverage purchas-ing power. The STARS team is-sued an offsite waste processing bid and received sever-al proposals. The bid review resulted in awarding a con-tract to a waste processor for Class A dry active waste (DAW) processing and for clearance survey services with quantity discounts based on the total mass shipped to that processor. The STARS team members reported back to management that because DAW processing costs were only about 25 per-cent of the total radwaste contract costs, they should expect only a proportionate savings. For example, the Diablo Canyon radwaste savings goal from STARS was pegged at $ 100 000, which is 10 percent of the typical an-nual contract cost of $ 1 million. Because DAW accounts for only 25 percent of total radwaste service costs, the savings goal from the joint con-tract for Diablo Canyon was set at $ 25 000. The USA and STARS al-liance held together over the term of the contract, and quantity <b>discounts</b> were <b>awarded.</b> Al-though the savings goal appeared very challeng-ing, Diablo Canyon ac-tually achieved savings of $ 24 000 in 2000, all Volume reduction of radwaste already generated can save some waste disposal costs, but large savings come about only with waste minimization and segregation efforts...|$|R
