30|$|Lastly, technology-enabled Remote Management may {{be based}} on better {{situational}} and security information and analysis, but the distance between senior staff and local staff members is considerable. The specific local situation is less-understood, emotional and empathetic involvement suffers, and the credibility and legitimacy of agencies declines. This {{is in line with}} critical scholars’ criticism that there is a gap in grassroot relations and knowledge as well as a growing social and existential distance from the field (e.g., Duffield 2012; Donini and Maxwell 2013; Sandvik 2016). New technologies are constantly adopted and implemented to overcome the virtual gaps but fail to do so (see Andersson and Weigand 2015). While not tested in this study, the growing distance appears to render reality even more threatening to aid workers, thus leaving aid agencies “trapped” in a problematic <b>implementation</b> <b>modality</b> (Donini and Maxwell 2013), as evidenced by the firm belief of many security managers that they would not operate in many regions for the foreseeable future.|$|R

Panel data spanning a 10 -year period {{are used to}} examine the effects of the adoption of new vegetable varieties and polyculture fish pond management technologies on household resource allocation, incomes, and nutrition. A difference-in-differences model combined with nearest-neighbour matching is used to compare changes in husbands and wives' assets within the same household. The results show women's assets increase more relative to men's when technologies are disseminated through women's groups, suggesting that <b>implementation</b> <b>modalities</b> are important in determining the gendered impact of new technologies. These findings are robust to controls for unobserved household-level characteristics. These results suggest that social capital, as embodied through women's groups, not only serves as a substitute for physical assets in the short run, but helps to build up women's asset portfolios in the long run. gender, social capital, Bangladesh,...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} long–term impact of {{agricultural}} technologies, disseminated using different <b>implementation</b> <b>modalities,</b> on men’s and women’s asset accumulation in rural Bangladesh. Data {{were collected in}} 1996 – 97 {{to examine the effects}} of the adoption of new vegetable varieties and polyculture fishpond management technologies on household resource allocation, incomes, and nutrition, and a followup survey was conducted ten years later. We make three types of comparisons using nearest neighbor matching, comparing (1) early and late adopters of the technology; (2) NGO members with access to the technology and those without access to the technology; and (3) NGO members vs. non–NGO members. Our results suggest that <b>implementation</b> <b>modalities</b> are important in determining the impact of new technologies on men’s and women’s asset accumulation.

40|$|Control systems, despite often being `invisibly' {{incorporated}} within products, {{devices and}} vehicles, are ubiquitous. They are prevalent within the automotive and aerospace industries and {{form part of}} the vanguard of technologies in in- creasing performance, improving fuel economy and increasing safety. One of the most appealing aspects of incorporating control technology in many systems is that the addition of extra control functionality can usually be achieved merely through the addition of extra software code though, in many cases, additional sensors and actuators may be required. This relatively simple <b>implementation</b> <b>modality</b> masks both the capability of control systems and {{the high level of}} engineering underpinning the devel- opment of a suitable control algorithm. For example, many high-performance model-based control design methods require an accurate mathematical model of the system to be controlled and a significant number of man-hours can be absorbed in modelling. Nevertheless, there is usually a good case to be made for the incorporation of control technology to improve the performance (both technical and economic), reliability and safety of a system. In this chapter, we will examine the role that control engineering can play in making ocean energy technology more competitive...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} {{complexity of}} VLSI digital systems has dramatically supported system-level representations in modeling and design activities. This evolution makes often necessary a compliant rearrangement of the modalities followed in validation and analysis tasks, {{as in the}} case of power performances estimation. Nowadays, transaction-level paradigms are having a wider and wider consideration in the research on electronic system-level design techniques. With regard to the available modeling resources, the most relevant framework is probably the transaction-level extension of the SystemC language (SystemC/TLM), which therefore represents the best platform for defining transaction-level design techniques. In this paper we present a macro-modeling power estimation methodology valid for SystemC/TLM prototypes and of general applicability. The present discussion illustrates the <b>implementation</b> <b>modalities</b> of the proposed approach, verifying its effectiveness through a comparison with RTL estimation techniques...|$|E

MethodsThis case study was based on semi-structured interviews with health promotion stakeholders involved in a regional program (PRALIMAP). General hypotheses on transferability and on how the intervention is presumed to produce its effects were used to construct an interview guide. Interviews were analyzed using thematic coding.

Three themes emerged as significant for the stakeholders: <b>implementation</b> <b>modalities</b> and methodology, modalities used to mobilize actors; and transferability-promoting factors and barriers.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{critically}} analyse the South Sudanese peace policy framework which has been expressed in its post-independence peace and development policies. The study also aimed at analyzing the nexus between peacebuilding and broader development agenda and at identifying types of discourses, beliefs and ideologies that have been adopted or relinquished in the South Sudanese peacebuilding framework. Any ideological impact of external factors in influencing peace policies was also critically analysed. Four policy documents namely the Comprehensive Peace Agreement 2005, the South Sudan Development Plan 2011 - 2013, the South Sudan Peace and Reconciliation Strategy 2013 - 2015 and the Comprehensive Strategic Dimensions for Healing, Peace and Reconciliation 2013 were selected and critically analysed using Norman Fairclough’s three-dimensional model for Critical Discourse Analysis: (1) linguistic features and texts, (2) interdiscursivity, and (3) explanation of wider social, political, historical and cultural contexts. Key theoretical concepts surrounding peacebuilding have been discussed starting from the Kantian notion of perpetual peace and continuing to modern ideas of democratic peace theory, negative-positive peace, international engagement and liberal peacebuilding. More recent concepts of new wars and transitional justice systems have been discussed as well. The study identifies altogether six discourses that are maintained through the policy documents. The identified discourses are the capitalist corporate discourse, the curative peace discourse, the development aid/dependency discourse, the good-governance discourse, the religious discourse and the reconciliation discourse. The findings of this study suggest that the South Sudanese peacebuilding framework is based on building peace primarily through security measures and institutional strengthening while paying less attention to bottom-up approaches and people’s subjective wellbeing. In addition, the policy documents studied do not envision any form of transitional justice mechanism and lack a comprehensive national reconciliation program. This is likely to deepen pervasive impunity and result in further divisions, more belligerencies and bloodshed in the country. The study also finds that the South Sudanese peace policy framework is heavily influenced by the so called Western idea of liberal peacebuilding that aim to promote liberal economy, Western-style democracy, marketization and globalization. Though the policy documents emphasize on democracy, good governance and human rights, their <b>implementation</b> <b>modality</b> is not clear. In addition, the policy documents lack coherency, one document prioritising one theme while another adopting a completely different approach, and the nexus between peacebuilding and broader development is poorly established...|$|R
