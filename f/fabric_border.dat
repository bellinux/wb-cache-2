It {{is adapted from}} an early 19th-century American Empire wallpaper having French influences. The upper border is a faux printed blue fabric drapery swag. The faux <b>fabric</b> <b>border</b> is similar in effect to an actual <b>fabric</b> <b>border</b> installed during the administration of John F. Kennedy. The printed dado border along the chair rail is blue and gold with rosettes. Installation of a new oval carpet, based on early 19th-century designs, completed the renovation project. The design was adapted from an original design for a neoclassical English carpet from about 1815, {{the period of the}} furnishings acquired by Monroe for the Blue Room.|$|E
40|$|A {{housing project}} {{comprised}} of 72 units {{is located in}} IJ Burg— a new suburb east {{from the center of}} Amsterdam. More specifically, the project sits on a man-made island called Steigereiland North, on a ‘left-over’ green strip of land. Two types of dwellings (A and B) are disseminated around the site forming various permeable blocks of living and working units. These apartments consist of free-standing, row, and semi-detached typologies, depending on their arrangement and orientation. The capacity of these units to grow and change over time is a key feature of this project. The project has an additional activity strip between the waterside and the housing <b>fabric</b> <b>border</b> which will aid to serve as a lively catalyst for the neighbourhood. This ‘mat’ consists of landscaping and supplementary functions such as: tennis courts, a soccer field, playgrounds, picnic zones, pergolas, a climbing wall, a dance studio, and storage facilities. The newly-added layer of economical, community-driven activities reinvigorates IJ Burg. Introducing light production as well as the creative and working classes into the urban fabric will also result in an extrovert and well-functioning community.

50|$|The Surat Zari Craft is {{a textile}} product of Surat {{district}} in Gujarat, India, {{which is made}} from yarns of silk and cotton mixed with gold, silver or copper. The zari threads are used to make intricate designs by weaving into generally silk fabrics. Its use is extensive in textile industries and handicrafts. The Surat Zari is either woven on cloth or hand embroidered to form <b>fabric</b> <b>borders</b> or used as part {{on the body of}} the cloth. The zaris are used in fabrics made in Varanasi and a few other places in Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Banarasi saris made in Varanasi and Kanjivaram Saris of South India use Surat Zari extensively.|$|R
50|$|Ringgold went to Europe in {{the summer}} of 1972 with her {{daughter}} Michele. While Michele went to visit her friends in Spain, Ringgold continued onto Germany and the Netherlands. In Amsterdam, she visited the Rijksmuseum, which {{became one of the most}} influential experiences affecting her mature work, and subsequently, lead to the development of her quilt paintings. In the museum, Ringgold encountered a collection of 14th and 15th century Nepali paintings that were framed with cloth brocades. These thangkas inspired her to produce <b>fabric</b> <b>borders</b> around her own work, so when she returned to the US, a new painting series was born: The Slave Rape Series. In these works, Ringgold imagined what it would have been like to be an African woman captured and sold into slavery. She invited her mother to collaborate on this project since she was a popular Harlem clothing designer and seamstress during the 1950s. This collaboration eventually lead to the making of their first quilt, Echoes of Harlem, in 1980.|$|R

50|$|Ticking is the {{protective}} fabric cover used to encase mattresses and foundations. It is usually designed to coordinate with the foundation <b>border</b> <b>fabric</b> {{and comes in}} a wide variety of colors and styles. Mattress fabrics can be knits, damask or printed wovens, or inexpensive nonwovens. During the past decade, along with the rise in popularity of all-foam beds, stretchy knit ticking on the bed's top panel has become a standard look on both innerspring and foam beds. Most ticking is made with polyester yarns. More expensive mattress fabrics may contain a combination of polyester with rayon, cotton, silk, wool or other natural yarns.|$|R

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} aŠacks like the Australian census website {{meltdown}} in 2016, this paper proposes {{a system for}} high-level specification and synthesis of intents for Geo-Blocking and IP Spoofing protection at a Software Defined Interconnect. In contrast to todays methods that use expensive custom hardware and/or manual configuration, our solution allows the operator to specify high-level intents, which are automatically compiled to ƒow-level rules and pushed into the interconnect fabric. We define a grammar for specifying the security policies, and a compiler for converting these to connectivity rules.

50|$|Until {{the early}} 2000s, beds were {{normally}} upholstered {{with a single}} fabric. This was usually a damask ticking or, for inexpensive bedsets, a nonwoven fabric covering all surfaces of the mattress and foundation. Today's bedsets are covered with up to six different fabrics: A better quality circular knit or woven damask on the top panel—the bed's sleeping surface; a matching or contrasting woven <b>fabric</b> on the <b>border</b> of the mattress; a matching or contrasting woven fabric on the foundation side panels; a 'non-skid' woven or non-woven fabric {{on the surface of}} the foundation and reverse side of the mattress; and a nonwoven dust cover on the under side of the foundation. Some North American mattress producers are beginning to use furniture upholstery fabrics on the bed's borders giving beds a more European, home furnishings look.|$|R
40|$|This project {{explores the}} use of content based image {{retrieval}} {{in the domain of}} interior decorating. The images in the database represent items used for interior decorating such as wallpapers, <b>borders,</b> <b>fabrics,</b> floorings, and carpets. A comparison is done on the performance of different variations of the colour and texture features and of various distance metrics used to measure the similarity between the query and database features. The colour features extracted from the images include: the average colour in the YIQ, HSV, and RGB colour spaces, colour histograms in the HSV and RGB (8 bin and 64 bin) colour spaces a cumulative colour histogram in the HSV colour space, and the moments of colour distribution in the HSV and RGB colour spaces. The texture features extracted from the images include: contrast, coarseness and four variations of directionality. Six distance metrics are used. They are: L 1, L 2, weighted L 2, L P, weighted sum, and scalar distance. The objective of this project was to find the most appropriate combinations of features and distance metrics for use in an interior decorating applicatio...|$|R
50|$|The {{election}} of Labour in October 1964 {{did not stop}} the programme of Beeching closures, despite the party's manifesto commitment to halt major closures. The intention remained {{to proceed with the}} closure of the Waverley Route, although the timing of the proposal was a matter of debate between the new Minister of Transport, Barbara Castle, and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Willie Ross, who was acutely aware of the sensitivity of the closure proposal for the Borders region and the wider context of Scottish economic development. The proposal for the closure of the entire line and its 24 stations was finally issued on 17 August 1966 with the mention that closure would take place on 2 January 1967 if no objections were received; replacement bus services were to be provided by Eastern Scottish. British Rail estimated that a net financial saving of £232,000 would be made from closure. 508 objections to closure were lodged with the Transport Users' Consultative Committee (TUCC) in Edinburgh within the allotted six-week period, and a public hearing was held in Hawick on 16 and 17 November 1966. Representatives from the County councils of Berwickshire, Roxburghshire and Selkirkshire and the town councils of Galashiels, Jedburgh, Innerleithen, Hawick, Kelso, Selkirk and Peebles attended the meeting to fight the case against closure. There were no representatives from English councils; only Northumberland had contacted the TUCC requesting to be informed of the outcome. Arguments made against closure included the inadequacies of local roads and the damage which would be caused to the <b>fabric</b> of <b>Borders</b> life, whilst British Rail pointed to the falling patronage of the line and the increased car ownership in the area. The TUCC's 15-page report was submitted to Barbara Castle in December 1966, but it was only in April 1968 that she reached the conclusion that the annual subsidy required for the line's retention - £700,000 for the whole route or £390,000 for Hawick-Edinburgh - could not be justified. In the meantime, British Rail's Network for Development plans published in May 1967 confirmed that the line was neither considered as a trunk route to be developed, nor as a rural branch line qualifying for subsidy on social grounds.|$|R
40|$|Skin is {{the largest}} organ of the human body. It is {{the first line of}} defense between the {{vulnerable}} organs and tissues of the body and the environment. Healthy skin is paramount to avoiding infection and disease. Therefore, any breach in the skin represents a significant risk to the health and comfort of its owner. Friction blisters are one of the most common modes of damage to human skin. In some extreme cases, such as those who suffer from Epidermal Bullosa, friction blisters are a very common and painful occurrence. Prior research on blister formation has been performed at mostly an observational level. In some cases, blisters have been deliberately created on human volunteers or animal test subjects. However, these studies are very difficult to recreate due to the legal issues of human and animal testing and the fact that no two people will have the same response to external stimulus. Other studies have followed athletes or soldiers who use different textile fabrics for socks or clothing to determine which have significant effects. Concurrent studies have focused on mimicking human skin for haptics research in product development. These have made great strides in introducing engineering properties such as coefficient of friction (COF) and elastic modulus into the field of skin study. While these studies are very useful to understanding the properties and mechanisms of human skin in rubbing applications, their primary audience is the cosmetics industry or product developers. There is a significant opportunity to take a similar approach of applying an engineering viewpoint to repeatably model the onset and formation of blisters on human skin. The authors have developed the Synthetic Skin Simulant Platform (3 SP) to fulfill this role. The 3 SP is a three-layer composite of elastomeric materials that outputs a visually recognizable blister upon sufficiently strong shear loading. The authors determined through two factorial experiments conducted on a custom wear testing table which variables were most significant to blister formation in the 3 SP. The results showed that COF and dermal stiffness are the primary contributors. This agrees with prior literature about the significance of COF, and it suggests that dermal stiffness is a significant factor that merits examination in future blister research. Finally, the authors ran another experiment to ascertain the influence of textile fabrics and surface treatments on blister formation in the 3 SP. The results demonstrated that surface treatments of corn starch and aloe-based lubricant were effective at mitigating blister formation on the 3 SP. Furthermore, the results show that <b>fabric</b> is also <b>bordering</b> statistical significance on blistering...|$|R
