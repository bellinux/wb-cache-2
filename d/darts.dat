5|$|Love <b>darts,</b> {{also known}} as {{shooting}} <b>darts,</b> or just as <b>darts,</b> are shaped in many distinctive ways which vary considerably between species. What all the shapes of love <b>darts</b> {{have in common is}} their harpoon-like or needle-like ability to pierce.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{existence}} and use of love <b>darts</b> in snails {{has been known for}} at least several centuries, until recently the actual function of love <b>darts</b> was not properly understood.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of <b>darts</b> in many superfamilies of the Stylommatophora, it seems likely that love <b>darts</b> appeared during the early evolution of the Pulmonata, and that the ancestors of the Stylommatophora possessed <b>darts</b> already.|$|E

50|$|Introduced in 1962, the Dodge <b>Dart</b> 440 {{model was}} the {{upmarket}} trim {{version of the}} Dodge <b>Dart.</b> Included was the standard equipment of the <b>Dart</b> and <b>Dart</b> 330, plus backup lights and exterior moldings. The <b>Dart</b> 440 was available as a 4-door sedan, 2-door hardtop, 4-door hardtop, 2-door convertible and 4-door station wagon. The <b>Dart</b> 440 used the 116 in wheelbase shared with the <b>Dart,</b> <b>Dart</b> 330, and Polara 500.|$|R

5|$|<b>Darts</b> is {{a widely}} popular sport in England; a {{professional}} competitive sport, <b>darts</b> is a traditional pub game. The sport is governed by the World <b>Darts</b> Federation, one of its member organisations is the BDO, which annually stages the Lakeside World Professional Championship, the other being the Professional <b>Darts</b> Corporation (PDC), which runs its own world championship at Alexandra Palace in London. Phil Taylor {{is widely regarded as}} the best <b>darts</b> player of all time, having won 187 professional tournaments, and a record 16 World Championships. Trina Gulliver is the ten-time Women's World Professional <b>Darts</b> Champion of the British <b>Darts</b> Organisation. Another popular sport commonly associated with pub games is Snooker, and England has produced several world champions, including Steve Davis and Ronnie O'Sullivan.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dart</b> {{came from}} a wealthy Chicago family. His father, Justin Whitlock <b>Dart</b> Sr., was {{president}} of <b>Dart</b> Industries.

50|$|Stand-alone: The <b>Dart</b> SDK also {{ships with}} a {{stand-alone}} <b>Dart</b> VM, allowing <b>dart</b> code {{to run in}} a command-line interface environment. As the language tools included in the <b>Dart</b> SDK are written mostly in <b>Dart,</b> the stand-alone <b>Dart</b> VM is {{a critical part of}} the SDK. These tools include the dart2js compiler, and a package manager suite called pub. <b>Dart</b> ships with a complete standard library allowing users to write fully working system apps, such as custom web servers.|$|R

5|$|During evolution, <b>darts</b> {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they had evolved and been functional. Vestigial <b>darts</b> (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E

50|$|A <b>dart</b> in a {{flat pattern}} has two {{important}} properties: its point, {{the point in the}} pattern at which the <b>dart</b> aims or converges, and the intake, or the amount of fabric taken in or removed. Since the <b>dart</b> can extend toward any edge of the pattern without affecting fit, the length of the <b>dart</b> intake {{at the edge of the}} fabric is not a good measure of <b>dart</b> intake. Rather, the angle subtracted from the pattern by the <b>dart</b> is what determines the <b>dart's</b> intake.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{arginine}} methylation in Drosophila melanogaster is unknown. We {{identified a}} family of nine PRMTs (protein arginine methyltransferases) by sequence homology with mammalian arginine methyltransferases, which we have named <b>DART</b> 1 to <b>DART</b> 9 (Drosophila arginine methyltransferases 1 - 9). In keeping with the mammalian PRMT nomenclature, <b>DART</b> 1, <b>DART</b> 4, <b>DART</b> 5 and <b>DART</b> 7 are the putative homologues of PRMT 1, PRMT 4, PRMT 5 and PRMT 7. Other <b>DART</b> family members have a closer resemblance to PRMT 1, but do not have identifiable homologues. All nine genes are expressed in Drosophila at various developmental stages. <b>DART</b> 1 and <b>DART</b> 4 have arginine methyltransferase activity towards substrates, including histones and RNA-binding proteins. Amino acid analysis of the methylated arginine residues confirmed that both <b>DART</b> 1 and <b>DART</b> 4 catalyse the formation of asymmetrical dimethylated arginine residues and they are type I arginine methyltransferases. The presence of PRMTs in D. melanogaster suggest that flies are a suitable genetic system to study arginine methylation...|$|R

50|$|The pin and pivot <b>dart</b> {{rotation}} technique requires tracing a new pattern {{from the}} original. First, the pattern with the <b>dart</b> {{to be rotated}} is set {{on top of another}} piece of paper on which the new pattern will be traced. A pin is pressed into the <b>dart</b> point to hold that point in place. Then one leg of the original <b>dart</b> and an arbitrary part of the original pattern is traced onto the paper. This tracing starts from the one <b>dart</b> leg and continues from there to the new point where the <b>dart</b> will reach the outside of the pattern piece. The pattern is then rotated around the pinned <b>dart</b> point until the other <b>dart</b> leg lines up with the traced <b>dart</b> leg. Tracing can then continue from the same spot on the original pattern. The pattern is then removed and the new <b>dart</b> legs drawn between the <b>dart</b> point (marked by the pin hole) and the gap in the pattern created during rotation.|$|R

5000|$|For 1962 the Seneca, Pioneer, and Phoenix trim {{levels were}} dropped; trim levels became <b>Dart,</b> <b>Dart</b> 330, and <b>Dart</b> 440. The Polara 500, offered in 2-door hardtop, 4-door hardtop, and {{convertible}} styles, was dimensionally identical but not officially a <b>Dart</b> {{by dint of}} its [...] "Polara 500" [...] badging.

5|$|The dart is {{shot with}} some {{variation}} in force, and with considerable inaccuracy, such that {{one-third of the}} <b>darts</b> that are fired in Cornu aspersum either fail to penetrate the skin, or miss the target altogether.

50|$|<b>Dart</b> {{initially}} had a mixed {{reception and}} the <b>Dart</b> initiative {{has been criticized}} by some for fragmenting the web, due to the original plans to include a <b>Dart</b> VM in Chrome. Those plans were dropped to focus instead on compiling <b>Dart</b> to JavaScript.|$|R
5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a <b>dart</b> to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of <b>dart</b> formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a <b>dart</b> before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a <b>dart</b> to use, because it takes time to create a replacement <b>dart.</b> In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new <b>dart</b> to form.|$|R
