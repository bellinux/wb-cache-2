A large quenched-in vacancy concentration at temperatures above about 873 K was apparent from the decrease in average lattice parameter. This was correlated to a lowering of the effective enthalpy of vacancy formation from about 91 to 42 kJ mol- 1, possibly caused {{by the presence of}} different types of point defect in lower- and higher- temperature regimes.

The most diffuse pollutants present in the particulates are sodium, lead, iron, calcium, zinc and vanadium: they can react with cordierite during regeneration of the filter. In this paper, the short-term interaction of these pollutants as oxides with cordierite filter was studied to examine the consequences on the ceramic characteristics, using <b>differential</b> <b>dilatometry,</b> coupled to X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). These investigations demonstrate that pollutant ions diffuse into the cordierite lattice, modifying its thermal expansion behaviour, often leading to surface etching and formation of new phases. Some of these new phases present a thermal expansion coefficient that is {{higher than that of}} pure cordierite one: different local dimensional variations in the ceramic structure lead to the appearance of microcracks.

Our {{results show that the}} formation entropy of vacancies is not constant as often assumed but increases almost linearly with temperature. The resulting highly nonlinear temperature dependence in the Gibbs formation energy naturally explains the differences between positron annihilation spectroscopy and <b>differential</b> <b>dilatometry</b> data and shows that nonlinear thermal corrections are crucial to extrapolate high-temperature experimental data to T= 0 [*][*]K. Employing these corrections—rather than the linear Arrhenius extrapolation that is commonly assumed in analyzing experimental data—revised formation enthalpies are obtained that differ up to 20 % from the previously accepted ones. Using the revised experimental formation enthalpies, we show that {{a large part of the}} discrepancies between DFT-GGA and unrevised experimental vacancy formation energies disappears. The substantial shift between previously accepted and the newly revised T= 0 [*][*]K formation enthalpies also has severe consequences in benchmarking ab initio methods against experiments, e. g., in deriving corrections that go beyond commonly used LDA and GGA exchange-correlation functionals such as the AM 05 functional...|$|E

Dilatometry was able to detect the end of hydride dissolution from concentrations around 60 wppm-H up to 650 wppm-H, where the eutectoid reaction: α + δ→α + β takes place (at 550 oC). We assume that this ability is a good indicator of the aptitude of the technique to measure dimensional changes in the given hydrogen concentration range.

40|$|The {{structure}} of the gel phase and {{the properties of the}} acyl chain disordering transition of dipalmitoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG) have been studied using differential scanning calorimetry, <b>differential</b> scanning <b>dilatometry,</b> and X-ray diffraction. In the presence of small, monovalent cations, DPPG at 22 ° C exists in a lamellar phase in which the hydrocarbon chains are tilted from the perpendicular to the bilayer surface. Around 34 °C, there is a small pretransition (ΔH < 1 kcal/mol) followed by the main transition at 40. 4 °C (ΔH = 8. 3 kcal/mol; ΔV = 0. 0381 ml/g). If DPPG is suspended in Tris-HCl buffer in the absence of other monovalent cations, X-ray diffraction data show that at 22 °C, the gel phase consists of interdigitated acyl chains perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer. No pretransition is observed and the main transition occurs at 41. 3 °C with ΔH = 9. 1 kcal/mol and ΔV = 0. 0511 ml/g. If sufficient Na^+ or K^+ ions are added to the Tris-buffered DPPG, the phase behavior reverts to what is observed in the absence of Tris. Analysis of the energetics of the main transition shows that the increase in van der Waals interaction energy resulting from the larger ΔV in Tris can be compensated by the favorable energetics of removing terminal methyl groups from the bilayer surface.

Unlike $ZrW_ 2 O_ 8 $ and $ZrV_ 2 O_ 7 $ which are cubic, the tetramolybdates are monoclinic (space group $P 2 _ 1 /c$). Nevertheless, the framework is similar to $ZrV_ 2 O_ 7 /ZrW_ 2 O_ 8 $ consisting of $MoO_ 4 $ tetrahedra that are weakly connected to $Mo_ 2 O_ 7 $ anions, which bind the Ln in a seven-fold anion coordination.

Practically, in SLM, a metallic powder is deposited layer-by-layer in a powder bed and then molten locally according to the desired shape. An important feature of this process is that the structure undergoes an ultra-fast cooling once the beam leaves the working zone, thus giving rise to strongly out-of-equilibrium microstructures. In the case of Ti alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V, in particular, the microstructural anisotropy resulting from the epitaxial growth of the newly deposited layer on the material previously solidified has been shown to exert a very strong influence on the mechanical properties [1] In the present work, the thermophysical behaviour of Ti-alloy Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and of stainless steel 316 L has been characterised in details, in order to reach {{a better understanding of the}} phenomena controlling the microstructures and mechanical properties of parts.

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, high energy and high peak power pulsed fibre lasers have found {{numerous}} applications in different industrial and scientific fields. They are commonly {{based on a}} master oscillator power amplifier (MOPA) architecture, that features a high power fibre amplifier stage based on a rare earth (RE) doped silica glass fibre. However, heavy doping of silica fibres is limited by clustering, therefore the fibres length has to be increased to several meters for efficient amplification. The consequence is an unwanted growth of nonlinearities along with fibre length, that impairs considerably the temporal pulse properties of the amplifier and prevents to achieve high peak power. Phosphate glasses have demonstrated in last years to be an alternative host material to silica glasses for RE doped optical fibres. In fact, they can incorporate high amounts of RE ions (up to 1021 ions/cm 3) without clustering, thus allowing the fabrication of extremely compact active devices with high gain per unit length. Moreover, they possess a large glass forming range, good thermo-mechanical and chemical properties, low nonlinear refractive index and no evidence of photodarkening even at high population inversion. In this work we present a new phosphate glass host composition, that was in-house developed {{in order to obtain}} a glass host stable, robust, able to incorporate high amount of RE ions and suitable for fibre drawing. Several Er 3 +-doped phosphate glass samples were fabricated by doping the developed host glass with concentrations of Er 3 + up to 10 mol%.

Nevertheless, interest in the science and technology of glass has expanded significantly in recent years {{as a result of the}} need to develop new materials for advanced applications. Examples of new materials in which glasses of various kinds are an essential constituent include glass ceramics which are prepared by crystallizing glass, glass matrix composities, glass fibre reinforced composities and optical-fibre glass. Sintered covalent ceramics, used for example for wear resistance and high temperature applications often also contain a small proportion of glass phase which is added intentionally to aid densification during sintering. In the development of such materials it has proved necessary to widen knowledge of the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of glass and how these are influenced by composition and microstructural morphology. The aim of the work presented in this thesis is to develop a better understanding of the crystallization behaviour of glasses in the system YSi-Al- 0 -(N) with small additions of ZrO 2 as a nucleating agent. Interest in the Y-Si-Al- 0 -(N) system stems not only from the fact that it forms the basis of glass phases added as sintering aids found as microstructural constituents in sintered Si 3 N 4 -based ceramics but also because glasses in this system have potential to form a relatively new group of refractory glass-ceramics. The study of compositions within this system in this work has involved investigation of: the glass formation in the Al 2 O 3 -Y 2 O 3 -Si 02 system under conditions of laser melting; the crystallization behaviour and properties of selected oxide and oxynitride glasses with / without addition of zirconia; the role of zirconia addition on the crystallization behaviour of Y-Si-Al- 0 -(N) glasses and on the melting of Y-Si-Al- 0 -(N) glass-ceramics; the YAG crystallization from an oxynitride glass relevant to the improved heat treatment of YAG-based glass-ceramics and YAG/beta-SiAlON materials. Techniques used in the investigations involved laser glass melting, conventional furnace glass melting, glass-ceramic furnace heat treatment, scanning electron microscopy, room temperature X-ray diffractometry, high temperature X-ray diffractometry, differential thermal analysis, <b>differential</b> scanning calorimetry, <b>dilatometry,</b> infrared spectroscopy, Vickers hardness and density measurements. The glass-forming region in the system Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 under conditions of laser melting was found to be more extensive than in earlier studies. No glass formed in compositions with less than 20 wt % SiO 2. 6 wt % of ZrO 2 can be dissolved in the investigated composition of the yttria-alumina-silica liquid at 1700 °C. When larger amounts are added a cubic crystalline phase of "yttria-stabilized zirconia" with a composition of Y 0. 15 Zr 0. 8501. 9 forms. The hardness and density of the zirconia-containing glasses are slightly higher than for the zirconiafree glasses. The glass transition temperature and softening temperature are lowered by the addition of zirconia. The Zr 4 + cation acts as a glass-network modifier causing lowering of the viscosity of the glass with a consequent decrease of the nucleation density. The optimum nucleation temperature of the ZrO 2 -containing glasses is marginally lower than that of the ZrO 2 -free glass. ZrO 2 acts as a crystal growth modifier rather than a nucleating agent during the crystallization of the ZrO 2 -containing glasses. Addition of ZrO 2 promotes the formation of the y-Y 2 Si 2 O 7 phase. Due to the lower viscosity of the retained glass in the ZrO 2 -containing glass-ceramics the rates of the phase transformations involved in the melting process are increased. The YAG crystallization from a ZrO 2 -free oxynitride glass was studied by high temperature X-ray diffractometry. It was found that the crystallization occurred preferably at free surfaces.
