40|$|Control of the {{energetics}} at interfaces {{is one of}} the key {{steps that}} improve the efficiency of light-emitting and energy-conversion devices based on organic materials. In this context, the present work is embedded in the field of organic electronics with a special focus on the electrode/semiconductor interface. Efficient electron injection and extraction is still a crucial mechanism that deserves improvement. Electron transport through this interface is dominated by the energetic injection barrier Delta_e. In order to gain control of this barrier, polar molecules have been used in this thesis to tailor the work function of the electrode. Three topics are addressed: (i) Understanding the chemical and electrical interface of N,N-dialkyl <b>dithiocarbamates</b> (CnDTC) on the noble metals Au, Ag and Cu. (ii) Work function tuning using tailor-made <b>dithiocarbamates.</b> (iii) Introduction of first results to generate low work functions of the transparent conductive indium tin oxide (ITO) based on a modified chemical structure of DTCs. To study these systems, a combination of X-ray and ultra-violet photoemission spectroscopy (XPS/UPS) with additional results from density functional theory (DFT) has been employed. Charge transport in electronic devices has been investigated using organic thin film transistors based on the n-type material PTCDI-C 13. (i) Prior to this thesis, the class of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> (DTC) have been reported by our research group to produce very low work functions of gold down to 3. 2 eV. This result marks the starting point for the present work. The assembly of N,N-dialkyl <b>dithiocarbamates</b> on the three noble metals Au, Ag and Cu has been analyzed with XPS. Therein, densely packed monolayers are identified on Au and Ag, while a disordered layer is observed on Cu. Nonetheless, a common work function of 3. 5 eV is revealed for CnDTC with n >= 4 on all metals with UPS. Only those molecules with the shortest alkyl chains, i. e. n = { 1, 2 }, were able to achieve 3. 2 eV on Au and Ag. The final work function of the modified metals results from a complex interplay of molecular arrangement (surface coverage, orientation), interface dipole formation and the energy level alignment at the interface. The detailed comparison of C 2 DTC as a model system on the three noble metals generates a deeper insight into the chemical and electronic structure. Based on experimental and theoretical results, a common hybridization of the frontier S 3 p orbital with those of the frontier metal d-states is identified to generate a metal/molecule interface state, that remains irrespective of the initial metal work function. (ii) A new set of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> are introduced and the effect of different polar groups attached to the molecular backbone is discussed. The molecular structure of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> has been modified using, among others, aromatic and fluorinated substitutions to induce different dipole moments. These directly affect the resulting work function of a modified electrode and enables the generation of a broad range of available work function values for noble metals using differently substituted <b>dithiocarbamates.</b> (iii) At last, the step towards modification of transparent conductive oxides based on the molecular structure of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> is explored for the commonly used indium tin oxide (ITO) as substrate. For metal oxides, a different linker group is required to bind to this kind of surface. Therefore, amine based carboxylic acids have been investigated as first candidates to lower the work function of ITO. A reduction down to 4. 0 eV is demonstrated. This result may serve as guideline to create new surface modifiers that should generate even lower work functions similar to those of <b>dithiocarbamates</b> on noble metals...|$|R
