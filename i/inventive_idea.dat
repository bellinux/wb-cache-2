40|$|Fractals are {{geometric}} {{objects of}} inexhaustible detail. Fractal structures {{have been found}} in the contours of mountain ranges, the patterns of veins on a leaf, and the fluctuations of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The endeavor of inventing new technologies, consisting of a hierarchical network of practical inquiries, exhibits fractal properties as well. Among these are multiplicity, latency, and self-similarity. Multiplicity means that a single <b>inventive</b> <b>idea</b> may lead to an immense and diverse array of technological artifacts. Latency means that the potential of an <b>inventive</b> <b>idea</b> to yield practical embodiments only reveals itself in time, and may never be fully known. Self-similarity means that invention is not scale-dependent; in other words, breakthroughs and refinements may be difficult, in principle, to distinguish. Invention, as a whole, resembles an ever-expanding fractal island of promontory upon promontory. Patent law assigns a particular inventor legal rights to a portion of that intricate coastline. The fractal properties of multiplicity, latency, and self-similarity contribute to many of the perennial difficulties in patent law, including fixing the meaning of claim language, properly applying the enablement and written description requirements, and identifying “abstract ideas” that cannot be patented. Understanding the fractal properties of invention is an important step in addressing these issues...|$|E
40|$|Fiber optics {{are widely}} used in {{flexible}} endoscopes which are indispensable for many applications in diagnosis and therapy. Computer-aided use of fiberscopes requires a digital sensor mounted at the proximal end. Most commercially available cameras for endoscopy provide the images {{by means of a}} regular grid of color filters {{what is known as the}} Bayer Pattern. Hence, the images suffer from false colored spatial moiré, which is further stressed by the downgrading fiber optic transmission yielding a honey comb pattern. To solve this problem we propose a new approach that extends the interpolation between known intensities of registered fibers to multi channel color applications. The <b>inventive</b> <b>idea</b> takes into account both the Gaussian intensity distribution of each fiber and the physical color distribution of the Bayer pattern. Individual color factors for interpolation of each fiber area make it possible to simultaneously remove both the comb structure from the fiber bundl e as well as the Bayer pattern mosaicking from the sensor while preserving depicted structures and textures in the scene...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{focuses on}} the concept of patent scope, and {{contributes}} to existing research in three ways. First, it offers a re-examination of the construct and identifies two dimensions of patent scope, (1) the number of variations of the core <b>inventive</b> <b>idea</b> identified in the patent, reflected in the number of claims in the patent (e. g. Merges and Nelson, 1994); and (2) the positioning of those variations in the inventive space, which is reflected in the number of technological classes in which patent examiners classify those claims. Second, it investigates the implications of patent scope for the firm's subsequent inventive performance, and finds that, when the scope of a patents spans across a higher number of technological classes, {{the extent to which the}} inventing firm itself succeeds in building on the knowledge underlying its own patent is lower. Third, it investigates the antecedents of scope, and suggests that prior investment in scientific knowledge and in related inventive experience are two factors that affect the scope of the patents that firms develop. The theoretical predictions elaborated in this paper are supported by an empirical examination of a longitudinal sample of firms in the photonics industry...|$|E

The analysis finds pervasive deconcentration across a wide set of areas. It also finds that the deconcentration takes place despite the role lateral entry by existing firms plays in driving concentration levels up. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that the deconcentration trend cannot be attributed to a single supply factor in the market for ideas, such as the breakdown of AT 2 ̆ 6 T during the deregulation of the telecommunications industry...|$|R

Prior to patenting, inventors work in networks of similar dimension and structure as those of their colleagues who do not invent. The ego-networks of the inventors are however more cohesive (denser), a circumstance that is often seen as associated to the exchange of more fine-grained information and to a greater climate of trust which facilitates long-term relationships and learning. Over time, both inventors and non-inventors extend their networks and become more central. In general, we {{found no evidence that}} after patenting inventors isolate or close their networks...|$|R
