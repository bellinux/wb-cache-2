40|$|Initial {{reaction}} rate data for lactic dehydrogenase / pyruvate, lactic dehydrogenase / lactate and malic dehydrogenase / malate enzyme reactions were analyzed to obtain activation free energy changes of - 329, - 195 and - 221 cal/mole, respectively, for rate increases associated with time-specific irradiation of the crystalline substrates prior to dissolution and incorporation in the reaction solutions. These energies, presumably, correspond to conformational or vibrational changes <b>in</b> the <b>reactants</b> <b>or</b> the activated complex. For the lactic dehydrogenase / pyruvate reaction, {{it is estimated}} that on the order of 10 % of the irradiation energy (546 nm, 400 footcandles for 5 seconds) would be required to produce the observed {{reaction rate}} increase if a presumed photoproduct is consumed stoichiometrically with the pyruvate substrate. These findings are consistent with the proposition that the observed reaction rate enhancement involves photoproducts derived from oscillatory atmospheric gas reactions at the crystalline enzyme substrate surfaces rather than photo-excitations of the substrate molecules, per se.

25|$|Initially, More O’Ferrall {{introduced}} {{this type of}} analysis to discuss the continuity between concerted and step-wise β-elimination reaction mechanisms. The model also provided a framework within which to explain the effects of substituents and reaction conditions on the mechanism. The appropriate lower energy species were placed {{at the corners of}} the two dimensional plot (Figure 2). These were the reactants (top left), the products (bottom right) and the intermediates of the two possible stepwise reactions: the carbocation for E1 (bottom left) and the carbanion for E1cB (top-right). Thus, the horizontal axes represent the extent of deprotonation (C-H bond distance) and the vertical axes represent the extent of leaving group departure (C-LG distance). By applying the Hammond and anti-Hammond effects, he predicted the effects of various changes <b>in</b> the <b>reactants</b> <b>or</b> reaction conditions. For example, the effects of introducing a better leaving group on a substrate that initially eliminates via an E2 mechanism are illustrated in Figure 2. A better leaving group increases the energy of the reactants and of the carbanion intermediate. Thus, the transition state moves towards the reactants and away from the carbanion intermediate.|$|R

50|$|Many {{intermediates}} are short-lived {{and highly}} reactive, thus having a low {{concentration in the}} reaction mixture. As is always the case when discussing chemical kinetics, definitions like fast/slow short/long-lived are relative, and depend on the relative rates of all the reactions involved.

40|$|Radical-molecule {{reaction}} {{barriers are}} often {{the product of an}} avoided curve crossing between two states: the reactant ground state, which ultimately correlates with a product ionic state, and a reactant ionic state, which ultimately correlates with the product ground state. The energy, location, and loose-mode frequencies of the transition state are controlled by this interaction. The curve crossing itself is constrained by long-range Coulombic forces acting primarily on the ionic states as the reactants approach each other. The crossing height is in essence a geometric mean of the ionic surface heights; a low ionic state energy <b>in</b> either the <b>reactants</b> <b>or</b> the products will force a low reaction barrier. The crossing location is controlled primarily by any asymmetry <b>in</b> the <b>reactant</b> and product ionic heights, while the interaction distance of the transition state is controlled by a balance in gradients on the ground and ionic states. The frequencies related to translation of the separated reagents within the center of mass frame of reference are controlled by the same physics controlling the barrier height, as is the imaginary frequency associated with the reaction itself. This drives a tight correlation between barrier heights, transition state frequencies (and thus preexponential terms), and the imaginary frequency (and thus the tunneling term). This is demonatrated by analyzing a series of H atom transfers from a mainfold of alkanes to a mainfold of atoms. The Hammond postulatesreaction enthalpy controls transition state locationsdoes not correspond to the mechanism controlling either barrier height or location, but rather appears to work in cases where ionization potential correlates with bond strengths...|$|R
