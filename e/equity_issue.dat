25|$|From the 1970s onwards, {{environmentalism}} {{became an}} increasing {{concern of the}} left, with social movements and some unions campaigning over environmental issues. For example, the left-wing Builders Labourers Federation in Australia, led by the communist Jack Mundy, united with environmentalists to place Green Bans on environmentally destructive development projects. Some segments of the socialist and Marxist left consciously merged environmentalism and anti-capitalism into an eco-socialist ideology. Barry Commoner articulated a left-wing response to The Limits to Growth model that predicted catastrophic resource depletion and spurred environmentalism, postulating that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation, as opposed to population pressures. Environmental degradation {{can be seen as}} a class or <b>equity</b> <b>issue,</b> as environmental destruction disproportionately affects poorer communities and countries.|$|E

We find that the stock price {{reaction}} to the announcement of public <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> is significantly positive during the bubble period and insignificantly negative during the post-bubble period. In regression analysis, {{we find that the}} key explanatory variable of new public <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> is the future profitability of the firm. Also, investors are indifferent to the offering amount, director’s shareholding, and investment expenditures. Hence, we show that Japanese capital market is becoming efficient after bubble...|$|R

50|$|A {{seasoned}} equity offering {{or secondary}} equity offering (SEO) or capital increase {{is a new}} <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> by an already publicly traded company.

50|$|Donaldson {{observed}} that firms prefer first to finance investment with retained earnings, then, {{when they need}} outside funding, they prefer to issue severe debt instead of equity. It suggests that capital structures are determined largely by the history of needs for external finance. Pecking order theory explains negative intra-industry correlation between profitability and debt to equity ratio, and the negative share price reaction on announcement of an <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> (i.e. information asymmetric).|$|E

40|$|We analyze equity {{financing}} for a two-stage investment and consider different informational structures. When private information is short-term, equilibria {{are consistent with}} signalling theory and pecking-order theory. When private information is long-term, equilibria may exist where high quality firms <b>issue</b> <b>equity.</b> The model explains the link between debt-equity choice and subsequent performance after issue (short-term versus long-term). A set of new predictions is generated regarding {{the link between the}} extent of asymmetric information and <b>equity</b> <b>issues,</b> macroeconomic performance and <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> and market timing. ...|$|R
40|$|I {{investigate}} the real economic effect of mutual funds. As informed financiers, mutual funds have superior {{ability to identify}} productive firms, and can allocate capital more efficiently in <b>equity</b> <b>issues.</b> A simple model of mutual fund intermediation demonstrates a positive relation between mutual fund investment in <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> and subsequent output growth. Empirically, at both the aggregate and industry level, I find that new <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> lead to higher real output, only when there is high mutual fund participation in these issues. In addition, the participation-output sensitivity is stronger when fund flows are low. At the firm-level, mutual fund investment in seasoned offerings positively predicts subsequent firm productivity growth. Further tests suggest that the results {{are unlikely to be}} driven by reverse causality explanations...|$|R
50|$|New <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> {{may have}} {{specific}} legal clauses attached that differentiate them from previous {{issues of the}} issuer.

Often, new issues {{that have not been}} registered with a securities governing body may be restricted from resale for certain periods of time.|$|E
50|$|After caddy Garland Dempsey {{collapsed}} at the Western Open {{in early}} July, the PGA Tour allowed male caddies, on a trial basis, to wear shorts on extremely hot days. Two years earlier, the USGA changed its policy and allowed caddies to wear shorts at the U.S. Open in June 1997. The shorts dispute had surfaced at the PGA Championship in August 1996 as a gender <b>equity</b> <b>issue,</b> as female caddies {{were allowed to}} wear them, but not males.|$|E

Constant mismanagement by Flegg and Prior could have averted a collapse had they had the ethical intent in maintaining a going concern through an <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> well before the collapse. Cash forecasting must have been foreseeable. There is no proof of undesirable behaviour, but this can be strongly assumed if incompetence from Flegg as CEO and Prior as CFO is not valid.|$|E
40|$|Recent studies {{find that}} {{aggregate}} <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> predict market returns in the U. S. market. In this research, I examine whether such predictive effect {{exists in the}} global stock market. I use an aggregate approach across 41 countries with diverse legal regimes. The results confirm the presence of predictability of aggregate <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> in the global market. In addition to aggregate equity shares, the annual frequency of <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> {{also appears to be}} a strong predictor of market stock returns. Furthermore, I find that the predictive power is related to the level of information asymmetry in a country due to cross country differences in legal protections and accounting disclosure standards.

Premier also became a 'grocery-only' business with {{the movement of the}} Hovis brand into a joint venture with US-based venture capital fund The Gores Group. Premier Foods sold a controlling 51% stake in the joint venture to The Gores Group, which saw Hovis become a private company.|$|E
5000|$|Investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are {{frequently}} intermediaries in the <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> process, {{and for some}} of these firms the fees associated with IPOs are a substantial part of their income. The role of these banks is to study the characteristics and business plans of the firm which is issuing equity and then recommend a minimum purchase price to investors.

40|$|Delays in {{construction}} projects are a recurring and global problem, with delays in land acquisition {{considered one of}} the largest contributors of delays in large construction projects in Vietnam. This research aims to investigate the formation of equity perceptions of land-acquired households and the relationship between <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> and delays {{in construction}} projects. A theoretical model with four propositions, is proposed that links <b>equity</b> <b>issues,</b> comparisons, <b>equity</b> perceptions, and responses of land-acquired communities that cause delays in large construction projects in Vietnam. Using a case study approach, semi-structured interviews of 40 land-acquired households was conducted across two large construction projects in Vietnam. The findings of this research could provide better understanding of the relationship between <b>equity</b> <b>issues</b> and delays, which can help to minimise delays in large construction projects...|$|R

Yang was the chairman. Creating Sun TV required plenty of capital. Early that year they took over Leung Kee Holdings, an ailing Hong Kong construction company. Working with the investment bankers Worldsec International, an investment-house affiliate of The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Wu injected SunTV's assets into Leung Kee and used its Hong Kong stock exchange listing to float a new <b>equity</b> <b>issue.</b> The issue raised $28 million in new capital for Sun TV; Yang and Wu injected another $11 million.|$|E
50|$|Some {{scholars}} {{consider the}} changing cultural trends that move society {{away from the}} norm of adult children caring for elderly parents to be an intergenerational <b>equity</b> <b>issue.</b> The older generation had {{to care for their}} parents, as well as their own children, while the younger generation must only care for their children. This is especially true in countries with weak social security systems. Professor Sang-Hyop Lee describes the presence of this phenomenon in South Korea, explaining that the current elderly now have the highest poverty rate among any developed country. He notes that is particularly frustrating because the elderly had invested spent a lot on their children's education, and they now feel betrayed.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{status is}} highly {{correlated}} to {{water and sanitation}} service access in urban environments. But economic status is often tied to other demographic characteristics such as caste, ethnicity, and race. Therefore, access to water and sanitation services is an <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> that faces urban planners working for urban governments. In the absence of policy to address these infrastructural disparities, the urban poor and minorities suffer disproportionately. A study of the social determinants of children’s health in urban settings in India looked at data from India’s National Family Health Survey and found that even within poor urban areas, caste status, religion, and sex are major factors which determine family employment and education level, factors which in turn affect access to sanitation and water.|$|E

50|$|Coase {{argued that}} without {{transaction}} costs the initial assignment {{of property rights}} makes no difference {{to whether or not}} the farmer and rancher can achieve the economically efficient outcome. If the cost of restraining cattle by, say, building a fence, is less than the cost of crop damage, the fence will be built. The initial assignment of property rights determines who builds the fence. If the farmer is responsible for the crop damage, the farmer will pay for the fence (as long the fence costs less than the crop damage). If the rancher is responsible for the crop damage, the rancher will build the fence. The allocation of property rights is primarily an <b>equity</b> <b>issue,</b> with consequences for the distribution of income and wealth, rather than an efficiency issue.|$|E
40|$|The {{aggregate}} {{volume of}} equity issues {{is used to}} search for periods when seasoned equity capital can be raised at favorable terms. The authors find that the price reaction to <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> announcements in high <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> volume periods is approximately 200 basis points lower on average than in low <b>equity</b> <b>issue</b> volume periods. The lower price reaction in hot markets is economically important and is independent of the macroeconomic characteristics of hot and cold markets. The evidence supports the existence of windows of opportunity for equity issues that result at least partially from reduced levels of asymmetric information.
