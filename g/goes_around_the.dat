5|$|Mulder and Scully {{go to the}} Shipley {{house and}} find the {{bathroom}} door barricaded shut, no sign of any people. The two have a brief run-in with Deputy Greer who believes they are burglars until Mulder disarms the man and Scully shows him her FBI ID. They attempt {{to go to the}} airport but are trapped by the hurricane. Elsewhere at the Breakers Condominiums, Deputy Greer encounters the creature after finding a dead man covered in a slimy substance on a toilet. Mulder and Scully later find the deputy's vehicle parked outside the apartments. Searching the building, they discover Greer on the ground, his neck covered with red welts. Mulder <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> complex to find {{the rest of the people}} and warn them that the thing is in the plumbing. He encounters Dougie, a looter, Walter Suarez whose girlfriend Angela Villareal is nine months pregnant, and George Vincent, an anti-government Second Amendment activist. Mulder attempts to get Vincent to come out and join them for his own protection. Vincent refuses but, after being attacked by the creature in his apartment, relents. Mulder hypothesizes that the entity attacking them was driven from the bottom of the sea by the hurricane into the city's water system.|$|E
5|$|The {{equatorial}} ring <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> {{belly of}} the armillary sphere 91 and 5/19 (degrees) away from the pole. The circle of the ecliptic also goes round the {{belly of the}} instrument at an angle of 24 (degrees) with the equator. Thus at the summer solstice the ecliptic is 67 (degrees) and a fraction away from the pole, while at the winter solstice it is 115 (degrees) and a fraction away. Hence (the points) where the ecliptic and the equator intersect should give the north polar distances of the spring and autumn equinoxes. But now (it has been recorded that) the spring equinox is 90 and 1/4 (degrees) away from the pole, and the autumn equinox is 92 and 1/4 (degrees) away. The former figure is adopted only because it agrees with the (results obtained by the) method of measuring solstitial sun shadows as embodied in the Xia (dynasty) calendar.|$|E
5|$|The Basingstoke Canal {{started at}} a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran {{alongside}} the River Loddon following {{the line of}} Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing, where the route <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> now ruined palace of Basing House and then through and around {{the eastern edge of}} Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell. The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation, which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge.|$|E

25|$|A {{person who}} <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world {{from east to}} west (the same {{direction}} as Magellan's voyage) would gain or set their clock back one hour for every 15° of longitude crossed, and would gain 24 hours for one circuit of the globe {{from east to west}} if they did not compensate by setting their clock forward one day when they crossed the IDL. In contrast, a west-to-east circumnavigation of the globe loses an hour for every 15° of longitude crossed but gains back a day when crossing the IDL. The IDL must therefore be observed in conjunction with the Earth's time zones: on crossing it in either direction, the calendar date is adjusted by one day.|$|E

25|$|Swan {{was born}} on the Cheyenne River Reservation to Lakota, Western Sioux parents in 1928. She was the fifth child of ten, of which only five survived to adulthood. Makoka Winge’ Win (<b>Goes</b> <b>Around</b> <b>The</b> World Woman) was her Indian name given to her by her father. Her parents, James Hart Swan and Lucy Josephine High Pine-Swan were born {{around the turn of}} the 20th century. Madonna’s father James {{completed}} education at both Chilocco Indian Agricultural School, an Indian school in Oklahoma, where he would have been taught a skilledtrade geared toward agriculture, and two years at Haskell Indian College, which was the equivalent to a junior college. For the first five years of her life the Swan family lived with Madonna’s paternal great-uncle, known as Grandpa Puts On His Shoes, or Grandpa Puts for short. American Indian elders of the age cohort of Grandpa Puts (born before 1900) were alive during the nomadic days before the Indian victory and defeat of Custer at Little Big Horn and the subsequent final Indian confinement on indian reservations. Madonna Swan’s childhood was filled with beliefs and customs of the traditional Indian lifestyle. She relates a story of being cured of warts with the rubbing of a raw potato on them, applied by her father.|$|E

500|$|Kenyon {{was born}} on 5 November 1732 in Gredington, Flintshire to Lloyd Kenyon, a country gentleman and Justice of the peace, and his wife Jane Eddowes. He was {{initially}} educated at a school in Hanmer – it was written that [...] "no man ever set out on his career with fewer advantages" [...] than Kenyon. When he was 12 {{he was sent to}} Ruthin School, where he learnt French and Latin, and was considered one of the best students at the school. His knowledge of Greek was non-existent, and his scientific training minor; [...] "he was said to have believed to his dying day that the sun <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> earth". As a second son, he had initially considered joining the clergy, but instead decided on the law and spent 5 years working as a clerk to Mr W.J. Tomkinson, an attorney. He proved to be an excellent clerk, becoming a [...] "rapid and accurate conveyancer". Originally happy with the idea of being a simple attorney, {{after the death of his}} older brother it was instead assumed he would become a barrister, and Kenyon joined the Middle Temple in November 1750. In February 1755 he left Tomkinson's practice and moved to London, where he was called to the Bar on 10 February 1756.|$|E
500|$|Hogan's {{obituary}} stated that, at {{some point}} in his playing career, he set a record for baserunning. [...] Several sources trace this record to a field day event held in Indianapolis in 1895, when he reportedly rounded the bases in 13.2 seconds. The World Almanac and Encyclopedia 1906, for instance, reported that Hogan [...] "lowered the base-running record" [...] in 1895, noting that [...] "he distance around the bases is 120 yards". [...] In January 1906, Sporting Life reported that Hogan had [...] "taken steps to have the base running record awarded to him". [...] The report added, [...] "Under proper conditions [...] turned the route in 13 15 seconds at Indianapolis in 1895". [...] Some observers questioned the veracity of the record, however. [...] In 1907, for instance, Washington Post sports columnist J. Ed Grillo conceded that [...] "Hogan was a great sprinter" [...] but described his unofficial record as [...] "out of reason". [...] Grillo, who argued that [...] "the fastest runners in baseball failed to come anywhere near the mark", lent his support to an official record of 14.1 that had been set more recently by Eastern League player Wally Clement. [...] An article published in the Washington Herald days earlier also raised questions about Hogan's baserunning record. [...] In this case, however, the writer claimed that the most [...] "authentic" [...] record had been set by Harry Berthrong in the 1860s. [...] The article stated that, while Hogan was [...] "said to have beaten Berthrong's base-circling record of 13 25 seconds by a fifth of a second", this alleged feat was not [...] "performed under official sanction". [...] One year earlier, in 1906, Berthrong, himself, weighed in on the debate. [...] According to an article that appeared in [...] Sporting Life in March of that year, Berthrong disputed Hogan's claim. [...] "My time...around the bases was made in Washington, D.C., in July 1868, after the old Nationals of Washington, D.C., had played a game with the Pastimes of Baltimore, Md.", Berthrong was quoted as saying in an interview. [...] "Three stop watches were held over me, the slowest giving me 14 1/4". [...] The retired player added: [...] "I am skeptical about this man Hogan doing the bases in 13 1-5: nobody but an Arthur Duffey could possibly do it, and I doubt if he could". [...] For reasons that are unclear, the article indicated that Hogan claimed to round the bases in 1889, six earlier than other reports. (A similar description of Hogan's claim appeared elsewhere in the same edition of Sporting Life; a brief news item suggested he claimed to set the record [...] "in Indianapolis in the 80's".) Baseball historian Jon Daly traced Hogan's contested record to 1898; he speculated that Ben Morgan, an official of the National Association, [...] "disputed that claim when doing a study of field day records". [...] The most widely accepted national baserunning record was set by Evar Swanson, who rounded the bases in 13.4 seconds in 1929. [...] Despite questions surrounding Hogan's baserunning record, he became popularly known as the [...] "Indianapolis Ringer". [...] Newspaper reports suggest he defended his position as baserunning champion of the Western League in various pre-game competitions. [...] On August 2, 1895, the Vindicator noted that the outfielder had [...] "a rival for the base running honors in the western league in George Nichol of the Milwaukees who, it is claimed, can get down to first quicker than Hogan". [...] The article added, [...] "A race between the two is talked of". [...] Then, on August 17, 1895, the Vindicator reported that Hogan had defeated Detroit outfielder Frank Tower in a baserunning contest. [...] "The Hoosiers have in Mart Hogan a pretty good extra card", the article added. [...] "Indianapolis <b>goes</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> land, and their sprinting outfielder meets all comers in foot races before the game. [...] He has not yet been defeated". [...] Several days earlier, the same newspaper quoted a journalist from Sporting Life, who reportedly commented: [...] "Mart Hogan, the Indianapolis outfielder, is showing such astonishing speed that he will probably be taken to England next year for the Sheffield Handicap".|$|E
