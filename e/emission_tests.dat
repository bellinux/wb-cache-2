25|$|Though Los Angeles {{was one of}} {{the best}} known cities {{suffering}} from transportation smog for much of the 20th century, so much so that it was sometimes said that Los Angeles was a synonym for smog, strict regulations by government agencies overseeing this problem, including tight restrictions on allowed emissions levels for all new cars sold in California and mandatory regular <b>emission</b> <b>tests</b> of older vehicles, resulted in significant improvements in air quality. For example, air concentrations of volatile organic compounds declined by a factor of 50 between 1962 and 2012. Concentrations of air pollutants such as nitrous oxides and ozone declined by 70% to 80% over the same period of time.|$|E

Unlike ambient discourse dirty diesel versus clean petrol cars, the results are much more nuanced and subtle. Some Euro 6 diesel cars perform as well as the best hybrid petrol cars; some other recent Euro 6 petrol indirect injection cars perform as the worst Euro 5 diesel cars; finally some petrol hybrid cars are at the same level as the best Euro 5 diesel cars.|$|E

40|$|Local {{government}} of Jakarta issued a bylaw on air pollution controls for mobile sources, stipulates that all private car owners must get their vehicles’ <b>emission</b> <b>tested</b> biennially. In consequence of non-compliance vehicle in <b>emissions</b> <b>test,</b> vehicle maintenance is essential. Vehicle owner should take an appropriate action {{in order to}} reduce pollutant level lower than standard. This study attempts to analyze economic aspect and emission level considerations come into making optimal choice of vehicle owner. First, we examine the influential factors of action taken in maintenance process of non-compliance vehicle on probability of vehicle to pass the second stage <b>emissions</b> <b>test.</b> Second, due to variation of actions taken in the maintenance process, we analyze impact on cost and explore components affects on variation of maintenance cost. Empirical analysis was done by using Inspection and Maintenance data in year 2000 which collected at several auto-mechanic shops in Jakarta city. The bivariate probit model was applied to examine impact of chosen alternatives on the probability to pass Hydrocarbon and Carbon Monoxide in second <b>emission</b> <b>test.</b> To examine variation of maintenance cost and explore components affects on cost, multilevel approach was applied. It is confirm that several actions may increase probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> but on the same time reduce average cost. Other actions may simultaneously increase probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> and also increase cost. It was also found some actions didn`t have impact on <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> {{but on the other hand}} rise maintenance cost. Furthermore, some actions reduce probability to pass <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> but increase maintenance cost. Vehicle owner need to properly select actions in order to maximize benefit and minimize cost. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} evaluate emission measurement of on road vehicle. In this regard, the research develops failure probability model of vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for passenger car which utilize binomial logit model. The model focuses on failure of CO and HC <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for gasoline cars category and Opacity <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for diesel-fuel cars category as dependent variables, while vehicle age, engine size, brand {{and type of}} the cars as independent variables. In order to implement the model, a survey to measure the vehicle emission was done to the two categories of passenger cars on road. Other information related to {{the characteristics of the}} cars sampling was collected in the survey. The survey was done at two main roads in Makassar City, one of the large cities in Indonesia. According to calculation result, the model gave good appearance. In further, the results showed that vehicle age became significant variable to determine the failure probability of vehicle <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for CO and HC emission of gasoline cars category. As well as, engine size gave significant contribution to the failure of Opacity <b>emission</b> <b>test</b> for diesel-fuel cars category.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the abilities of acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> and self-sensing fibres to detect damage in composite materials. This was achieved by performing acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> on fibre samples and resin samples during tensile tests. In parallel to the acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> the changes in strain for the resin samples was recorded using electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. Acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing</b> of Self-sensing fibre composites allowed the recorded changes in the light intensity transmitted by the fibres to be analysed in conjunction with the acoustic emission data. The fabrication of the three different sample types is presented as is the installation of the electrical resistance strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings. The experimental procedure and method of data capture is detailed for tensile and acoustic <b>emission</b> <b>testing,</b> strain data and Self-sensing fibre data. The fabrication and testing of the samples was performed successfully. The testing procedure and analysis of results demonstrates the accurate use of acoustic emission and the potential of self-sensing fibres in detecting damage in composite materials...|$|R

5000|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century, dynamometers (or [...] "dyno" [...] for short) {{have been used}} to measure torque and {{rotational}} speed (measured in rpm) from which power produced by an engine, motor or other rotating prime mover can then be calculated. A chassis dynamometer measures power from the engine through the wheels. The vehicle is parked on rollers which the car then turns and the output is measured. These dynos can be fixed or portable. Because of frictional and mechanical losses in the various drivetrain components, the measured horsepower is generally 15-20 percent less than the brake horsepower measured at the crankshaft or flywheel on an engine dynamometer. [...] Historically though, dynamometer <b>emission</b> <b>tests</b> are very expensive, and have usually involved removing fleet vehicles from service {{for a long period of}} time. Also, the data derived from such testing is not representative of “real world” driving conditions, not least due to numerous and ample flexibilities in laboratory test procedures, particularly in the European Union's [...] "New European Driving Dycle (NEDC)". Beyond that, this test method cannot be deemed as representative, especially due to the relatively low amount of repeatable tests at such a facility.|$|E
