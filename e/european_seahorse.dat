40|$|Hippocampus guttulatus is a <b>European</b> <b>seahorse</b> species whose {{breeding}} {{in captivity}} started in 2006 {{in the frame of}} “Proyecto Hippocampus. Until recently, attempts to develop a rearing methodology resulted in low survivals during early development mainly due to mortalities associated with swimbladder hyperinflation. In order to improve survival and growth rates, the most appropriate rearing conditions concerning zootechnics (type of aquaria, aeration level), physical factors (photoperiod regime, temperature) and feeding (type/quality of prey, prey digestibility and digestive capabilities) were assessed. The results achieved allowed {{for the first time the}} closure of the life cycle of H. guttulatus, the incorporation of the species into the aquarium trade and the definition of a standard procedure (pseudoKreisel aquaria, strong aeration, 19 - 20 ºC, 16 L: 8 D photoperiod regime and copepods + Artemia diet) for the successful rearing of the species providing high survivals (70 - 90 % at 30 DAR) and growth rates...|$|E
40|$|Accurate taxonomy, {{population}} demography, {{and habitat}} descriptors inform species threat assessments {{and the design}} of effective conservation measures. Here we combine published studies with new genetic, morphological and habitat data that were collected from seahorse populations located along the European and North African coastlines to help inform management decisions for <b>European</b> <b>seahorses.</b> This study confirms the presence of only two native seahorse species (Hippocampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus) across Europe, with sporadic occurrence of non-native <b>seahorse</b> species in <b>European</b> waters. For the two native species, our findings demonstrate that highly variable morphological characteristics, such as size and presence or number of cirri, are unreliable for distinguishing species. Both species exhibit sex dimorphism with females being significantly larger. Across its range, H. guttulatus were larger and found at higher densities in cooler waters, and individuals in the Black Sea were significantly smaller than in other populations. H. hippocampus were significantly larger in Senegal. Hippocampus guttulatus tends to have higher density populations than H. hippocampus when they occur sympatrically. Although these species are often associated with seagrass beds, data show both species inhabit {{a wide variety of}} shallow habitats and use a mixture of holdfasts. We suggest an international mosaic of protected areas focused on multiple habitat types as the first step to successful assessment, monitoring and conservation management of these Data Deficient species...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Knowledge on {{seahorses}} {{is generally}} scarce {{but has been}} increasing in recent years due to their conservation status. Seahorse culture is a quite recent activity {{in the field of}} marine aquaculture in most countries attempting it, and captive breeding techniques are available only for some species. With the aim of contributing to the development of breeding in captivity for conservative purposes, broodstocks of the <b>European</b> long-snouted <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus guttulatus) were established with 32 wild seahorses captured in Galicia (NW Spain). This study describes the methodologies applied to the maintenance of the broodstocks, with special reference to aquaria design, feeding, growth and breeding. Procedures of seahorse identification (morphologically and genetically) as a tool for broodstock management are also considered. The results achieved during the first year demonstrate a rapid adaptation of wild seahorses to captive conditions. Seahorses were fed exclusively on enriched adult Artemia and displayed high growth rates. However, fatty acid analyses performed on unfertilised eggs of captive broodstock showed a progressive decrease with time in the content of essential fatty acids (DHA, EPA), suggesting the need for improvement in the nutritional quality of broodstock feed. 1...|$|R

Historical and {{contemporary}} population genetic connectivity of the <b>European</b> short-snouted <b>seahorse</b> Hippocampus hippocampus {{and implications for}} management. Journal of Fish Biology, 78 (6), 1738 - 1756. This first genetic study of Hippocampus hippocampus covers the species' entire geographic range and employs two mtDNA markers (control region and cytochrome b) to establish patterns of population structuring. A total of 255 specimens from 21 locations were used to obtain 89 concatenated haplotypes. The common haplotype was present {{in all but one}} population, however, most haplotypes were unique. The haplotype network had a star-like construction, suggesting expansion from a bottleneck event. F-ST and AMOVA revealed population subdivision into three geographic regions (English Channel + Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean Sea + Atlantic Ocean Iberian coast + Macaronesian Islands, and West Africa) with barriers to gene flow indentified at Cape Finisterre and the Cape Verde frontal zone. Neutrality tests and nested clade analysis suggest a complex demographic history, with both historic events {{and contemporary}} processes shaping patterns of genetic differentiation. The genetic population subdivision detected in this study indicates that H. hippocampus should be managed as three separate units. This is especially pertinent as H. hippocampus populations within the West African region are the only ones known to be specifically targeted for exploitation.

40|$|My thesis {{examined}} {{the implications of}} life history and ecology for population-level responses of the <b>European</b> long-snouted <b>seahorse</b> (Hippocampus guttulatus Cuvier 1829) to habitat alteration, exploitation and a recommended minimum size limit for seahorse management. The research employed a mark-recapture study, underwater visual censuses (UVCs) and catch data from an unrelated experimental sampling program in the Ria Formosa Lagoon (southern Portugal). These small-bodied fish are characterized by rapid growth rate, early age at maturity, high natural mortality, short generation time, short life span and multiple spawnings per year, traits that are usually associated with resilience to exploitation. However specialized parental care, complex social interactions, small adult home ranges and benthic habit confer risk to H. guttulatus. Population-level responses to experimental reductions in non-selective fishing effort differed in magnitude and direction between H. guttulatus and its smaller congener, Hippocampus hippocampus: the abundance of H. guttulatus increased significantly while its congener decreased in abundance. Hippocampus guttulatus preferred more complex, vegetated habitats, while H. hippocampus preferred more open, sparsely vegetated habitats. Thus it seems probable that H. guttulatus fared better in the more complex habitats that developed when seining stopped, whereas H. hippocampus fared better in the less complex habitat arising from repeated seining. I used an age-structured stochastic simulation to evaluate the biological implications of a recommended generic strategy (10 cm minimum size limit) for managing the exploitation and international trade of seahorses, using H. guttulatus as a model. The smallest size limit that was robust (using the magnitude of population decline and probability of quasi-extinction as criteria) {{to a range of}} fishing rates, maximum population growth rates (rmax) and models of density-dependenc...|$|R
40|$|Cuvier, 1829 occurs {{mostly in}} shallow inshore waters among algae and eel grass (Zostera or Posidonia) {{and also in}} {{littoral}} lagoons (1). The species {{can be found in}} the Eastern Atlantic from the British Isles to Morocco, including the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores (2). The presence of the long-snouted seahorse in Belgian waters was already suspected (see CITES appendix II) but never confirmed. Hippocampus ramulosus Leach, 1814 is regarded as an invalid synonym of this species, although this name is still widely used for what is now H. guttulatus (2). The sampling station where Hippocampus guttulatus was found is situated between the sandbanks Buiten Ratel en Oost Dyck (UTM 5674450 - 460236. 7), on the French-Belgian border (Fig. 1). This station was investigated dur-ing a sampling campaign on August 20 th (2003) with the research vessel ‘Zeeleeuw’. The sample was taken with a rectangular neuston net (2 m x 1 m, 1 mm mesh) from which only the lower 50 cm is immersed, thereby sam-pling the upper 50 cm of the water column. Identifications of the specimens, which were preserved in a 10 % formal-dehyde-seawater solution, are based on characteristics described by LOURIE et al. (2). The neuston sample contained two well-preserved juveniles (approximately 3 to 4 weeks old) of the species Hippocampus guttulatus. Most of the examined charac-teristics (Table 1) are within the range for both Hippoc-ampus guttulatus and H. hippocampus (i. e. number of trunk rings, number of tail rings, number of pectoral fin rays, number of dorsal fin rays). However, the ratio of snout length to head length (> 1 / 3) certainly suggests that these specimens are H. guttulatus or the <b>European</b> long-snouted <b>seahorse,</b> and the number of pectoral fins on one of the specimens is consistent with it being H. guttulatus. Both specimens lack a mane of thick skin fronds on neck and head, usually seen in adults (Fig. 2) ...|$|R
