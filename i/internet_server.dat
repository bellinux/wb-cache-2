40|$|The {{increasing}} number of Internet users and innovative new services such as e-commerce are placing new demands on <b>Internet</b> <b>servers,</b> for example web servers. It is becoming essential for <b>Internet</b> <b>servers</b> to be highly available, have fast response times, and provide continuous service during overload at least to preferred customers. It is necessary, therefore, to protect <b>Internet</b> <b>servers</b> from overload since during server overload clients experience increased response times and service failures. In this paper we present a kernel-based architecture that protects <b>Internet</b> <b>servers</b> against overload by controlling the amount and rate of work entering the system. Our basic control algorithm limits the incoming TCP SYN requests based on connection attributes. By dropping non-compliant connection requests, the server can provide continuous service to preferred clients even under overload. We present a second mechanism that reorders the listen queue of a server socket based on the priorities of the incoming connection requests. Our experiments show that both mechanisms enable service di#erentiation during overload. We describe an adaptive architecture that uses these mechanisms to dynamically protect web servers from overload...|$|R

Independent variables log transformed were GDP per capita by PPP, number of fixed broadband Internet subscribers, secure <b>Internet</b> <b>servers,</b> and secure <b>Internet</b> <b>servers</b> (per million people).|$|R

40|$|Slowdown, {{defined as}} the ratio of a request’s {{queueing}} delay to its service time, is accepted as an important quality of service metric of <b>Internet</b> <b>servers.</b> In this paper, we investigate the problem of providing proportional slowdown differentiation (PSD) services to various applications and clients on cluster-based <b>Internet</b> <b>servers.</b> We extend a closed-form expression of the expected slowdown of a popular Internet workload model with a typical heavy-tailed service time distribution from a single server mode to a server cluster mode. Based on the closed-form expression, we design a two-tier resource allocation approach, which integrates a dispatcher-based node partitioning scheme and a server-based dynamic process allocation scheme. We evaluate the two-tier resource allocation approach via extensive simulations and compare it with an one-tier node partitioning approach. Simulation {{results show that the}} two-tier approach can provide fine-grained PSD services on clusterbased <b>Internet</b> <b>servers.</b> We implement the two-tier approach on a cluster testbed.
