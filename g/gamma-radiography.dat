40|$|A {{systematic}} {{presentation of}} arrangements and materials for detection of reinforced concrete {{by means of}} <b>gamma-radiography</b> is the first aim of this paper. New proposals concerning auxiliary techniques in <b>gamma-radiography</b> have been investigated: a) Photometric measurements on simple gamma-radiographies have been applied, in order to estimate the diameter of an embedded bar, {{on the basis of}} the difference in film density, between the image of the bar and its surrounding area. b) Ordinary photogrammetric apparatuses have been used on twin stereo-radiographies for direct discrimination of complicated bars of concrete reinforcements. The same method has been applied for a direct reading of the position and diameter of every bar simultaneously, instead of repetitive application of two-equations systems for each bar in conventional stereo-radiography. © 1971 Secrétariat de Rédaction...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- Tha NDA procedures, aappiied {{on fresh}} and irradi-ated fuel of the {{research}} reactor RA in VinCa, are described and the obtained results are presented. To measure the relative quantity of U- 235 in the fresh u ^ n i u m fuel elements the passive gamma ray emis-sion method, as well 33 the zero power reactor RB criticality mesure-ment procedure, have been employed. The <b>gamma-radiography</b> tiethod is also used for inspection of the fresh fuel of the RA reactor. The semiempirical method, based on spatial power distribution determina-tion, and the gamma-spectrometric procedure, developed at the "Boris Kidrič " Institute in Vinča, were {{used to measure the}} burn-jp of ir-radiated fuel of reactor RA. The procedures presented are of interest for the accounting for and control of nuclear material, the fuel qu-ality control and the economy and safety analysis of the RA reactor. The principles of the NDA procedures reported, and the nair. ed ex-perience, are also of interest for the power reactor fuel testinq, at the nuclear power stations that will be constructed in Yugoslavia in the next future.
