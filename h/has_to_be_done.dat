Doc is unhappy, and Hazel decides something <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> ("Thinkin' "). He is unable {{to come up with an}} answer, and eventually forgets the question. Some weeks pass, and Joe the Mexican woos Suzy. He has no success, and his attempts irritate Doc. The next day, Doc himself approaches the pipe with flowers in hand ("How Long?"), still uncertain as to why he is seeking a girl like Suzy. Suzy lets him in the boiler, which she has fitted up in a homelike manner. She is doing well at the burger joint, but is grateful to Fauna for giving her confidence. She is confident enough, indeed, to reject Doc, who is unhappy, but philosophical ("The Next Time It Happens").|$|E

25|$|No {{official}} {{attempts to}} create an orthography have been made, nevertheless there are countless short stories, poems and songs written in Erzgebirgisch. The Sächsischer Heimatverein guidelines to writing in Erzgebirgisch were established in 1937, but are by and large not respected {{by the majority of}} authors. This means that linguistic analysis of this dialect <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a field work setting with native speakers. An additional threat to Erzgebirgisch is the popular misconception that Erzgebirgisch was a hillbilly variety of Saxonian, which does not help the conservation efforts.|$|E

25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have to start making payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

Rather than having all material that might be considered sensitive filed under seal, Durkin said that he might grant a motion directing lawyers to file a motion requesting that the material be filed under seal first. If Durkin granted such a motion, the attorneys would file both a complete copy under seal and a redacted copy that would be publicly available.|$|E

On 6 August 1942, in a continued Chetnik effort to eliminate external enemies and purge their own ranks, Baćović ordered the subordinate commanders of all corps and brigades to submit lists of such individuals with suggestions {{on how to deal with}} them. Brigade commanders were required to send three assassins to kill any person whom they labelled with the letter [...] "Z" [...] (from the , meaning [...] "murder") within 24 hours of receiving the name.

500|$|Silence is {{considered}} a [...] "passion project" [...] of Scorsese's {{and has been in}} development since 1990, two years after the release of Scorsese's most controversial film, The Last Temptation of Christ, which also carried strongly religious themes. Scorsese first read the novel in 1989 and obtained the movie rights soon afterwards. When asked why he retained interest in the project for over 26 years, Scorsese stated: [...] "As you get older, ideas go and come. Questions, answers, loss of the answer again and more questions, and this is what really interests me. Yes, the cinema and the people in my life and my family are most important, but ultimately as you get older, there's got to be more... Silence is just something that I'm drawn to in that way.

500|$|Despite Ice-T's {{attempts}} to differentiate Body Count {{from his work}} in the hip hop genre, the press focused on the group's rap image. Ice-T felt that politicians had intentionally referred to the song [...] "Cop Killer" [...] as rap to provoke negative criticism. [...] "There is absolutely no way to listen to the song 'Cop Killer' and call it a rap record. It's so far from rap. But, politically, they know by saying the word rap they can get {{a lot of people who}} think, 'Rap-black-rap-black-ghetto,' and don't like it. You say the word rock, people say, 'Oh, but I like Jefferson Airplane, I like Fleetwood Mac — that's rock.' They don't want to use the word rock & roll to describe this song." [...] Body Count has since been credited for pioneering the rap metal genre popularized by groups such as Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit, although Ice-T does not rap on any of the album's tracks. Ernie C stated that [...] "A lot of rappers want to be in a rock band, but it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> sincerely. You can't just get anybody on guitar and expect it to work.
