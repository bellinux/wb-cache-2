40|$|The Mars ascent {{vehicle is}} a {{critical}} element of the robotic Mars Sample Return (MSR) mission. The Mars ascent vehicle must be developed to survive a variety of conditions including the trans-Mars journey, descent through the Martian atmosphere and the harsh Martian surface environments while maintaining the ability to deliver its payload to a low Mars orbit. The primary technology challenge of developing the Mars ascent vehicle system is designing for all conditions while ensuring the mass limitations of the entry descent and landing system are not exceeded. The NASA In-Space Propulsion technology project has initiated the development of Mars ascent vehicle technologies with propulsion system performance and launch environments yet to be defined. To support the project s evaluation and development of various technology options {{the sensitivity of the}} Mars ascent <b>vehicle</b> <b>gross</b> lift-off <b>mass</b> to engine performance, inert mass, target orbits, and launch conditions has been completed with the results presented herein...|$|R

5000|$|Whilst {{historically}} autogas was excise-free, {{it began}} being imposed on all vehicle fuels {{that were not}} previously subject to excise in 2011 and will continue being added incrementally until 2015. The excise on autogas started at 2.5 cents per litre in 2011 and will reach 12.5 cents per litre by 2015. By comparison, the excise on petrol will remain at its existing 38 cents per litre. The additional excise on autogas is being offset somewhat by a subsidy that was implemented in 2006 for private motorists, paying either [...] to convert their existing vehicle to autogas, or [...] for purchasing a new vehicle that was manufactured to operate on autogas. The subsidy {{does not apply to}} business vehicles or vehicles with a <b>gross</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>mass</b> of over 3500 kilograms. In addition to the subsidy provided by the Australian federal government, the Western Australian government also provides a [...] subsidy under the long-running LPG subsidy scheme.|$|E
