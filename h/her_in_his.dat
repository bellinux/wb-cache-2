5|$|Calafia is {{a fictional}} warrior queen who ruled over a kingdom of Black women {{living on the}} mythical Island of California. The {{character}} of Queen Calafia was created by Spanish writer Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo who first introduced <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> popular novel entitled Las sergas de Esplandián (The Adventures of Esplandián), written around 1500.|$|E
5|$|The goddess he worshipped {{the most}} zealously, however, was Minerva. Not {{only did he}} keep a {{personal}} shrine dedicated to <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bedroom, she regularly appeared on his coinage—in four different attested reverse types—and he founded a legion, Legio I Minervia, in her name.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Donna {{accepts the}} Doctor's {{original}} offer to travel in the TARDIS. The Doctor makes it clear to her that he only wants to be friends and nothing more, and she emphatically agrees. She makes a detour to leave her car keys in a litter bin, telling her mother Sylvia to collect them later. While there, she meets a blonde woman and asks her to help Sylvia find the keys. The woman turns out to be Rose Tyler, who fades from view as she walks away from the area. In the final scene, Donna asks the Doctor to fly by her grandfather, Wilfred. He sees <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> telescope and celebrates on his allotment.|$|E
5|$|Enrichto's role in Pharsalia {{has often}} been {{discussed}} by classicists and literary scholars, with many arguing that she serves as a antithesis and counterpart to Virgil's Cumaean Sibyl, a pious prophetess who appears in his work the Aeneid. In the 14th century, the Italian poet Dante Aligheri referenced <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Divine Comedy (wherein it is revealed that she once commanded Virgil to retrieve a soul from the lowest circle of Hell). She also makes appearances in both Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's 18th century play, Faust, as well as John Marston's Jacobean play The Tragedy of Sophonisba.|$|E
5|$|Exasperated, Candace {{returns to}} the circus, where Jeremy has saved a spot for her, only for the boys to mistake her for Buford and include <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> act. She is sent flying through {{the roof of the}} tent, just as Doofenshmirtz and Perry are flying overhead. Doofenshmirtz's machine activates, giving {{everyone}} in the cirque audience high-pitched voices that cause the tent to rupture. The high velocity of Doofenshmirtz's flying machine propels the tent up into the air, destroying the machine and sending Doofenshmirtz flying off (with a high voice). Jeremy gives a CD to Candace, but Candace is not at the house, but Candace then gets the CD from Jeremy.|$|E

5|$|Her {{death was}} widely publicised shortly {{afterwards}} by the Polish press, which contributed to her growing fame. Plater {{became one of}} the symbols of the uprising. The symbol of the fighting girl became quite widespread both in Poland, Lithuania and abroad. Mickiewicz immortalized <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> poem, Śmierć pułkownika (Death of a Colonel), although the description of her death is a pure poetical fiction and was only loosely based on her real life. Mickiewicz has also idealized her personality and skills, portraying her as the ideal commander, worshiped by her soldiers. That poem has entered the elementary curriculum in the independent Poland.|$|E
5|$|Imelda {{also managed}} to {{convince}} Fernando Lopez to accept the vice-presidential nomination along with presidential candidate Ferdinand Marcos. She first invited Lopez to personally meet with <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> suite. Lopez accepted the invite but preferred {{to talk with her}} in her suite instead. To persuade Lopez, her methods include appealing to Lopez's sympathy by telling him the struggles that she and Ferdinand faced during the campaign for Ferdinand's nomination and how she feels being abandoned by Lopez. Lopez refused multiple times until Imelda cried in front of him. Imelda then proceeded to hand him and make him sign a document stating that he accepts the nomination as the Nacionalista vice-presidential candidate.|$|E
5|$|Moondram Pirai {{is about}} a school teacher, R. Srinivas, who rescues a woman, Bhagyalakshmi, who is {{suffering}} from retrograde amnesia, from a brothel, and protects <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> house located in Ketti. The rest of the film shows how Bhagyalakshmi recovers her memory with Srinivas' help. Moondram Pirai is based on Balu Mahendra's brief relationship with actress Shoba, who died in 1980, shortly after their marriage. It was shot in Ketti, a small town situated close to Ooty, with further shooting also taking place in Bangalore. A total of 30 days was taken to complete the filming, using 36,000 feet of film negative.|$|E

5|$|Protestant writers at {{the time}} took a highly {{negative}} view. By the 17th century, Mary's persecution of Protestants had led to her sobriquet Bloody Mary. John Knox attacked <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women (1558), and she was prominently vilified in Actes and Monuments (1563), by John Foxe. Subsequent editions of Foxe's book remained popular with Protestants throughout the following centuries and helped shape enduring perceptions of Mary as a bloodthirsty tyrant.|$|E
5|$|Revithi {{arrived at}} the race location, the small village of Marathon, on Thursday, 9April , where the athletes had already {{assembled}} for the following day's race. She {{attracted the attention of}} the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon's mayor, who sheltered <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> house. She answered the reporters' questions and was quick-witted when a male runner from Chalandri teased her, predicting that when she entered the Stadium, there would be no crowds left. Revithi retorted that he should not insult women, since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is set in}} Kentucky, where J. P. Pettigrew's (Bernhard Goetzke) {{wife had}} died giving birth to their son Edward (John F. Hamilton), born a cripple. Pettigrew loathes John 'Fear o' God' Fulton (Malcolm Keen) who was also in love with Pettigrew's wife. Pettigrew later {{witnesses}} his now-grown son making love to schoolteacher Beatrice (Nita Naldi), and confronts her about the relationship. He attempts to take <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms, but Beatrice rejects his advances. Pettigrew's son Edward sees this and flees the village.|$|E

5|$|Aurelian, {{learning}} about Zenobia's departure, sent a contingent which captured the queen {{before she could}} cross the Euphrates to Persia; Palmyra capitulated soon after news of Zenobia's captivity reached the city in August 272. Aurelian sent the queen and her son to Emesa for trial, followed by most of Palmyra's court elite (including Longinus). According to the Augustan History and Zosimus, Zenobia blamed her actions on her advisers; however, there are no contemporary sources describing the trial, only later hostile Roman ones. The queen's reported cowardice in defeat was probably Aurelian's propaganda; it benefited the emperor to paint Zenobia as selfish and traitorous, discouraging the Palmyrenes from hailing her as a hero. Although Aurelian had most of his prisoners executed, he spared the queen and her son to parade <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> planned triumph.|$|E
5|$|C.J., however, {{seems more}} than {{reasonably}} distressed {{by the whole}} incident. She pays Hoynes a visit {{to give him a}} warning, and it becomes clear that {{she was one of the}} women with whom the Vice President had an affair. She makes it clear to him that, should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women, she will fight him on it, and he says he had no plans to include information about <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book (when Hoynes' book is published in Season 6, a scene with C.J. confirms that he did not mention her in the book outside of her work as Press Secretary). C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes. Distressed and in need of comfort, she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben, who has been trying to get in touch with her (and been ignored or shunted aside) for quite a while.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps {{it is possible to}} read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do no such thing.|$|E

5|$|Ganondorf appears and kidnaps Zelda, imprisoning <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> castle. The {{other six}} sages help Link {{infiltrate}} the stronghold; Link frees Zelda after defeating Ganondorf, who destroys the castle {{in an attempt}} to kill Link and Zelda. After they escape the collapsing castle, Ganondorf emerges from the rubble and transforms into a boar-like monster named Ganon using the Triforce of Power. Ganon knocks the Master Sword from Link's hand; with Zelda's aid, Link retrieves the Master Sword and defeats Ganon. The seven sages seal Ganondorf in the Dark Realm; still holding the Triforce of Power, he vows to take revenge on their descendants. Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to his childhood. Navi departs and young Link meets Zelda in the castle garden once more, where he retains knowledge of Hyrule's fate, starting with Hyrule's decline.|$|E
5|$|Later, Suzuha Amane, Daru's future daughter, {{arrives in}} a time machine to tell Okabe {{that the only way}} to prevent a time-travel arms race leading to World War III is to prevent Kurisu's father Nakabachi from killing her and {{stealing}} her time travel theories. Suzuha and Okabe travel back in time, but Okabe accidentally kills Kurisu himself. Returning to the present, Okabe receives a message from his future self telling him that to escape the current timeline, he needs to save Kurisu while recreating the vision of the dead Kurisu that his past self saw. Traveling back in time again, he provokes Nakabachi into stabbing him, knocks Kurisu unconscious, and puts <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> pool of blood for his past self to see, causing the timeline to diverge into one where Kurisu lives and World War III does not occur.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald {{continued}} {{to expand his}} practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and {{a lawyer for the}} new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto. Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game loo and winning substantially. Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, Isabella Clark. As Macdonald did not mention <b>her</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known. In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister. The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.|$|E
