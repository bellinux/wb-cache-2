40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the {{research}} of the functioning of financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> on Ukraine’s markets for corporate control and investments. The largest financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> of Ukraine - “Finance & Credit”, “Privat-Invest”, “Ukrsibbank” and “The Industrial Union of Donbass” - were studied during the research. The research revealed the most important criteria that financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> have to meet for the efficient functioning on the Ukrainian markets for corporate control and investments. These are the following criteria: a powerful bank capable of carrying out the function of cash generator within a group; high degree of business diversification; optimum concentration of property; minimal hierarchy of the system of corporate control. The research has studied such criterion as transparency of the structure of property, which is highly valued by the corporate governance in other countries. In Ukraine, the structure of ownership of most of efficiently functioning financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> is not transparent, which is paradoxical. This {{can be explained by the}} lack of proper legislation for protection of property rights, low activity of small shareholders and reluctance of financial and <b>industrial</b> <b>groups</b> themselves to make transparent the motives of their participation on the market for corporate control...|$|R

50|$|Calwell {{left office}} in 1949 when the Chifley {{government}} {{was defeated by}} the Liberal Party, led by Robert Menzies. The following period in opposition was one of great frustration. Like many Labor parliamentarians and union officials at the time, Calwell was a Roman Catholic. The Australian Catholic Church was in this period fiercely anti-communist and had in the 1940s encouraged Catholic trade unionists to oppose communists within their trade unions. The organisations that co-ordinated Catholic efforts were called <b>Industrial</b> <b>Groups.</b> Calwell had originally supported the <b>Industrial</b> <b>Groups</b> in Victoria and continued to do so until the early 1950s.
