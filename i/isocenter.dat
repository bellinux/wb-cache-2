Optical navigation has been in use for the last 10 years within image-guided surgery (neurosurgery, ENT, and orthopaedic) and has increased in prevalence within radiotherapy to provide real-time feedback through visual cues on graphical user interfaces (GUIs). For the latter, a method of calibration is used to align the camera's native coordinate system with that of the isocentric reference frame of the radiation treatment delivery room. [...] Optically tracked tools are then used to identify the positions of patient reference set-up points and these are compared to their location within the planning CT coordinate system. A computation based on least-squares methodology is performed using these two sets of coordinates to determine a treatment couch translation that will result in the alignment of the patient's planned <b>isocenter</b> with that of the treatment room. These tools can also be used for intra-fraction monitoring of patient position by placing an optically tracked tool on a region of interest to either initiate radiation delivery (i.e. gating regimes) or action (i.e. repositioning). Alternatively, products such as AlignRT (from Vision RT) allow for real time feedback by imaging the patient directly and tracking the skin surface of the patient.|$|E

50|$|In practice, due to {{the heavy}} weight and {{mechanical}} imperfections of the system, the <b>isocenter</b> {{is not a single}} point and its location changes with the rotation of the gantry, collimator or couch.

40|$|The dose {{distribution}} {{resulting from}} partially overlapping intensity modulated beams (IMBs) assigned to different <b>isocenters</b> {{for the treatment}} of the same planning target volume (PTV) was evaluated. These partially overlapping IMBs are used in static intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatments with the Novalis system using the mini-MultiLeaf Collimator (mini-MLC) in Dynamic MultiLeaf Collimation (DMLC) mode. The resultant dose distribution was verified dosimetrically for a cylindrical target defined in a homogeneous cubic phantom. The phantom positioning can introduce dose nonuniformities in the resultant dose distribution by nonperfect positioning of the <b>isocenters</b> in accordance with each other. The dose inhomogeneities are quantified mathematically by summation of the dose profiles of the used IMBs and experimentally by measurement of the resulting dose profiles with radiographic film and thermoluminescent detectors (TLD). The mathematical estimation of the resulting dose profile of the treatment with a perfect positioning of the <b>isocenters</b> showed a good agreement with the planned dose profile. The magnitude of the maximum dose inhomogeneities introduced by the simulated supplementary shifts between the <b>isocenters</b> decreases by - 8. 54 % mm(- 1) as the shift changes from - 0. 30 +/- 0. 10 cm to + 0. 30 +/- 0. 10 cm. The TLD measurements showed a similar variation of the magnitude of the maximum dose inhomogeneities: - 8. 77 % mm(- 1). The amount of dose variation was underestimated with the radiographic film measurements, which showed a variation of - 7. 17 % mm(- 1). The film measurements demonstrated that the magnitude of the introduced maximum dose inhomogeneities did not alter significantly throughout the PTV. The approach of using partially overlapping IMBs assigned to different <b>isocenters</b> to enlarge the treatment region introduces smaller dose inhomogeneities in the resultant dose distribution than when abutting treatment fields are used. The resultant dose distribution of this treatment technique is less sensitive to positioning errors of the used treatment <b>isocenters.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{results achieved}} with radiosurgery and complications {{of the procedure}} when treating arteriovenous malformations with linear accelerator. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted between October 1993 and December 1996. Sixty-one patients with arteriovenous malformations were treated with radiosurgery utilizing a 6 MV energy linear accelerator. Ages of the 32 female and 29 male patients ranged from 6 to 54 years (mean: 28. 3 years). The most frequent initial symptom was cephalea (45. 9 %), followed by neurological deficit (36. 1 %). Cerebral hemorrhage diagnosed by image was observed in 35 patients (57. 3 %). Most arteriovenous malformations (67. 2 %) were graded Spetzler III and IV. Venous stenosis (21. 3 %) and aneurysm (13. 1 %) were the most frequent angioarchitecture changes. The dose administered varied from 12 to 27. 5 Gy in {{the periphery of the}} lesion. RESULTS: Out of twenty-eight patients that underwent conclusive angiography control, complete obliteration was achieved in 18 (72 %) and treatment failed in 7 (absence of occlusion with more than 3 years of follow-up). Four were submitted to a second radiosurgery, and one of these has shown obliteration after 18 months of follow-up. DISCUSSION: Several factors were analyzed regarding the occlusion rate (gender, age, volume, localization, Spetzler, flow, embolization, total of <b>isocenters,</b> prescribed dose and chosen isodose) and complications (total of <b>isocenters,</b> localization, volume, maximum dose, prescribed dose and chosen isodose). Analyzed variables showed no statistical significance for obliteration of the vessel, as well as for treatment complications. The largest diameter of the arteriovenous malformation, its volume and the dose administered did not influence time of obliteration. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery is effective in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations and can be an alternative for patients with clinical contraindication or with lesions in eloquent areas. In the studied variables no statistically significant correlation was observed between occlusion and treatment complications...|$|R

40|$|Free Paper 5 – OncologyTheme: Radiation Oncology in Neurosurgical PracticeINTRODUCTION: Whole brain {{radiotherapy}} (WBRT) {{either as}} an adjunct or sole treatment for cerebral metastases has been employed for over 50 years. Studies have compared the efficacy of WBRT when used as adjunct for open neurosurgery or radiosurgery or as a stand alone treatment. But not many studies {{have looked at the}} booster effect of radiosurgery. The aim {{of this study is to}} review the efficacy and safety of LINAC (LINear ACcelerator) based stereotactic radiosurgery for cerebral metastases after the administration of whole brain radiotherapy at a single institution. METHOD: Patients with history of cerebral metastases treated with WBRT and subsequent X-knife LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery booster were retrospectively reviewed over 8 years in a single institution. All patients were adults above 18 years of age. Patients with prior craniotomies were included. Different primary carcinomas were included. The dosages of radiotherapy, follow-ups, complications and survival were reviewed and presented in the study. RESULTS: From January 2004 to March 2012, 16 patients with cerebral metastases treated with WBRT received booster X-knife LINAC stereotactic radiosurgery to reccurrent or residual lesions were identified. All patients received standard WBRT treatment of 30 gray (Gy) in 10 fractions. X-knife therapy booster were given to 2 <b>isocenters</b> in 3 patients and single <b>isocenters</b> in other 13 patients. Radiosurgery booster were given from 1 month after WBRT to 21 months after WBRT. The dosage for X-knife booster ranged from 14 Gy at 85 % isodose line to 20 Gy at 90 % isodose line. Only one patient reported significant cerebral oedema as a result of the radiosurgery requiring steroid cover and the rest of the patients recorded no complication from radiosurgery. Follow-up period ranged from 3 months to 25 months following radiosurgery. Survival ranged from 5 months to 25 months after radiosurgery. CONCLUSION: Stereotactic radiosurgery booster can be safely administered to patients with cerebral metastatic lesions who have been treated with WBRT in the past. Radiosurgery booster in majority of the cases seem to offer effective local control of the disease with little risk of undesirable effects. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty patients with brain or head and neck tumors were consecutively assigned to one of three different thermoplastic masks (Posifix) : head mask with three fixation points (3 FP, ten patients), head and shoulder mask with four fixation points (4 FP, ten patients), head and shoulder mask with five fixation points (5 FP, four fixations plus an additional one on the top of head, ten patients). Once a week, during the session with a 6 MV linac (Elekta), orthogonal (antero-posterior and lateral) portal images were acquired for three fictitious <b>isocenters</b> placed during the simulation at the level of the head, the neck and the shoulders. Portal images and digitized simulator films were compared using the PIPS pro software, and displacements in antero-posterior (A-P), cranio-caudal (C-C) and medio-lateral (M-L) directions were calculated. From these displacements, 2 D or 3 D errors were also calculated. RESULTS: A total of 915 portal images were obtained, of which 98 % could be analyzed. For the whole population, total displacements reached a standard deviation (SD) of 2. 2 mm at the level of the head and the neck. Systematic and random displacements were in the same order of magnitude and reached a SD of 1. 8 mm. Patient setup was slightly worse at the shoulder level with a total displacement of 2. 8 mm (1 SD) for both the C-C and the M-L directions. There again, the systematic and the random components were in the same order of magnitude below 2. 4 mm (+/-SD). For <b>isocenters</b> in the head and in the neck, there was no substantial difference in the setup deviation between the three masks. The setup reproducibility was found to be significantly worse (P= 0. 01) at the level of the shoulders with the 3 FP mask. For the 2 D random error, 1 SD of 2. 3 mm was observed compared to 0. 8 and 1. 2 mm for the 4 and 5 FP masks, respectively. Lastly, 90 % of the 3 D total deviations were below 4. 5 mm for the head and the neck. In the shoulder region, 90 % of the 2 D total deviations were below 5. 5 mm. CONCLUSION: Thermoplastic masks provide an accurate patient immobilization. At the shoulder level, setup variations are reduced when 4 or 5 FP masks are used. These data could be used for the assessment of margins for the PTV...|$|R
40|$|Object. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} efficacy and safety of gamma knife radiosurgery (GKS) {{for the treatment of}} arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) located within the brainstem. Methods. The results of GKS performed in 87 patients with brainstem AVMs at two centers with experienced physicians are reviewed. The mean patient age was 37 years and the population included 19 children. The male/female ratio was 56 : 31. The malformation was located in the upper brainstem in 52 patients. Seventy-four percent of the patients had suffered a hemorrhage before GKS. For 70 % of the patients no other treatment had been proposed before GKS. The mean AVM volume was 1. 3 cm 3. The lesions were treated with one to eight <b>isocenters,</b> with a margin dose ranging between 11. 5 Gy and 30 Gy. The mean clinical follow-up period was 3. 2 years. Ninety-five percent of the patients improved or remained neurologically stable. Rebleeding occurred in three patients at 3, 6, and 16 months, respectively, after GKS. Two patients in whom rebleeding occured recovered, and one died. The AVM obliteration rate was 63 % at 2 years and 73 % at 3 years after GKS. A second GKS was performed in six patients in whom only partial obliteration was demonstrated on angiography 3 years after the first procedure. Conclusions. Gamma knife radiosurgery may be a valuable first-choice therapy for the treatment of AVMs located within the brainstem. SCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
