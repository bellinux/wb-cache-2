The polyvinylalcohol materials {{have been prepared}} by a solvent <b>free</b> hot <b>pressing</b> technique {{as well as the}} traditional solvent casting method. The hot pressing technique allows the production of samples which are genuinely free of solvents and thereby has allowed an assessment in this work of the effect of residual solvent on conductivity. The acrylate materials were prepared by direct polymerization of monomer/salt mixtures, thus avoiding the need for solvents. These materials have glass transitions around or well above room temperature, but nonetheless have conductivities as high as 10 − 7 S/cm at room temperature.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to produce {{workable}} bio-based concretes with consistence indexes around 265 ± 15 mm, <b>free</b> of <b>pressing</b> process with bio-aggregates such as bamboo particles, wood shavings and rice husk. To produce the concretes, a nominal water-to-cement ratio of 0. 45, a cement amount of 687 kg/m 3 and a volume {{fraction of the}} bio-aggregates of 50 %, were used for all mixtures. Appropriate compensating water amounts {{and the use of}} adequate dosages of viscosity modifying agent (VMA) allowed obtaining bio-concretes of high workability without exudation and segregation. The fresh property used was the consistence index through the flow table test, while the hardened property determined was the compressive stress-strain behavior at 1, 7 and 28 days. The results showed workable and consistent mixtures, with mechanical properties that can allow industrial scale production of construction components...|$|R

The progress north-west was frustrated by ice and shoals, and at one time the Investigator became grounded so firmly that all stores had to be unloaded to her boats (one of which capsized, losing 3344 lbs of dried beef) before she could be <b>freed.</b> Alternating between <b>pressing</b> ice flows, then open water, McClure's continued to advance to the north-east, reaching the solid pack ice on August 19.|$|R
50|$|While Mohandas Gandhi and {{the entire}} Congress Working Committee had been arrested during the Quit India movement, from 1942 to 1945, Desai was one of few Congress leaders <b>free.</b> While <b>pressing</b> demands for the {{immediate}} release of political prisoners, Desai began secretive talks with Liaquat Ali Khan, the second-most important leader of the Muslim League. However this assertion has been seriously challenged by other eminent people like Sir Chiman Lal Setalwad who have stated that Gandhi had full knowledge of the ongoing negotiations. It was their intention to negotiate an agreement for a future coalition government, which would enable a united choice for Hindus and Muslims for the independent Government of India. In this deal, Liaquat gave up the demand for a separate Muslim state in turn for parity of Muslims-to-Hindus in the council of ministers. Conceding the League as the representative of Muslims and giving a minority community equal place with the majority Hindus, Desai attempted to construct an ideal Indian alliance that would hasten India's path for freedom while ending the Quit India struggle. While Desai was working without the knowledge of Gandhi, Patel, Jawaharlal Nehru or any other Congress leader, Khan had kept the deal a secret from his superior, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.|$|R
50|$|The grape {{was widely}} {{popular in the}} United States {{during the years of}} Prohibition. Grape growers in California's Central Valley found that its pulp was so fleshy and juicy that {{fermentable}} juice could be retrieved even after the third pressing. In contrast, wines made from grapes like Chardonnay and Merlot typically only include the juice from the <b>free</b> run (before <b>pressing)</b> and first or second pressing. The grape's thick skin also meant that it could survive the long railway transportation from California to New York City's Pennsylvania Station which had auction rooms where the grapes were sold. In 1928, one single auction lot of 225 carloads of grapes were purchased by a single buyer. The amount of grapes was enough to make more than 2000000 gal of wine.|$|R
40|$|Exports of {{processed}} rice {{have been}} increasing every year, {{as well as}} legislative restrictions and consumer demand for certified chemical <b>free</b> rice, <b>pressing</b> the rice processing industry to new challenges. The objective of this work was {{the implementation of a}} Rice Quality Certification Program. The package includes the association of a rigorous sanitation program and safe environmentally friendly control measures. It was accomplished in a large paddy rice facility with 40 silos during the 2008 / 09 rice crop. Silo sanitation was done by washing with pressurized water the conveyor belt structure above the silo roof, around the externals walls and thorough aspiration of the aeration system. During silo filling, the lower and top portions of the rice grain were treated with a mixture of diatomaceous earth (DE) and powder deltamethrin. Artificial chilling was applied as soon as the top layer of the grain mass was leveled by insufflating cool air (6 to 8 ºC) with a large cooling machine through the aeration system. The grain mass temperature stabilized at about 12 - 14 ºC, and kept this range of temperature for about 60 d. As the temperature of the grain mass increased, mainly on the top layer, aeration was performed with natural air from the cold fronts during the winter months. After 8 months on storage the rice was free of external insects, as proved by the grain sampling just before processing. For the 2009 / 10 crop season, the rice quality program will be repeated on 60 silos with few adjustments...|$|R

After securing Krobelus' release from Indubal, Maia interrogates the man who proceeds to explain a past venture with Morbazan to a fragment of the tree of Eleh. It was there he encountered the Tempest, the very entity that shattered Eleh in the beginning, and the monster who now dwells inside of Krobelus. Krobelus is a temporary party member, and leaves during the Fragment of Eleh stage. He cannot equip armor, but has access to Energy, Heal, Holy, and Cold spells.|$|R
40|$|In {{reaching}} movements, parietal contributions can {{be distinguished}} {{that are based on}} representations of external space and body scheme. By functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined 16 healthy subjects to see whether such segregation similarly exists in the frontal lobes when visuomotor actions are not specified but when free choices are allowed. Free selection was button based (target based) or finger based (self-referenced), with invariant instructions as control. To avoid a visual attention bias, instructions were auditory presented. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that free button selection with the same finger was associated with increased activations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), right posterodorsal prefrontal cortex (PFC) including the rostral extension of the dorsal premotor cortex (pre-PMd), and the anterodorsal PFC. Prefrontal activation related to <b>free</b> finger selection (<b>pressing</b> the same button) was restricted to an anteromedial segment of the posterodorsal PFC/pre-PMd. Bilateral inferior parietal activations were present in both free-choice conditions. Pre-PMd and parietal contributions to free selection support concepts on early-stage action selection in dorsal visuomotor pathways. The rostral-caudal segregation in pre-PMd activations reflected that in anterior direction, frontal processing is gradually less involved in selection of environmental information but increasingly committed to self-referenced selection. ACC particularly contributes to free selection between external goals...|$|R
40|$|We {{establish}} the statistical mechanics framework for {{a bundle of}} Nf living and uncrosslinked actin filaments in a supercritical solution of <b>free</b> monomers <b>pressing</b> against a mobile wall. The filaments are anchored normally to a fixed planar surface at one of their ends and, because of their limited flexibility, they grow almost parallel to each other. Their growing ends hit a moving obstacle, depicted as a second planar wall, parallel to the previous one and subjected to a harmonic compressive force. The force constant is denoted as the trap strength while {{the distance between the}} two walls as the trap length to make contact with the experimental optical trap apparatus. For an ideal solution of reactive filaments and free monomers at fixed free monomer chemical potential μ 1, we obtain the general expression for the grand potential from which we derive averages and distributions of relevant physical quantities, namely, the obstacle position, the bundle polymerization force, and the number of filaments in direct contact with the wall. The grafted living filaments are modeled as discrete Wormlike chains, with F-actin persistence length lp, subject to discrete contour length variations ±d (the monomer size) to model single monomer (de) polymerization steps. Rigid filaments (lp = ∞), either isolated or in bundles, all provide average values of the stalling force in agreement with Hill’s predictions FsH = Nf kBT ln(ρ 1 /ρ 1 c) /d, independent of the average trap length. Here ρ 1 is the density of free monomers in the solution and ρ 1 c its critical value at which the filament does not grow nor shrink in the absence of external forces. Flexible filaments (lp < ∞) instead, for values of the trap strength suitable to prevent their lateral escape, provide an average bundle force and an average trap length slightly larger than the corresponding rigid cases (few percents). Still the stalling force remains nearly independent on the average trap length, but results from the product of two strongly L-dependent contributions: the fraction of touching filaments ∝ (⟨L⟩O. T.) ^ 2 and the single filament buckling force ∝ (⟨L⟩O. T.) ^− 2...|$|R

[...] Poor girl, it never even occurred to her that from the higher standpoint of a really learned man like Cyril Milliter the petty smattering of French and strumming of the piano, wherein alone these grand girls actually differed from her, were mere useless surface accomplishments, in no way affecting the inner intelligence or culture, which were the only things that Cyril regarded in any serious light as worthy of respect or admiration. As a matter of fact, Netta had learnt infinitely more from her Bible, her English books, her own heart, and surrounding nature, than any of these well-educated girls had learnt from their parrot-trained governesses; and she was infinitely better fitted than any of them to be a life companion for such a man as Cyril Milliter.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{magnificent}} {{ceremony at the}} Parliament House, the old hall of the Augustins. The little King held a bed of justice, upon a couch under a purple velvet canopy, with all his grandees round him. I would not go to see it, I thought it a wicked shame {{to set up a}} poor boy to break all the solemn pledges made in his name, and I knew it was the downfall of Clement's hopes; but Meg went in her Princess's suite, and I had her account of it, the King looking very handsome with his long fair hair, and bowing right and left, with such a dignity and grace that no one saw what {{a little bit of a}} fellow he really was. Poor child! the best thing they could have taught him would have been to worshipping and loving no one but himself. Of course Meg saw nothing so plainly as how beautiful her little Marquis looked among the attendant young nobles, and I must own that he was a very fine fellow, and wonderfully little spoiled considering the sort of folk with whom he lived. On that ceremonial day there came doleful tidings to us. Worcester had been the scene of a massacre rather than a fight, and my brother was in despair and misery at not having been there--as if his single arm could have retrieved the day!--thinking shame of himself for resting at home while sword and block were busy with our friends, and no one knew where the King was. I know not whether it were the daunting of his hopes or the first beginning of the winter cold; but from that time he began to decline from the strength he had gained while I had him to myself in Holland, <b>free</b> from all <b>pressing</b> cares.|$|R
40|$|Powder {{metallurgy}} (PM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} cost effective methods for manufacturing structural components with complex shapes. Utilisation of the metal powder to shape the components allows to minimise material waste and increase energy efficiency. However, with the increased usage of PM parts in high performance applications, there is a demand for components with properties that can withstand extreme loading conditions and are equivalent or better than the properties of their wrought counterparts. The PM steels fabricated with press and sinter, even with all its advantages have limitations due to the presence of residual porosity. Hence, reaching full density is necessary to meet the high performance demands. The scope of this study covers different approaches of powder consolidation with the aim of reaching near full density. Liquid phase sintering and double pressing-double sintering approach for water atomised powders, high velocity compaction approach for agglomerated gas atomised powders, and finally additive manufacturing approach to produce samples with almost full density were utilised. These approaches were complimented by capsule <b>free</b> hot isostatic <b>pressing</b> (HIP) to reach full density and improve component performance. The liquid phase sintering approach utilised is based on addition of Ni-Mn-B master alloy for enhanced sintering and densification. The results obtained clearly indicated that the master alloy addition effectively enhances the densification process through the liquid phase generation. The mechanical properties were improved when boron content was optimised from 0. 2 to 0. 12 wt. %. Density levels up to 98 % were realised after sintering with addition of this master alloy. In the double pressing-double sintering process, cylindrical and gear samples, fabricated from water atomised powder, prealloyed with Mo were studied. The studies included the comparison of using both standard and fine (< 63 µm) powder for the compacts investigated. The process route provides pore free surface and full density is then realised by means of subsequent HIP after second sintering. Fine powder shows better densification but the density variation after the first pressing persists as a low density region in the middle of the compact, i. e. at the neutral zone. Hence, optimisation during first pressing is necessary in order to avoid this phenomenon. High velocity compaction (HVC) is a means of tailored densification. There is an industrial processing route that takes advantage of this effect, involving conventional pressing of agglomerated gas-atomised powder and sintering followed by HVC re-strike and hot isostatic pressing for reaching full density. In this study, the said approach was evaluated for agglomerated alloyed tool steel powder type 100 Cr 6 when processed to reach almost full density of about 99. 5 % relative density. The additive manufacturing approach includes the assessment of material fabricated by means of electron beam melting (EBM), involving both solid and shell samples from Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder. The studies showed that either samples were printed solid or as shells filled with powder, the subsequent HIP led to full densification. Furthermore, good bonding between the shell and the interior material was obtained after HIP. The above presented approaches all represent ways of achieving full density. Based on the analysis of the different methods it can be concluded that the combination of the tailored alloy concepts and consolidation techniques allows manufacturing complex-shaped full-density components for high-performance applications...|$|R
