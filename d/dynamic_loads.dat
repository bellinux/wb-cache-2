25|$|Structural dynamics, therefore, {{is a type}} of {{structural}} analysis which covers the behavior of structures subjected to dynamic (actions having high acceleration) loading. <b>Dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> include people, wind, waves, traffic, earthquakes, and blasts.

25|$|While the {{buildings}} were designed to support enormous static loads, they provided little resistance to the moving mass of the sections above the floors where the collapses initiated. Structural systems respond very differently to static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads,</b> and since {{the motion of the}} falling portion began as a free fall through the height of at least one story (roughly three meters or 10feet), the structure beneath them was unable to stop the collapses once they began. Indeed, a fall of only half a meter (about 20inches) would have been enough to release the necessary energy to begin an unstoppable collapse.|$|E
