F. Gmel and Combretum glutinosum Perr. The experimental design is adapted to the usual local harvesting period (May) and to the traditional tools (machete). Three factors were studied: species, height (ground level (RT), 20 and 50 cm) and diameter (0 - 10 and 10 - 20 cm). For each species, each treatment is represented by 15 individuals. Results from field observations and analysis of variance {{on the number of}} stems and growth variables (height and diameter) suggest a high survival rate (100 %), a higher number of stems at 20 and 50 cm cutting height, a slow height growth of stems from ground level stumps (RT), and a larger diameter growth of G. senegalensis. For sustainable management of the studied Combreteceae species in the <b>Groundnut</b> <b>Basin,</b> 20 cm cutting height of all individuals would be appropriate...|$|E
40|$|Optimizing the use {{of common}} {{resources}} in the <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin</b> of Senegal: An ex-ante evaluation of plans and alternatives for sustainable management. The preservation of inter village forestry and pastoral spaces (ESPIVs) is an endogenous initiative, introduced by local communities in the <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin</b> of Senegal, to meet the combined {{effects of climate change}} and resource degradation. Located outside crop-growing areas, these community reserves are a source of fodder for livestock and for local transhumance, and they provide additional income for rural populations. The preservation of these ESPIVs is supported by management tools such as the Simple Management Plan (PSG) and the Development and Management Plan (PAG). In some cases, the economic impact of these plans on poverty reduction at the community level is very noticeable. But in other cases, the expectations of the communities are not being met. This article is an ex-ante evaluation of the projected management plans of two ESPIVs in the <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin</b> of Senegal. The results show that simpler management options involving reduced areas would make only a small contribution to local development, even when consolidated with various incitative measures. Management options involving interventions in the infrastructure of vast areas with a high forest-product potential would {{have a positive impact on}} the economic surplus of the members of those communities, hence reinforcing possibilities for local development. However, this approach is controversial and simpler management options therefore need to be re-assessed. These simpler options would involve alternatives for revenue generation, such as taxation for access to common land resources by transhumant livestock and the marketing of non-ligneous forest products. This study shows the limits of PSG compared to PAG and proposes alternatives for improved approaches to managing ESPIVs. Thus, the study provides decision-makers with possible negotiating tracks in a situation requiring the sustainable management of common resources within a context of decentralization...|$|E

We will question nowadays the interest of i) maintaining traditional system remainder adapted to new environmental constraints (Diohine case) ii) or favouring new fertility management rise structured around bovine fattening (Barry Sine case). These divergent managements impact biomass and nutrient flows differently according to the analysis scale adopted: plot, household or terroir scales. Nutrient and biomass flows analysis informs each scale functioning while nutrient balance is a largely admitted environmental sustainability indicator (Roy et al. 2005). In other words, we will focus on system opening multi- scale effects on nutrient balance and especially for the terroir scale adopting a systemic approach. To be able to plan agricultural future of the former <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin,</b> it is primordial to consider actor’s terroir perception in terms of soils fertility evolution and to grasp the fertility management practices evolution dynamics {{in order to increase}} production. In that purpose, a multiple perspective analysis that distinguishes both terroirs (Barry Sine and Diohine) and genders 22 (men and women) will be necessary {{to take into account the}} different social status distinction, their role within the household and their position into agricultural activities. Physical, socio-political and economical changes impacted the former Senegalese <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin</b> what resulted in a strong natural resources use competition and therefore an agrarian transition that disconnects cropping and livestock farming sectors. Two terroirs were studied, one within a traditional model that conserved common fallows (Diohine), the other one that adopted livestock fattening practice (Barry Sine). Multi-scale nutrient balances based on surveys were sustainability indicators for the selected options and a participative workshop gathered their fertility management perceptions and dynamic per terroir and per gender. Plot scale nitrogen balances are both negative but higher for Diohine (- 13 kgN. ha- 1 for - 24 kgN. ha- 1 in Barry Sine) as well as nitrogen efficiency (116 for 4 à Barry Sine). On the other hand household and terroir scale nitrogen balances are positive and Barry Sine presents higher results (24 kgN/ha- 1 for 11 at household scale, 25 kgN. ha- 1 for 9 kgN. ha- 1 at terroir scale). Household nitrogen efficiency is higher in Diohine (1. 11 for 0. 92) but lower at terroir scale (0. 12 for 0. 64).

40|$|The <b>groundnut</b> {{cropping}} <b>basin</b> of Senegal suffers environmental degradation, with {{a negative}} impact on local agriculture, shown by intense soil erosion. Despite the existence of many extensive programmes, there are few results concerning actual effects, at the hillside scale, of rehabilitation practices. The objective of the study, carried out from 1983 to 1993, was to give evidence of the actual effects, in terms of hydrology and agronomy, of conservation measures set-up in a small cultivated watershed (60 ha). The measures included, on the basis of ecological features and human uses, live-hedges, stone bunds and improved cropping practices. The hydrological survey, based upon the paired watershed technique, gives evidence of land conservation, rather than land restoration, due to these developments. The efficiency of the hedges is mainly due to the favourable planting conditions. The proposed cropping practices were adopted by farmers to varying degrees, and field monitoring showed no actual effect on average crop production. To improve the cost/benefit ratio, the scientific staff should have emphasized, for the attention of the farmers, the necessary linkage between fertility restoration and runoff control. Despite this limitation, an increasing number of farmers and village communities are asking for technical assistance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Much {{has been}} written to show the {{importance}} of diversification for rural African households because of the considerable share of non-farm revenues in total income (Reardon, 1997; Reardon et al., 1998). The literature points out push and pull factors explaining that risk and adverse shocks which characterize farm activities urge rural population to diversify into more profitable non-farm activities. But less {{attention has been paid}} to the distinction between two diversification patterns, namely local diversification and migration, and their relationship. Drawing on the theoretical and empirical literature, we identify the advantages and drawbacks of local diversification versus migration decision in terms of expected pay-offs for the family and the individual. Based on original data from a sample of rural families in two villages of the Senegal <b>Groundnut</b> <b>Basin,</b> the present paper examines whether local diversification and migration are complements or substitutes, by investigating the choice of the number of migrants in the family. We consider the family as a basis of reciprocal relations and point out that its role of insurance may differ when the member migrates. Our analysis indicates that when agricultural endowments are low and variable in the whole, migration is found to be functioning rather as an alternative activity to local diversification, than as a complement. Such a finding implies that with relative low returns expected from local economy, migration provides rural households with a form ofmigration, diversification, mutual insurance, <b>Groundnut</b> <b>basin,</b> Senegal, Consumer/Household Economics, O 15, O 55, D 70, Q 12,...|$|E
40|$|In the {{traditional}} operation of production-consumption groups {{in rural areas}} of Senegal, the group chief, or Borom njël, has a social duty to make sure family food needs are met. His ability {{to do this is}} supported by certain social rules governing these groups, and by a favourable environment. However, various changes have now adversely affected the environment. These changes prompted us to assess the Borom njel's current ability to go on playing his social rule as a food provider. From data collected in two villages of the Senegalese <b>Groundnut</b> <b>Basin,</b> using multivariate analysis, we identified three production-consumption group profiles according to how the Borom njel ensured main cereal supplies: (i) market purchase with migrants' remittances; (ii) home production and (iii) market purchase with own resources. The ability of the Borom njël to ensure cereal supplies differed according to the profile. We used a multivariate logit model to study the determinants affecting the Borom njel's ability to ensure cereal supplies for the production-consumption group. We found that physical assets and wage labour employment increased this ability. We also found that agricultural income, including livestock, was positively correlated to the likelihood of the Borom njël successfully ensuring cereal supplies, particularly those depending heavily on own production. Additional income earned by the Borom njel from non-agricultural activity had the same positive effect, particularly when ensuring cereals provision through market purchase. We end with some thoughts on the increasing reliance of Borom njels on migrants remittances to ensure that family cereal needs are met.

40|$|Senegal, with 196, 712 km 2 land area, {{is located}} at the extreme west of the African {{continent}} (Longitudes 11 ° 21 W - 17 ° 32 N and Latitudes 12 ° 8 N - 16 ° 41 N). The country’s soils are in general of low fertility, fragile and very susceptible to wind and water erosion. The climate is of Sudano-Sahelian type characterized by alternating dry season (November to May) and rainy season (June to October). The 700 km coastline brings climatic differences between coastal areas and inland zones.

Productivity and {{economic}} risks. his second part concerns {{the analysis of}} land productivity and labour results within a traditional farming system and two improved systems experimented on a site in the center-west part of the Senegalese <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin.</b> Intensified farming systems associate farming and livestock and use motorized or draft cultivation (oxen) as means of mechanization. Results show that intensification systematically increases crop yields and gives rise to larger amounts of by-products fitting well for use as animal feed. Furthermore, yields stabilize with soil fertility improvement. The economic risk linked to intensification strongly depends on the climatic context. A 400 mm annual rainfall appears as a threshold to insure a net increase of land and labour productivity, justifying an intensification operation that combines plowing, liming material, organic and minerai fertilizer applications. In the climatic risk zone like that where the experimentation took place, the diversification of farming activity increases and stabilizes income. Therefore, productions as cassava or bissap and the integration of a perennial forage crop offer interesting development perspectives. The constraints limiting the adoption of intensified and diversified farming systems are linked to market conditions, time-labour feasibility, soil fertility management and institutional context.

40|$|National audienceBiomass {{recycling}} plays a {{major role}} in the functioning and sustainability of agro-silvo-pastoral ecosystems in West Africa. However, farming systems must adjust rapidly to changing landscapes. This abstract describes an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that analyzes nutrient (N) cycles within the village “terroir” agro-ecosystem to assess how changes in land use and farming practices affect croplivestock integration and spatial heterogeneity. The ABM is implemented on the GAMA platform (Generic Agent-based Modelling Architecture). Each simulated household is classified according to a farm type with a pre-defined biomass management strategy (use of crop products, manure, etc.). The model is spatially explicit, with biomass being moved across landscape units and through different ecosystem components: soil, plants, animals, humans, etc. Biomass flows are converted into N flows which are then used to calculate indicators such as N balance, N use efficiency, and the diversity and recycling indexes that characterize N cycles. The model was parameterized through on-farm measurements of crop and livestock productions (for the biophysical sub-system) and participatory workshops with farmers (for the decision sub-system). The model was validated on the basis of biomass flows observed in two villages in the Senegalese <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin.</b> The model is original in its multi-scale analysis of N cycles occurring at different organizational levels: plot, herd, household and landscape. For instance this highlights the consequences of households' choices at the plot scale for spatial heterogeneity at the landscape scale.

These agricultural residues are collected from Senegal. It is known that some regions of Sénégal, commonly called the <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin,</b> are affected by a public health problem caused by an excess of fluoride in drinking water used by these populations. The activated carbons were produced by a combined pyrolysis and activation with water steam; no other chemical compounds were added. Then, activated carbonaceous materials obtained from cashew shells and millet stalks were called CS-H 2 O and MS-H 2 O respectively. CS-H 2 O and MS-H 2 O show very good adsorbent features, and present carbon content ranges between 71 % and 86 %. The BET surface areas are 942 m² g- 1 and 1234 m². g- 1 for CS-H 2 O and MS-H 2 O respectively. A third activated carbon produced from food wastes and coagulation-flocculation sludge (FW/CFS-H 2 O) was produced in the same conditions.

40|$|Up to now, {{efforts to}} help local {{communities}} out of the food-insecurity trap were guided by researcher (or other actors) -led decisions on technologies to be implemented by the communities. This approach has proved inefficient because of low adoption of the so-called improved technologies. This paper describes the strategic approaches {{to the development of}} a climate-smart village (CSV) model in the <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin</b> of Senegal. A CSV model is a participatory integrated approach using climate information, improved context-based technologies/practices aiming at reaching improved productivity (food and nutrition security), climate resilient people and ecosystem and climate mitigation. In this study, participatory vulnerability analysis, planning adaptation capacity and participatory communication for development were implemented, putting people affected by the impacts of climate change (CC) at the center of the approach. Four interdependent groups of activities/domains, namely—local and institutional knowledge, use of climate information services, development of climate-smart technology and local development plans, were covered. It was emphasized, how all this taken together could create improved livelihoods for women, men and vulnerable groups. Results: The approach made it possible to involve local people in the decision-making process for the development of their adaptation capacity to CC. It also helped to set up an overall land management process by identifying and addressing environmental (sustainable resource management, ecosystem resilience) and socioeconomic (institutional organization, empowerment, poverty alleviation and food security) challenges. A monitoring survey revealed that farmers appreciate well this participatory approach compared to previous top-down approach in that the former allow them to own the process. Also determinant drivers of adoption of the technologies were identified.

A new model, the Crop Model for Sahelian Adaptation Studies (CROMSAS), was developed to examine the influence of climatic variability, climate change and crop management strategies on millet yields. To improve the simulation of environmental stresses, several original features were implemented including a new leaf expansion methodology, semi-independent tillers, stress-dependent partitioning, and intercropping. CROMSAS was designed in a structured, accessible way to facilitate the use of the model by other researchers who want to examine climate change impacts in Africa. The influences of rainfall and crop management decisions over the period 1950 { 2009 were assessed for six locations in Senegal with average rainfall from 200 mm to 1200 mm. Poor rainfall severely restricted yields in the north of the country in most years while having little impact in the more humid south. In the highly-populated <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin,</b> rainfall variability reduced the effectiveness and hence the profitability of fertiliser application. Current planting densities were found to lie within the optimal range but higher grain yields could have been produced, with lower risk of crop failure, by delaying planting by 2 - 3 weeks. The benefits of adapting crop management strategies according to the conditions in previous years were assessed. Using a fixed long-term strategy produced higher long-term yields and profits, at lower risk of crop failure, than frequently changing strategies. Projections from three GCMs for the period 2000 - 2100 were converted to daily weather data using a novel methodology and used to examine the impact of climate change on millet cultivation across Senegal. Grain yields were projected to be relatively unchanged for the SRES A 2 and B 1 scenarios, with losses due to temperature increases and higher vapour pressure deficits being balanced by CO 2 fertilisation.

40|$|During {{the last}} 30 years, {{the climate of}} the West African Sahel has {{undergone}} various changes, {{especially in terms of}} rainfall. This has large consequences for the poor-resource farmers depending mainly on rainfed agriculture. This paper investigates the impacts of current climate variability and future climate change on groundnut and cowpea production in Niger for three major agricultural regions, including the <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin.</b> Niger was one of the largest West African groundnut producing and exporting countries. Groundnut production – as a cash crop – dropped fromabout 312, 000 tons in the mid 1960 s (about 68 % exported) to as low as 13, 000 tons in 1988 and increased again to 110, 000 tons in 2000. Cowpea, a food crop, showsa different tendency, going from 4, 000 tons in the mid fifties to a maximum of 775, 000 tons in 1997, and its cultivated area is still increasing. It is also a cash crop in local economies (especially for women). To highlight the impact of climate change on groundnut and cowpea production (significantly determined by rainfall in July, August and September), the following components of the rainfall regime were calculated for the period 1951 – 1998 : mean annual and monthly rainfall, beginning, end and lengthof the rainy season, number of rainy days per month, amount of rainfall per rainy day and the maximum length of dry spell per month. Three sub-periods whose duration varied per region were defined: for Dosso 1951 – 1968, 1969 – 1984 and 1985 – 1998; for Maradi 1951 – 1970, 1971 – 1987 and 1988 – 1998; and for Zinder 1951 – 1966, 1967 – 1984 and 1985 – 1998. A change in rainfallregime components was observed between the three sub-periods, which were characterized in chronological order by wet, dry and intermediate conditions. To assess the impact of climate variability and change on groundnut and cowpea production, a statistical modeling approach has been followed, based on thirteen predictors as described and discussed in the preceding paper. Climate change is mimicked in terms of reduced total amount of rainfall for the three main rainfall months and an increased temperature, while maintaining other significant predictors at a constant level. In 2025,production of groundnut is estimated to be between 11 and 25 % lower, while cowpeayield will fall maximally 30 %.

L'influence du développement de la végétation sur le ruissellement est étudié au moyen des données pluie-débit de 4 parcelles (50 m 2) couvertes en mil, arachide, jachère ou maintenue dénudée du centre Sénégal au cours d'une saison des pluies (1994). Un modèle analogique de ruissellement ‡ {{stockage}} de surface (BADER, 1994), dans lequel l'infiltration est une fonction croissante de la lame d'eau en surface du sol est ajusté sur les données.

Une analyse de sensibilité menée sur les données de la parcelle de sol nu {{montre que}} le paramètre n est le plus sensible des trois. Le calage numérique des paramètres sur chaque crue au cours de l'hivernage permet d'étudier leur évolution temporelle. Cette évolution est cohérente avec l'occupation de chaque parcelle. Les paramètres n et S de la parcelle de sol nu sont invariants sur la saison tandis que ceux des parcelles en végétation s'écartent progressivement des valeurs obtenues sur sol nu. Pour les parcelles en végétation, les valeurs de S divergent de celles du sol nu lorsque l'indice radiométrique de végétation (N. D. V. I.) servant à l'estimation du couvert dépasse 0. 30 - 0. 35 environ. L'évolution des paramètres n et S des parcelles en végétation peut être reliée au temps écoulé depuis le semis (mil, arachide) ou le sarclage initial (jachère) et à l'état d'humectation du sol (pour S). On montre également que le paramètre Hl peut être estimé linéairement à partir d'un indice de rugosité de surface descriptif de la microtopographie. The Sudanese climate {{is characterized by}} a rainy season and a dry season (mean annual rainfall between 400 and 900 mm). At the end of the dryseason (June in the northern hemisphere), the landscape is completely bare under the effect of animal grazing or soil tillage. During the first rainfalls this leads to high runoff coefficients. These runoff coefficients decrease gradually as the amount of vegetation increases during the growing season (RODIER (1984 - 1985); ALBERGEL (1988)). This is particularly true in the <b>Groundnut</b> <b>basin</b> of central Senegal where millet and groundnut are cultivated every other year. As the vegetative cover increases, a system of macropores develops in the soil and preferentially induces water infiltration through mesofauna burrows and along root systems. Hence, many authors have distinguished matrix infiltration governed by the generalized Darcy's law, from preferential infiltration through macropores characterized by a strongly heterogeneous spatial distribution (GERMAN, 1990). These macropores are thought to be responsible for the proportional increase in infiltration with increase in rainfall intensity observed on several experimental plots (BOUCHARDEAU and RODIER, 1960; VALENTIN, 1985; COLLINET, 1985; ALBERGEL, 1988). A more complete surface ponding or a differential distribution of the macroporosity in relation with the microtopography can contribute to this phenomenon. A conceptual runoff model accounting for surface storage, which views infiltration as a function of water depth on the ground surface, is proposed to describe the aforementioned phenomenon under three characteristic vegetative canopies of central Senegal (millet, groundnut and fallow). The model (BADER, 1994) is a distributed, three parameter model that accounts for transfer between spatial elements (parameter n), runoff (parameter Hl) and infiltration (parameter S). The model solves the equation of continuity according to an explicit scheme (forward time). The discharge exiting a spatial element is defined by a power function based on the water depth on the element. The value of the transfer parameter n (dimensionless) depends on the roughness and slope of the soil surface. Parameter Hl (meters) is equivalent to the water depth from which runoff occurs and is found in the discharge expression. Infiltration is defined as the product of the squareroot of the depth of ponded water of a plot and a S parameter (dimensionless) representing surface porosity. The experimental work took place on 4 rectangular 50 m 2 plots (10 m by 5 m) that were initially bare and weedy. At the beginning of the rainy season, two plots were cultivated in millet and groundnut, one left fallow and the fourth stripped by a powerful herbicide. The runoff was measured by a capacitive gauging system with each tank being equipped with a pressure transducer connected to a datalogger. A tipping bucket raingauge was also connected to the datalogger and rainfall and runoff were recorded simultaneously. The measurements were made to a precision of 4 mm in the tanks (0. 16 mm uncertainty for surface runoff depth). With a total seasonal rainfall of 711 mm in 1994, the cumulative surface runoff varied between 40 mm for the fallow plot to 150 mm for the bare soil plot. The cultivated groundnut and millet plots had cumulative runoff depths of 55 and 60 mm, respectively. The fallow plot would have had less runoff if it had been more than one-year old. The microtopography of each plot was evaluated using a profile meter. The surface roughness was estimated by the standard-error of measured relative elevations (GUILLOBEZ and ZOUGMORE, 1994). Measurements were taken after each significant rainfall and following tillage operations. The index of roughness varied following vigorous weeding of the groundnut plot to 5 mm for the fallow plot whose microtopography remained constant throughout the season. The development of the vegetative cover was indirectly followed by the calculation of a vegetation index (NDVI) derived from red and near infrared reflectances measured with a field radiometer. Although this index tends to saturate with full ground cover, it nevertheless remains a good indicator at the start of vegetative growth. The proposed model was used to reproduce measured runoff during several storm events. Calculations were undertaken with a 10 -s time step on a 1 m-long spatial element with a uniform set of parameters for each plot. A sensitivity analysis was performed for all runoff events on the bare plot. Hydrograph characteristics (runoff volume, peak discharge and time-to-peak) were particularly sensitive to variations in the transfer parameter (n) {{and to a lesser extent}} to changes in the infiltration (S) and runoff (Hl) parameters. For the 42 measured runoff hydrographs for all fourplots, the results were excellent: 70 % of the simulated hydrographs had a Nash's coefficient greater than or equal to 0. 90. For each plot, the seasonal chronicle of each parameter is coherent with the plot cover. The parameters for the bare plot were invariant throughout the rainy season. However, for the other plots, they varied with the vegetative cover. At the beginning of the growing season, they were similar to those obtained on bare soil and, as the vegetative cover increased, they varied until the NDVI exceeded 0. 35 (approximately 20 days after seeding). The evolution of the n and S parameters for the cultivated plots was linearly extrapolated from past events (seeding for the cultivated plots and chemical weeding for the fallow plot) and for S to an antecedent precipitation index. Farming practices that modified surface roughness needed to be accounted for as well. For the transfer parameter (n) of the groundnut plot, an increase of approximately 0. 4 was observed when a rainfall event followed weeding. No significant increase was seen for the millet plot. A linear relationship between the index of roughness and the roughness parameter (Hl) was also derived...|$|E
40|$|There {{are three}} systems of land tenure {{operating}} in Africa today: common law, state law based on colonial law and, in some areas, {{the law of}} Islam. None of these {{could be said to}} be dominant either regionally or nationally. Today, because of the growth in population, the considerable investment in development and the exploitation of the land's potential to the full, land is being seen more than ever before as a valuable resource. There has {{to be some sort of}} rationalization of all these land tenure systems in order to identify the most workable and the most appropriate system. Firstly, there is the problem of who owns the land, whether it belongs to one or to several individuals, to the state, to the clan or to no one in particular. Until recently the question was not even asked in these terms. There was more than enough land for everyone in Africa's vast expanses. Common law scrupulously controlled the acquisition of land but since there was little competition for it the application of the law was generally undisputed and did not result in conflict. The growth in population, the continual droughts in some parts of the continent, and the exhaustion of the soil have all combined to give land a new status, as something precious, since it is increasingly rare and threatened. Large sums of money have been spent on exploiting the bush, where once it was sufficient just to gather in what nature in her bounty provided. Who, for example owns the irrigated areas bordering the great rivers of Africa? Is it the man whose ancestors lived on them or the man who farms them or the man who has spent a fortune on developing them'? In the Sahel, who owns the maize fields where crops and cattle live in a symbiotically profitable relationship'? Is it the man who raises the crops or the man whose animals make the soil fertile ? In the western countries a single legal system can be applied to arbitrate in cases of dispute. African countries have to contend with several legal codes, the product of a chequered history: ancestral common law; modern law imposed by the colonial powers and, in certain cases, Islamic law. In some countries each region, even each village, has its own set of land tenure laws, often a mixture of past systems, in a jumbled juridical jigsaw. It is not hard to imagine the difficulty in trying to apply traditional common law land rights within the legalities of a barely understood European land tenure system. Private ownership an anathema It is the old, old story: the colonial settlers wanted to extract the maximum profit from their newly acquired lands. but had no intention of getting embroiled in the tangled web of common law. The French, for example. were quite clear on their policy: 'French intentions were to force the natives to adopt the concept of private ownership and land registration. This was initiated by Faidherbe in Senegal in I 865, who stipulated that only official title deeds would be accepted. The French Civil Code does not recognize the existence of common law,' explains the academic Catherine Coquery-Vidrovitch. African farmers, however, continue to use the common law system. Even today. when there is a dispute over land tenure, the conflict between the French concept of private property and the African tradition of land and the individual becomes apparent. At a conference on this subject one researcher put it this way: 'We thought we could move smoothly into the 2 () th century without dealing with the problem of persisting common laws on land tenure. The last 30 years have proved that you cannot act rid of history quite so easily. ' Right from the beginning the dice were loaded against the colonial powers. 'Land belongs first and foremost to the community before it belongs to an individual,' explains the researcher Raymond Verdier. 'Individuals do not exist in isolation because they are part of different groups, family relationships, marriage, locality or neighbourhood. ' In Mauritania. for example, and in many other West African countries, land belongs to those sharing the same lineage. The 'elders' share out the land between different families according to their needs, such as when children are born or leave the district or when couples form. This is very different from the deed or private ownership which states that the title to land shall be 'absolute, exclusive, and in perpetuity' (article 544 of the Civil Code). What makes it even harder for the lawyers is that in Africa land is not conceptualized as something purely material. A CNRS researcher, V 9 ronique Jacob, explains: 'This is one of the foundations of religious and social lit`e in Africa. The land is the home of their ancestors, through whose intermediary the living have a relationship with the dead. The land has a whole system of beliefs tied in with it. It is venerated and votive offerings are made to it. It is holy. inalienable, and often has no financial value attached to it, as with the Baoul 9 people in C 4 te d'lvoire. ' Here when the Kossou dam was being built, the surveyors who came to mark out the land, which was to be used to settle those who had to be moved off their own homelands, were welcomed by machetes. President Houphou-Boigny has bitter memories of 1963 when lawyers were drawing up estate law. Any unoccupied lands, deemed to be the favoured home of deities, were henceforth to be taken over by the state. As soon as this law became public knowledge the whole country went up in flames, a village technique for marking the acquisition of land. The law goes unheeded No one solution to this problem of land tenure seems wholly appropriate, neither control by the state, state monopoly, nor private ownership. This situation is bringing disastrous consequences for African agriculture and, in particular, for the environment. In C 4 te d'lvoire the famous principle that 'the land belongs to whoever cultivates it' has meant that coffee-cocoa fields have taken over the forest. The planters have demonstrated that 'might is right' and taken over large tracts of land at the expense of small farmers. The tropical forests, even those which are in theory protected, are being eroded by the advance of crop-growing and are dying out. In 1991 some 42 sq km, one-third of the Khelcom Forest, was cleared by a project initiated by the powerful Mouride Associates and established as an extension of the Senegal <b>groundnut</b> <b>basin.</b> The pastoralists found they had suddenly lost huge areas of pasture to groundnut growing. Mamadou Sy. a journalist with the Senegalese daily Waj Fadjri, wrote at the time: 'From now on in Khelcom the 6, 000 pastoralists will have to limit all their herd movements to 28, 000 ha per 100, 000 head of cattle, where once they had an area of 78. 000 ha to move round in. ' The crops vs. stock conflict Of all contemporary problems of land tenure law, that of users' right over pastoralists' land is one of the most difficult. 'After the herds pass through our fields we just want to lie down and die. The animals leave complete devastation in their wake, and there is just nothing left, especially if the crop is maize, yams, sorghum or millet. It is absolutely heartbreaking, two months' work wiped out in minutes,' a farmer from Niger told a newspaper during the last winter transhumance. So much for the symbiotic relationship, that happy coexistence of Haoussa farmers and Peul pastoralists spoken of by the sociologist Andr 9 Marty. The pastoralists on the one hand must have the forage provided by the farmland in order to feed their herds, and on the other the farmers need the natural fertilizer provided by the animals. Formerly the herds had to winter in the northern pasturelands and farming took precedence during those months, and if the herds came down early there were always the fallow fields and the poor land to provide their fodder. But fallow is a thing of the past and even the poor land is now used for out-of-season crops. The age-old division of time and space will no longer work. Since common law does not make allowance for new ways of life, what legislative process will take over from it? The answer to that question in today's Africa is: the law of the gun. A veterinary inspector in Togo reports that 'the itinerant pastoralists have firearms and threaten the peasant farmers, even though the carrying of weapons is illegal. Furthermore, they light fires whenever they camp without taking precautions and allow their herds to trample through the fields. ' In Benin from 1986 - 89 the tally of incidents was horrendous: 15 dead, 13 seriously injured and three missing in the Zou province, and four dead in the Mono. The terrible slaughter which took place at Toda, Niger, left a total of 300 dead, the majority of whom were women and children. A land registry is crucial Not surprisingly, development agents are making a priority of the land tenure question in order to avoid such horrifying tragedies. But Erik Orsenna asked in one of his books, 'Without a proper land registry, that is if property is not clearly marked, how can we ever make progress?' Since land rights are constantly changing is it reasonable to talk in teens of a land tenure survey which in any case would require constant updating, a task beyond the means of most countries? Etienne Le Roy of the Sorbonne believes that there is no point in setting up a system for the sake of it: 'We have to try and draw up a consensus which is appropriate to the circumstances, but I feel it is far more relevant and useful to societies in Africa to try solutions to their everyday problems (production, urban survival, education, management of the environment) than to be preoccupied by codes which have come from a consensus negotiated elsewhere and which is alien to them. ' To those who know Africa, it is apparent that African ways of thinking and behaviour are changing. Once upon a time, for example, the bush belonged to everyone. Now in some villages the chiefs are keen to extract payment from woodcutters working on their lands. The straw which once belonged to the gleaners is now claimed by the owner of the field. Could these ideas not be integrated into the framework of the national legislation, since common law alone cannot cope with the complexity of the population, changes in land use and the venous ways of allocating land? The large aid organizations are also aware of these changes. In Niger the European Development Fund (EDF) Project takes ethnic and land tenure customs into account when setting up irrigated areas along the river. Rather than keep the land improvements which belong to the state, and the]and itself (which belongs to those who have traditional rights to it) as two separate things, the developed land is sold off. The size and shape of these plots coincide with the existing land divisions and will he governed by local customary laws rather than by a national water or rural code, which does not exist in this country. 'It is not man who owns the land: it is the land which owns the man. ' The old proverb could just be right. (*) From L`appropriation de la terre en Afrique noire 'The French expression 'le foncier' means a particular set of social relationships which have land and territory as their basis. The factors which determine these social relationships are mainly economic (the original accumulation of capital: making a living, or legal procedures for land acquisition or adjudicating disputes), and they are also shaped by the processes which both confer objective reality on them and define them as distinctive systems*.
