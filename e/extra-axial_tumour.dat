40|$|Although primary {{treatment}} of medulloblastoma is now successful {{in a high}} percentage of patients, its secondary manifestations still bear a poor prognosis. Thorough studies of secondary manifestations are therefore pivotal to plan therapeutic approaches for the long-term management of medulloblastoma. Here we describe the incidence of secondary tumour manifestations in 66 patients of a single centre who underwent surgery for medulloblastoma between 1975 and 1990. No patient was excluded due to a poor postoperative course. Thirty-five patients showed evidence of secondary tumour growth. Of these, 17 suffered from local recurrence, and 27 developed metastastatic disease. The median latencies for secondary manifestations were 25 months for local recurrence (n = 17), 11 months for spinal metastases (n = 10), 15 months for supratentorial metastases (n = 8), 8 months for subleptomeningeal dissemination (n = 6), and 23 months for systemic metastases (n = 8). Two patients developed primary metastatic spread to the posterior fossa. Of 8 patients with supratentorial metastases, 6 developed fronto-basal lesions. In our patients, 89 % of secondary lesions occurred within less than 3 years after primary diagnosis. 85 % of patients with <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumour</b> spread had been treated with a permanent shunt. Radical tumour resection and radiotherapy with 30 Gy to the neuraxis and 20 Gy boost to the posterior fossa was an important prognostic factor in this series. Patients with additional chemotherapy did not benefit significantly from this treatment. We conclude that optimal management of the primary lesions should aim at (i) total resection, (ii) avoid permanent shunting, and (iii) completion of the radiotherapy with inclusion of the medial frontobasal cisterns in the radiotherapeutic regimen. Our analysis suggests that adequate postoperative screening programmes should consist of 3 -monthly scans of the neuraxis in the first three postoperative years and 6 -monthly scans thereafter...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the mechanism of}} cyst formation in <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). Cyst fluid, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood plasma were analysed in eight patients with nine peritumoral cysts: four with meningiomas, two with intracranial and two spinal intradural schwannomas. Measuring concentrations of various proteins [albumin, immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgA, alpha(2) -macroglobulin and IgM] in cyst fluid, CSF and blood plasma provides insight into the state of the semipermeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Peritumoral cysts accompanying intra-axial brain tumours are the end result of disruption of the BBB and oedema formation. Unlike intra-axial tumours which lie embedded within nervous tissue, <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> tend to be separated from nervous tissue by arachnoid and pia mater. High concentrations of proteins were measured in the cyst fluid, approaching blood plasma levels, suggesting a local barrier disruption, and passage across the arachnoid, pia mater and cortical/medullary layer into the CNS parenchyma, leaving the protein concentrations of CSF practically unchanged. We confirmed that very high concentrations of protein {{are to be found in}} tumour cysts, plasma proteins forming almost 90 % of the total protein in the cyst. We review current hypotheses on the pathogenesis of cysts accompanying neoplasms, particularly meningiomas and schwannomas, and conclude that the majority of proteins in cyst fluid in extra-axial, intradural meningiomas and schwannomas are plasma proteins. This provides a strong argument for pathogenesis of <b>extra-axial</b> intradural <b>tumour</b> cysts in favour of leakage of plasma proteins out of the tumour vessels into the nervous tissue...|$|R

40|$|A 68 -year-old woman {{presented}} with a 2 month history of progressive headache, left extremity weakness, and cognitive difficulties. Neuroimaging results demonstrated a macrocystic tumour attached to ethmoid sinuses and disclosed atypical findings. The tumour was totally removed. All the symptoms and signs ameliorated after surgery. Histological and immunohistochemical examinations led to a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumour. A solitary fibrous tumour {{could be seen in}} various intracranial areas but ethmoid sinuses and anterior fossa are not an exceptional site. They appear as <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> with a characteristic pattern on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the cystic component is very unusual.

30|$|Meningiomas {{are highly}} {{vascular}} lesions and therefore demonstrate hyperperfusion on perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), of which dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI {{is the most}} commonly used. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) should be raised and values are typically reported between 6 and 9 with slightly higher or lower values for angiomatous or fibrous subtypes respectively [15]. This is in contrast with metastases which have much lower rCBV values of 2 or less; the exception being the more vascular metastases of renal carcinoma or melanoma which may be indistinguishable from meningiomas [16]. Furthermore, <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> in general can be differentiated from intra-axial tumours due to the tendency of the former’s time-intensity curve to not return to baseline during the first pass [17]. This is due to their complete lack of a blood-brain barrier allowing more vascular leakage of contrast.|$|R
40|$|Conference Theme: Degenerative Lumbar SpineFree Paper 7 INTRODUCTION: Chordomas are <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> that {{originate}} from the primitive notochord. They are rare diseases that present mostly between {{the third and}} the fifth decades of life with an incidence rate of 0. 08 per 100, 000 in the United States. Approximately 35 % of chordomas arise in the clivus of the skull base (clival chordoma). In spite of their slow-growing and non-malignant histopathological appearance, they are potentially life threatening due to their locally destructive and invasive nature. Clival chordomas are located near the spheno-occipital junction {{at the base of}} the skull, behind the sphenoid sinuses. Involvement of the surrounding cranial nerves accounts for their symptomatology. It is notorious for its high tendency of recurrence following treatment, with a reported recurrence rate of 68 %. Therefore, gross total resection in combination with adjuvant radiotherapy is the standard mode of treatment …published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Dynamic {{perfusion}} {{magnetic resonance}} (MR) techniques {{may be used}} to track the susceptibility effects of gadolinium contrast material as it passes through the brain. We describe three intracranial tumours that showed progressively rising signal intensity above the baseline during first-pass contrast-enhanced echo-planar imaging (EPI) MR imaging. Methods: Multiphase acquisition using single-shot EPI was performed during rapid bolus contrast injection. Ten studies, using either spin-echo or gradient-echo EPI sequences, were carried out in eight patients with intracranial tumours. Time-signal intensity graphs and regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) were reviewed. Results: In seven studies, the signal intensity within the tumour showed initial signal drop and quick recovery to baseline and increased rCBV. Three studies revealed progressively rising signal intensity. These patients were all imaged using a spin-echo EPI method and subsequent histology revealed meningioma, hemangiopericytoma and pinealblastoma. Conclusion: Dynamic perfusion MR methods {{may be used to}} study intracranial tumours. However, in short relaxation time spin-echo EPI, the T 1 -effect of gadolinium becomes noticeable during the first-pass acquisition in <b>extra-axial</b> <b>tumours</b> that lack a well-developed blood-brain barrier. Careful selection of patients and pulse sequence is essential to avoid this potential pitfall...|$|R
40|$|HER 2 -positive {{breast cancer}} metastatic to {{intracranial}} meningioma: a case report The successful introduction of trastuzumab and other novel tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) {{for treatment of}} HER 2 -positive breast carcinoma has resulted in lengthened sur-vival for affected patients. In {{the context of this}} increased survival time, it has since emerged that patients who would otherwise have succumbed to the systemic progression of their disease have an increased propensity to develop metastases within the central nervous system (CNS) when compared with their HER 2 -negative counterparts. 1 Recent literature shows that these metastatic depos-its respond poorly to TKI therapy, most likely due to their inability to penetrate the blood brain barrier. 2 We write to inform you of the first known reported case documenting a HER 2 -positive breast carcinoma metasta-sising to an intracranial meningioma, without evidence of additional CNS involvement. This report serves to high-light our increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of brain metastasis, and how this growing knowledge should inform the next generation of treatment strategies. It also raises a clinical dilemma whether such a metastasis should be considered a true brain metastasis and be treated accordingly, since no brain parenchyma was involved. A 48 -year-old woman presented to hospital with a three-week history of a wor-sening generalised headache. Three months prior, she had been diagnosed with grade 3 HER 2 -amplified, oestrogen receptor (ER) positive, progesterone receptor (PR) nega-tive, invasive carcinoma of the breast, for which staging showed metastatic disease in the liver and lungs. At the time of this pres-entation, she had completed surgical management and was being actively treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab. She reported no focal neurological symptoms, and neurological physical examination was Figure 1 MRI image showing a 6. 5 cm well-circumscribed <b>extra-axial</b> frontal lobe <b>tumour...</b>|$|R
