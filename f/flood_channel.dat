5|$|SR54 was {{extended}} west as a freeway to I-5 from I-805 {{at the same}} time the Sweetwater River flood control channel was built; the state proposed routing the <b>flood</b> <b>channel</b> in between the two roadways of the freeway in 1963, and it would also delineate the boundary between the cities of Chula Vista and National City. Later that year, the county proposed an extension of the freeway east to US80 and Third Street in El Cajon. In 1966, the U.S. Army's Board of Engineers supported the construction of the <b>flood</b> <b>channel,</b> to protect future development in the surrounding region from flooding; the integration of SR54 was included in the proposal.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{road with}} a similar routing to SR54 was mentioned in newspapers in 1908, and was paved by 1935. The South Bay Freeway was constructed next as an expressway from National City to Spring Valley. The freeway west to I-5 and the Sweetwater River <b>flood</b> <b>channel</b> were built at the same time, although both were delayed due to environmental concerns and litigation. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, {{the entirety of the}} western portion of SR54 was converted to a freeway, while the entire portion inside the El Cajon city limits was returned to that city.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the freeway opened in 1963, east of I-805. The {{extension}} of the freeway west to I-5 was delayed in order {{to coincide with the}} construction of the <b>flood</b> <b>channel</b> for the Sweetwater River. While construction started in 1984, a court stopped the process for a few years, and this portion was not complete until 1992. The final section of freeway, which was upgraded from an expressway, opened in 2007, to coincide with the extension of SR125 south to Otay Mesa.|$|E

50|$|<b>Flood</b> control <b>channels</b> {{are large}} and empty basins which let water flow in and out (except during <b>flooding)</b> or dry <b>channels</b> that run below the street levels of some larger cities, so that if and when a flood occurs, the water will run into these channels, and {{eventually}} drain into a river or other body of water. <b>Flood</b> <b>channels</b> are sometimes built on the former courses of waterways {{as a way to}} reduce flooding. They are {{not to be confused with}} watercourses which are simply confined between levees. These structures may be made entirely of concrete, with concrete sides and an exposed bottom, with riprap sides and an exposed bottom, or completely unlined. They often contain grade control sills or weirs to prevent erosion and maintain a level streambed. By definition, <b>flood</b> control <b>channels</b> range from the size of a street gutter to a few hundred or even a few thousand feet wide in some rare cases. <b>Flood</b> control <b>channels</b> are found in most heavily developed areas in the world. One city with many of these channels is Los Angeles, as they became mandatory with the passage of the Flood Control Act of 1941 passed in the wake of the Los Angeles Flood of 1938.|$|R

40|$|The yearly floods of the Mekong Delta {{caused by}} the Mekong River have been {{considered}} a blessing; it purifies the agricultural lands and deposits a fresh layer of silt on the surface, which keeps the delta fertile. However, the growing demand for agricultural products internationally and nationally has pushed the farmers to harvest all year long, which has lead to {{a situation where the}} floods are more of a curse than a blessing. Besides the growing agricultural demand, the continuous urbanization has also caused the yearly flood to become less accepted. Furthermore, it is expected that the flooding problems will only increase even more in future due to climate change. A possible solution to reduce the frequency of flood risks is by constructing a <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> between the Mekong River and the Gulf of Thailand. The purpose of this <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> is to reduce the water level of the Mekong River during high water preventing it from flooding. The question is, if a <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> is a realistic measure to achieve this objective and to reduce flood risks. A feasibility study divided into two parts has been made, to find out how realistic a <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel,</b> as measure is to reduce flood risks. The first part of the study is {{to find out what the}} required technical conditions are for constructing a <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel.</b> The second part of the study concentrates on the question whether the effects of sediment deposition by the <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> into the Gulf of Thailand prohibits the construction of a <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel.</b> The conclusion of this feasibility study is that a <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> can be a solution to reduce current flood risks {{caused by the}} Mekong River. However, when future climate changes are taken into account the diversion channel is only sufficient to reduce the increased flood risk of the Hau River; additional measures are necessary to also lower the water level of the Tien River. The concern of sediment deposition at Phu Quoc is unjustified. Deposition of sediment near the shore of the discharge location can even have a positive side effect for the eroding coastline. The preferred <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> is to construct a deep channel of approximately 70 km long and depending on the withdrawal necessities the width of the channel will be between the 340 and 680 meters. The <b>flood</b> diversion <b>channel</b> withdraws at Chau Doc, goes along the Vinh Te channel for as long as possible and crosses the K. Tam Ngan channel to eventually discharge at the Middle location into the Gulf of Thailand. Coastal EngineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} the morphological integrityof the multiple channel system (MCS) of the Western Scheldt estuary. The tidal flats and surrounding ebb and <b>flood</b> <b>channels</b> form morphological cells, and the entire MCS can be schematized as a chain of such cells. The major ebb and <b>flood</b> <b>channels</b> have lost their one time function to feed and drain large tidal basins along the estuary. It is hypothesized that the MCS is now self-preserving {{as a result of the}} large gross sediment transport rates through these channels and the asymmetry of the channel system. From a stability analysis and computation of the gross sediment transports through the channels, the local and overall capacity of the estuary could be established to accommodate for the dumping of sediments dredged in the fairways of the estuary to safeguard navigation. This capacity compared favorably with the experience of the managing authorities. The scheme is used to evaluate a series of managing scenarios.
