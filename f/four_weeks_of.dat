The scene required Modine and Cage to hang {{off the edge of the}} roof secured by safety wires, while the sequence in which Birdy falls off the roof was performed by a stunt double.|$|E
5|$|Although the B-52A was {{the first}} {{production}} variant, these aircraft were used only in testing. The first operational version was the B-52B that had been developed in parallel with the prototypes since 1951. First flying in December 1954, B-52B, AF Serial Number 52-8711, entered operational service with 93rd Heavy Bombardment Wing (93rd BW) at Castle Air Force Base, California, on 29 June 1955. The wing became operational on 12 March 1956. The training for B-52 crews consisted of five weeks of ground school and <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> flying, accumulating 35 to 50 hours in the air. The new B-52Bs replaced operational B-36s on a one-to-one basis.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} few days after hatching, young red-throated loons are fed aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E

5|$|Iniki's {{high winds}} also downed 26.5% of the island's {{transmission}} poles, 37% of its distribution poles, and 35% of its 800mile (1300km) distribution wire system. The entire island lacked electricity and television service {{for an extended}} period of time. Electric companies restored only 20% of the island's power service within <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> Iniki, while other areas were without power for up to three months. Also affected by the storm was the agricultural sector. Though much of the sugar cane was already harvested, what was left was severely damaged. The winds destroyed tender tropical plants like bananas and papayas and uprooted or damaged fruit and nut trees.|$|E
5|$|Overall {{the play}} was a {{tremendous}} financial success; the previews broke attendance records. In Boston, the show sold out even after the addition of extra matinées. The first week on Broadway took in nearly $ 20,000, close to the maximum the Shubert Theatre could generate at normal prices. However, ticket sales fell off rapidly following the strongly negative reviews. Woods pre-sold <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> tickets to local ticket brokers, which helped the box office totals, but the brokers were left with unsold seats even after offering deep discounts.

5|$|Visual {{effects for}} Deadpool were {{produced}} by Digital Domain (DD), Atomic Fiction, Blur Studio, Weta Digital, Rodeo FX, and Luma Pictures. Reynolds credited Miller and his visual effects experience with producing {{a film that}} looked liked others with much bigger budgets. Motion capture supervisor Greg LaSalle agreed with this, noting that Miller held off on working on the CGI for Colossus until after the film was edited to avoid spending money on shots {{that would not be}} used. Miller worked with visual effects supervisor Rothbart to design and complete the film's 1500 effects shots. These were up from a planned 700 shots, with 800 of them completed in the last <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> production.|$|E

Four years later, Richard's sister Joan was born, and the family moved to Far Rockaway, Queens. Though {{separated}} by nine years, Joan and Richard were close, as they both shared a natural curiosity about the world. Their mother thought that women did not have the cranial capacity to comprehend such things. Despite their mother's disapproval of Joan's desire to study astronomy, Richard encouraged his sister to explore the universe. Joan eventually became an astrophysicist specializing in interactions between the Earth and the solar wind.|$|E

5|$|By 1730, on the {{recommendation}} of General Wilhelm Dietrich von Buddenbrock, the rehabilitated Zieten entered the newly-formed Freikompanie (independent company) of hussars at Potsdam. On 1 March 1732, a second company of the Hussars was created, and Zieten was appointed as its chief and promoted to the Rittmeister with 50 thalers a month's salary. In summer 1732, Zieten was given <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> arrest for an offense. In 1735, Frederick William appointed Zieten as the head of a hussar company, and sent him to the Imperial Army on the Rhine, where he participated in the Rhine campaign. Károly József Batthyány, the Austrian hussars' superintendent, served as his mentor in the fighting against France. At that time, the Austrians were the reputed masters of light cavalry work. His next promotion, to major took place on 29 January 1736.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{instruction}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World WarII, {{in response to a}} vast {{increase in the number of}} aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, No.1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS). The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Evans {{broke the}} Western Australian {{record for the}} 100m breaststroke during his final year at school. He and his father decided that he should step up his {{swimming}} career, and Evans entered the 1979 Australian Championships in Perth. Despite only <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> solid training {{leading up to the}} meet, Evans came second to Lindsay Spencer. Evans was omitted from the Australian squad that toured Britain because he was an unknown swimmer. After the meet, Evans vowed to become an elite swimmer and Olympian. A week later, Evans travelled to England to train at Crystal Palace in London under David Haller, coach of future Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew. Evans did so feeling that there was insufficient coaching support for breaststrokers in Australia. In three months of training in London, Evans had risen up the breaststroke rankings from outside the top 200 into the top 25. He returned to Australia and won selection in the national team for the FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation) World Cup in Japan, before returning to London for more training.|$|E

5|$|Plasmapheresis and {{intravenous}} immunoglobulins (IVIG) are the {{two main}} immunotherapy treatments for GBS. Plasmapheresis attempts to reduce the body's attack on the nervous system by filtering antibodies out of the bloodstream. Similarly, administration of IVIG neutralizes harmful antibodies and inflammation. These two treatments are equally effective, but {{a combination of the}} two is not significantly better than either alone. Plasmapheresis speeds recovery when used within <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> the onset of symptoms. IVIG works as well as plasmapheresis when started within two weeks of the onset of symptoms, and has fewer complications. IVIG is usually used first because of its ease of administration and safety. Its use is not without risk; occasionally it causes liver inflammation, or in rare cases, kidney failure. Glucocorticoids alone have not been found to be effective in speeding recovery and could potentially delay recovery.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} pitched to several studios, {{and the only}} {{interested}} studio was Focus Features, who wanted to film it in Canada. After the studio attempted to have the film be centered on the character Richard Hoover, and Arndt disagreed, he was fired and replaced by another writer. The new writer added several scenes, including Richard's confrontation with the character who dismisses his motivational technique business. A corporate change brought in a new studio head and Arndt was rehired when the new writer left after <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> rewriting the script. After two years of pre-production, Focus Features dropped the film in August 2004. Marc Turtletaub paid $400,000 to Focus Features to buy back {{the rights to the}} film and for development costs.

The same month at Benalla, thirty-two United States Army Air Corps pilots undertook <b>four</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>of</b> flying in the Wacketts. On 5September 1942, one of the Wacketts crashed after apparently stalling on takeoff, killing the trainee and seriously injuring the pilot. The Wackett Trainers were taken out of service for upgrades in February 1943, and the school again began operating Tiger Moths. One pilot was killed and another seriously injured when their Tiger Moths collided shortly after takeoff on 15June. On 7July, one of the Tiger Moths crashed during a night-flying exercise just east of Benalla, killing both pilots. Another Tiger Moth and its pilot were lost in a crash west of Benalla on 20October 1943. On 14May 1944, a pilot was killed and a trainee seriously injured when their Tiger Moth spun out of control during an instrument test north of Benalla.|$|E
5|$|The troupe hired {{several of}} the people they had worked with on Brain Candy, {{including}} Craig Northey and director Kelly Makin.
