5000|$|A {{post office}} called Grubville {{has been in}} {{operation}} since 1853. The community was named after the occupation of a local [...] "grubber" [...] (i.e. post <b>hole</b> <b>digger).</b>|$|E
50|$|Commonly {{referred}} to as Post <b>Hole</b> <b>Diggers</b> and Earth Augers, Tractor PTO Augers are implements {{used in conjunction with}} a tractor's Power Take Off drive, and a tractor's 3 point hitch.|$|R

[...] "I {{happened}} to be over near where he lives when Farmer Brown's boy came along and surprised Digger some distance {{from one of his}} <b>holes.</b> <b>Digger</b> didn't try to get to one of those holes; he simply began to dig. My gracious, how the sand did fly! He was out of sight in the ground before Farmer Brown's boy could get to him. Johnny Chuck is pretty good at digging, but he simply isn't in the same class with Digger the Badger. No one is that I know of, unless it is Miner the Mole. I guess this is all I know about him, excepting that he is a great fighter. Once I saw him whip a dog almost twice his size. I never heard such hissing and snarling and growling. He wouldn't tell me anything about how he lives." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 'Traditional underpinning,' {{the mass}} {{concrete}} underpinning method is nearly 100 years in age, and the protocol has not changed. This underpinning method strengthens an existing structure's foundation by digging boxes by hand underneath and sequentially pouring concrete in a strategic order. The final result {{is basically a}} foundation built underneath the existing foundation. This underpinning method is generally applied when the existing foundation is at a shallow depth, however, the method still works very well even at fifty feet (fifteen meters) deep. The method has not changed since its inception with its use of utilitarian tools such as shovels and post <b>hole</b> <b>diggers.</b> Heavy machinery is not called for in this method due to the tight nature of the boxes being dug. There are several advantages to using this method of underpinning including {{the simplicity of the}} engineering, the low cost of labor to produce the result, and the continuity of the structure's uses during construction.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} auger type post hole diggers. These are {{generally}} easier to use, {{and they can}} be used to a much greater depth, as the hole can be dug as deep as {{the entire length of the}} shaft. More importantly, they form a much neater hole, with a well-defined circumference. However, the very fact that the person doing the digging is guaranteed a perfect hole with an auger post <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> is also its greatest weakness: any given auger style post <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> can only dig one size hole—a hole with the same diameter as the auger's screw.|$|E
50|$|Compact utility {{tractors}} require special, smaller implements than full-sized agricultural tractors. Very common implements {{include the}} box blade, the grader blade, the landscape rake, the post <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> (or post hole auger), the rotary cutter (slasher or a brush hog), a mid- or rear-mount finish mower, a broadcast seeder, a subsoiler and the rototiller (rotary tiller). In northern climates, a rear-mounted snow blower is very common; some smaller CUT models {{are available with}} front-mounted snow blowers powered by mid-PTO shafts. Implement brands outnumbere tractor brands, so CUT owners have {{a wide selection of}} implements.|$|E
50|$|There are {{different}} kinds of post hole diggers. The pictured type is jabbed into {{the ground in the}} open position until the blades are buried. At that point the handles are pulled apart to close the tool and grab the chunk of soil loosened. They are then pulled out of the ground with the chunk of soil. The process is repeated until the hole is deep enough, or until the hole is so deep and narrow that the handles can no longer be pulled apart fully. This is one of the weaknesses of this kind of post <b>hole</b> <b>digger.</b>|$|E
5000|$|On 9 July 1872 The Maitland Mercury and Hunter River General Advertiser {{reported}} that [...] "the scene at Home Rule is a busy one, {{and very few}} people can form an idea of it unless they go and see for themselves. A township is in rapid formation, and streets are being made close to the golden <b>holes.</b> One <b>digger</b> refused £500 for a share in a claim on the right spot. Everyone appears sanguine. The storekeepers and publicans look remarkably pleasant, as if they anticipated rich harvests, and even John Chinaman smiles graciously on meeting you. It would almost be an impossibility {{to give an account}} of the different claims, as they extend for miles; and until the dispute as to the frontage and block system is settled, many men will prefer to be idle." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{whole of}} {{the bottom of the}} narrow valley was a scene of life and bustle. The {{existence}} of gold in the valley had been discovered but three weeks before, but a rush had taken place from other diggings. The ground had been allotted out, and a number of tents pitched, and rough huts erected. Men were working as if for bare life. The lots were small, and the ground was already perfectly honeycombed with <b>holes.</b> Generally the <b>diggers</b> worked in batches of four or five, each member of which took up a claim, so that the space for operations was enlarged.|$|R
5000|$|Eucalyptus elaeophloia, {{commonly}} known as Nunniong gum or olive mallee, is a mallee or tree species that is endemic to a restricted area in south-eastern Australia. It {{is closely related to}} Eucalyptus imlayensis which occurs in New South Wales. It may grow to between 4 and 12 metres in height and has smooth bark. The species was first formally described in the journal Australian Systematic Botany in 1992 from material collected in 1987 from Brumby Point and <b>Diggers</b> <b>Hole</b> Spur in the Alpine National Park. Due to widespread bushfires in 2003, the known habitat of the species was completely burnt, however most individuals have since resprouted from trunks and lignotubers. The species is listed as [...] "vulnerable" [...] on the Department of Sustainability and Environment's Advisory List of Rare Or Threatened Plants In Victoria.|$|R
40|$|Many {{hatcheries}} successfully {{produced and}} sold cherax as ornamental crayfish. The attempt to culture cherax in earthen pond to produce consumable size yabbies facing {{the fact that}} cherax is a good <b>hole</b> <b>digger</b> and usually escapes {{through the hole in}} dyke. Single-o-shelter meant to provide shelter for every single spawner as well as hideout for the juvenile produced. The shelter for spawner was a 25 inches long and 2. 0 inches diameter PVC pipe randomly spread on pond bottom. Aquatic weed (Vallisneria torta) grew in the shallow part of pond to provide hiding place for juvenile. The species stocked is huna and redclaw, each at density of 2 and 6 sets of spawner. One set of spawner consists of 3 males and 5 females weighing averagely around 20 g each. The experimental units are randomly selected to facilitate random block design in 2 rearing period as replicate. The pond dimension is 10 x 10 m, divide into 3 compartments i. e. feeding, ground, nursery ground and harvest ditch. Water depth at nursery ground was 30 cm and at the other compartments at 60 cm. Follow gravity force, the water in ponds flows at 50 — 100 L minute- 1. Self-made diet distributed into pond twice a day to meet 3 % daily feeding ration. Survival rate and specific growth rate of spawner as well as juvenile produced and number of gravid female checked {{at the end of each}} rearing period or every 3 months. After 6 months, average weight of redclaw and huna reaching 146. 12 ± 34. 47 g and 103. 7 ± 29. 83 g, respectively. Redclaw produced progeny of 5 size groups and huna produced only 2 groups. Respective to the species, average weight of the first offspring batch was 39. 03 ± 5. 33 and 26. 83 ± 2. 09 g. Redclaw at 2 sets of spawner and male grow faster than of 6 sets of spawner and female. No survival rate significant difference among ponds indicates that single–o-shelter technique provides sufficient shelter for spawner to grow and reproduce. Male monosex redclaw culture in earthen pond seems to be more promising than mixed-sex and female monosex culture for consumable size production of either huna or redclaw...|$|E
