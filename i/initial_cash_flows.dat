40|$|Firm-level {{simulation}} is used {{to analyze}} farm financial performance with adjustable-rate, adjustable-term, and fixed-rate financing. Adjustable-term financing is accomplished by changing the term of the loan, instead of payment size, when interest rates change. Simulation {{results indicate that the}} adjustable-term loan is an innovation which reduces the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> destabilizing effects of volatile interest rates. Key words: adjustable-term loan, <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> repayment risk, simulation. Historically, fixed-rate loans have been the standard financing arrangement in agriculture. A number of credit innovations have been pro-posed as alternatives to conventional fixed-rate, constant payment loans (Baker; Lee; Tauer). There are four primary reasons for considering these alternatives: (a) fluctuating interest rates, (b) fluctuating repayment ability of borrowers, (c) tax implications for lenders and borrowers, and (d) discrepancies between finance charges and <b>initial</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> generated by debt-financed assets. Lee identified several categories of alternatives. These include flex-ible repayment mortgages, graduated payment mortgages, variable interest rate mortgages, and reverse mortgages. Flexible repayment mort-gages allow borrowers to increase or reduce the amount of loan payments, within certain lim-its, in response to fluctuating repayment abil-ity. Graduated payment mortgages (GPMs) provide for loan payments to be structured in a manner that allows initial payments to be less than under straight amortization. GPMs require payment size to gradually increase {{over the life of the}} loan.

The starting point for gathering such information {{is presented in the}} enterprise financial statements. Secondary data presented by the Business School of the University of Stellenbosch was used. The study focused on finding out the magnitude of reporting <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from operating activities using the indirect or direct methods. The study also checked the frequency of reporting value - added statements, and took a forecast view on what the reporting nature is expected to look like in the next financial year-end. The database used in the study included 655 listed and delisted industrial companies in the Johannesburg Stock Exchangeover the ten-year period starting from January 1990 through to December 1999. It is noted that the South African Institute of Chartered Accountants, as stated in Statement AC 118, encourages enterprises to report <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from operating activities using the direct method. This is because the direct method provides information which may be useful in estimating future <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and which is not available under the indirect method. The study noted the rate at which newly listed enterprises report their <b>initial</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> statements, and the rate at which enterprises listed before 1996 are changing from reporting using the indirect method to the direct method. The results showed that at present South African enterprises are reporting <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from operating activities at a higher rate that in other notable Western Countries subscribing to the doctrines of the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC). The number of enterprises presenting value - added statements has shown an increase, though reporting value - added statements is not yet statutory.

40|$|Innovative {{financial}} instruments are being created to reward conservation on private, working lands. Major design challenges remain, however, {{to make investments}} in biodiversity and ecosystem services economically attractive and commonplace. From a business perspective, three key financial barriers for advancing conservation land uses must frequently be addressed: high up-front costs, long time periods with no revenue, and high project risk due to long time horizons and uncertainty. We explored ways of overcoming these barriers on grazing lands in Hawaii by realizing a suite of timber and conservation revenue streams associated with their (partial) reforestation. We calculated the financial implications of alternative strategies, focusing on Acacia koa (“koa”) forestry because of its high conservation and economic potential. Koa’s timber value alone creates a viable investment (mean net present value = $ 453 /acre), but its long time horizon and poor <b>initial</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> pose formidable challenges for landowners. At present, subsidy payments from a government conservation program targeting benefits for biodiversity, water quality, and soil erosion have the greatest potential to move landowners beyond the tipping point in favor of investments in koa forestry, particularly when combined with future timber harvest (mean net present value = $ 1, 661 /acre). Creating financial mechanisms to capture diverse ecosystem service values through time will broaden opportunities for conservation land uses. Governments, nongovernmental organizations, and private investors have roles to play in catalyzing this transition by developing new revenue streams that can reach {{a broad spectrum of}} landowners...|$|R

50|$|Net {{present value}} (NPV) is {{determined}} by calculating the costs (negative <b>cash</b> <b>flows)</b> and benefits (positive <b>cash</b> <b>flows)</b> for each period of an investment. The period is typically one year, but could be measured in quarter-years, half-years or months. After the <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> for each period is calculated, the present value (PV) of each one is achieved by discounting its future value (see Formula) at a periodic rate of return (the rate of return dictated by the market). NPV {{is the sum of}} all the discounted future <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> Because of its simplicity, NPV is a useful tool to determine whether a project or investment will result in a net profit or a loss. A positive NPV results in profit, while a negative NPV results in a loss. The NPV measures the excess or shortfall of <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> in present value terms, above the cost of funds. In a theoretical situation of unlimited capital budgeting a company should pursue every investment with a positive NPV. However, in practical terms a company's capital constraints limit investments to projects with the highest NPV whose cost <b>cash</b> <b>flows,</b> or <b>initial</b> <b>cash</b> investment, do not exceed the company's capital. NPV is a central tool in discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> (DCF) analysis and is a standard method for using the time value of money to appraise long-term projects.

40|$|Discounted <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> {{methods such as}} Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return {{are often}} used interchangeably or even {{together}} for assessing value creation in industrial and engineering projects. Notwithstanding its diffi culties of applicability and reliability, the {{internal rate of return}} (IRR) is commonly used in real-life applications. Among other problems, a project may have no real-valued IRR, a circumstance that may occur in projects which require shutting costs or imply an <b>initial</b> positive <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> such as a down payment made by a client. This paper supplies a genuine IRR for a project which has no IRR. This seemingly paradoxical result is achieved by making use of a new approach to rate of return (Magni, 2010), whereby any project is associated with a unique return function. which maps aggregate capitals into rates of return. Each rate of return is a weighted average of one-period (internal) rates of return, so it is called Average Internal Rate of Return (AIRR). We introduce a twin project which has a unique IRR and the same NPV as the original project's, and which is obtained through an appropriate minimization of the distance between the original project's cash ow stream and the twin project's. Given that the latter's IRR lies on the original project's return function, it represents an AIRR of the original project.

The {{purpose of this}} research is to explain and prove the {{influence of}} changes in <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> from operating activities, <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> from investing activities and <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> from financing activities of the stock return. Analysis tools used in this study is a multiple linear regression analysis where the analysis used to determine the effect of variable X consists of Variable Operating <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Changes (X 1), change in Investment <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> (X 2), and Financing <b>Cash</b> <b>Flow</b> Changes (X 3), the Stock Return (Y) in the BEI Manufacturing Company. Hypothesis testing using the F test to simultaneously test the dependent variable against independent variables, t tests to demonstrate the influence of partially dependent variables against independent variables Results of analysis showed that simultaneous changes in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow,</b> investment <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> has a significant impact on stock returns. While In partial, changes in operating <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> have an effect on stock returns, while changes in investment <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> and financing <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> does not have an effect on stock retur...|$|R

40|$|The thesis investigates {{construction}} project <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> It {{is divided into}} two main components. The first investigates the cumulative gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles (S curves), and the second examines the cumulative net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> profiles. The gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model can be used by either construction industry clients or contractors, whereas the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model concerns the contractor. Interest in {{construction project}} <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> resulted from changed economic pressures in the 1970 s. A rise in inflation was associated with increased client attention to his gross <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> to the contractor, and similarly higher interest rates had the effect that contractors became concerned with their net <b>cash</b> <b>flows.</b> An examination of the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature found that most models were aimed at discovering generally applicable ideal curves. A similar situation existed within the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> literature. It was argued that the averaging approach is unsuitable for construction project <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> research, and consequently an approach which concentrates on the individual project was pursued. A gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was developed using logistic transformation regression procedures. This yielded excellent results for post-hoc analysis of individual project data. Furthermore the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was found to be suitable for the generation of a construction project net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model, which was similarly oriented towards the post-hoc analysis of single projects. A measure of deviation was used which enabled the identification of projects for which the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model was a poor fit. This same procedure was used to exclude projects from the net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> analysis. The results from the gross <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model analysis indicate that projects do vary considerably from one to another, and this supports the contention made that an individual approach to this research is necessary. The net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model yields an excellent trend line for net <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> on a project, and thus provides an excellent means for senior management to judge the quality of management employed on a projectRestricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
