5|$|A {{saturation}} {{profile is}} one {{which all the}} tissues considered by the decompression model have become saturated with inert <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the breathing mixture. Most decompression models will take this to be at six tissue half-times for the slowest tissue considered. Further bottom time at the same depth will not affect the inert gas loading of any tissue and will not affect the decompression required.|$|E
5|$|Because the hot recycle solids are heated in a {{separate}} furnace, the oil shale <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> these technologies is not diluted with combustion exhaust gas. Another advantage {{is that there is}} no limit on the smallest particles that the retort can process, thus allowing all the crushed feed to be used. One disadvantge is that more water is used to handle the resulting finer shale ash.|$|E
5|$|Flux-cored wire is {{considered}} to have some advantages for outdoor welding on-site, as the shielding gas plume {{is less likely to}} be blown away in a wind than shield <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> a conventional nozzle. A slight drawback is that, like SMAW (stick) welding, there may be some flux deposited over the weld bead, requiring more of a cleaning process between passes.|$|E

5|$|From the 1950s until 2009 the {{buildings}} were used as a barn for animals and agricultural machinery. It has since been restored and had a biomass boiler installed. During the restoration an unexplained series of unusual pipework was discovered in {{the floor of the}} building. The building now acts as a visitor centre, which includes access to the dynamo room where acetylene gas was produced along with a thermalume generator which produced <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> petrol and air.|$|E
5|$|Halley has {{probably}} been in its current orbit for 16,000â€“200,000 years, {{although it is not}} possible to numerically integrate its orbit for more than a few tens of apparitions, and close approaches before 837 AD can only be verified from recorded observations. The non-gravitational effects can be crucial; as Halley approaches the Sun, it expels jets of sublimating <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> its surface, which knock it very slightly off its orbital path. These orbital changes cause delays in its perihelion of four days, average.|$|E
5|$|Offshore oil and <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> North Sea and Irish Sea, {{and more}} {{recently}} offshore wind, are significant components in Northern England's energy mix. Although deep-pit coal mining in the UK ended in 2015 with the closure of Kellingley Colliery, North Yorkshire, there are also several open-pit mines in the area. Shale gas is especially prevalent across Northern England, although plans to extract it through hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") {{have proven to be}} controversial.|$|E

40|$|Concentration-response {{data are}} {{presented}} on the toxic {{effects of the}} pyrolysis <b>gases</b> <b>from</b> six synthetic polymers on Swiss Webster male mice, using a toxicity screening test method. The polymers consisted of one sample each of polycarbonate and polystyrene, and two samples each of polyethylene and acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS). All six samples were evaluated using the rising temperature program, and three samples were evaluated using the fixed temperature program. The pyrolysis <b>gases</b> <b>from</b> polycarbonate, polyethylene, and ABS appeared to exhibit the concentration-response relationships commonly encountered in toxicology. The polystyrene sample gave variable results; probably due to poor reproducibility of the essentially anaerobic pyrolysis. Carbon monoxide {{seemed to be the}} principal toxicant in the pyrolysis <b>gases</b> <b>from</b> polycarbonate and polyethylene, but {{did not appear to be}} the principal toxicant in the pyrolysis <b>gases</b> <b>from</b> ABS...|$|R
5|$|Once microbubbles have formed, {{they can}} grow by either a {{reduction}} in pressure or by diffusion of gas into the <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> its surroundings. In the body, bubbles may be located within tissues or carried along with the bloodstream. The speed of blood flow within a blood vessel {{and the rate of}} delivery of blood to capillaries (perfusion) are the main factors that determine whether dissolved gas is taken up by tissue bubbles or circulation bubbles for bubble growth.|$|E

5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost heating fuel that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E

5|$|Although {{industry}} was rapidly expanding throughout {{the northern part}} of the state, Indiana remained largely rural at the turn of the 20th century with a growing population of 2.5million. Like much of the rest of the American Midwest, Indiana's exports and job providers remained largely agricultural until after World War I. Indiana's developing industry, backed by inexpensive natural <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the large Trenton Gas Field, an educated population, low taxes, easy access to transportation, and business-friendly government, led Indiana to grow into one of the leading manufacturing states by the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s the lessee at Muckaty was Fred Ulyatt. The 1940s also {{marked a}} {{significant}} change in the region's road infrastructure. A dirt track had been formed to service the telegraph line in the late nineteenth century. This became the Stuart Highway, crossing the eastern part of Muckaty, and it was upgraded to an all-weather road in late 1940, before being bitumenised in 1944. Sources do not say who leased the property between the 1940s and 1982, at which point the lease was held by James and Miriam Hagan. In 1988 it was transferred to Hapford Pty Limited and Kerfield Pty Limited. Between 1985 and 1987 a natural gas pipeline was built across the station, carrying <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> Palm Valley in the Amadeus Basin to Channel Island near Darwin.|$|E
5|$|Charging {{an empty}} dive {{cylinder}} also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> a storage bank {{at room temperature}} decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but {{the temperature of the}} gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.|$|E

5|$|Due to his {{casualty}} {{studies on}} mustard <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> an accident {{during the war}} in Italy, Rhoads became interested in its potential for cancer treatment. For the rest of his life, his research interest was in developing chemotherapy for cancer treatment, but he served primarily as an administrator and scientific director at Memorial and Sloan-Kettering. From studies of mustard gas, he developed a drug called mechlorethamine or Mustargen. Its success in clinical trials during the war years was the basis {{for the development of the}} field of anti-cancer chemotherapy. Rhoads also became interested in total body irradiation, which led to early work on chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Ever {{since the}} Han dynasty (202 BC â€“ 220 AD), the Chinese had drilled deep {{boreholes}} to transport natural <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> bamboo pipelines to stoves where cast iron evaporation pans boiled brine to extract salt. During the Tang dynasty, a gazetteer of Sichuan province stated {{that at one}} of these 182m (600ft) 'fire wells', men collected natural gas into portable bamboo tubes which could be carried around for dozens of km (mi) and still produce a flame. These were essentially the first gas cylinders; Robert Temple assumes some sort of tap was used for this device.|$|E

5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved <b>gas</b> <b>from</b> the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the nerve endings causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
5|$|Intensification of {{the killing}} {{operations}} took place in late 1941 when the SS began construction of stationary gassing facilities to replace the use of Einsatzgruppen for mass killings.

During Operation Reinhard, run by officers from the TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde, who were sworn to secrecy, three death camps were built in occupied Poland: BeÅ‚Å¼ec (operational by March 1942), SobibÃ³r (operational by May 1942), and Treblinka (operational by July 1942), with squads of Trawniki men (Eastern European collaborators) overseeing hundreds of Sonderkommando prisoners, who were forced to work in the gas chambers and crematoria before being murdered themselves. On Himmler's orders, by early 1942 the concentration camp at Auschwitz was greatly expanded to include the addition of gas chambers, where victims were killed using the pesticide Zyklon B.|$|E
