6000|$|Bobus, in {{quest of}} <b>green</b> <b>hellebore,</b> got {{off with a}} warning; but a week later, Robin and Jock were {{inspecting}} the heronry, when they caught sight of a keeper, and dashed off to find themselves running into the jaws of another. Swift as lightning, Jock sprung up into an ivied ash; but the less ready Bob was caught by the leg as he mounted, and pulled down again, while his captor shouted, [...] "If there's any more of you young varmint up yonder, you'd best come down before I fires up into the hoivy." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{the month}} of January passed, with its short days and its bits of snow and bursts of sunshine. On sunny days Alvina {{walked down to the}} desolate river-bed, which fascinated her. When Pancrazio was {{carrying}} up stone or lime on the ass, she accompanied him. And Pancrazio was always carrying up something, for he loved the extraneous jobs like building a fire-place much more than the heavy work of the land. Then she would find little tufts of wild narcissus among the rocks, gold-centred pale little things, many on one stem. And their scent was powerful and magical, like the sound of the men who came all those days and sang before Christmas. She loved them. There was <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> too, a fascinating plant--and one or two little treasures, the last of the rose-coloured Alpine cyclamens, near the earth, with snake-skin leaves, and so rose, so rose, like violets for shadowiness. She sat and cried over the first she found: heaven knows why.|$|E

50|$|Common meadow wildflowers include Jeffrey's {{shooting}} star, elephanthead, Gorman's buttercup, alpine asters, American alpine speedwell, Indian paintbrush, small-flowered paintbrush, {{high mountain}} cinquefoil, Gray's ligusticum, <b>green</b> false <b>hellebore,</b> swamp laurel, and white bog orchid (Habenaria dilatata). Also, Jeffrey's shooting star and marsh marigold grow {{close to the}} lake shore. In the moist riparian area near the lake's outlet, there are Gorman's buttercup, yellow monkeyflower, Lewis monkey flower, arrowleaf groundsel, and false asphodel. Oregon saxifrage lives {{in some of the}} boggy areas around the lake.|$|R
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> {{has become}} weedy in North America, Scandinavia, the Netherlands, and {{northern}} Germany.|$|E
50|$|The {{ground layer}} {{includes}} herb paris, <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> and lily-of-the-valley which grow amongst bluebell, yellow archangel, wood anemone, ramsons (wood garlic), wood-sorrel and many ferns.|$|E
50|$|Helleborus viridis, {{commonly}} called <b>green</b> <b>hellebore,</b> is a perennial flowering {{plant in the}} buttercup family, Ranunculaceae, native to Central and Western Europe, including England. All parts of the plant are poisonous.|$|E
5000|$|Only after Walter's {{death in}} 1947 could Margery fully {{implement}} her ideas and develop her {{skills as a}} plantswoman. She became interested especially in unfashionable <b>green</b> <b>hellebores</b> and other shade-loving spring flowers. She sought to make things grow in cracks and crevices. She soon had a group of correspondents, with whom she swapped ideas and rare plant material. These included Lawrence Johnston of Hidcote Manor, Gloucestershire, the garden designer Nancy Lindsay, and the Somerset neighbour Violet Clive of Brympton d'Evercy, an equally passionate gardener. By the late 1950s, East Lambrook garden was being {{opened to the public}} for charity and had a small plant nursery attached to it. In 1963, she received a silver Veitch Memorial Medal from the Royal Horticultural Society.As the garden's present-day website puts it, [...] "Margery Fish developed a style of gardening which was in tune with the times: the Second World War had made labour scarce and expensive and it was no longer a reality to have paid teams of gardeners. Gardens had to change. While the cottage garden style was already apparent at Hidcote and Sissinghurst, these were gardens that still required paid gardeners. What Mrs Fish created at East Lambrook Manor, was a grand cottage garden on a domestic scale." [...] The garden was awarded Grade I status by English Heritage in 1992.|$|R
40|$|Côr das águas de Sepetiba; as pròpriamente marítimas, pela Escala de Forel e as outras côres aparentes totais feitas por comparação com escalas de SÉGUY e com o Dicionário de Côres de MAERZ & PAUL, 1950. Côr Forel nº 6 mostrava no litoral cirrípedes como a Tetraclita squamosa, nas rochas; Águas com a cianofícea planctônica Trichodesmium erythraeum tinham côr de "fôlha de bananeira" ou alpine green. O verde esmeralda mais intenso {{no local}} 7, com plancto maciço da diatomácea Coscinodiscus; a parte central da Baía com 150 [quilometros quadrados], cheia de larvas de camarão Penaeus schmidti, águas de cõr de ferrugem nas superfícies das águas; os estuários côr caramelo, isabellinus e bistre. Êste levantamento preliminar serve para comparações futuras, pois a Baía de Sepetiba ainda não é poluída. Futuramente haverá um pôrto de minérios com 3. 000. 000 de toneladas anuais, cais do pôrto, siderúrgicas e outras indústrias que a poluirão. Várias cõres de águas poluídas da Baía de Guanabara, como águas negras, águas côr de asfalto e outras escurecidas não foram encontradas em Sepetiba. Também não foram encntradas "águas vermelhas" com plancto predominante de dinoflagelados do que já vimos na Baía de Guanabara seguidos de mortandadas de peixes. A fig. 3 mostra as curvas de transparência, e a relação entre côr e transparência é dada para as côres totais aparentes. Foi marcado o coeficiente de extinção da luz K, pelo cálculo a partir do Disco de Secchi. Havendo poluições todos êsses dados que apresentamos deverão ser alterados. The {{apparent}} total color of sea {{by comparison with}} samples tested by "MAERZ & PAUL: A Dictionary of Colors, 1950 ". We find green colors of Forel Scale: Forel n. 5 in waters with Pheophyceae, Sargassum, and Rhodophyceae; Forel n. 6 waters in stones with the Cirripedia, the barnacle Tetraclita squamosa; the alpine green in waters with Trichodesmium exuthraeum. Emerald green in the localities with blooms of the diatom Coscinodiscus. The central portion of the bay, 150 Km[squared] hole-green, full of larvae of shrimps Penaeus schmidti; some shoals of shrimps moves its pleopods and by displacement of botton with diatoms and reddish sediment produces a rust color spot in surface of waters seen by fishermen. The estuaries are Isabell color, and caramel. That is a preliminar survey, to future comparison, because to day Sepetiba Bay is not polluted. But futurelly, it will be polluted by an harbour for 3. 000, 000 tons of iron ore, and by a quay for cargo boats, and siderurgy mills, airports, and other industries. Several polluted waters of Guanabara Bay are black and asphalt color, and cub color. That colors are not found in Sepetiba Bay to day. In 1965, we do not find the "red waters" and "red tides" with blooms of dinoflagellates in Sepetiba Bay, that they are present sometimes in Guanabara Bay with mortalities of fishes. Sepetiba Bay is not biologic problem, to day, is not polluted. The fig. 3 shows a map of transparence of waters by the disc of Secchi and a relation is given of color and transparence, in Sepetiba: Forel color 5 : transparence 2. 8 m to 2. 9 m; Forel n. 6 : 2. 0 m; Forel color n. 7 : 1. 0 m to 1. 5 m. Moss green waters: 0. 6 to 1. 5 m; <b>hellebore</b> <b>green</b> waters: 0. 9 to 1. 5 m; emerald green waters: 2. 0 m to 2. 2 m; In Guanabara Bay, into the polluted Enseada de Inhaúma: asphalt color waters: 0. 02 - 0. 05 m; and in black waters: trasnparence of 1 cm.

50|$|This site is ecologically diverse {{boulder clay}} woodland, {{with a range}} of wildflowers, {{including}} oxlips and the uncommon <b>green</b> <b>hellebore.</b> There are butterlies such as brimstones, large whites, orange-tips and speckled woods.|$|E
50|$|Growing {{to around}} 60 cm (2 ft) high, the <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> is a {{perennial}} plant. The flowers appear in spring (February to April). They have five large green oval sepals with pointed tips, and seven to twelve much smaller petals. The roots are rhizomatous. Subspecies viridis has flowers of 4-5 cm diameter and leaves covered with fine hairs, while the flowers of subspecies occidentalis are smaller (3-4 cm diameter) and its leaves are smooth. The <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> {{is found in}} Western and Central Europe, east to eastern Austria and south to northern Italy. It grows on limestone and chalk-based soils {{in the south of}} England.|$|E
50|$|These ancient coppice with {{standards}} woods {{are mainly}} oak with some ash and birch. The soils are boulder clay, which is covered in some areas with glacial sands. Ground flora includes <b>green</b> <b>hellebore,</b> birds-nest orchid and wood spurge.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> {{was one of}} {{the many}} plants first {{described}} by Linnaeus in volume one of his 1753 tenth edition of his Species Plantarum. The species name is the Latin adjective viridis, [...] "green". Two subspecies are recognised, subspecies viridis from Central Europe and the maritime Alps, and subspecies occidentalis from western Europe including England.|$|E
50|$|On deeper soils in the {{northern}} part and in more level areas, hazel and ash coppice occurs. Here oak is more abundant, and crab apple can be found. Diligent search may yield butcher's-broom and <b>green</b> <b>hellebore,</b> whilst at the southern end, is stinking hellebore. There is also a fine colony of stinking iris, its orange seeds persisting through the winter.|$|E
50|$|Of special note is the {{population}} of narrow-leaved lungwort (Pulmonaria longifolia). This nationally scarce species is the rarest known vascular plant on the reserve and in Britain is limited to ancient woodlands on the shores and tributaries of the Solent. Other locally distributed ancient woodland specialities include <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> (Helleborus viridis), greater butterfly orchid (Platanthera chlorantha) and thin spiked wood sedge (Carex strigosa).|$|E
50|$|The Common {{is noted}} for its wild flowers, with {{thriving}} communities of yellow archangel (Galeobdolon luteum), wood spurge (Euphorbia amygdaloides) and wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa). Spurge-laurel (Daphne laureola) is sparsely but widely distributed. The Common {{is also home to}} such interesting species as stinking hellebore (Helleborus foetidus), <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> (H. viridis ssp. occidentalis), bird's nest orchid (Neottia nidus-avis), violet helleborine (Epipactis purpurata), the extreme rarity E. x schulzei (first British record here, 1931), and green-flowered helleborine (E. phyllanthes).|$|E
50|$|The ground flora {{includes}} {{ferns and}} a spring display of primrose, bluebell, dog-violet, wood anemone and early purple orchid. Also recorded are <b>green</b> <b>hellebore,</b> bird's nest orchid and fingered sedge. Wild flowers grow {{on the open}} rock faces, cliff ledges and in the quarries. These include hairy violet, yellow-wort, lesser calamint, oxeye daisy, red valerian and shining crane's-bill. The flora of the saltmarsh includes sea aster, English scurvy-grass, sea milkwort and buck's-horn plantain. There {{are a variety of}} lichens and mosses.|$|E
5000|$|The site is {{described}} by Natural England as [...] "of national importance as a large, unfragmented area of ancient semi-natural woodland characteristic of the Chilterns scarp". It is composed of Grove Wood, Aston Wood, Juniper Bank, Kingston Wood, High Wood and Crowell Wood. Flora include 52 species indicative of ancient woods, and there are over 100 species of fungi, while damp hollows and fallen trees provide diverse habitats for invertebrates. Uncommon species include the herb Paris quadrifolia and the flower <b>green</b> <b>hellebore.</b> There are small areas of scrub and chalk grassland.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory has}} been put forward that the {{settlement}} {{was connected to the}} Cistercian monks who founded their substantial Abbey up-river at Tintern in 1131. [...] A cast lead font in the church, comparable to other local examples from the same mould, can be dated precisely to between 1120 and 1140. This font is now in the Lady Chapel of Gloucester cathedral. Another suggestion is that it may once have been the site of a leper colony, and an unusual number of medicinal herbs including the non-native elecampane - once used to treat respiratory ailments - and <b>green</b> <b>hellebore</b> have been found in and around the churchyard.|$|E
5000|$|... "Black hellebore" [...] {{was used}} by the ancients in paralysis, gout and other diseases, more {{particularly}} in insanity. [...] "Black hellebore" [...] is also toxic, causing tinnitus, vertigo, stupor, thirst, a feeling of suffocation, swelling of the tongue and throat, emesis (vomiting), catharsis, bradycardia (slowing of the heart rate), and finally, collapse and death from cardiac arrest. Although Helleborus niger (black hellebore) contains protoanemonin, or ranunculin, which has an acrid taste and can cause burning of the eyes, mouth, and throat, oral ulceration, gastroenteritis, and hematemesis, research in the 1970s showed that the roots of H. niger do not contain the cardiotoxic compounds helleborin, hellebrin, and helleborein that are responsible for the lethal reputation of [...] "black hellebore". It seems that earlier studies may have used a commercial preparation containing a mixture of material from other species such as Helleborus viridis, <b>green</b> <b>hellebore.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of medicine, two kinds of {{hellebore}} were recognized: black hellebore, which included various species of Helleborus, and white hellebore (now known as Veratrum album or [...] "false hellebore", which belongs to a different plant family, the Melanthiaceae). [...] "Black hellebore" [...] was used by the ancients totreat paralysis, gout and particularly insanity, among other diseases.

40|$|Muńcoł {{reserve is}} located on the eastern slopes of Muńcoł Massif (1165 m above the sea level), in the group of the Wielka Racza in the Żywiec Beskids, in the range of 925 – 1120 m above the sea level. Phytosociological - floristic studies in the reserve Muńcoł, carried out between 2008 – 2009, serve to identifity {{vascular}} plants and diversity of plants communities in term of their availability for environmental education. As a result, the study found 112 species of vascular plants of which 12 species are under legal protection and 3 are covered partially protected. In the study, there were no non-native species to the Polish flora. There was no expansive species that threaten the diversity of species of flora present in the area. Based on 42 phytosociological relevés following the Braun-Banquet’s method allows to distinguish 5 syntaxa the rank of the association, including 3 forest syntaxa and 2 non-forest syntaxa. To fully popularize natural assets of the reserve Muńcoł, the “Muńcolskie Knieje” educational trail is projected along existing forest trail through {{the central part of the}} reserve. Both adults and school children can benefit from visiting the educational trail. Along the nature trail the following stops are planned: Fertile Carpathian beech, Springfens stream, Sycamore forest with tall-herbs, Snowdrop, Interesting forms of spruce, Fauna of the reserve, <b>Green</b> <b>hellebore,</b> Active protection of mountain meadows. The total length of the nature trail is 0. 9 km and the time required for a visit including reading all 8 stop descriptions is about 1 hour...|$|E
