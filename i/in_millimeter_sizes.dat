Towards higher resolution we extend these studies at our recently upgraded waveguide-based cone-beam holo-tomography instrument GINIX at DESY. This setup allows high resolution recordings with adjustable field of view and resolution, down to the voxel sizes in the range of a few ten nanometers.

30|$|In general, {{lubrication}} is {{the most}} promising solution to reduce friction. However, lubrication becomes difficult when the dimensions of machine elements decrease from macro- to micro/nano-scale. For example, as {{the size of the}} machine elements shrinks from 1  mm to 1  μm, the surface area decreases by a factor of 106 whereas the volume decreases by a factor of 109, yielding the surface area-to-volume ratio of 103. Hence, surface forces such as adhesion and friction become significantly influential at such small scales. Further in miniaturized devices, the gap (clearance) between the elements is small (< 1  μm), which prohibits the use of conventional liquid and/or solid lubricants. For example, a drop of liquid lubricant will be <b>in</b> <b>millimeter</b> <b>size</b> and the size of solid lubricants such as graphite or MoS 2 is of the same order as the size of the miniaturized devices. In addition, retention of lubricants at the contact points between the moving elements could be a hurdle for further implementation. Thus, minimizing surface forces in miniaturized devices has remained a real challenge.|$|R
40|$|We present {{field effect}} {{measurements}} on discontinuous 2 D thin films which {{are composed of}} a sub monolayer of nano-grains of Au, Ni, Ag or Al. Like other electron glasses these systems exhibit slow conductance relaxation and memory effects. However, unlike other systems, the discontinuous films exhibit a dramatic slowing down of the dynamics below a characteristic temperature $T^*$. $T^*$ is typically between 10 - 50 K and is sample dependent. For $T<T^*$ the sample exhibits a few other peculiar features such as repeatable conductance fluctuations <b>in</b> <b>millimeter</b> <b>size</b> samples. We suggest that the enhanced system sluggishness {{is related to the}} current carrying network becoming very dilute in discontinuous films so that the system contains many parts which are electrically very weakly connected and the transport is dominated by very few weak links. This enables studying the glassy properties of the sample as it transitions from a macroscopic sample to a mesocopic sample, hence, the results provide new insight on the underlying physics of electron glasses.

40|$|X-rays, being waves, always {{undergo the}} {{propagation}} effects of reflection, refraction, diffraction, geometric attenuation and absorption. In most circumstances {{the first four}} effects are considered negligible given the resolution sizes demanded of the measurement systems, x-ray energies involved, and physical properties of the materials under evaluation. We have reached the point, however, in some x-ray non-destructive evaluation (NDE) and imaging where we wish to resolve features of micrometer <b>size</b> <b>in</b> <b>millimeter</b> <b>size</b> objects to less than micrometer resolution. Given this resolution and the sizes of the measurement systems, diffraction effects within the object may become observable. We studied {{the extent to which}} diffraction is observable numerically using a two-dimensional paraxial approximation wave propagation code using a multislice method. We modeled realistic parts of interest at worst-case x-ray energies, comparing wave propagation and straight-ray simulated results. In two cases, we compare the numerical results to experimental measurements. The conclusion, based upon the results of the simulation code, is that diffraction effects on the measured data will be insignificant.
