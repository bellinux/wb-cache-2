40|$|Natural {{neighbor}} interpolation is {{a weighted}} average interpolation method {{that is based}} on Voronoi tessellation. In this paper, we present and implement an algorithm to perform natural neighbor interpolation using graphics hardware. Unlike traditional software-based approaches that process one query at a time, we develop a scheme that computes the entire scalar field induced by natural neighbor interpolation, at which point a query is a trivial array lookup, and range queries over the field are easy to perform. Our approach is faster than the best known software implementations, and makes use of general purpose stream programming capabilities of current graphics cards. We also present a simple scheme that requires no advanced graphics capabilities and can process natural neighbor queries faster than existing software-based approaches. Finally, recognizing the limitation incurred by the bounded size of <b>graphics</b> <b>frame</b> buffers, we propose a subdivision approach that allows performing queries locally in a subdivision of the input domain. This approach can reduce to a negligibly small degree (< 1 %) the loss of precision caused by the naive scaling method while still processing queries faster than the software-based approaches when the number of sites is large...|$|R
40|$|Providing {{fault-tolerance}} for long-running GPU-intensive jobs requires application-specific solutions, {{and often}} involves saving {{the state of}} complex data structures spread among many graphics libraries. This work describes a mechanism for transparent GPU-independent checkpoint-restart of 3 D graphics. The approach {{is based on a}} record-prune-replay paradigm: all OpenGL calls relevant to the graphics driver state are recorded; calls not relevant to the internal driver state as of the last <b>graphics</b> <b>frame</b> prior to checkpoint are discarded; and the remaining calls are replayed on restart. A previous approach for OpenGL 1. 5, based on a shadow device driver, required more than 78, 000 lines of OpenGL-specific code. In contrast, the new approach, based on record-prune-replay, is used to implement the same case in just 4, 500 lines of code. The speed of this approach varies between 80 per cent and nearly 100 per cent of the speed of the native hardware acceleration for OpenGL 1. 5, as measured when running the ioquake 3 game under Linux. This approach has also been extended to demonstrate checkpointing of OpenGL 3. 0 for the first time, with a demonstration for PyMol, for molecular visualization. ...|$|R

Now this practice is used on all Antenna TV programs except Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Johnny Carson. The network originally didn't display an on-screen logo bug during its programs but now does, affiliates can add their own bug during Antenna TV programming, with many that do displaying modified versions of logos that the affiliate station has used as part of their main branding in the past (for example, WPHL-TV in Philadelphia uses a variant of the logo it used from 1976 to 1987, under the brand [...] "Channel 17, The Great Entertainer").|$|R
