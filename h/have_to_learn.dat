You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to conserve your energy. In college, you just left it all {{out on the field}} every game. In pro ball, you do that and you'll wear out, because you play every single day.|$|E
5|$|It's {{really a}} dance-off between a more {{sophisticated}} 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And in the end a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us because we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> three routines for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many girls}} of her time, Barney had a {{haphazard}} education. Her {{interest in the}} French language began with a governess who read Jules Verne stories aloud to her so she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> quickly to understand them. Later she and her younger sister Laura Clifford Barney attended Les Ruches, a French boarding school in Fontainebleau, France, founded by feminist Marie Souvestre, who also founded Allenswood, in Wimbledon, outside London, which was attended by such notables as Eleanor Roosevelt. As an adult she spoke French fluently without an accent and made her home in Paris. Nearly all her published works were written in French.|$|E

40|$|This paper details how the Australia Dennis family <b>has</b> {{been able}} <b>to</b> professionalize their family {{business}} while still retaining their {{family values and}} realizing the founders’ vision. We detail how Bert and Dawn Dennis and their four adult offspring decided to amalgamate their associated businesses with the parent company and take on the challenge of professionalizing this new entity. We highlight that, although the four siblings had learnt business, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> now <b>learn</b> their family business. In addition, the CEO, Grant Dennis, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> lead the business. As well, the Dennis family <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> give up some control to professional management. Bert, as {{a founder of the}} business, also <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> let go. Comments from family members and key stakeholders are included...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of postmortem imaging and its introduction into forensic medicine, especially modern cross-sectional imaging techniques, <b>have</b> led <b>to</b> {{the emergence of}} new specialties and subspecialties. As with other transdisciplinary projects, the need to become familiar with some characteristics of the respective other disciplines is both a challenge and an opportunity. The forensic pathologist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> deal with the possibility of investigating the inside of a body without opening it, the radiologist <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>to</b> manage forensic questions and postmortem artifacts, and the radiographer <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> how <b>to</b> cope with dead bodies instead of living patients and adapt examination protocols. This chapter will give the reader the perspective of each of these three practitioners...|$|R
25|$|Tongyong Pinyin is {{currently}} more useful for visitors and tourists unfamiliar with Mandarin {{than it is}} for residents who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Mandarin. Because Tongyong Pinyin has not been adopted for language learning in Taiwan's schools, most natives of Taiwan continue to use other romanization methods (usually modified Wade–Giles systems). Expatriates and immigrants who study Chinese generally <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> Hanyu Pinyin.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} romanization {{system of}} Mainland China, the International Organization for Standardization, and the United Nations is Hanyu Pinyin.

Whatever {{the merits of the}} new system, it is unlikely to displace Hanyu Pinyin at this level.|$|E

The Ministry of Education ensures that the Bilingual Policy is met by students in Primary and Secondary schools- {{not only are they}} required to master English as their first language, they also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> their Mother Tongue as a second language. They are offered Mandarin Chinese, Malay or Tamil depending on their father's ethnicity.|$|E
25|$|Morse code {{has been}} {{employed}} as an assistive technology, helping {{people with a}} variety of disabilities to communicate. Morse can be sent by persons with severe motion disabilities, {{as long as they have}} some minimal motor control.

25|$|The 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were {{a time of}} {{transition}} for typewriters and word processors. At one point in time, most small-business offices would be completely 'old-style', while large corporations and government departments would already be 'new-style'; other offices would have a mixture. The pace of change was so rapid that it was common for clerical staff to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> several new systems, one after the other, {{in just a few}} years. While such rapid change is commonplace today, and is taken for granted, this was not always so; in fact, typewriting technology changed very little in its first 80 or 90 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} a Fair Trade school or Fair Trade {{university}} emerged from the United Kingdom, where the Fairtrade Foundation now maintains a list of colleges and schools that comply with the needed requirements to be labeled such a university. In order {{to be considered a}} Fair Trade University, a school or university must have established a Fairtrade School Steering Group. They must have a written and implemented a school-wide Fair Trade Policy. The school or university must be dedicated to selling and using Fair Trade products. They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> and educate about Fair Trade issues. Finally, the Fairtrade Foundation requires that schools promote Fair Trade not only within the school, but throughout the wider community.|$|E
25|$|On 10 April, {{the cavalry}} moved {{up behind the}} {{advancing}} British infantry near Telegraph Hill and were kept in an exposed position overnight. The next morning, the British cavalry came under heavy German artillery and machine gun fire before they were withdrawn; McCreery was shot in his right thigh, severing his femoral artery. In an effort to stem the blood loss from his wound, the circulation in his leg had been restricted sufficiently to cause gangrene in his foot; McCreery refused to have his leg amputated but lost two toes {{and parts of the}} others. He would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to walk and ride again, and was affected by a pronounced limp {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

25|$|At 20 {{months of}} age, when {{presented}} with three familiar objects (e.g., a ball, a bottle and a cup) and one unfamiliar object (e.g., an egg piercer), children are able to conclude that in the request “Can I have the zib,” zib must refer to the unfamiliar object, i.e., the egg piercer, {{even if they have}} never heard that pseudoword before. Children as young as 15 months can complete this task successfully if the experiment is conducted with fewer objects. This task shows that children aged 15 to 20 months can assign meaning to a new word after only a single exposure. Fast mapping is a necessary ability for children to acquire the number of words they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> during {{the first few years of}} life: Children acquire an average of nine words per day between 18 months and 6 years of age.|$|E
25|$|Azusa {{participants}} {{returned to}} their homes carrying their new experience with them. In many cases, whole churches were converted to the Pentecostal faith, but many times Pentecostals were forced to establish new religious communities when their experience {{was rejected by the}} established churches. One of the first areas of involvement was the African continent, where, by 1907, American missionaries were established in Liberia, as well as in South Africa by 1908. Because speaking in tongues was initially believed to always be actual foreign languages, it was believed that missionaries would no longer <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> the languages of the peoples they evangelized because the Holy Spirit would provide whatever foreign language was required. (When the majority of missionaries, to their disappointment, learned that tongues speech was unintelligible on the mission field, Pentecostal leaders were forced to modify their understanding of tongues.) Thus, as the experience of speaking in tongues spread, a sense of the immediacy of Christ's return took hold and that energy would be directed into missionary and evangelistic activity. Early Pentecostals saw themselves as outsiders from mainstream society, dedicated solely to preparing the way for Christ's return.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

25|$|Learning {{in early}} life is {{apparently}} important to all parrots, {{and much of}} that learning is social learning. Social interactions are often practised with siblings, and in several species, creches are formed with several broods, and these, too, are important for learning social skills. Foraging behaviour is generally learnt from parents, and {{can be a very}} protracted affair. Suprageneralists and specialists generally become independent of their parents much quicker than partly specialised species who may <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> skills over long periods as various resources become seasonally available. Play forms a large part of learning in parrots; it can be solitary, and related to motor skills, or social. Species may engage in play fights or wild flights to practice predator evasion. An absence of stimuli can delay the development of young birds, as demonstrated by a group of vasa parrots kept in tiny cages with domesticated chickens from the age of 3 months; at 9 months, these birds still behaved {{in the same way as}} 3-month-olds, but had adopted some chicken behaviour. In a similar fashion, captive birds in zoo collections or pets can, if deprived of stimuli, develop stereotyped behaviours and harmful behaviours like self plucking. Aviculturists working with parrots have identified the need for environmental enrichment to keep parrots stimulated.|$|E
25|$|The major {{driving force}} of the anti-Hindi {{agitation}} was not the questioning of protecting Tamil, but questions {{of the future of}} Tamils. Hindi as a suitable candidate for the official language of India after independence was first proposed by the Motilal Nehru Report of 1928. An Official Language Commission appointed {{under the terms of the}} Constitution in 1955 to review the situation supported Hindi as the sole official language, although members from Bengal and Madras dissented in favour of English. As of the 1961 census, there were 1652 languages. Hindi as an official language was opposed for two reasons: the first because the numbers of people with knowledge of English were fairly evenly spread, and also that imposition of Hindi would give a major advantage in terms of job and educational possibilities to those who had Hindi as their mother tongue. In effect a Tamil who would desire to pursue union civil service would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> three languages, Tamil, Hindi and English, which are members of three different language families and each is written in a different script. Therefore, a three-language formula proposed was seen as a great educational burden imposed on non-Hindi-speaking states. Nehru promised in 1959 that the interests of the non-Hindi speakers would be safeguarded, and so did Lal Bahadur Shastri later, but those promises didn't put the fears of non-Hindi speakers to rest.|$|E
