25|$|Due to the {{stereotype}} of Asian Americans being successful as a group and having the lowest crime rates in the United States, <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> mostly focused on those from Mexico and Latin America while leaving out Asians. Asians are the second largest racial/ethnic alien immigrant group in the U.S. behind Hispanics and Latinos. While the majority of Asian immigrants to the United States immigrate legally, up to 15% of Asian immigrants immigrate without legal documents.|$|E

About 80% thought that the government should do more to curb illegal immigration.|$|E
25|$|Miller stated at a {{town hall}} meeting that he {{believed}} East Germany was an example of a nation taking effective measures to control the flow of people across a border. Miller believes <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> a “critically important” issue to deal with because of its economic effects on health care, education and employment. Miller wants to secure the border to stop more immigrants from entering America illegally and protect the country from possible terrorist threats. Miller does not believe the millions of immigrants already here illegally should be granted amnesty. Miller supports efforts by states such as Arizona to enforce immigration laws when the federal government will not, and he believes illegal immigrants should be deported when they come into contact with law enforcement officials.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, the Mexican {{government}} {{was criticized for}} distributing a comic book which offers tips to illegal emigrants to the United States.

[...] The Mexican government defends the guide {{as an attempt to}} save lives. [...] "It's kind of like illegal immigration for dummies," [...] said {{the executive director of the}} Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, Mark Krikorian. [...] "Promoting safe <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> not the same as arguing against it". The comic book does state on its last page that the Mexican Government does not promote illegal crossing at all and only encourages visits to the US with all required documentation.|$|E
2500|$|Achieving a [...] "Greater Bangladesh" [...] as Lebensraum (additional living space) {{is alleged}} to be the reason for {{large-scale}} illegal immigration from Bangladesh into India's states. Similarly it is alleged that <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh {{as well as the}} state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states, particularly Assam and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh. One Indian proposition is that the state of Bangladesh is pursuing a territorial design seeking a Lebensraum for its teeming population and trying to establish a Greater Bangladesh. Another proposition called for capturing one or two districts in Bangladesh and sending illegal immigrants there. Yet another proposition called for killing off Bangladeshi immigrants in India to thwart the designs of state of Bangladesh.|$|E
2500|$|After the Obama {{administration}} reduced federal immigration enforcement, Democratic counties {{reduced their}} immigration enforcement more than Republican counties; a paper by a University of Pennsylvania PhD candidate found [...] "that Democratic counties with higher non-citizen population shares saw greater increases in clearance rates, {{a measure of}} policing efficiency, with no increase in crime rates. The results indicate that reducing immigration enforcement did not increase crime and rather led {{to an increase in}} policing efficiency, either because it allowed police to focus efforts on solving more serious crimes or because it elicited greater cooperation of non-citizens with police." [...] A 2003 paper by two Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists found [...] "that while the volume of <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> not related to changes in property-related crime, there is a significant positive correlation with the incidence of violent crime. This is most likely due to extensive smuggling activity along the border. Border enforcement meanwhile is significantly negatively related to crime rates. The bad news is that the deterrent effect of the border patrol diminishes over this time period, and the net impact of more enforcement on border crime since the late 1990s is zero." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors regarding public opinion about <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> the level of unemployment; anti-illegal immigrant sentiment is highest where unemployment is highest and vice versa. In general, some say that illegal immigrants are taking away jobs from Americans; however businesses and agricultural groups disagree and say that migrant workers are needed to fill unattractive jobs. This is further supported by a May 2006 New York Times/CBS News Poll report that 53 percent of Americans felt [...] "illegal immigrants mostly take the jobs Americans don't want". However, there are others who say that illegal immigration helps to [...] "decimate the bargaining leverage of the American worker. If you use a form of labor recruitment that bids down the cost of labor, that leads you to a society where a small number are very, very rich, there's nobody in the middle, and everyone is left scrambling for crumbs at the bottom. Yet there are still others who say that the U.S. [...] "has an economy that depends on illegal immigration" [...] and [...] "without illegal immigration labor, it would almost certainly not be possible to produce the same volume of food in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|Spain in {{particular}} receives {{most of the}} immigrants coming illegally to Europe from Africa, probably due to its large coastal area and its proximity to and land borders with Morocco at Ceuta and Melilla; African immigrants try to enter the country by boat from Morocco or Senegal or by jumping the border fences. [...] For example, during just the first weekend of September 2006, more than 1,300 illegal immigrants arrived on beaches in the Canary Islands and estimates are that between 50,000 and 70,000 people enter the European Union illegally through Spanish borders or beaches. Border fences have been built at both the Ceuta and Melilla borders {{in an attempt to}} stop illegal entrance to the country. <b>Illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>is</b> an issue in Spanish politics, and also a big human rights problem, since many people die during the journey. Spain has been Europe's largest absorber of migrants for the past six years, with its immigrant population increasing fourfold as 2.8million people have arrived, mostly from Latin America. Spectacular growth in Spain's immigrant population came as the country's economy created {{more than half of all}} the new jobs in the European Union between 2001 and 2006.|$|E

2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the British {{turned a blind eye to}} large-scale Arab <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration,</b> and instead disproportionately focused on Jewish <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration.</b> In particular, Freddy Liebreich claimed that significant undocumented Arab immigration, much of it from the Hauran region of Syria, did take place during the Mandate era, and that the British authorities largely ignored it. According to Liebreich: [...] "Jewish <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>was</b> minutely detailed and meticulously recorded but all references to Arab <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> <b>were,</b> perhaps deliberately, obscured." [...] He claimed that one major example took place in 1934, when, according to him, approximately 35,000 Arabs illegally immigrated to Palestine from the Hauran, basing this estimate on a claim made by the Governor of the Hauran at the time, who estimated that 30,000-36,000 people from the Hauran had left to settle in Palestine in recent months. By contrast, the British estimated the number of illegal immigrants to Palestine in 1934, both Arab and non-Arab, at 3,000. Liebreich also wrote that many British documents from the beginning of the Mandate era to the 1940s contain references to Syrians from the Hauran being freely admitted into Palestine without a passport or visa, and noted that <b>illegal</b> <b>immigration</b> from the Hauran was mentioned in Parliament a year before the end of British rule in Palestine.|$|R

Therefore, the people of the State of Oklahoma declare that it is a compelling public interest of this state to discourage illegal immigration by requiring all agencies within this state to fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities in the enforcement of federal immigration laws.
