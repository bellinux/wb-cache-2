But Grace was approached by both Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club. In 1866, when he played a match at Oxford, one of the Oxford players, Edmund Carter, tried to interest him in becoming an undergraduate. Then, in 1868, Grace received overtures from Caius College, Cambridge, which had a long medical tradition. <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> {{he would have gone}} to either Oxford or Cambridge if his father had allowed it. Instead, he enrolled at Bristol Medical School in October 1868, when he was 20.|$|E
500|$|The set {{was already}} being broken down {{the day after}} filming finished. Debra Messing, who plays <b>Grace,</b> <b>said</b> it was [...] "cordoned off like an {{accident}} scene. It {{was a shock to}} see parts of it gone already." [...] Each cast member was allowed to keep their favorite souvenir from the set. Messing took the door to Grace's office; she wanted to lean it up against the wall at her house as a piece of modern art. Sean Hayes was given a couple of pieces from Will's apartment: [...] "There's a leather box that was on Willâ€™s desk that I want to find a place for." [...] Mullally chose a simple portrait from one of the walls, and McCormack took a small ceramic dog, though he said he would have taken everything if he could.|$|E
500|$|Halo {{franchise}} {{development director}} Frank O'Connor explained that Halo Wars 2 {{would be more}} integrated with other fiction in the universe than its predecessor. The story of the first Halo Wars is set 20 years before , and is largely isolated from other games within the series. This was {{to prevent it from}} interfering with other projects (Halo 3 and [...] ) that were also in development at the time. Consequently, Halo Wars 2 is set in the contemporary fictional timeline following the events of Halo 5: Guardians, and is said to have a [...] "sense of scale" [...] that the first game was missing. This decision also opened a narrative thread in Halo Wars 2, in which the returning characters are placed in an unfamiliar universe with outdated technology. Narrative director on Halo Wars 2, Kevin <b>Grace,</b> <b>said</b> that the development team took most of their inspiration for the game's tone from Halo: Combat Evolved.|$|E

500|$|During the {{planning}} for the 2002 race, {{it was announced that}} a provisional date for 2003 had been set at 4 May. The then Chief Executive of the circuit David <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> it presented an opportunity to hold the event at the start of summer, and give motor racing fans [...] "the ideal start" [...] to the season. He noted the moving of dates did not involve additional risk of bad weather as the meteorological information the track accumulated showed the months of May and September were the driest of the year. The 2002 event saw better weather but was down on attendance. It was won by Team Green driver Dario Franchitti. In an attempt to promote the race, Dale Coyne Racing formed what was described as an [...] "all-England" [...] team named Team St. George with British American Racing Formula One test driver and ASCAR Days of Thunder series competitor Darren Manning. Some journalists believed there was a possibility the race would not be run because of the cancellation of the German 500 owing to financial difficulties. Rockingham renegotiated its sanctioning fee from $4.2 million to $2.8 million, claiming the event's reputation had been damaged by the German 500's cancellation.|$|E

[...] During the show, <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> the charges filed against Medrano weren't harsh enough.

2500|$|Various spiritual traditions offer a {{wide variety}} of devotional acts. There are morning and evening prayers, <b>graces</b> <b>said</b> over meals, and reverent {{physical}} gestures. Some Christians bow their heads and fold their hands. Some Native Americans regard dancing as a form of prayer. Some Sufis whirl. [...] Hindus chant mantras. Jewish prayer may involve swaying back and forth and bowing. Muslims practice salat (kneeling and prostration) in their prayers. Quakers keep silent. Some pray according to standardized rituals and liturgies, while others prefer extemporaneous prayers. Still others combine the two.|$|R

2500|$|In its heyday, Hyde Park covered {{five and}} a half acres and so could stage several matches concurrently. Situated on high ground, as <b>Grace</b> <b>said,</b> it was known for [...] "its splendid views and rapid {{draining}} and drying". Its ability to stage [...] "massed cricket" [...] emulated Parker's Piece and the Bombay Maidan as up to 200 cricketers could be playing there at any one time.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} on Good Morning America, Nancy <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> in reaction to events that [...] "If anything, I would suggest that guilt made her commit suicide. To suggest that a 15- or 20-minute interview can cause someone to commit suicide is focusing on the wrong thing." [...] She then said that, while she sympathized with the family, she knew from her own experience {{as a victim of}} crime that such people look for somebody else to blame.|$|E
2500|$|While {{describing}} {{it as an}} [...] "extremely sad development," [...] Janine Iamunno, a spokeswoman for <b>Grace,</b> <b>said</b> that her program would continue to follow the case as they had a [...] "responsibility to bring attention to this case {{in the hopes of}} helping find Trenton Duckett." [...] Grace commented that [...] "I do not feel that our show is to blame for what happened to Melinda Duckett. The truth is not always nice or polite or easy to go down. Sometimes it's harsh, and it hurts." ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1859 English cricket season, Carpenter was one of {{the twelve}} players who took part in cricket's first-ever {{overseas}} tour when an England cricket team led by George Parr visited North America. He also toured Australia with Parr in 1863. In the early 1860s, Carpenter and his Cambridgeshire contemporary Thomas Hayward were rated the finest batsmen in England. Richard Daft was among those ranking them as equal first, but George Parr reckoned Carpenter the better of the two. W. G. <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> of Carpenter that [...] "he may be safely placed as one of the finest of our great batsmen".|$|E
2500|$|She {{also made}} some {{statements}} pointing to Westerfield's possible innocence. The strongest evidence against Westerfield {{was found in}} his RV, particularly a drop of van Dam's blood and her hand print. That evidence could be innocently explained if, at some previous time while it was parked unlocked in the streets outside her home, van Dam had entered that vehicle, perhaps to explore it out of curiosity. There was no testimony she had done so, but <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> she [...] "can imagine a little girl wandering into a RV and playing in it, much as if they saw a swimming pool, they might jump in, or a playground, they might play on it".|$|E
2500|$|Mason's {{response}} {{was viewed as}} especially critical of Nancy Grace, whose news program is cited as having [...] "almost single-handedly inflated the Anthony case from a routine local murder into a national obsession". <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> {{that she did not}} understand why Mason would care what pundits are saying, and that she imagines she has tried and covered as many cases as Mason. She criticized the defense attorneys for delivering media criticism before mentioning Caylee's name in their post-verdict news conference, and said she disagrees with the verdict. At a meeting of local professionals, named the Tiger Bay Club of Tampa, Mason told the media and those in attendance that he was surprised by the not-guilty verdict.|$|E

2500|$|Grace {{had been}} [...] "notoriously unscholarly" [...] as a boy.

2500|$|Shaw {{was born}} at Sutton-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire. He joined Nottinghamshire in 1865 and played every {{consecutive}} Notts game over a ten-year period. He also made numerous appearances in representative teams such as the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series, the North of England cricket team and the All-England Eleven. [...] He played against W G Grace many times and had some successes, including twice dismissing him for nought in 1871. [...] <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> after the second of these that he [...] "would {{pay particular attention to}} J C Shaw". [...] In the next innings, Grace scored a double-century. [...] Shaw's comment afterwards was famous for its ruefulness and it has often been quoted: [...] "I puts the ball where I likes and he puts it where he likes".|$|E
2500|$|On October 11, 2016, The Jim Norton and Sam Roberts Show had Grace as a guest, {{on which}} they accused her of capitalizing on other's tragedy, for her {{personal}} gain. They also addressed her handling of The Ultimate Warrior's death, and the Duke lacrosse case. Norton said during the interview that he has disliked her for some time, and she has previously blocked him on Twitter. Grace, in defending herself, stated {{that she was a}} crime victim herself, and stating that they didn't ask her one decent question. The next day on The View, Grace addressed the interview, calling Norton and Roberts Beavis and Butt-head <b>Grace</b> <b>said</b> she had to hold back tears during the interview and stated, [...] "I donâ€™t really know what it was, but it was hell for me." ...|$|E
