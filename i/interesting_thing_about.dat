Moore said that Watchmen {{was designed to be}} read [...] "four or five times", with some links and allusions only becoming apparent to the reader after several readings. Dave Gibbons notes that, [...] "s it progressed, Watchmen became much more about the telling than the tale itself.

500|$|On 9 August 1942, Ledbury sailed from Gibraltar, sighted {{the convoy}} in the afternoon, and took its convoy {{screening}} station. An hour before midnight on 10 August {{she left the}} convoy and proceeded to refuel from the tanker Dingledale, an operation that took place {{early in the morning}} of 11 August. Ledbury took aboard 101 tons of fuel. Just before ten o'clock in the morning, the destroyer took station as starboard wing ship of screen. In the afternoon, [...] was hit by torpedoes, with Derwent ordering Ledbury to stand by the stricken aircraft carrier. As Eagle sank, one destroyer and the tug Jaunty stopped, picking up survivors in the oil patches in the water. As Ledbury reached survivors, she was ordered to rejoin the convoy. The convoy now suffered a series of aerial attacks with the gunner of Ledburys port Oerlikon thought to have shot down one plane, although many other ships were firing at this machine. At 21:00, Ledbury was ordered to Anti-Aircraft station, with one cable on the starboard beam of No. 43. Early on the morning of 12 August, the destroyer was ordered by [...] to investigate a periscope reported on the starboard quarter of No.43. Nelson reported a submarine periscope bearing north of her, and Ledbury deployed single scare charges to cover [...] from this submarine, and destroyers astern of her appeared to follow up this contact. At nine o'clock in the morning, an air attack by Junkers 88s developed on the convoy, with one Junkers 88 crashing at bearing 058 degrees. Four small bombs were seen to go by the bridge, landing on the starboard side, and a large bomb came near the port quarter. In the ensuing mayhem, Ledbury was ordered to fill in gaps in the screen caused by ships falling back on contact. On the way to this position three airmen were seen coming down by parachute. One was picked up and found to be German, the others were abandoned. The captured airman stated that the last raid consisted of Luftwaffe airmen flying Junkers 88s from Sicily; and that he had been shot down by close range weapons from the convoy. Ledburys crew noted that the most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> the pilot was that the nails of his boots were made of wood. Yet another aerial attack ensued, this time by dive-bombers. Two groups approached from ahead, but neither got over the convoy. Two of these planes were shot down by gunfire. After this attack, the destroyer resumed station on the starboard side of the convoy. An attack by Junkers 88s soon started whilst escort fighters were still refuelling. Ledbury suffered another near miss off her port quarter. One ship in the convoy was damaged, and [...] stood by her.|$|E

500|$|Seldom hesitating to use {{herself as}} the butt of her own jokes, Fey is also well known for {{practicing}} self-deprecating humor, as demonstrated throughout her performance as Liz Lemon in 30 Rock. In an article ranking Fey's six greatest jokes, David Renshaw of The Guardian wrote that the performer's work continues to feature her [...] "trademark mix of snark, self-deprecation and pop-culture smarts." [...] Fey's self-deprecating comedic style inspired Ashley Fetters of The Atlantic to recognize her as comedian Phyllis Diller's successor because of their similar humor. Critics have been divided in their opinions and discussions of Fey's use of self-deprecating humor, {{and its effect on}} women as a female comic; while blogger Kate Harding disapproved of Fey's performance in 30 Rock because [...] "I'm torn between being sad that she apparently doesn't see [...] in herself and being pissed off that she's reinforcing the idea that having brown hair, glasses, and a figure that's maybe a size 2 instead of a 0 actually equals ugly", Jessica G. of Jezebel defended the actress, writing that Fey's performance is [...] "supposed to be parodying precisely the kinds of media that reinforce ideas that unconventional women are unworthy." [...] Writing that Harding misunderstood Fey's intentions, the author concluded that her self-deprecation [...] "is precisely what makes her relatable", elaborating that [...] " [...] have many moments of self-doubt, and seeing someone as successful as Tina Fey be self-deprecating gives us all permission to be imperfect." [...] Sophie Caldecott of Verily defended Fey's modesty and tendency to downplay her own physical appearance: [...] "She mocks her own appearance, sure, but she does so in a way that consistently shows up our culture for placing so much importance on how women look, as if that’s the most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> us ... Her comic persona on 30 Rock, Liz Lemon, can be laughed at for many things, but her career managerial style and ability is not one of them." [...] Caldecott concluded, [...] "In reality, self-deprecation is an art that comedians everywhere dabble in ... In fact, I defy you to find a good male comedian who isn’t a master of self-deprecation. Comedians make fun of themselves for many reasons, mostly because it is the most readily accessible source of inspiration but also because it is the most generous one." [...] Observing that Fey's material lacks [...] "whining", Gina Barreca of the Hartford Courant wrote that Fey's comedy [...] "is not simply an iteration of self-deprecating femininity passing itself off as humor. In itself, this demarcates the current generation of female humorists from earlier generations of performers who were told, more or less, to use themselves not as a sounding board for ideas but as a punching bag for insults." [...] Fey has also garnered criticism for being politically incorrect, but she defends her right to write borderline jokes, saying that she has chosen to [...] "opt out" [...] of the culture of demanding apologies.|$|E

But she's also just as neurotic, which adds depth to her love songs." [...] In a review for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood opined, [...] "At its best, Push and Shove channels some of the infectiously restless energy of Rock Steady [...] And it further polishes a bold mix-and-match aesthetic that feels familiar today in part because of records such as Tragic Kingdom." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{black-and-white}} film employing handheld {{camera and}} a fragmented, impressionistic narrative structure, Tanaka's Confidential Report: Sex Market (1974) {{is among the most}} unusual-looking films in the Roman Porno series. The first film in Tanaka's Showa Trilogy, A Woman Called Sada Abe is more conventional than most of his films, but highly regarded by critics. Tanaka was proud of his ability to produce a high-quality film on a minimal budget. Nikkatsu allotted 7,500,000 yen (approximately US$65,000) for their Roman porno films, but Tanaka used only about 6,600,000 yen to make A Woman Called Sada Abe. Tanaka later explained, [...] "I managed to make it for about 900,000 yen under budget. I believe it depends on the initial concept. I was confident {{that as long as the}} concept was good, it would become a great film and beat any of those films made for 10,000,000 yen. I think that's the most <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> film-making: it's so unpredictable. 'Abe Sada's' simple lip movement could say more and be more appealing to an audience than thousands of horses running around a field. It's possible that lip movement could be more effective than thousands of horses and that's why film-making is very creative and incredibly interesting." ...|$|E

[...] Later elaborating on this, Silvestri said, [...] "We knew that if we were to have a theme for every character in this movie, the music would get very clunky and intrusive. So I stayed away from all of that." [...] Instead, Marvel and Whedon wanted a central, definable [...] "Avengers" [...] theme for the film, which Silvestri wanted to have a heroic aspect and a grandness, but also be [...] "generated from that scene when they’re all gathering for the last great battle ... the <b>interesting</b> <b>thing</b> <b>about</b> it as the 'big moment; of the score is that they’re not doing anything. They’re standing there, which allowed me to move away from the idea of it being an action moment." [...] Silvestri did ultimately use some other themes in the score: he developed a motif for Loki as the central villain of the film, a [...] "low, ominous sequence of chords, [...] when his presence is either visible or implied"; he reprised his Captain America theme, for when that character [...] "makes his entrance, or when he’s in the middle of a fight scene ... yet not using it fully" [...] as [...] "a little of his theme goes a long, long way", and his Tesseract theme, including over the opening logos of the film; and midway through Silvestri's work writing the score, Whedon had seen some completed scenes featuring the Black Widow and [...] "wanted to explore music that was a bit more thematic for her", so Silvestri introduced [...] "a lonely, plucked theme with an Eastern European flavor" [...] to define the character.
