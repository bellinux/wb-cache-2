5|$|Additional Confederate {{activity}} in Louisiana occurred on June 29 at Goodrich's Landing. Confederates attacked a plantation and army training center run by former slaves. The Confederates destroyed the plantations and captured {{over a hundred}} former slaves before <b>disengaging</b> {{in the face of}} Ellet's Marines. Confederate raids such as these were disruptive and caused damage, but they were only minor setbacks and showed the Confederates could cause only momentary disturbances in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela actively defends food trees, {{engaging in}} aggressive bill-wiping both {{in response to}} a threat and after chasing intruders from a tree. It is very antagonistic even towards its own species; the males fight by grappling in mid-air and falling close to the ground before <b>disengaging.</b> It constantly chases brown honeyeaters through the canopy, though it has not been observed in grappling fights with other species.|$|E
5|$|The North Korean force {{eventually}} withdrew {{after several}} unsuccessful attacks, having suffered heavy casualties. As it was <b>disengaging</b> from Masan, US Air Force aircraft caught the North Korean truck columns {{as they were}} retreating, inflicting significant damage on them and producing further casualties. This fight, {{with a number of}} smaller engagements in the region, effectively stopped the North Korean offensive on the southern flank of the Pusan Perimeter. It also gave both sides a reprieve from the fighting to resupply and re-enforce before engaging in the Battle of Pusan Perimeter shortly after.|$|E
50|$|Much like Klayton's {{experiences}} with R.E.X., his short deal with Flying Tart provided {{a number of}} frustrations. Although Klayton intended to release <b>Disengage</b> in 1997 and precede its release with an EP of <b>Disengage</b> remixes titled Refractorchasm, Flying Tart canceled the EP's release and delayed <b>Disengage</b> until 1998, requiring Klayton to tack the EP onto <b>Disengage</b> {{in order to ensure}} the release of the music. The label also reduced the length of the album's art booklet, which Klayton self-designed. Within two weeks of signing his contract with Flying Tart, the label was bought out and dissolved, ensuring the album saw extremely limited distribution.|$|R

5|$|On 14 May, the Germans {{continued}} to attack Soviet {{positions in the}} north in localized offensives and by then, the Luftwaffe had gained air superiority over the Kharkov sector, forcing Timoshenko to move his own air assets forward in order to effectively counter the bolstered Luftflotte 4. The Luftwaffe won air superiority over their numerically superior, but technically inferior opponents. The air battles depleted the Soviet fighter strength, allowing the German strike aircraft the chance to influence the land battle even more. Nonetheless, the Soviet forces pushed on, <b>disengaging</b> from several minor battles and changing the direction of their thrusts. However, {{in the face of}} continued resistance and local counterattacks, the Soviet attack ebbed, especially when combined with the invariably heavy air raids. By the end of the day, the 28th Army could no longer conduct offensive operations against German positions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received the order to fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty <b>disengaging.</b> Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received the order to complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby <b>disengaging</b> with the male. On a few occasions, workers have been seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E

50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To <b>disengage</b> the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the <b>disengaged</b> position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to <b>disengage</b> the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly is all it takes to <b>disengage</b> the safety.|$|R
5|$|The Das Reich {{division}} attacked on {{the same}} day, along {{the west side of}} Kharkov. After penetrating into the city's Zalyutino district, the advance was stopped by a deep anti-tank ditch, lined with Soviet defenders, including anti-tank guns. A Soviet counterattack was repulsed after a bloody firefight. A detachment of the division fought its way to the southern approaches of the city, cutting off the road to Merefa. At around 15:00, Hoth ordered Hausser to immediately disengage with the Das Reich, and instead redeploy to cut off escaping Soviet troops. Instead, Hausser sent a detachment from the Totenkopf division for this task and informed Hoth that the risk of <b>disengaging</b> with the Das Reich was far too great. On the night of 11–12 March, a breakthrough element crossed the anti-tank ditch, taking the Soviet defenders by surprise, and opening a path for tanks to cross. This allowed the Das Reich to advance to the city's main railway station, which would be the farthest this division would advance into the city. Hoth repeated his order at 00:15, on 12 March, and Hausser replied as he had replied on 11 March. However, a third attempt by Hoth was obeyed, and Das Reich disengaged, using a corridor opened by LSSAH to cross northern Kharkov and redeploy east of the city.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman centre {{and left}} columns were skilfully led round the open {{flank of the}} infantry's entrenchments and on towards the camp and railway. After the moon had set at around 02:30, the Germans and Ottomans made a bayonet charge on Mount Meredith. Although vastly outnumbered, the light {{horsemen}} fought an effective delaying action at close quarters, but were forced to relinquish ground slowly and to ultimately evacuate the position by 03:00. Without the benefit of moon light, the light horsemen had fired at the flashes of the enemy's rifles until they were close enough to use bayonets. The 1st Light Horse Brigade was eventually forced back; withdrawing slowly, troop covering troop with steady accurate fire, staving off a general attack with the bayonet to their fall-back position; a large east/west sand dune called Wellington Ridge at {{the southern edge of}} the Romani encampment. During the retirement to Wellington Ridge, the covering squadrons on the left near Katib Gannit were also attacked, as was the squadron on the right, which was taken in the flank and suffered considerable loss, but managed to hold its ground until the position in its rear was occupied. By 03:30, all light horsemen south of Mount Meredith had been forced back to their led horses and had succeeded in <b>disengaging</b> and falling back to their second position. Soon after, an Ottoman machine gun was shooting down on the light horse from Mount Meredith.|$|E

40|$|Visuospatial neglect after stroke {{is often}} {{characterized}} by a <b>disengage</b> deficit on a cued orienting task, in which individuals are disproportionately slower to respond to targets presented on the contralesional side of space following an ispilesional cue {{as compared to the}} reverse. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the generality of the finding of a <b>disengage</b> deficit on another measure of cued attention, the temporal order judgment (TOJ) task, that does not depend upon speeded manual responses. Individuals with right hemisphere stroke with and without spatial neglect and older healthy controls were tested with both a speeded RT cueing task and an unspeeded TOJ-with-cuing task. All stroke patients evidenced a <b>disengage</b> deficit on the speeded RT cueing task, although the size and direction of the bias was not associated with the severity of neglect. In contrast, few neglect patients showed a <b>disengage</b> deficit on the TOJ task. This discrepancy suggests that the <b>disengage</b> deficit may be related to task demands, rather than solely due to impaired attentional mechanisms per se. Further, the results of our study show that the <b>disengage</b> deficit is neither necessary nor sufficient for neglect to manifest...|$|R

30|$|Goldhammer et al. (2016) {{investigated}} {{whether the}} P +> 0 % indicator of <b>disengaged</b> response {{behavior can be}} considered valid, which requires the indicator to identify responses with no chance for success (e.g., due to rapid guessing or because the time spent on the item was below the minimum allowing for success above chance level). Following the procedures described by Lee and Jia (2014), they determined the average proportion correct for engaged versus <b>disengaged</b> response behavior across items (and additionally by item) for each construct, {{as well as the}} correlations between score group and proportion correct for engaged and <b>disengaged</b> response behavior by item. One example of their findings is that the proportion correct for engaged responses in literacy, numeracy, and problem solving were 0.56, 0.63 and 0.43, respectively, in comparison to 0 for <b>disengaged</b> responses by definition according to the P +> 0 % method. Compared to other methods specifying constant thresholds of 5000 or 3000  ms, or item-specific thresholds obtained by inspecting visually the (bimodal) response time distribution, the P +> 0 % method resulted in the greatest difference in proportion correct for engaged versus <b>disengaged</b> responses, suggesting that the method separates <b>disengaged</b> and engaged responses very well. Taken together, these validity checks indicate that the P +> 0 % indicator can validly be interpreted as a measure of test-taking disengagement.|$|R
