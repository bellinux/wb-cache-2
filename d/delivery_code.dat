40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a coding problem called {{complementary}} delivery, where messages from two correlated sources are jointly encoded and each decoder reproduces one of two messages using the other message as the side information. Both lossless and lossy universal complementary delivery coding schemes are investigated. In the lossless case, it is demonstrated that a universal complementary <b>delivery</b> <b>code</b> can be constructed by only combining two Slepian-Wolf codes. Especially, it is shown that a universal lossless complementary <b>delivery</b> <b>code,</b> for which error probability is exponentially tight, can be constructed from two linear Slepian-Wolf codes. In the lossy case, a universal complementary delivery coding scheme based on Wyner-Ziv codes is proposed. While the proposed scheme cannot attain the optimal rate-distortion trade-off in general, the rate-loss is upper bounded by a universal constant under some mild conditions. The proposed schemes allows us to apply any Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv codes to complementary delivery coding.

30|$|The {{validity}} of the Korean NHI database, which {{has been reported to}} be acceptable in several investigations, has been used in numerous epidemiological studies (Cho et al. 2013, 2015; Lee 2014; Kim et al. 2012). Although the accuracy of diagnostic coding could vary substantially across conditions (Fisher et al. 1992), the codes for more severe conditions have been reported to be more accurate than those for less severe ones (Park et al. 2003). Because there is no previous study on the {{validity of}} obstetric complications in the Korean NHI cohort data, working definitions using procedure codes specific to the conditions were used in this study. We identified individuals with obstetric delivery discharge from the NHI cohort data according to three criteria, following the hierarchical method suggested by Kuklina et al. (2008): (1) cases with a treatment history in an obstetrics and gynecology department and with a diagnostic code for delivery (starting with ‘O 8 ’ in International Statistical Classification of Disease and Related Health Problems, 10 th Revision [ICD- 10]); (2) cases with a hospital admission made under a <b>delivery</b> <b>code,</b> and (3) cases aged between 15 and 44  years. The presence of preeclampsia and postpartum hemorrhage during labor or delivery was determined by coexistence of diagnostic and specific procedure codes for both complications within the obstetric delivery data. For preeclampsia, the ICD- 10 codes for preeclampsia (O 14.0, mild-to-moderate pre-eclampsia, O 14.1, severe pre-eclampsia, O 14.2, HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and lower platelets) syndrome, and O 14.9, pre-eclampsia, unspecified) and the procedure code for intravenous MgSO 4, which is used in severe cases of preeclampsia, was used in the identification of preeclampsia cases. For postpartum hemorrhage, ICD- 10 codes starting with O 72.0 –O 72.3, and procedure codes for blood transfusions, were included in the working definition.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach for encoding Korean addresses to the finest depth of sort {{is presented in}} this paper. The implementation is focused on producing the final <b>delivery</b> point <b>code</b> for various types of address recognized in an efficient manner. There are two stages in the address interpretation: 1) agreement verification between the recognized postal code and {{upper part of the}} address and 2) analysis of lower part of the address which is important for the encoding. In the agreement verification procedure, the recognized postal code is used as a key to access the address dictionary and each of the retrieved addresses is compared with the words in the recognized address. As a result, the boundary between the upper part and the lower part is located. The confusion matrices are introduced to improve performance of the process by correcting misrecognized characters. In the procedure of interpreting the lower address part, a <b>delivery</b> point <b>code</b> is derived using the house number and/or the building name. Several rules for the interpretation have been developed based on the analysis of real addresses collected. Experiments have been performed to evaluate the proposed approach using addresses collected from two metropolitan cities in Korea. 1...|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we study}} a {{noiseless}} broadcast link serving K users whose requests arise from {{a library of}} N files. Every user {{is equipped with a}} cache of size M files each. It has been shown that by splitting all the files into packets and placing individual packets in a random independent manner across all the caches, it requires at most N/M file transmissions for any set of demands from the library. The achievable delivery scheme involves linearly combining packets of different files following a greedy clique cover solution to the underlying index coding problem. This remarkable multiplicative gain of random placement and <b>coded</b> <b>delivery</b> has been established in the asymptotic regime when the number of packets per file F scales to infinity. In this work, we initiate the finite-length analysis of random caching schemes when the number of packets F {{is a function of the}} system parameters M,N,K. Specifically, we show that existing random placement and clique cover delivery schemes that achieve optimality in the asymptotic regime can have at most a multiplicative gain of 2 if the number of packets is sub-exponential. Further, for any clique cover based <b>coded</b> <b>delivery</b> and a large class of random caching schemes, that includes the existing ones, we show that the number of packets required to get a multiplicative gain of 4 / 3 g is at least O((N/M) ^g). We exhibit a random placement and an efficient clique cover based <b>coded</b> <b>delivery</b> scheme that approximately achieves this lower bound. We also provide tight concentration results that show that the average (over the random caching involved) number of transmissions concentrates very well requiring only polynomial number of packets in the rest of the parameters.
