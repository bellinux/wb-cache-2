50|$|A {{cobblestone}} area-forming cell (CAFC) assay is a cell culture-based empirical assay. When plated onto a {{confluent culture}} of stromal <b>feeder</b> <b>layer,</b> {{a fraction of}} HSCs creep between the gaps (even though the stromal cells are touching each other) and eventually settle between the stromal cells and the substratum (here the dish surface) or trapped in the cellular processes between the stromal cells. Emperipolesis is the in vivo phenomenon in which one cell is completely engulfed into another (e.g. thymocytes into thymic nurse cells); on the other hand, when in vitro, lymphoid lineage cells creep beneath nurse-like cells, the process is called pseudoemperipolesis. This similar phenomenon is more commonly known in the HSC field by the cell culture terminology cobble stone area-forming cells (CAFC), which means areas or clusters of cells look dull cobblestone-like under phase contrast microscopy, {{compared to the other}} HSCs, which are refractile. This happens because the cells that are floating loosely on top of the stromal cells are spherical and thus refractile. However, the cells that creep beneath the stromal cells are flattened and, thus, not refractile. The mechanism of pseudoemperipolesis is only recently coming to light. It may be mediated by interaction through CXCR4 (CD184) the receptor for CXC Chemokines (e.g., SDF1) and α4β1 integrins.|$|E

Various terrestrial plant species have been found to effectively remove toxic metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr6+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ from aqueous solutions. It was also found that low level radioactive contaminants can successfully be removed from liquid streams. A system to achieve this can consist of a “feeder layer” of soil suspended above a contaminated stream through which plants grow, extending the bulk of their roots into the water. The <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> allows the plants to receive fertilizer without contaminating the stream, while simultaneously removing heavy metals from the water. Trees have also been applied to remediation. Trees are the lowest cost plant type. They can grow on land of marginal quality and have long life-spans. This results in little or no maintenance costs. The most commonly used are willows and poplars, which can grow 6 - 8’ per year and have a high flood tolerance. For deep contamination, hybrid poplars with roots extending 30 feet deep have been used. Their roots penetrate microscopic scale pores in the soil matrix and can cycle 100 L of water per day per tree. These trees act almost like a pump and treat remediation system.|$|E

Control cultures without the feeder layers did not continue growing through serial subcultures. 2) With the use of the soft agar clonogenic assay, addition of the <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> to the petri dishes increased the number of tumor cell colonies in each of si...|$|E
40|$|The {{initiation}} of a cultured human colon carcinoma line on a <b>feeder</b> <b>layer</b> of confluent fibroblasts is described. Attempts to initiate cultures without fibroblast feeder layers were not successful. Two sub-lines (designated HCT C and HCT C Col) were isolated and weaned from cells {{growing on the}} surface of the <b>feeder</b> <b>layer.</b> The sub-lines had different morphologies, secreted different levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) into the medium of confluent cultures and had slightly different karyotypes. Both sub-lines grew in semi-solid medium and formed xenografts when injected s. c. into athymic nude mice. Analysis of radioiodinated cell membrane components indicated small, but significant differences between the sub-lines...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUmbilical {{cord blood}} (UCB) is an {{attractive}} source of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, the number of HSCs in UCB is limited, and attempts to amplify them in vitro remain inefficient. Several publications have documented amplification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) on endothelial or mesenchymal cells, {{but the lack of}} homogeneity in culture conditions and HSC definition impairs direct comparison of these results. We investigated the ability of different <b>feeder</b> <b>layers,</b> mesenchymal progenitors (MPs) and endothelial cells (ECs), to amplify hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Placental derived HSPCs (defined as Lin−CD 45 −/dimCD 34 +CD 38 −CD 90 +) were maintained on confluent <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> and the number of cells and their marker expression were monitored over 21 days. Although both types of <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> supported hematopoietic expansion, only endothelial cells triggered amplification of Lin−CD 45 −/dimCD 34 +CD 38 −CD 90 + cells, which peaked at 14 days. The amplified cells differentiated into all cell lineages, as attested by in vitro colony-forming assays, and were capable of engraftment and multi-lineage differentiation in sub-lethally irradiated mice. Mesenchymal progenitors promoted amplification of CD 38 + cells, previously defined as precursors with more limited differentiation potential. A competitive assay demonstrated that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells had a preference for interacting with endothelial cells in vitro. Cytokine and transcriptomic analysis of both feeder cell types identified differences in gene expression that correlated with propensity of ECs and MPs to support hematopoietic cell amplification and differentiation respectively. Finally, we used RNA sequencing of endothelial cells and HSPCs to uncover relevant networks illustrating the complex interaction between endothelial cells and HSPCs leading to stem/progenitor cell expansion...|$|R
40|$|Telomere {{shortening}} in {{populations of}} human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) that survive early replicative arrest (M 0) by the inactivation of p 16 (INK 4 A) during cell culture on plastic dishes {{leads to a}} state of permanent replicative arrest termed senescence. While culture of HMECs on <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> abrogates M 0 and p 16 (INK 4 A) inactivation, progressive telomere attrition in these cells also eventually results in permanent replicative arrest. Expression of telomerase prevents both senescence on plastic (S-P) and senescence on <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> (S-FL) in HMECs, as it does also in cultured primary human fibroblasts. We report here that the gene expression profiles of senescence in HMECs of the same lineage maintained under different culture conditions showed surprisingly little commonality. Moreover, neither of these senescence-associated profiles in HMECs resembles the profile for senescence in human fibroblasts. These results indicate that senescence-associated alterations in gene expression resulting from telomere attrition are affected by culture conditions as well as by cell origins, and argue that replicative senescence at the molecular level is a diverse rather than unique cellular process...|$|R
40|$|Some {{molecular}} changes which {{correlate with}} the tumorigenic progression of neoplastic cells {{can best be}} studied with in vitro cell lines that represent each stage in the progression. Lymphoid cells infected by Abelson murine leukemia virus exhibit {{a wide range of}} growth potential in vitro and in vivo. Uncloned populations that are poorly oncogenic early after infection become progressively more oncogenic with successive passages of the cells in culture. In such mass cultures, it is difficult to evaluate whether a rare subpopulation of highly oncogenic cells becomes dominant in the culture or whether the individual cells progress in oncogenic phenotype. To examine this latter possibility, Abelson virus-infected lymphoid cells were cloned by limiting-dilution culture 10 days postinfection. We isolated two clones that grew poorly in agar, required <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> of adherent bone marrow cells for growth in liquid culture, and were extremely slow to form tumors in syngeneic animals. Both clones, after passage in the presence of adherent <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> for 3 months, grew well in liquid and agar-containing cultures in the absence of <b>feeder</b> <b>layers</b> and formed tumors in animals at a rapid rate. The progression of these clonal cell lines to a more malignant growth phenotype occurred in the absence of detectable changes in the concentration, half-life, phosphorylation, in vitro kinase activity, or cell localization of the Abelson virus-encoded transforming protein. No change in the concentration or arrangement of integrated Abelson viral DNA sequences was detected in either clone. Thus, perhaps changes in the expression of cellular genes would appear to alter the growth properties of lymphoid cells after their initial transformation by Abelson virus. Such cellular changes could complement the activity of the Abelson virus transforming protein in producing the fully malignant growth phenotype...|$|R
