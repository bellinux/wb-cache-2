500|$|Zayat {{lives in}} Teaneck, New Jersey, with his wife, Joanne. The couple have four children: Ashley, Justin, Benjamin and Emma. Justin, a 2015 {{graduate}} of New York University, {{works closely with}} his father in the Zayat Stables business. While residing primarily in New Jersey, the Zayats also have residences in New York, Egypt and London. The family are Orthodox Jews; Zayat's Hebrew name is Ephraim (אפרים), used by family and community. Zayat donates to Jewish schools and charities, including those that help special-needs children. Although The New York Times has stated that Zayat has publicly identified as both Jewish and Muslim at times, his family attends Congregation Bnai Yeshurun in Teaneck, keeps the Jewish Sabbath, and observes kosher laws regarding food. When questioned about his religious affiliation, Zayat stated, [...] "Why is it relevant, and why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> It's personal." ...|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 1917, Kerensky {{declared}} Russia a republic. Michael {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "We {{woke up this morning}} to hear Russia declared a Republic. What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> which form the government will be {{as long as there is}} order and justice?" [...] Two weeks later, Michael's house arrest was lifted. Kerensky had armed the Bolsheviks after a power struggle with the commander-in-chief and in October there was a second revolution as the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former colleague of Michael from the Savage Division who was now a commander in Petrograd, Michael planned to move his family to the greater safety of Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their preparations were seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. The last of Michael's cars were seized by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
500|$|Booker {{has never}} been married, and in 2013 he was named one of Town & Country’’s [...] "Top 40 Bachelors". Although he has {{generally}} tried to keep his personal life private, Booker {{has in the past}} described himself as a [...] "straight male" [...] and has said that he is trying to date more in hopes of finding someone to settle down with. [...] In a 1990 column in the Stanford Daily, Booker admitted that as a teenager he had [...] "hated gays". [...] Booker has himself been the target of rumors about being gay and has generally refused to address these on principle, which he explained in 2013: Because I want to challenge people on their homophobia. I love seeing on Twitter when someone says I'm gay, and I say, [...] "So what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> if I am? So be it. I hope you are not voting for me because you are making the presumption that I'm straight." ...|$|E

500|$|Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph was {{generally}} negative about the film, stating, [...] "The Human Centipede has its moments, but they're largely obscured by umpteen {{holes in the}} plot {{as well as by}} reams of exposition" [...] and that it was [...] "an ultimately underwhelming affair that's neither sick or repellent enough to garner the cult status it so craves." [...] The New York Times review by Jeannette Catsouli noted that whether the film was [...] "a commentary on Nazi atrocities or a literal expression of filmmaking politics, the grotesque fusion at least silences the female leads, both of whose voices could strip paint." [...] Writing in the Chicago Sun Times, Roger Ebert did not assign the film a star rating (not to be confused with awarding it zero stars), stating, [...] "I am required to award stars to movies I review. This time, I refuse to do it. The star rating system is unsuited to this film. Is the movie good? Is it bad? <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
500|$|Ebert {{emphasized}} that his star ratings had little meaning if not {{considered in the}} context of the review itself. Occasionally, Ebert's star rating may have seemed at odds with his written opinion. Ebert acknowledged one such case in his review of Basic Instinct 2, stating, [...] "I cannot recommend the movie, but... why the hell can't I? Just because it's godawful? What kind of reason is that for staying away from a movie? Godawful and boring, that would be a reason". In August 2004 Stephen King, in a column, criticized what he saw as a growing trend of leniency towards films from critics, including Ebert. His main criticism was that films, citing Spider-Man 2 as an example, were constantly given four star ratings that they did not deserve. In his review of The Manson Family, Ebert gave the film three stars for achieving what it set out to do, but admitted that did not count as a recommendation per se. He similarly gave the Adam Sandler-starring remake of The Longest Yard a positive rating of three stars, but in his review, which he wrote soon after attending the Cannes Film Festival, he recommended readers not to see the film because they had access to more satisfying cinematic experiences. He declined to give a star rating to The Human Centipede, arguing that the rating system was [...] "unsuited" [...] to such a film: [...] "Is the movie good? Is it bad? <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> It is what it is and occupies a world where the stars don't shine." ...|$|E
2500|$|One [...] {{quote of}} Symmachus from [...] "The Memorial of Symmachus, Prefect of the City" [...] reads (in translation), [...] "We gaze {{up at the}} same stars; the sky covers us all; the same {{universe}} encompasses us. <b>Does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> what practical system we adopt in our search for the Truth? The heart of so great a mystery cannot be reached by following one road only." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tragedy of Arthur {{also brings}} into play {{questions}} of authorship akin to those raised by critical theorists Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, in their essays [...] "Death of the Author" [...] and [...] "What is an Author?". Foucault's question – [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> who is speaking?" [...] – and {{his concept of}} [...] "The Author Function" [...] {{is essential to the}} protagonist's investigation into – and evaluation of – the works his father produces.|$|E
2500|$|Randy Moore and Sehoya Cotner, {{from the}} biology {{program at the}} University of Minnesota, reflect on the {{relevance}} of teaching creationism in the article [...] "The Creationist Down the Hall: <b>Does</b> <b>It</b> <b>Matter</b> When Teachers Teach Creationism?" [...] They conclude that [...] "Despite decades of science education reform, numerous legal decisions declaring the teaching of creationism in public-school science classes to be unconstitutional, overwhelming evidence supporting evolution, and the many denunciations of creationism as nonscientific by professional scientific societies, creationism remains popular throughout the United States." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{noticeable}} {{characteristic of}} Ryelandt was his modesty. Although he enjoyed hearing his works performed, {{he left it}} to others—especially his teacher Tinel and Charles Lamy (pen name of Charles Martens, meaning ‘Charles, the friend ’)—to make his works known. As he put it: “If God wants my work to be known one day, that will happen. If not, what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter?</b> The task of the artist is to create, and that’s it. Success is a luxury and a pleasure, it’s not indispensable.” He never bragged about the extra-musical honors that befell him. Sometimes he gently mocked them, like when, on being made Commander {{in the order of}} Leopold, he “complained” no one had told him whom to command. When he was very old, he told his daughter: “You must never call a priest or a doctor for me at night, not before 6 in the morning. Those folk need their sleep.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{somewhat}} convoluted plot of Simon Boccanegra {{is hard to}} follow. Budden notes: [...] "All {{the characters}} define themselves against an ingeniously shifting pattern of intrigue such as can be highly effective in a play but well-nigh impossible to follow in an opera". [...] Verdi had {{gone so far as}} to actually write out the scenario in prose, which he then submitted to Piave in August; all that he expected from his librettist was that it would be turned into poetry, so Verdi balked somewhat when the censors demanded a complete poetic version: [...] "what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> for the moment it's in prose or verse?" [...] He pushed harder, stating that [...] "I plan to compose music for a prose libretto! [...] What do you think of that?" [...] In the end, there was a poetic version and all was well: it was accepted by the opera house and the censors.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth season {{once again}} {{received}} mostly positive critical reception. Season 5 {{was given a}} weighted average of 78 out of 100 by Metacritic. Variety said that [...] "The ABC series remains one of primetime's most uncompromising efforts, and this year's latest wrinkle on flashbacks, flash-forwards and island-disappearing flashes of light does nothing to alter that perception." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Newark Star Ledger said that season 5 may finally be [...] "a day of reckoning between those viewers who embrace the show's science-fiction trappings, and those who prefer {{not to think about}} them." [...] Sepinwall also related that [...] "I loved every minute. But I'm also a geek who read Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov growing up." [...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com criticized the use of time travel saying that [...] "when a narrator brings magic or time travel or an act of God into the picture, then uses it without restraint, the story loses its anchor to real life." [...] The critic also asked [...] "Why <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>matter</b> what Locke and Richard Alpert and Daniel Faraday or anyone else does, when they all seem as clueless and unfettered from reality as we are as viewers? How can these characters have any concrete agenda or strategic approach or philosophical perspective on anything when the rug is pulled out from under them by another Act of God every few seconds?" [...] The New York Times also commented that [...] "what has been most dispiriting about the current season is the show's willingness to abandon many of the larger and more compelling themes that grounded the elaborate plot: the struggles between faith and reason; the indictments of extreme capitalism, the futility of recovery. All that remains is the reductively limned battle between fate and free will largely playing out, now, in Jack Shephard's belief that returning to the island is his Destiny." [...] The A.V. Club said of the fifth-season finale, [...] "Me? I found the ending frustrating, but in a good way. This finale was entertaining as all get-out to me, and despite the occasional groaner moment, I think this may be Lost's most purposeful, surprising finale." ...|$|E

60|$|Then, {{satisfied}} and shattered, fulfilled and destroyed, {{he went home}} away from her, drifting vaguely through the darkness, lapsed into the old fire of burning passion.
