40|$|BACKGROUND: Conventional annuloplasty rings {{consist of}} woven, nondegradable {{prosthetic}} material. Their use should theoretically be limited in <b>acute</b> <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis.</b> Novel biodegradable annuloplasty rings, which are implanted into the annulus, carry theoretical advantages, but {{have never been}} evaluated for feasibility and mid-term outcome in such patients. METHODS: Between 2004 and 2009, 17 consecutive patients with <b>acute</b> <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis</b> (age, 34. 5 +/- 21. 6 years; range, 11 - 82 years; 8 men) had mitral (n= 13), tricuspid (n= 3), and mitral and tricuspid (n= 1) annuloplasty to conclude valve repair. Repair was performed by complete excision of the infected tissue, valvar reconstruction, and biodegradable ring annuloplasty. Prospectively collected clinical and echocardiographic data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Indications for surgery were heart failure (n= 9; 52. 9 %), hemodynamic instability (n= 8; 47 %), and persistent infection or sepsis despite antibiotics (n= 6; 35. 3 %). Staphylococci (n= 7) and Streptococci (n= 4) were the most common causes. Three patients died on postoperative days 1, 2, and 34 because of massive gastrointestinal bleeding; heart failure and pneumonia; and sepsis and acute renal failure, respectively. During a median follow-up of survivors at 29. 6 months (range, 2. 0 to 51. 0 months), no mortality, recurrence, or reoperation occurred. At follow-up, transthoracic echocardiography revealed no or trivial regurgitation in 11 and mild in 3 patients. Left ventricular dimensions regressed significantly after mitral repair. CONCLUSIONS: Valve repair using a biodegradable ring showed good structural and functional properties up to 4 years after repair. Implantation of the biodegradable ring is feasible and effective in patients with <b>acute</b> <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis.</b> Its intraannular implantation, hindering direct blood contact and associated risk of colonization, represents a theoretical advantage in such patients.

Prosthetic valve replacement is often necessary for <b>acute</b> <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis.</b> Although valve repair and homografts have been associated with excellent outcome, homograft availability and the importance of valvular destruction often dictate prosthetic valve replacement in patients with <b>acute</b> bacterial <b>endocarditis.</b> METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the experience with prosthetic valve replacement following acute NVE and PVE between 1988 and 1998 was performed at the Montreal Heart Institute. RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients (57 men and 20 women, mean age 48 +/- 16 years) with <b>acute</b> <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis</b> underwent valve replacement. Fifty patients had NVE and 27 had PVE. Four patients (8 %) with NVE died within 30 days of operation and there were no hospital deaths in patients with PVE. Survival at 1, 5, and 7 years averaged 80 % +/- 6 %, 76 % +/- 6 %, and 76 % +/- 6 % for NVE and 70 % +/- 9 %, 59 % +/- 10 %, and 55 % +/- 10 % for PVE, respectively (p = 0. 15). Reoperation-free survival at 1, 5, and 7 years averaged 80 % +/- 6 %, 76 % +/- 6 %, and 76 % +/- 6 % for NVE and 45 % +/- 10 %, 40 % +/- 10 %, and 36 % +/- 9 % for PVE (p = 0. 003). Five-year survival for NVE averaged 75 % +/- 9 % following aortic valve replacement and 79 % +/- 9 % following mitral valve replacement. Five-year survival for PVE averaged 66 % +/- 12 % following aortic valve replacement and 43 % +/- 19 % following mitral valve replacement (p = 0. 75). Nine patients underwent reoperation during follow-up: indications were prosthesis infection in 4 patients (3 mitral, 1 aortic), dehiscence of mitral prosthesis in 3, and dehiscence of aortic prosthesis in 2.

40|$|The {{adherence}} {{of microorganisms}} to platelets previously immobilized on the subendocar-dium in nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis {{is considered an}} important pathogenic step in Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis.

The library was affinity panned against purified immobilized platelets. After a second panning against platelets, {{a significant increase in}} the number of eluted phag-emid particles was observed; 27 % of 88 randomly isolated clones expressed overlapping de-duced amino acid sequences with high similarity to the C-terminal domain of the S. aureus coagulase.

The present authors analyzed 150 patients with left-sided IE. Embolisms including cerebrovascular events (CVE) and the use of ACT were checked at the time of admission and during hospitalization.

We present the first case report in Argentina of the failure of treatment with vancomycin in endocarditis caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus containing subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. Case presentation We report the case of a 66 -year-old Hispanic man with infective endocarditis complicated by septic emboli in the lumbosacral spine and the left iliopsoas muscle. This disease was caused by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus containing subpopulations with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. He was initially treated with cephalothin and gentamicin but developed a rash caused by beta-lactams and interstitial nephritis. For that reason, the treatment was subsequently switched to vancomycin but he failed to respond. The infection resolved after administration of vancomycin in combination with gentamicin and rifampin. Conclusion Our case report provides important evidence for the existence of subpopulations of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus that have reduced susceptibility to vancomycin which would account for treatment failure. Our case raises an alert about the existence of these strains and highlights the need to determine the vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration of Staphylococcus aureus to screen for the presence of strains that have reduced vancomycin susceptibility at different infection sites. </p...|$|R

The predominant infecting organisms were Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeroginosa (29 %). In contrast to single valve infection, {{congestive heart failure}} {{was the most common}} operative indication (86 %, p < 0. 05) and was uniformly present when both left-sided valves were involved. Surgery was performed 20 ± 13 days after initiation of antibiotic therapy, yet 7 of the 14 patients had perivalvular abscess formation. In nine patients with solely left-sided infection, aortic and mitral valve replacements were performed. In five patients with bilateral infection, partial or complete tricuspid valvectomy was performed in conjunction with one aortic and four mitral valve replacements. Tricuspid valve competence was reestablished by valve insertion or anuloplasty in two patients, and these patients experienced less perioperative heart failure than did those with tricuspid excision alone. There was no early (< 30 day) mortality. However, long-term follow-up revealed a reoperative incidence of 21 % and a 36 % late mortality rate due to prosthetic valve infection with or without dehiscence at 3 to 18 months (mean 7. 2 ± 6) after the initial operation. These late infectious complications were not related to infecting organism or prosthetic material in the tricuspid anulus, but did occur in four (57 %) of seven patients with intracardiac abscess. The data indicate that 1) multiple valve infection does not preclude successful early surgical therapy, 2) maintaining tricuspid competence may be hemodynamically preferable, and 3) reinfection in this addict population increases late mortality...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE—To analyse {{the long}} term results of {{mechanical}} prostheses for treating active infective endocarditis.  DESIGN—Prospective cohort study of a consecutive series of patients diagnosed with infective endocarditis and operated on in the active phase of the infection for insertion of a mechanical prosthesis.  SETTING—Tertiary referral centre in a metropolitan area.  RESULTS—Between 1975  and 1997,  637  cases of infective endocarditis were diagnosed in the centre. Of these, 436  were left sided (with overall mortality of 20. 3 %). Surgical treatment in the active phase of the infection was needed in 141  patients (72 % native, 28 % prosthetic infective endocarditis). Mechanical prostheses were used in 131  patients. Operative mortality was 30. 5 % (40  patients). Ninety one survivors were followed up prospectively for (mean (SD)) 5. 4  (4. 5) years. Thirteen patients developed prosthetic valve dysfunction. Nine patients suffered reinfection: four of these (4 %) were early and five were late. The median time from surgery for late reinfection was 1. 4  years. During follow up, 12  patients died. Excluding operative mortality, actuarial survival was 86. 6 % at five years and 83. 7 % at 10  years; actuarial survival free from death, reoperation, and reinfection was 73. 1 % at five years and 59. 8 % at 10  years.  CONCLUSIONS—In patients surviving <b>acute</b> <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis</b> and receiving mechanical prostheses, the rate of early reinfection compares well with reported results of homografts.

We analysed the agreement between the patient's attending physicians and European Society of Cardiology guidelines regarding indications for surgery. We also assessed whether surgery was performed in patients who had an indication. METHODS AND RESULTS: From the 2008 prospective population-based French survey on IE, 303 patients with definite left-sided native IE were identified. For each case, we prospectively recorded (i) indication for surgery according to the attending physicians and (ii) indication for surgery according to guidelines. Surgery was indicated in 194 (65 %) patients according to attending physicians and in 221 (73 %) according to guidelines, while 139 (46 %) underwent surgery. Agreement was moderate between attending physicians and guidelines (kappa 0. 41 - 0. 59) and between indication according to guidelines {{and the performance of}} surgery (kappa 0. 38). Of the 90 (30 %) patients not operated despite indication, contraindication to surgery was reported by the attending physicians in 42 (47 %), and indication was not identified in 48 (53 %). One-year survival was 76 % in patients with indication and surgery performed (n = 131), 69 % in patients without indication and no surgery (n = 74), 56 % in patients with identified indication and contraindication to surgery (n = 42), and 60 % in patients with no identified indication (n = 48; P = 0. 059).

Design: Retrospective review of 102 necropsy reports from a tertiary centre obtained {{over a period of}} 19 years. Methods: The diagnosis, the operated or non-operated state of the main defect, the cause of death, and main complications were related to the age and gender. Other clinically relevant conditions, and identifiable sequels of previous diseases, were also noted. Results: The ages ranged from 15 to 69 years, with a mean of 31. 1 and a median of 28 years, with no difference detected according to the gender. Of the patients, two-thirds had been submitted to at least one cardiac surgery. The mean age of death was significantly higher in non-operated patients (p = 0. 003). The most prevalent cause of death in the whole group was related to recent surgery, found in one-third. From them, two-fifths corresponded to reoperations. Among the others, cardiac failure was the main terminal cause in another third, and the second cause was pulmonary thromboembolism in just over one-fifth, presenting a significant association with histopathological signs of pulmonary hypertension (p = 0. 011).

Bartonella endocarditis {{has been described}} from wealthier countries in Asia, Japan, Korea, Thailand and India {{but there are no}} reports from poorer countries, such as the Lao PDR (Laos), probably because people have neglected to look. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a retrospective (2006 - 2012), and subsequent prospective study (2012 - 2013), at Mahosot Hospital, Vientiane, Laos, through liaison between the microbiology laboratory and the wards. Patients aged > 1 year admitted with definite or possible endocarditis according to modified Duke criteria were included. In view of the strong suspicion of <b>infective</b> <b>endocarditis,</b> <b>acute</b> and convalescent sera from 30 patients with culture negative endocarditis were tested for antibodies to Brucella melitensis, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Bartonella quintana, B. henselae, Coxiella burnetii and Legionella pneumophila. Western blot analysis using Bartonella species antigens enabled us to describe the first two Lao patients with known Bartonella henselae endocarditis. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We argue that it is likely that Bartonella endocarditis is neglected and more widespread than appreciated, as there are few laboratories in Asia able to make the diagnosis. Considering the high prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in Asia, there is remarkably little evidence on the bacterial etiology of endocarditis. Most evidence is derived from wealthy countries and investigation of the aetiology and optimal management of endocarditis in low income countries has been neglected. Interest in Bartonella as neglected pathogens is emerging, and improved methods for the rapid diagnosis of Bartonella endocarditis are needed, as it is likely that proven Bartonella endocarditis can be treated with simpler and less expensive regimens than "conventional" endocarditis and multicenter trials to optimize treatment are required.

The remaining gram-positive and -negative isolates, including four viridans streptococci, were relatively nonadherent. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated attachment of Staphylococcus aureus and invagination of the underlying endothelial cell membrane at 1 h followed by engulfment of large numbers of bacteria after 3 h.

Contegra, a bovine jugular vein graft, is an interesting alternative to overcome these limitations. It consists of a bovine jugular vein with a naturally integrated valve in it. Isolated pulmonary valve endocarditis is extremely rare. Case presentation: We report {{the case of a}} 20 years old male patient with <b>acute</b> <b>endocarditis</b> of bovine Contegra valved conduit, four years after right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction and atrial septal defect correction, associated with acute glomerulonephritis, renal failure and severe anemia, secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (MRSA). Conclusion: We present a complex patient with <b>acute</b> <b>endocarditis</b> of bovine Contegra valved conduit. We believe that the presentation of this case should encourage the researchers for the discussing of the implantation of this conduit and the prevention of endocarditis in these patients. Background A variety of prosthetic conduits and homografts for the right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction have bee...|$|R
40|$|We sequenced {{the genome}} of Streptococcus pyogenes strain G 773 that caused an infective {{endocarditis}} in a 4 -year-old boy suffering from <b>acute</b> <b>endocarditis.</b> The 1. 9 -Mb genome exhibited a specific combination of virulence factors including a complete integrative and conjugative element, sp 2905, previously described as incomplete in S. pyogenes, and five bacteriocin-coding genes. However, strain G 773 lacked a CRISPR-Cas system...|$|R
50|$|In 1899 MacCallum and T.W. Hastings {{described}} {{a new species}} of pathogenic Gram-positive bacterium which they named Micrococcus zymogenes. The bacterium was discovered to be the causative agent of heart infection (<b>acute</b> <b>endocarditis).</b> The bacterium was a very small, occurred mainly in pairs, sometimes in short chains, and developed in small, pale, grayish-white colonies. It was uniquely capable of fermenting milk, hence, the name zymogenes.|$|R
50|$|In 1997, he died {{suddenly}} at 51 {{years of age}} from <b>acute</b> <b>endocarditis,</b> a bacterial infection of the heart valves. In his memory, a benefit match was organized on 12 October 1997 between ONA Gouda and the Ajax of the Europe Cup I-finals from 1971. In May 2017, 20 years after his death, another matched was staged in his memory between former Ajax players and Nice.|$|R
