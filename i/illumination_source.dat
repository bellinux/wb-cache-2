50|$|Two general {{types of}} {{infrared}} / near-infrared (also known as active light) eye tracking techniques are used: bright-pupil and dark-pupil. Their difference {{is based on}} the location of the <b>illumination</b> <b>source</b> with respect to the optics. If the illumination is coaxial with the optical path, then the eye acts as a retroreflector as the light reflects off the retina creating a bright pupil effect similar to red eye. If the <b>illumination</b> <b>source</b> is offset from the optical path, then the pupil appears dark because the retroreflection from the retina is directed away from the camera.|$|E

30|$|The {{variation}} of the incident angle also influences the acquired spectral reflectance, {{as the amount of}} light reflected by a surface depends both on the lighting and sensing directions [37]. We implicitly assume that all the acquired surfaces are approximately Lambertian, and thus that the reflectance does not vary with the observation direction. From a practical point of view, this means we should be careful when acquiring, for example, frescoes with extended gold leaf coverage. As for possible reflections from the surrounding surfaces, we assume these are negligible in comparison with the light from the <b>illumination</b> <b>sources.</b> What is not accounted for is the dependence of the spectral reflectance on the incident light direction. Therefore, in order to compare different acquisitions for monitoring purposes, the operator should place the <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> in matching positions.|$|R
50|$|Dual {{photography}} is a photographic technique that uses Helmholtz reciprocity {{to capture the}} light field of all light paths from a structured <b>illumination</b> <b>source</b> to a camera.

50|$|Condensers {{typically}} {{consist of}} a variable-aperture diaphragm and one or more lenses. Light from the <b>illumination</b> <b>source</b> of the microscope passes through the diaphragm and is focused by the lens(es) onto the specimen.

50|$|Filters are {{sometimes}} {{added to the}} UV <b>illumination</b> <b>source</b> to narrow the illuminant waveband.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} the illumination type on the performance of photovoltaic energy harvesting for application in buildings. A range of different types of solar cells are available to suit differing <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> and intensities. Modules made from polycrystalline silicon, amorphous silicon and dye-sensitized TiO 2 were investigated under illumination from incandescent, fluorescent, white light LED and RGB colour-controllable LED light sources in this paper. It is shown {{that it is important to}} select the solar cell to suit the type of light. In this paper, the maximum power points of four types of solar cell have been investigated under three different electrical light <b>sources</b> for various <b>illumination</b> levels allowing the selection of the optimum solar cell type for a given combination of electrical light source and a particular illumination level. An analysis of the effect of varying the spectral composition of the illumination is achieved by using a colour-controllable LED to provide the primary colours of white light. Generally, most power is harvested by solar cells under incandescent <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> followed by compact fluorescent (CFL) and then LED. The amorphous-Si solar cells tested show a similar power output under all three <b>illumination</b> <b>sources,</b> therefore a device using these should perform consistently under all lighting sources, whereas the poly-crystalline silicon solar cell tested shows a significant difference between incandescent and CFL/white light LED sources which could restrict operation to just incandescent lighting...|$|R

The system analyses eye closures and head poses to determine early onset of fatigue and distraction. The fatigue detection algorithm calculates AVECLOS. This is the percentage of time the eyes are fully closed during a one-minute interval.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{sampling}} procedures often begin by obtaining the dark current {{images of the}} sample. Dark current {{is referred to as}} the photocurrent generation created by the OPV in the absence of an <b>illumination</b> <b>source.</b> The cantilever and tip are simply rastered across the sample while topographic and current measurements are obtained. This data can then be used as a reference to determine the impact the illumination process exhibits on the OPV. Short circuit measurements are also commonly performed on the OPV devices. This consists of engaging the <b>illumination</b> <b>source</b> at open current (that is applied potential to the sample is zero). Nguyen and workers noted that a positive photocurrent reading correlated to the conduction of holes, while a negative reading correlated to the conduction of electrons. This alone allowed the authors to make predictions regarding the morphology within the cell. The current density for the forward and reverse bias can calculated as follows:Current density equation: ...|$|E

40|$|E-commerce is {{a growing}} market for selling gods and digital images are often used to display the product. However, {{there is a problem}} when the color of the object does not match the reality. This can lead to a dissatisfaction of the {{customer}} and a return of the product. Returned goods causes a significant loss in revenue for the suppliers. One reason for untruthful rendering of colors in images is due to different temperatures, or colors, of the <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> lighting the scene and the object. This effect can be reduced by a method called white balance. In this thesis, an algorithm based on the technique in Hsu et al. was implemented for a more truthful rendering of images of clothes and toys used in e-commerce. The algorithm removes unwanted color casts induced in the image from two different <b>illumination</b> <b>sources.</b> The thesis also marks important details missing in aforementioned paper as well as some drawbacks of the proposed technique, such as high processing time...|$|R
40|$|The {{appearance}} of a static scene as sensed by a camera changes considerably {{as a result of}} changes in the illumination that falls upon it. Scene appearance modeling is thus necessary for understanding which changes in the {{appearance of}} a scene are the result of illumination changes. For any camera, the appearance of the scene {{is a function of the}} <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> in the scene, the three-dimensional configuration of the objects in the scene and the reflectance properties of all the surfaces in the scene. A scene appearance model is described here as a function of the behavior of static <b>illumination</b> <b>sources,</b> within or beyond the scene, and arbitrary three-dimensional configurations of patches and their reflectance distributions. Based on the suggested model, a spatial prediction technique was developed to predict the appearance of the scene, given a few measurements within it. The scene appearance model and the prediction technique were developed analytically and tested empirically. Two potential applications are briefly explored...|$|R
30|$|An {{important}} and often underestimated consideration regarding the multispectral acquisition of large-sized painted surfaces is that performing it using the instruments currently employed for the multispectral acquisition of paintings [5, 24, 30, 31] {{is not an}} optimal choice. First of all, in those instruments the camera is placed close to the painting surface, and a full image is acquired moving the camera by means of linear translators. This solution is unpractical when acquiring surfaces of several squared meters; whereas {{the use of a}} rotating stage allows more compactness. Most of all, state-of-the-art instruments for the multispectral scanning of paintings feature <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> positioned near the camera so as to illuminate the small area under consideration, generally using halogen lamps due to their broad emission spectrum [5, 30, 31]. In the case of the acquisition of large scenes, one needs the <b>illumination</b> <b>sources</b> not to be integral with the scanner, but of standalone type and positioned several meters far from the scanned surface. This particular setup forces nonstandard choices for the <b>illumination</b> <b>sources.</b> As we will see, the emission of broad spectrum lamps such as halogen and incandescence lamps has a drop in the blue region. While this may not be a problem when the lamps are positioned very close to the target, it turns out that when they are far from the acquired surface the signal in the blue region possibly falls close to or below the dark signal (we recall that illumination intensity is inversely proportional to the square of distance).|$|R
