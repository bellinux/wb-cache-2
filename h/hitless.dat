5|$|In 36 relief {{appearances}} in 2006, {{he had an}} ERA of 3.92. In games that were late and close, Feldman held the sixteen batters he faced <b>hitless.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ramirez {{made his}} major league debut on September 2, 1993 against the Minnesota Twins, going <b>hitless</b> in four at bats as the {{designated}} hitter.|$|E
5|$|Brooklyn went <b>hitless</b> in {{the bottom}} of the eighth. They {{inserted}} Harry Taylor to pitch the top half of the ninth, in which, he held St. Louis <b>hitless.</b> With half an inning left to play, the Dodgers began to get hits off of Dickson. Galan doubled, and after Walker flied out, Ed Stevens tripled to score Galan and Furillo singled to score Stevens, after a wild pitch and a walk, Brecheen took over pitching duties for Dickson with St. Louis leading 8–3. Edwards singled off Brecheen and allowed Furillo to score, and after Cookie Lavagetto walked, the score was 8–4 with the bases loaded. The Cardinals kept the score from getting any closer, as Brecheen struck out the final two batters to end the game.|$|E
5|$|Two Phillies {{have made}} 30% {{or more of}} their Phillies {{appearances}} as both pitchers and position players. In addition to Edgar Smith's batting notes above, he amassed a 15.43 ERA as a pitcher, striking out two. John Strike was <b>hitless</b> in seven plate appearances as a right fielder while amassing a 11 record as a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|Kemp's {{ankle injury}} {{took a lot}} longer to heal than had been expected, and the team {{reported}} that they hoped {{to get him back}} in September. However, when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class-A Rancho Cucamonga in late August, he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back. He went <b>hitless</b> in five games, with seven strikeouts, and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners went <b>hitless</b> for {{the third}} time in {{franchise}} history and this was the first time that no Mariner reached base. However, they went on to pitch two no-hitters in 2012, both of which took place at Safeco Field and winning both games 1-0. One of them was the first perfect game in franchise history, by Félix Hernández, making them the first team to be on both the losing and winning end of a perfect game in the same season, and marking the first time two perfect games were thrown in the same park in the same season.|$|E
5|$|Despite his struggles, Affeldt {{was named}} to the Giants' playoff roster. Affeldt made his first playoff {{appearance}} for the Giants in Game 2 of the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia. He struck out one batter and intentionally walked another one, but Santiago Casilla allowed him to score as the Giants lost 61. Affeldt faced (and retired) one batter in Game 5, but the Phillies won that game 42. In Game 6, Affeldt entered the game in the third inning with runners on first and second and nobody out after starting pitcher Jonathan Sánchez was taken out early. He pitched two <b>hitless,</b> scoreless innings, and the Giants won the game 32 to advance to the World Series. Affeldt pitched in two games in the World Series, which the Giants won in five games to give Affeldt his first World Series ring.|$|E
5|$|The series {{then moved}} to Shibe Park in Philadelphia for Game 3, where Martin had two hits, {{including}} a double and scored twice in a 5-2 Cardinals' victory over Grove. In Game 4, he produced the only two hits by the Cardinals as they lost to Earnshaw, 3-0. Martin almost single-handedly provided the offense for the Cardinals in Game 5, driving home four runs with two singles, a home run and a sacrifice fly, as the Cardinals triumphed 5-1. Although he was held <b>hitless</b> {{in the final two}} games of the series, he made an impressive catch to extinguish an Athletics two-run rally in the ninth inning of Game 7 to end the game and clinch the world championship for the Cardinals.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, he {{was signed}} by the Peanut Eaters of the Pennsylvania State Association, and played in 36games before being sold to the Detroit Wolverines of the NL, along with Ed Beatin for $1,000 on July27. Soon, the deal was put on hold by the NL, as the Cincinnati Red Stockings of the American Association(AA) also claimed they had a deal in place for these players. On September6, an {{arbitration}} board for the NL and AA leagues convened to render their findings. They found that Detroit's contract with the players was dated on July20, which superseded Cincinnati's contract that was signed on July27, and awarded Detroit the players. Detroit then sold their contracts with the players to the London Tecumsehs of the International Association. Though he did not play for London in 1887, he did play in two games for the New York Metropolitans of the AA, going <b>hitless</b> in eight at bats.|$|E
5|$|In Game 4 (the final game) of the NLDS {{against the}} Brewers, Burrell hit {{two home runs}} (a three-run game-winning home run against Jeff Suppan and a solo home run against Guillermo Mota) in a 62 victory that gave the Phillies their first playoff series victory since 1993. Four days later, {{in the first game}} of the NL Championship Series, he hit a game-winning solo home run in a 32 victory over the Dodgers. After going <b>hitless</b> in his first 14 at-bats in the World Series, Burrell doubled against J. P. Howell of the Tampa Bay Rays on October 29 in Game 5 (the final game of the series). Burrell was then {{replaced}} by pinch-runner Eric Bruntlett, who scored the game's winning run in the 43 victory as the Phillies won their first World Series since 1980. After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies' World Series parade.|$|E
5|$|May 9 {{was one of}} {{two times}} Young came within an inning of a shutout by {{pitching}} eight scoreless innings; August 17 against the Cleveland Indians was the other. Young recorded a personal-best eight strikeouts in a seven-inning no-decision on June 2 at Detroit. The closest Young came to a no-hitter was 5⅔ innings of <b>hitless</b> pitching in a road game against the Houston Astros on June 25 before allowing a Craig Biggio single in the sixth inning. Over the course of the season, Young was the beneficiary of the second-highest run support in the majors, trailing only David Wells of the Boston Red Sox. However, he surrendered three runs or less in 22 of 31 starts. After a 2005 season when he went 5–0 with a 3.47 ERA in 11 games during the day and 7–7 with a 4.71 ERA in 20 games at night, he had a career 8–1 record with a 3.31 ERA in 15 day games and 7–8 with a 5.05 mark in 23 games at night.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, Young had {{a no-hitter}} through 8⅓ innings {{of the game}} against the Pittsburgh Pirates before pinch hitter Joe Randa hit a two-run home run. This {{would have been the}} first no-hitter in Padres history. It was the first time a Padre had taken a no-hitter into the ninth inning since Andy Ashby on September 5, 1997 vs. the Atlanta Braves. Young had been on pace for a perfect game through 5⅔ innings. Young also took a no-hitter into the eighth inning on May 30 against the Colorado Rockies as a prelude to his June performance. In that game, which marked the first time a pitcher took a no-hitter into the eighth inning during the 2006 season, he {{surrendered}} a double to Brad Hawpe, who had been a teammate in the 1997 Connie Mack World Series, on his first pitch of the eighth inning and 99th of the game. During Young's next start on June 4 at Pittsburgh, he did not allow a hit for the first 5⅓ innings, making him one of only two pitchers (Steve Trachsel – June 20–25, 2002) to have consecutive starts with at least five <b>hitless</b> innings since the 2000 season.|$|E
5|$|Sisler {{began the}} 1958spring {{training}} in spectacular form, pitching {{a total of}} nine <b>hitless</b> innings and allowed just one baserunner in 28batters faced; the last 27 in order. However, he finished the spring with two consecutive losses, including one to the Pittsburgh Pirates, with whom {{his father was a}} special assistant to their manager. He opened the regular season with a complete game victory against the Yankees on April16. On May2, he pitched his only career complete game shutout, a 6–0victory against the Detroit Tigers and future Hall of Famer Jim Bunning, improving his record to 3–1for the season. Over the next two months, his average innings pitched declined during his starts, and on several occasions he entered the game in relief. He went winless from June12 to August9, when he defeated the Yankees. He recorded just one more victory in 1958, and completed the season with an 8–9record, a 4.94ERA, and 71strikeouts in a career-high 149⅓innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{faced the}} Atlanta Braves in the 1996 National League Championship Series. Smith started Game 1 and {{subsequently}} registered three putouts and one {{assist in the}} field, but went <b>hitless</b> in four at-bats in the Cardinals' 4–2 loss. The Cardinals then won Games 2, 3, and 4, contests in which Smith did not appear. Upon receiving the start in Game 5, Smith nearly duplicated his Game 1 performance with four putouts, one assist, and zero hits in four at-bats as part of another Cardinals defeat. The Cardinals also failed to win Game 6 or Game 7 in Atlanta, ending their season. When the Cardinals were trailing by ten runs during Game 7 on October 17, Smith flied out to right field while pinch-hitting in the sixth inning, marking {{the end of his}} playing career. Smith finished his career with distinctions ranging from the accumulation of more than 27.5 million votes in All-Star balloting, to holding the record for the most MLB at-bats without hitting a grand slam.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{were leading}} the Yankees 3–0 {{by the end}} of the inning. The Yankees failed to produce any offense in the fifth inning, but the Cardinals added to their lead by picking up a run when Billy Southworth beat the tag at home {{following}} a Jim Bottomley grounder to second base. Ruether was then replaced by Bob Shawkey, who closed out the inning by yielding two weak infield groundouts. The Yankees picked up one hit in each of the next two innings, but could not produce any runs. Yankees pitcher Myles Thomas came in to pitch a <b>hitless</b> ninth inning. With one out in the top of the ninth inning, Lou Gehrig hit a line drive single into right field, but Lazzeri grounded into a double play, ending the game as a 4–0 Cardinals victory. Haines pitched a complete game shutout, and only gave up five hits total, two of which came from Gehrig.|$|E
5|$|The Mets {{promoted}} deGrom to {{the major}} leagues on May 12, 2014, after Gonzalez Germen {{was placed on the}} disabled list. The Mets planned to use deGrom in relief, but an injury to Dillon Gee required the Mets to insert him into their starting rotation. DeGrom made his major league debut on May 15 against cross-town rival New York Yankees in Citi Field. He faced fellow rookie Chase Whitley, also making his MLB debut. He pitched seven innings, allowing only one run and striking out six, but the Yankees shut out the Mets and won 1–0. DeGrom also collected his first MLB hit in the game in his first career at bat. It was the first hit by a Mets pitcher in the 2014 season ending an 0-for-64 <b>hitless</b> streak, the worst collective mark by a pitching staff to begin a season in MLB history.|$|E
5|$|Vic Lombardi {{replaced}} Behrman {{in the top}} of the sixth. He allowed {{just one}} hit to Dickson, keeping the score 5–1 when Brooklyn came up to bat. Whitman, Galan, and Dixie Walker all grounded out to end the inning. In the top of the seventh, Lombardi allowed two walks, then Dusak hit a sacrifice bunt, after which Lombardi was replaced by Higbe. Marion hit a sacrifice bunt as well, which allowed Kurowski to score. Higbe quickly got the third out, and the Dodgers again went <b>hitless</b> in the seventh, making the score 6–1 at the end of seven innings. In the top of the eighth, Dickson struck out, while Red Schoendienst singled and Moore doubled. Musial was intentionally walked to load the bases, and Kurowski singled, allowing two baserunners to score and making the game 8–1 in favor of the Cardinals. After another walk, Higbe was replaced on the pitcher's mound by Rube Melton, who got the final two outs of the inning.|$|E
5|$|On July 19, after a 21 at-bat <b>hitless</b> streak, Bonds hit 2 home runs, numbers 752 and 753, {{against the}} Chicago Cubs. He went 3–3 with 2 home runs, 6 RBIs, and {{a walk on}} that day. The {{struggling}} last place Giants still lost the game, 9–8. On July 27, Bonds hit home run 754 against Florida Marlins pitcher Rick VandenHurk. Bonds was then walked his next 4 at-bats in the game, but a 2-run shot helped the Giants win the game 12–10. It {{marked the first time}} since he had hit #747 that Bonds had homered in a game the Giants won. On August 4, Bonds hit a 382foot(116m) home run against Clay Hensley of the San Diego Padres for home run number 755, tying Hank Aaron's all-time record. Bonds greeted his son, Nikolai, with an extended bear hug after crossing home plate. Bonds greeted his teammates and then his wife, Liz Watson, and daughter Aisha Lynn behind the backstop. Hensley was the 445th different pitcher to give up a home run to Bonds. Ironically, given the cloud of suspicion that surrounded Bonds, the tying home run was hit off a pitcher who had been suspended by baseball in 2005 for steroid use. He was walked in his next at bat and eventually scored on a fielder's choice.|$|E
5|$|Henderson had 468 more {{stolen bases}} {{in his career}} than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most {{prolific}} basestealer. In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League. In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he {{led the league in}} steals every season except 1987, when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury, allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader. However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history. (Tim Raines ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at 84%.) On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was <b>hitless</b> in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signalling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, Gehrig went <b>hitless</b> {{against the}} Washington Senators. He had just played his 2,130th {{consecutive}} major league game.|$|E
25|$|In the ALDS, Hamilton's {{first hit}} {{was a single}} in Game 3. This ended his postseason <b>hitless</b> streak at 31 at-bats, which tied for second all time.|$|E
25|$|Hayes {{made his}} major league debut with the Athletics on September 21, 1933, {{at the age}} of 18, making him the {{youngest}} player in the league at the time. He was <b>hitless</b> in five at bats that season.|$|E
25|$|On September 26, 2009, Ichiro was {{ejected from}} {{a game for}} the first time in his {{professional}} career. Arguing that a strikeout pitch from Toronto's David Purcey had been outside, Ichiro used his bat to draw a line on the outer edge of the plate, and was immediately tossed by umpire Brian Runge. He was the only Mariner to be ejected from a game all season. The ejection may have hurt Ichiro's chances regarding an esoteric record: the longest playing streak without going <b>hitless</b> in consecutive games. Ichiro's stretch was at 180 games, the longest in the majors since Doc Cramer went 191 consecutive games without back-to-back 0-fers in 1934–35. Ichiro went <b>hitless</b> in the following afternoon's game.|$|E
25|$|With the Mets, on April 10, 2005, at Turner Field, Martínez outdueled John Smoltz, {{pitching}} a two-hit, one-run, complete game {{en route to}} his first Mets victory. On August 14, 2005, against the Dodgers, he pitched 7 <b>hitless</b> innings, but ended up losing the no-hitter and the game.|$|E
25|$|On June 12, Carlos Peña hit a {{home run}} for the sixth {{consecutive}} game. This broke the team record for homers in consecutive games, set by Jose Canseco, who went deep in five straight games during the 1999 season. Peña's streak was snapped the next day, going <b>hitless</b> in four at-bats. Peña had been struggling throughout the season offensively, and some called for him to be benched as recently as the week prior.|$|E
25|$|In {{the top of}} {{the tenth}} inning, Norimoto drew a lead off walk from Yomiuri {{reliever}} Kentaro Nishimura. He went on to reach second base on a sacrifice bunt by Takero Okajima. Next, Kazuya Fujita was hit in the calf with a pitch and took first base. Rakuten then took the lead with a single from Ginji Akaminai. On Akaminai's single, Fujita went from first to third but was then taken out and replaced by pinch runner Toshihito Abe. Abe then scored on Andruw Jones' infield single giving the Eagles an insurance run. Norimoto pitched a <b>hitless</b> bottom half of the inning to win the game.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Lee {{held the}} Monarchs <b>hitless</b> {{through the first}} four innings, and to one hit through seven. With two outs {{in the bottom of}} the eighth, the Monarchs offense finally came alive, when Johnston singled to right, and McNair reached on an error by Carr. Allen then singled to right, driving in Johnston to take a 1–0 lead. Hilldale responded in the top of the ninth, when Cockrell, pinch hitting for Lee, reached base with a one-out walk. Briggs {{followed}} with a single to left, and Warfield grounded to shortstop, forcing Briggs at second. With two outs, Carr singled to right, scoring Cockrell and tying the game.|$|E
25|$|June 8, 2012 – After {{pitching}} {{the first}} no-hitter in Mets history {{in his previous}} start, Johan Santana gives up a career-worst four home runs to the Yankees in the first Subway Series {{game of the year}} as the Mets, who were held <b>hitless</b> by Hiroki Kuroda until the sixth, lose 9-1. Two days later, after Rafael Soriano blew his first save of the year by surrendering an RBI double to Ike Davis {{in the top of the}} ninth, Russell Martin hit a home-run in the bottom of the inning off of Jon Rauch to give the Yankees a 5-4 win and first-ever sweep of the Mets at the new Yankee Stadium.|$|E
25|$|The student-teacher {{relationship}} gradually {{changed to}} one of jealous rivals. Cobb was unpopular with his teammates, and as he became the biggest star in baseball, Crawford was unhappy with the preferential treatment given Cobb. Cobb was allowed to report late for spring training and given private quarters on the road – privileges not offered to Crawford. The competition between the two was intense. Crawford recalled that, if he went three for four {{on a day when}} Cobb went <b>hitless,</b> Cobb would turn red and sometimes walk out of the park with the game still on. When it was initially (and erroneously) reported that Nap Lajoie had won the batting title, Crawford was alleged to have been one of several Tigers who sent a telegram to Lajoie congratulating him on beating Cobb.|$|E
25|$|On October 11, 1999, in Game 5 of the ALDS, Charles Nagy {{started for}} Cleveland and Bret Saberhagen started for Boston, both on {{only three days}} rest. Boston jumped out to a quick two-run lead {{in the top of}} the first inning, but Cleveland responded with three runs of their own in the bottom half of the innings. The hitting continued, {{knocking}} Saberhagen out of the game in the second inning having allowed five runs, and then Nagy out of the game after only finishing only three innings and allowing eight runs. Going into the fourth inning, manager Jimy Williams opted to replace Derek Lowe with the ailing Pedro Martínez, who had left Game 1 with a back injury. This decision would prove to be wise, as Martínez threw six <b>hitless</b> innings in relief to win and clinch the ALDS.|$|E
25|$|The Dodgers {{were shut}} out 3–0 by the St. Louis Cardinals at Busch Stadium on May 29 as John Lackey struck out nine in seven innings. This {{was the fourth}} {{straight}} road game that the Dodgers were shut out (the longest streak in franchise history), and they fell out of first place {{for the first time}} since April 15. Michael Wacha held the Dodgers <b>hitless</b> through five innings in the next game, extending the Dodgers' road scoreless innings streak to a franchise-record 42 innings, breaking the mark previously set by the 1908 Brooklyn Superbas. They finally scored in the sixth inning, with a three-run homer by Yasmani Grandal. Carlos Frias allowed only one unearned run in a career-high seven innings, as the Dodgers won 5–1. The team struggled on offense again the next day, managing only two hits in a 3–1 loss to the Cardinals to wrap up the month of May.|$|E
25|$|On April 29, 2008, in a 3–2 road {{win over}} the San Francisco Giants, Tulowitzki tore a left {{quadriceps}} tendon during a defensive play in the first inning. He wasn't originally {{in the starting lineup}} for the game; however, he was put in at the last minute after utility player Jeff Baker broke a blood vessel in his throwing hand during pregame warmups. On June 11, Tulowitzki played his first rehab game since the injury, as he started at shortstop in a minor league game for the Modesto Nuts – a high-A affiliate of the Colorado Rockies. He returned to the Rockies, starting at shortstop, on June 20, in a 7–2 home loss against the New York Mets. Tulowitzki went <b>hitless</b> in four at-bats and committed no fielding errors in the game. Colorado optioned second baseman Doug Bernier (who made his MLB debut with the team on June 17) to Triple-A before the game in order to open a roster spot for Tulowitzki.|$|E
25|$|Beginning on March 4, the Longhorn {{posted a}} career best 24.2 {{consecutive}} <b>hitless</b> innings when she surrendered a first-inning hit to the Evansville Purple Aces {{to open a}} three-game series before shutting them down {{for the rest of}} the game. The next day, Osterman threw the final 1.2 innings by striking out all batters faced in an eventual win for the Aces. On March 9, Osterman struck out her 1,200th batter to tie Lisa Ishikawa of Northwestern University for 10th place on the NCAA all-time strikeout list; the victory was also her sixth career perfect game, breaking the record originally set by Debbie Doom. On March 11, she moved past Ishikawa and passed Jocelyn Forest of the University of California, Berkeley to take ninth place with a second consecutive no-hitter against the UTEP Miners. Finally, on March 14, Osterman came on in relief vs. the UCLA Bruins and retired the first five batters before the streak ended with a sixth-inning leadoff single. Overall, Osterman allowed only two walks and struck out 64 batters in four wins over 5 games during the streak.|$|E
25|$|On May 5, 1978, Rose {{became the}} 13th player {{in major league}} history to collect his 3,000th career hit, with a single off Montreal Expos pitcher Steve Rogers. On June 14 in Cincinnati, Rose singled {{in the first inning}} off Cubs pitcher Dave Roberts; Rose would proceed to get a hit in every game he played until August 1, making a run at Joe DiMaggio's record 56-game hitting streak, which had stood {{virtually}} unchallenged for 37 years. The streak started quietly, but by the time it had reached 30 games, the media took notice and a pool of reporters accompanied Rose and the Reds to every game. On July 19 against the Philadelphia Phillies, Rose was <b>hitless</b> going into the ninth with his team trailing. He ended up walking in the eighth inning and the streak appeared over. But the Reds managed to bat through their entire lineup, giving Rose another chance to bat in the ninth inning. Facing Ron Reed, Rose laid down a perfect bunt single to extend the streak to 32 games.|$|E
25|$|Eduardo Rodríguez tossed 4 <b>hitless</b> innings {{before he}} was pulled with left {{hamstring}} tightness. Matt Barnes took over and carried the combined no-hitter into seventh, which was broken up by Steve Pearce. The Orioles eventually tied the game at three in that inning. With his second home run of the night, the first giving Boston a 3–0 lead in the fifth, Mookie Betts put the Red Sox up in front for good, scoring David Ortiz and driving in all five runs for his team. Betts became the 13th Red Sox player with back-to-back multiple home run games and the first after David Ortiz in 2014 against the Twins in Minneapolis. In a rain-shortened six inning affair, David Price pitched his second complete game of the season, allowing one run on four hits. Jackie Bradley Jr. drove in four of Boston's eight runs, including his 20th home run of the season. Sandy León also went deep with a blast onto Eutaw Street. With the win, the Red Sox put the Orioles to third place in the AL East for the first this season and are one game behind the division leading Blue Jays.|$|E
25|$|Injuries and {{ineffective}} play by several bench players caused the Brewers to make several roster moves {{during the month}} of May. Mike Rivera returned from the disabled list on May 14 as Carlos Corporán was returned to the minors; Corporan appeared in only one game, where he caught the last two innings of a 15–3 blowout of the Cincinnati Reds on May 6 and singled off of regular Cincinnati shortstop Paul Janish in his only at-bat. The team suffered a significant setback on May 18 when starting second baseman Rickie Weeks suffered an injury to his left wrist, ending his 2009 season. For the time being, Craig Counsell and Casey McGehee are expected to replace Weeks in the lineup; Hernán Iribarren was called up from Nashville following the injury, but was returned to Nashville after only one series. Brad Nelson, who went <b>hitless</b> in 21 at-bats, declined a demotion to the minor leagues and became a free agent on May 15; top third base prospect Mat Gamel was called up to replace Nelson on the roster. On May 21, the Brewers traded Triple-A outfielder Tony Gwynn, Jr. to the San Diego Padres in exchange for outfielder Jody Gerut; Chris Duffy was demoted to Nashville to make room on the roster for Gerut. Finally, on May 21 the team called up outfielder Frank Catalanotto, who had been signed to a minor league contract by the team earlier in the month.|$|E
