40|$|For a long time, the {{traditional}} pattern of urban-rural <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> {{has been shaped}} {{in reference to the}} existence of the urban-rural dual structure. In this paper, we put forward the notion of triaxiality of <b>human</b> <b>settlements,</b> and used the standards conversion entropy weight method to measure and calculate degrees of livability of <b>human</b> <b>settlements,</b> so as to prove the existence of triaxiality of <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> within the same unit at the micro-scale level, and conduct an empirical study on the spatial-temporal evolution, system attributes and formation mechanisms of the triaxiality of <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> in 10 districts (counties) of Dalian (Years 2002 – 2011). Results showed that: (1) Spatial evolution of <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> presents triaxiality. Administrative divisions do not play a full and predominant role in the unit division of <b>human</b> <b>settlements.</b> The number of distribution districts (counties) within different units of <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> tends to be balanced, there is spatial variation of tertiary units in the <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> of Dalian, and the transition area of <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> occupies the leading position in the unit division of human settlements; (2) <b>Human</b> <b>settlements</b> also exhibit triaxiality at different development stages during the period of evolution. The fluctuation changes of degrees of livability of the <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> of Dalian within the past 10 years have been relatively stable, with a trend of small scale decline and obvious manifestations of stage differences; (3) The system attributive characters of <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> presents triaxiality. There also exists differentiations of system and area in <b>human</b> <b>settlements</b> within the same unit; (4) Industrialization and urbanization have led to the collapse of part of the urban-rural dual structure, while the differentiation of ternary structure of the economic and social structure, and living environment and life style leads to the triaxiality of <b>human</b> <b>settlements...</b>|$|R

5|$|Historically part of Lancashire, Eccles grew {{up around}} the 13th century Parish Church of St Mary. Evidence of pre-historic <b>human</b> <b>settlement</b> has been {{discovered}} locally but the area was predominantly agricultural until the Industrial Revolution, when a textile industry {{was established in the}} town.

5|$|<b>Human</b> <b>settlement</b> in {{the area}} dates back to before the Iron Age.
