50|$|One {{important}} question of VVPAT systems is when should an audit be performed? Some {{have suggested that}} random audits of <b>direct</b> <b>recording</b> electronic voting machines be performed on Election Day to protect against machine malfunction. However, the partial tallying of votes before the polls have closed could create a problem similar to the occurrence in American national elections where a winner is declared based on East Coast results long before polls have closed on the West Coast. In addition, the partial tallying of votes before the polls have closed may be illegal in some jurisdictions.
