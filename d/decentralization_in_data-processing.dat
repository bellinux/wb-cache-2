40|$|Author for {{correspondence}} Management Control and R&D <b>Decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Multinational Corporations We analyze R&D <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> {{multinational corporations}} from a management control theory perspective. For international R&D within MNCs, this theory predicts that decentralization will {{be associated with}} research intensity in the subsidiary, lower interdependencies with other units, information asymmetry, and personnel controls such as rotation and transfer. We test this using questionnaire survey data elicited from heads of 138 R&D subsidiaries of MNCs located in Austria. We find support for hypothesized effects of research intensity, interdependencies and information asymmetry. However, the result for personnel controls is negative and significant, contradicting management control logic and implying that R&D <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> MNCs can be achieved through results-based mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{general purpose}} of this study is to {{thoroughly}} examine <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> education according to the literature and previous research, and to discuss the applicability of educational <b>decentralization</b> practices <b>in</b> Turkey. The literature was reviewed for the study and findings reported. It has been observed that <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> education practices were realized in many countries after the 1980 ’s. It is obvious that the educational system in Turkey has difficulty in meeting the needs, and encounters many problems due to its present centralist state. Educational decentralization can provide effective solutions for stakeholder engagement, educational financing and for problems in decision making and operation within the education system. However, the present state of local governments, the legal framework, geographical, cultural and social features indicate that Turkey’s conditions are not ready for <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> education. A <b>decentralization</b> model realized <b>in</b> the long run according to Turkey’s conditions, and as a result of a social consensus, can help resolve the problems of the Turkish education system...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fiscal <b>Decentralization</b> (FD) <b>in</b> {{many cases}} is {{encouraged}} {{as a strong}} means of improving the efficiency and equity {{in the provision of}} public goods, such as healthcare services. This issue has urged the researchers to experimentally examine the relationship between fiscal decentralization indicators and health outcomes. In this study we examine the effect of Fiscal <b>Decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Medical Universities (FDMU) and Fiscal <b>Decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Provincial Revenues (FDPR) on Under-Five Mortality Rate (U 5 M) in provinces of Iran over the period between 2007 and 2010. Methods: We employed panel data methods in this article. The results of the Pesaran CD test demonstrated that most of the variables used in the analysis were cross-sectionally dependent. The Hausman test results suggested that fixed-effects were more appropriate to estimate our model. We estimated the fixed-effect model by using Driscoll-Kraay standard errors as a remedy for cross-sectional dependency. Results: According to the findings of this research, fiscal <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> the health sector had a negative impact on U 5 M. On the other hand, fiscal <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> provincial revenues had a positive impact on U 5 M. In addition, U 5 M had a negative association with the density of physicians, hospital beds, and provincial GDP per capita, but a positive relationship with Gini coefficient and unemployment. Conclusion: The findings of our study indicated that fiscal decentralization should be emphasized in the health sector. The results suggest the need for caution in the implementation of fiscal <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> provincial revenues...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{discussing}} {{the practice of}} <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> public adminis-tration in Hong Kong. The operationalization of <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> the public sector will be analyzed {{in the light of}} the political context in Hong Kong. As Hong Kong is undergoing political transition from a British colony to a Special Administrative Region under sovereignty of Communist China <b>in</b> 1997, <b>decentralization</b> of the public sector is not only a pure administrative matter, but a political issue as well. <b>Decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Hong Kong’s public sector has attained some fruits of success, as indicated by the efficient use of trading funds, the effective operation of Non-Departmental Public Bodies, and the minimization of cost of services. Hence, the efficiency and effectiveness brought about by <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> the public sector in Hong Kong is certainly positive. Yet decentralization brings about wider political implications for the smooth transition in Hong Kong before and after 1997. It leads to the concerns of the decreasing commitment of the government at the end of the colonial adminis-tration, social injustice and disorder, as well as declining morale and stability of the civil service. Thus decentralization of the public sector in Hong Kong should take a cautious approach without neglecting the political implications. In the final analysis, a simplistic approach towards <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> the light of administrative efficiency and effectiveness could result in a failure, or even a disaster in the case of Hong Kong.

40|$|Neoliberal {{reforms have}} {{promoted}} privatization and decentralization as strategies to improve equity, efficiency, {{and the quality}} of health services. In this piece the impact of these reforms in Latin America is critically analyzed, and the impacts of privatization in Colombia and of <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Mexico are detailed. These two cases show that after 10 years of privatization in Colombia and 20 years of <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Mexico the reforms have had the opposite of the desired effect: They have not improved equity, have increased health expenditures, have not increased efficiency, and have not shown a positive impact on quality. Public health programs in Colombia have deteriorated, while <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Mexico has had a very high cost, without achieving the proposed objectives. It is officially accepted that <b>decentralization</b> <b>in</b> Mexico has increased inequity, and that new reforms implemented in 2003 promote vertical programs. Health systems based on regulated competition are not the most suitable ones for Latin America. Latin American countries should improve their health systems in line with the principles stated in the Declaration of Alma Ata and according to their own national experiences...|$|R
