40|$|In dairy industry, whey protein {{fractionation}} is {{an important}} process that requires an effective method to separate valuable proteins in bovine whey protein. Bovine whey protein {{can be divided into}} two components which are major protein and minor proteins. The major protein contains approximately 50 % of β-lactoglobulin (β-Lg), 20 % of α-lactalbumin (α-Lac), 10 % of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 10 % of immunoglobulin (Ig). Cation exchange and anion exchange chromatography is one of advance separation techniques that can fractionate bovine whey protein. All negatively charged proteins in whey were bound simultaneously to an anion exchange column (Q-Sepharose), while all positively charged proteins in whey were bound to a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose). Whey protein and <b>buffer</b> <b>solution</b> (pH 4 - pH 10) were prepared before run the experiment. The method is based on the use of an ionic column and salt gradient <b>elution</b> <b>buffer</b> (<b>Buffer</b> <b>solution</b> plus 1 M NaCl). The collected fractions were analyzing using SDS-PAGE to determine which fractions that contain protein component. By using UPLC the concentration of protein exists in the fraction had been determined. Protein fractionation at pH 7 gives the best result with highest concentration of protein recover by using Q-Sepharose. While, by using SP-Sepharose show pure β-Lg can be fractionate at pH 5...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{radial flow}} {{chromatography}} (CRFC) combines radial flow and rotating annular bed chromatography. Solution flows radially from eight fixed ports around the periphery through a rotating annular packed bed towards the axis. Loading, equilibration, elution and reequilibration solutions {{can be applied}} simultaneously at different feed ports. Protein is captured on resin in the loading zone and carried around by the annulus to the elution zone to be eluted, making the CRFC a continuous process. Small axial flow columns experiments were carried out to represent continuous BSA purification in the CRFC {{for a range of}} rotation speeds, flow rates, feed concentration, <b>elution</b> <b>buffer</b> concentration, loading sections and elution secions. Quality of the separation was measured based on productivity and height to width ratio. Best operating conditions for BSA purification in the CRFC include 720 deg/hr rotation speed, 1 mL/min flow rate, 1 M <b>elution</b> <b>buffer</b> (NaCl) <b>solution,</b> and either 5 or 1. 5 mg/mL feed solution. A wide range of loading sections and elution sections can be allocated. Combinations of these best conditions are restricted by total protein load per chromatography cycle. Mathematical models solved by finite difference method in Matlab were used to predict CRFC operation under the best conditions. Model accounts for change in solute concentration by convection, film diffusion and uptake into resin. Protein and salt parameters were adjusted to achieve best mached protein peaks. Model simulations agreed well with experimental results. Loading peak width was similar but experimental data showed broader elution peaks. Elution peak height for all simulations was greater while loading peak height were more variable than in the experiments. Peak tailing was observed in both experimental and model data...|$|R

Metallothionein was separated into isoproteins on a gel-permeation column by <b>elution</b> with alkaline <b>buffer</b> <b>solution,</b> the separation being due to the dissociation of hydroxy groups in the gel material.

The replacement with Cu 2 + accompanied intramolecular oxidation of thiol groups in metallothioneins and the oxidized metallothioneins showed different chromatographic properties from the original ones, probably due to {{changes in the}} isoelectric points.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a combined {{investigation of the}} salivary and MUC 5 B films structure and topography in conditions {{similar to those found}} in the oral cavity in terms of ionic strength, pH, and protein concentration. AFM and ellipsometry were successfully used to give a detailed picture of the film structure and topography both on hydrophilic and on hydrophobic substrata. Regardless of the substrata, the salivary film can be described as having a two sublayer structure in which an inner dense layer is decorated by large aggregates. However, the shape and height of these larger aggregates largely depend on the type of substrata used. Additionally, we show that the adsorption of MUC 5 B is controlled by the type of substrata and the MUC 5 B film topography {{is similar to that of}} the larger aggregates present in the salivary films, especially on hydrophobic substrates. Therefore, we conclude that MUC 5 B is a major component in the salivary film when formed on hydrophobic substrates. Furthermore, we studied how resistant the salivary and MUC 5 B films are against elutability by buffer rinsing and addition of SDS solution. We conclude that the adsorbed proteins contain fractions with varying binding strengths to the two types of surfaces. Specifically, we have shown that the large MUC 5 B biomacromolecules on the hydrophobic substrates are especially resistant to both <b>elution</b> with <b>buffer</b> <b>solution</b> and SDS. Therefore, these large mucins can be responsible for the increased resistance of HWS films on hydrophobic substrates and can protect the intraoral surfaces against surface-active components present in oral health care products...|$|R

Prolamin was the richest protein fraction although very poor in haemagglutinating activity. Basic glutelin was far the less interesting fraction for lectin activity and protein content, even though this fraction contains considerable amounts of carbohydrates. Lectin was present in all protein fractions as estimated by haemagglutinating assays but basic glutelins were almost devoid of lectin activity. Except for prolamins, protein bands were detected by SDS-PAGE in all other fractions. Western blot using digoxigenin labelled Con A revealed a single band in the albumin, globulin, acidic and basic glutelin fractions, which specifically interacted with ConA.
