In particular, there is strong interest in replacing conventional 390 - 440 MPa grade steel sheets used for structural and chassis parts with higher strength grades offering sufficient formability. TRIP steel, in which a small portion of austenite remains in the ferritic-bainitic basic matrix, is one of the candidate materials for 590 - 780 MPa grade <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> with superior formability. The excellent mechanical properties exhibited by transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) steels are mainly due to the martensitic transformation of the metastable retained austenite induced by strain.

Mechanical properties were determined by uniaxial tensile tests and were correlated to the steel microstructures. Tensile tests up to fracture were performed to analyse the relation between the different strain hardening behaviours and the transformation of retained austenite into martensite during deformation. Specimens for the metallographic microstructure investigations were conventionally prepared and conventional etchants such as Le Pera were used as well as a two-step etching starting with nital and then sodium metabisulfite.
