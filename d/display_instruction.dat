40|$|Displays of eye {{movements}} may convey {{information about}} cognitive processes but require interpretation. We investigated whether participants {{were able to}} interpret displays of their own or others' eye movements. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants observed an image under three different viewing instructions. Then they were shown static or dynamic gaze displays and had to judge whether it was their own or someone else's eye movements and what instruction was reflected. Participants were capable of recognizing the instruction reflected in their own and someone else's gaze <b>display.</b> <b>Instruction</b> recognition was better for dynamic displays, and only this condition yielded above chance performance in recognizing the display as one's own or another person's (Experiments 1 and 2). Experiment 3 revealed that order information in the gaze displays facilitated instruction recognition when transitions between fixated regions distinguish one viewing instruction from another. Implications of these findings are discussed...|$|E

Smart TV sets (requirement # 2) could be treated analogously, but the 3 D technologies that {{are becoming more and more}} common both on TVs and gaming consoles could be exploited to provide more involving, innovative configuration experiences: configuration could take place by inviting users to interact with 3 D entities – maybe humanized animals or appliance avatars – instead of merely navigating through classic, tedious dialogs or on-screen <b>display</b> <b>instruction.</b> The wizard could also exploit the natural language, exploiting voice recognition and text-to-speech systems to talk to the user, making the system more accessible to visually-impaired or elderly people in the Assisted Living perspective.

50|$|The Display List and {{the display}} data are written into RAM by the CPU. ANTIC reads the <b>Display</b> List <b>instructions,</b> screen memory, and {{character}} set information from RAM using a technique known as {{direct memory access}} (DMA). A BASIC or 6502 machine language program's job is to initialize the display—set up the <b>Display</b> List <b>instructions,</b> organize screen memory (and character set if applicable), and then direct ANTIC to start the display. After this, ANTIC automatically takes care of generating the screen display. This powerful design allows the Atari 8-bit computers to produce complex, mixed-mode displays without direct CPU intervention while other platforms, even those designed much later, cannot either mix graphics modes in one display, or do so without direct, complex CPU interrupts.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{describe}} a software package that can be used for performing such routine tasks as controlling listening experiments (e. g., simple labeling, discrimination, sentence intelligibility, and magnitude estimation), recording responses and response latencies, analyzing and plotting the results of those experiments, <b>displaying</b> <b>instructions,</b> and making scripted audio-recordings. The software runs under Windows and is controlled by creating text files that allow the experimenter to specify key features of the experiment such as the stimuli that are to be presented, the randomization scheme, interstimulus and intertrial intervals, the format of the output file, and the layout of response alternatives on the screen. Although the software was developed primarily with speech-percep-tion and psychoacoustics research in mind, it has uses in other areas as well, such as written or auditory word recognition, written or auditory sentence processing, and visual perception.

40|$|In {{numerous}} psychological experiments, participants classify stimuli {{by pressing}} response keys. According to Lakens, Schneider, Jostmann, and Schubert (2011), classification performance {{is affected by}} physical distance between response keys – indicating a cognitive tendency to represent categories in spatial code. However, previous evidence for a key distance effect (KDE) from a color-naming Stroop task is inconclusive as to whether: (a) key separation automatically leads to an internal spatial representation of non-spatial stimulus characteristics in participants, or if the KDE rather depends on physical spatial characteristics of the stimulus configuration; (b) the KDE attenuates the Stroop interference effect. We therefore first adopted the original Stroop task in Experiment 1, confirming that wider key distance facilitated responses, but did not modulate the Stroop effect as was previously found. In Experiments 2 and 3 we controlled potential mediator variables in the original design. When we did not <b>display</b> <b>instructions</b> about stimulus-response mappings, thereby removing the unintended spatial context from the Stroop stimuli, no KDE emerged. Presenting the instructions at a central position in Experiment 4 confirmed that key separation alone is not sufficient for a KDE, but correspondence between spatial configurations of stimuli and responses is also necessary. Evidence indicates that the KDE on Stroop performance is due to known mechanisms of stimulus-response compatibility and response discriminability. The KDE does, however, not demonstrate a general disposition to represent any stimulus in spatial code...|$|R

This emerges the need for automation in parking systems. In the “AUTOMATED MULTI-STOREYED CIRCULAR PARKING SYSTEM ” we are mainly concerned with the ameliorations in the fields of car parking systems. This system includes a multi-storeyed building for parking cars which can be constructed above as well as below the ground level. Each floor of this building is drawn into concentric circular rings containing parking slots. The inner and outer ring of slots is connected by means of a rectangular plate which revolves between the two circular rings of slots. A slider will be mounted on this rectangular plate which will lift the car from the elevator and park it in the parking slot and vice versa. The position of rectangular plate is controlled with help of mechanical switches. The whole mechanism will be controlled by microcontroller 8051. For the safety of cars, scratch card and password verification systems are used. A magnetic card will be used as a scratch card and an optocoupler will constitute the card detection system.

40|$|While {{living and}} working in todays {{high-tech}} world, the ability to perform tasks and understand the system structure of technology may affect our lives in many ways. For example, calibrating a medical device such as a blood glucose meter may be infrequently performed but adequate knowledge of the system structure may be critical for doing it correctly. This and other forms of technology vary in complexity and require training for proper use. Due to age-related differences in skill acquisition, the design of proper training may be especially important for older adults when learning to use new technology. One factor to consider when developing age-specific training is the type of information presented during training. In general, little research has addressed the effect of information type on the development of an understanding of the system structure and fewer have examined the influence of age. The current study compared the effects of emphasizing actions or concepts during training on performance on multiple measures of learning. Participants completed one of two tutorials for operating a computer-simulated hydroponic garden control. One tutorial presented participants with instructions that focused specific actions to operate the system. The other tutorial <b>displayed</b> <b>instructions</b> that focused on generalized system concepts. At test, overall participants in the concept training condition were faster and more accurate than those in the action training condition for both novel and familiar tasks. Concept training also reduced age-related differences in performance. Results suggest that concept training may lead {{to the development of a}} better understanding of the system structure. M. S.
