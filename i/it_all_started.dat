What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> with Stonewall.|$|E

25|$|Till 2008 {{there was}} no system of {{preference}} of state cadre by the candidates; the candidates, if not placed in the insider vacancy of their home states, were allotted to different states in alphabetic order of the roster, beginning with the letters A, H, M, T for that particular year. For example, if in a particular year the roster begins from 'A', which means the first candidate on the roster {{will go to the}} Andhra Pradesh state cadre of IAS, the next one to Bihar, and subsequently to Chhatisgarh, Gujarat and so on in alphabetical order. The next year the roster starts from 'H', for either Haryana or Himachal Pradesh (if it has started from Haryana on the previous occasion when <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> from 'H', then this time it would start from Himachal Pradesh). This highly intricate system, in vogue since the mid-1980s, had ensured that officers from different states are placed all over India.|$|E

500|$|Bowie's love {{of acting}} led his total {{immersion}} in the characters he created for his music. [...] "Offstage I'm a robot. Onstage I achieve emotion. It's probably why I prefer dressing up as Ziggy to being David." [...] With satisfaction came severe personal difficulties: acting {{the same role}} over an extended period, it became {{impossible for him to}} separate Ziggy Stardust—and, later, the Thin White Duke—from his own character offstage. Ziggy, Bowie said, [...] "wouldn't leave me alone for years. That was when <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> to go sour... My whole personality was affected. It became very dangerous. I really did have doubts about my sanity." [...] His later Ziggy shows, which included songs from both Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, were ultra-theatrical affairs filled with shocking stage moments, such as Bowie stripping down to a sumo wrestling loincloth or simulating oral sex with Ronson's guitar. Bowie toured and gave press conferences as Ziggy before a dramatic and abrupt on-stage [...] "retirement" [...] at London's Hammersmith Odeon on 3 July 1973. Footage from the final show was released the same year for the film Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars.|$|E

The team finished second in the Western Conference with a [...] record. With the national teammates' presence on the team, the Sounders sold out nine of their ten home matches at the 4,500 capacity Starfire Stadium.

500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you get to know the person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> coming out, melodies and everything...

500|$|Rhodes {{gave him}} 48 hours {{to decide whether}} he wanted to join the new band that would [...] "rival the Pistols". Within 24 hours, Strummer agreed. Simonon later remarked, [...] "Once we had Joe on board <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> to come together." [...] Strummer {{introduced}} the band to his old school friend Pablo LaBritain, who sat in on drums during Strummer's first few rehearsals with the group. LaBritain's stint with the band {{did not last long}} (he subsequently joined 999), and Terry Chimes—whom Jones later referred to as [...] "one of the best drummers" [...] in their circle—became the band's regular drummer. In Westway to the World, Jones also says, [...] "I don't think Terry was officially hired or anything. He had just been playing with us." [...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives. He later explained the name's origin: [...] "It really came to my head when I started reading the newspapers and a word that kept recurring was the word 'clash', so I thought 'the Clash, what about that,' to the others. And they and Bernard, they went for it." ...|$|E

500|$|After his 2010 {{debut album}} Doo-Wops & Hooligans, which {{produced}} the singles [...] "Just the Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Grenade", Bruno Mars revealed {{he wanted to}} create something unexpected with its follow-up. [...] "This is me going into the studio and recording and writing whatever I want," [...] Mars said confidently. [...] "This album represents my freedom." [...] <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> backstage, after a show, during a jamming session in a [...] "greenroom", while singing the phrase [...] "Locked Out of Heaven". According to Philip Lawrence, the track developed a meaning as they started to write it, [...] "when you’re with someone who’s showing you {{a new way to}} love." [...] The Smeezingtons went to New York to work with Jeff Bhasker, Emile Haynie and Mark Ronson and during a jamming session with drums, bass, and guitar, Mars created the riff of the song. He started singing the chorus previously created {{on the top of the}} riff. Then, The Smeezingtons went back to L.A., where they finished the lyrics and changed the original melody. Lawrence felt that the recording was [...] "sort of empty but it had a carnal vibe to it", making them enthusiastic to place a [...] "driving rhythm" [...] in it. The composer recalled thinking it was [...] "something special" [...] in the studio, the same way he did during the creation of [...] "Just The Way You Are" [...] and [...] "Billionaire".|$|E

Freeman asked Hancock many searching questions about his life and work. Hancock, who deeply admired his interviewer, often appeared uncomfortable with the questions, but answered them frankly and honestly. Hancock had always been highly self-critical, and it is often argued that this interview heightened this tendency, contributing to his later difficulties. According to Roger, his brother, [...] "It was the biggest mistake he ever made. I think <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>started</b> from that really. ...Self-analysis - that was his killer." ...|$|E
