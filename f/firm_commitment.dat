From a sample of 140 Spanish companies, we find that the impact of family character on <b>firm's</b> <b>commitment</b> is not statistically significant and it only increases the positive influence of firm's size...|$|R

25|$|<b>Firm</b> <b>commitment</b> by the Minister of Public Works to {{construction}} of the lighthouse finally came on 29 January 1881, {{after two years of}} assessment. Work commenced at Île de Sein, where the raw materials (stone) were stored. The engineer in charge of overseeing the works, Probestau, set up home on the island. Since the construction of La Vieille followed Ar Men, the team were able to draw on a wealth of experience. Each year on the first of May, workmen would arrive at the island in a small steam-powered boat towing a longboat laden with construction materials, as well as rowboats for landing. Anchorages set up allowed the team to moor the steamboat and longboat.|$|E
25|$|No <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> {{was made}} to the F-111 until the {{publication}} of the 1966 Defence White Paper, although it was the government's preferred option. Following {{the publication of the}} defence review, it was announced that up to 50 F-111s would be procured for the RAF; like the Australian version, these would be highly adapted to suit the unique set of British requirements. The intention was to form an initial four operational squadrons, plus an OCU, with two stationed in the UK and two forming part of the UK's forces East of Suez. The intention was that long-range, land based F-111s would be used to replace the strike capability of the CVA-01 aircraft carriers that were cancelled in the White Paper. Although there was no public announcement as to specific squadrons that would receive the F-111, a document from early 1966 by the AOC-in-C of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir Wallace Kyle, indicated that 12 Squadron (then a Vulcan squadron assigned to the strategic nuclear role), together with the inactive 7, 15 and 40 Squadrons, would receive the aircraft upon their delivery.|$|E
25|$|After the Fall of Acre to the Egyptian Mamluks in 1291, the Franks (a name {{used in the}} Levant for Catholic Europeans) {{who were}} able to do so retreated to the island of Cyprus. It became the {{headquarters}} of the dwindling Kingdom of Jerusalem, and the base of operations for any future military attempts by the Crusaders against the Egyptian Mamluks, who for their part were systematically conquering any last Crusader strongholds on the mainland. Templars in Cyprus included Jacques de Molay and Thibaud Gaudin, their 22nd Grand Master. During a meeting assembled on the island in the autumn of 1291, Molay spoke of reforming the Order and put himself forward {{as an alternative to the}} current Grand Master. Gaudin died around 1292 and, as there were no other serious contenders for the role at the time, Molay was soon elected. In spring 1293, he began a tour of the West to try to muster more support for a reconquest of the Holy Land. Developing relationships with European leaders such as Pope Boniface VIII, Edward I of England, James I of Aragon and Charles II of Naples, Molay's immediate goals were to strengthen the defence of Cyprus and rebuild the Templar forces. From his travels, he was able to secure authorization from some monarchs for the export of supplies to Cyprus, but could obtain no <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> for a new Crusade. There was talk of merging the Templars with one of the other military orders, the Knights Hospitaller. The Grand Masters of both orders opposed such a merger, but pressure increased from the Papacy.|$|E

500|$|In Waters' absence, Gilmour {{had been}} {{recruiting}} musicians {{for a new}} project. Some months previously, keyboard player Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression for what later became [...] "Learning to Fly", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role {{on the development of}} his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was [...] "far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as [...] "mucking about with a lot of demos". At this stage, there was no <b>firm</b> <b>commitment</b> to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the new material might end up on a third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music [...] "doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd". Gilmour later admitted that the new project was difficult without Waters. [...] Gilmour had experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who would be credited as co-writer of [...] "Learning to Fly" [...] and [...] "On the Turning Away". Instead of writing a concept album, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link.
