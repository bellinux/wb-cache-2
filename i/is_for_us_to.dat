25|$|One thing more: at {{the close}} of the Civil War, when the problem of the emancipated slaves was before the nation, it might have left them in a {{condition}} of alienage, or established them as wards of the government, like the Indian tribes, and thus retained for the nation jurisdiction over them, or it might, as it did, give them citizenship. It chose the latter. By the Fourteenth Amendment, it made citizens of all born within the limits of the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. By the Fifteenth, it prohibited any state from denying the right of suffrage on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude, and by the Thirteenth, it forbade slavery or involuntary servitude anywhere within the limits of the land. Whether this was or was not the wiser way to deal with the great problem is not a matter for the courts to consider. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> accept the decision, which declined to constitute them wards of the nation or leave them in a condition of alienage where they would be subject to the jurisdiction of Congress, but gave them citizenship, doubtless believing that thereby, in the long run, their best interests would be subserved, they taking their chances with other citizens in the states where they should make their homes.|$|E

Campbell politely declined, {{and returned with}} his party to Cape Evans to report this development. Scott received the news on , during the first depot-laying expedition. According to Cherry-Garrard, the first reaction of Scott and his party was an urge to rush over to the Bay of Whales and [...] "have it out" [...] with Amundsen. However, Scott recorded the event calmly in his journal. [...] "One thing only fixes itself in my mind.

500|$|The local {{controlling}} council, Tendring District Council, {{are working}} with the residents of Brooklands on improving the area and trying to buy up land to build new housing. Council leader Mick Page stated [...] "The only way we will start anything in Jaywick <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> lead it. We will be the catalyst." [...] The council are proposing to stop the allocation of housing benefit to rented properties in Jaywick by 2017, to discourage rental in poor quality buildings. Former council leader Neil Stock has called Jaywick [...] "an embarrassment to the whole country", blaming planning regulations he believes are draconian. Stock reported around 30 to 40 absentee landlords were renting poor quality accommodation to tenants on benefits without requiring any deposit, adding that [...] "the state is subsidising squalor." [...] Carswell has been critical of the government's response to Jaywick, noting that although the area contained large numbers of unemployed, these were often people who were unable to find work both due to disabilities or a lack of available jobs. He believes the [...] "downward spiral will continue" [...] unless existing planning laws are relaxed and the area has economic investment.|$|E

500|$|The Government of Canada {{disagreed}} with Ontario's ruling {{and announced that}} the decision would be appealed. Falle helped the Crown formulate their case. That November, Falle was a panelist at a debate about the case. At the debate, which was hosted by the Queen's Law and Public Policy Club at Queen's University, Falle said that, whatever {{the outcome of the}} appeal, she was glad that the case was removing the taboos surrounding talking about prostitution. The following June, Falle and more than twelve others intervened in the case, arguing that the laws should be reinstated to protect women from pimps. As part of this anti-prostitution coalition, Falle said that all areas of the sex industry are unsafe, including escort agencies and strip clubs. Falle testified in the lower courts, saying that [...] "the more they say the women are there by choice, the harder it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> convince police, social workers and everyone else that these people are vulnerable." [...] She also said that striking down anti-prostitution laws sends a message to men that it is acceptable to harass women. Falle said that all the applicants in Bedford v. Canadaincluding Terri-Jean Bedford, the dominatrix seeking to have the anti-brothel law struck downentered the sex industry as children. For this reason, Falle argued that neither of these women chose a life of prostitution as a consenting adult; that life had already been chosen for them by the time that they had reached the age of consent. Falle encouraged Canadians to take an interest in Bedford v. Canada because any Canadian girl can become a victim of prostitution.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, apostle Spencer W. Kimball began preaching against racism. In 1972, he said: [...] "Intolerance by church members is despicable. A special problem exists {{with respect to}} black people because they may not now receive the priesthood. Some members of the Church would justify their own un-Christian {{discrimination}} against black people because of that rule {{with respect to the}} priesthood, but while this restriction has been imposed by the Lord, it is not for us to add burdens upon the shoulders of our black brethren. They who have received Christ in faith through authoritative baptism are heirs to the celestial kingdom along with men of all other races. And those who remain faithful to the end may expect that God may finally grant them all blessings they have merited through their righteousness. Such matters are in the Lord's hands. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> extend our love to all." [...] In a study covering 1972 to 1996, church members in the United States has been shown to have lower rates of approval of segregation than others from the United States, as well as a faster decline in approval of segregation over the periods covered, both with statistical significance.|$|E
