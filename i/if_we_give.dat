500|$|Montcalm {{was taken}} aback to learn of the British deployment, and his {{response}} has been regarded as precipitate. Though he might have awaited reinforcement by Bougainville's column (allowing simultaneous frontal and rear attacks on the British position) or avoided battle while he concentrated his forces, or even yielded the city to Wolfe, he instead elected to confront Wolfe's force directly. [...] Had he waited, the British would have been entirely cut off—they {{had nowhere to go}} but back down the Foulon, and would have been under fire the entire way. To an artillery officer named Montbelliard, Montcalm explained his decision thus: [...] "We cannot avoid action; the enemy is entrenching, he already has two pieces of cannon. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> him time to establish himself, we shall never be able to attack him with the troops we have." ...|$|E
500|$|Stevens is {{a proponent}} of using {{statistical}} analysis to enhance his coaching decisions, spending almost as much time looking at statistics as watching game film. [...] "I think it's a unique {{way of looking at}} the game that may be able to help best communicate to your players", he explains. For example, when Butler was slumping in late 2010, Stevens challenged his team: [...] "this [...] is where we are. This isn't acceptable to get to where we want to go. But what does that really mean? It's not just get better defensively, it is, <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> up 3 less baskets a game, then we will be at 40 percent field goal percentage defense which will be top 20 in the country". The team got the message, improved throughout the season, and ultimately went on a March run fueled by defense. In 2012, Stevens became the first college coach to hire someone solely for statistical research when he added Drew Cannon to the staff. If he had the resources, Stevens says he would hire a team of statisticians to analyze the teams play.|$|E
2500|$|But he {{believed}} that the United States may be able to change Iran without using military force: [...] "Iran might fall of its own weight <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> it a little help. We're not doing nearly enough to get communications in there. There are riots ... that are seldom reported, but they're taking place all over the country nowadays. Their inflation is up; unemployment is up." [...] By encouraging the people of Iran and using our intelligence resources {{we may be able to}} help bring about a regime change.|$|E

2500|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Rømer thought that he was measuring : he gives his result as the time of 22minutes for light to travel a distance equal to the diameter of Earth's orbit or, equivalently, 11minutes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth. It can be readily shown that the two measurements are equivalent: <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> τ as the time taken for light to cross the radius of an orbit (e.g. from the Sun to Earth) and P as the orbital period (the time for one complete rotation), then(1) express the orbital velocity in terms of the orbital radius r and the orbital period P: v= (2) substitute τ= [...] →v= (3) rearrange to find [...]|$|E

A cover of [...] "Immigrant Song" [...] by Led Zeppelin, produced by Reznor and Ross, with Karen O (of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs) as the featured singer, accompanied a trailer for the film. Reznor and Ross' second collaboration with Fincher was scored as the film was shot, based on the concept, [...] "What <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> you music the minute you start to edit stuff together?" [...] Reznor explained in 2014 that the composition process was [...] "a lot more work," [...] and that he [...] "would be hesitant to go as far in that direction in the future." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai met Nasser at the 1955 Bandung Conference and was {{impressed}} by him. Zhou recommended that Khrushchev treat Nasser as a potential ally. Zhou described Nasser to Khrushchev as a young nationalist, who though no Communist, could if used correctly do much damage to Western interests in the Middle East. Marshal Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia, who also come to know Nasser at Bandung told Khrushchev in a 1955 meeting that [...] "Nasser {{was a young man}} without much political experience, but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>give</b> him the benefit of the doubt, {{we might be able to}} exert a beneficial influence on him, both for the sake of the Communist movement, and ... the Egyptian people". Traditionally, most of the equipment in the Egyptian military had come from Britain, but Nasser's desire to break British influence in Egypt meant that he was desperate to find a new source of weapons to replace Britain. Nasser had first broached the subject of buying weapons from the Soviet Union in 1954.|$|E
