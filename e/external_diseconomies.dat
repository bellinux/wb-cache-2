Thus the government should play {{a leading role in the}} eco-tourism development to take on necessary intervention and regulation to the eco-tourism. The government must establish eco-tourism planning and strict examination and approval system, must strengthen eco-tourism environmental monitoring, must set up complete macro policies and laws or regulations on the eco-tourism development, must eliminate or weaken the <b>external</b> <b>diseconomy</b> of the eco-tourism and must protect the ecological environment on which eco-tourism relies.

40|$|An {{extensive}} literature {{discusses the}} existence of a virtuous circle of expectations that might lead communities to Pareto-superior states among multiple potential equilibria. It is generally accepted that such multiplicity stems fundamentally from the presence of positive agglomeration externalities. We examine a two-sector model in this class and look for intertemporal perfect foresight equilibria. It turns out that under some plausible conditions, positive externalities must coexist with <b>external</b> <b>diseconomies</b> elsewhere in the model, for there to exist equilibria that break free of historical initial conditions. Our main distinguishing assumption is that the positive agglomeration externalities appear with a time lag (that can be made vanishingly small). Then, in the absence of <b>external</b> <b>diseconomies</b> elsewhere, the long-run behaviour of the economy resembles that predicted by myopic adjustment. This finding is independent of the degree of forward-looking behavior exhibited by the agents. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

This means that a harmonious development in the area of a rational and economic investment activity including traffic infrastructure facilities must inevitably take heed {{of the effects of the}} external economy and <b>external</b> <b>diseconomy.</b> In this the traffic infrastructure facilities develop into the elements of harmonious relationships in the process of the investment activity, which must not and absolutely cannot be unilateral. The complex aspect of viewing both positive and negative effects is a distinctive quality of each and every rational investment activity, because it is an accepted fact that there exists no such activity which yields only positive effects. These investment activities oriented towards traffic infrastructure facilities in the community and business systems must arise from more complex reviews and verified methods for the final effects to incorporate all the elements of a harmonious relationship of positive and negative effects of a concrete investment operation.

40|$|The {{extension}} of adjustment assistance {{to those who}} have suffered trade-related job displacement is widely supported {{on both sides of the}} economics of globalisation debate. The form that such assistance should take, namely wage insurance, is also the subject of wide agreement. Nevertheless, the formal economic rationales offered for such a policy are varied, including political economy arguments, equity arguments and market failure/ex post efficiency arguments. This note proposes an ex ante efficiency-based rationale for the provision of adjustment assistance in the specific form of wage insurance. Job displacement imposes pecuniary externalities on displaced workers, which, in a complete markets setting, induce only shifts along the ex ante Pareto-efficient frontier. However, when markets are incomplete, pecuniary externalities become welfare-relevant. Without the possibility of diversifying or hedging the risk of pecuniary <b>external</b> <b>diseconomies</b> of job displacement using contingent claims, welfare is reduced ex ante. Wage insurance - whether publicly underwritten, privately underwritten (as in Shiller's (2003) 'livelihood insurance'), or supplied on a mixed public/private basis - completes the market for contingent claims, allowing workers to diversify or hedge the risk of trade-related pecuniary <b>external</b> <b>diseconomies.</b> By facilitating risk sharing, wage insurance removes an impediment to ex ante Pareto efficiency. Moreover, wage insurance affects not only post-displacement behaviour by increasing the incentive to reacquire employment quickly, but it also affects pre-displacement consumption and investment behaviour, in particular, lowering the threshold at which workers will be willing to undertake irreversible investment in industry-specific skills.

In the financial crisis, excessively indebted investors hoard the assets hoping for a miraculous rise in their value (risk-shifting behavior), although the asset hoarding hinders the assets from working as media of exchange in the goods trading.

40|$|Pricing {{congested}} facilities above {{marginal production}} cost is a conventional approach to improving resource allocation. Where everyone is producing the same externality, a uniform price (in excess of marginal cost by {{the value of}} the externality) permits the competitive equilibrium to be Pareto optimal. Where individuals give rise to different externalities, but a uniform price is in effect, we have a second-best situation. When demands depend only on price, price should exceed marginal cost by a weighted average of externalities generated, the weights being the price derivatives of demand. When demands also depend on congestion, the optimal price generally diverges from this rule. The price should be lower when the individuals giving large <b>external</b> <b>diseconomies</b> per unit demanded tend to be price insensitive and congestion sensitive in their demands (relative to the average). In this case public expenditures to decrease congestion directly should not be carried {{to the point where the}} marginal direct benefit from congestion reduction equals the marginal cost.
