500|$|Director Terry Gilliam would {{praise the}} film as [...] "a work of genius. It got people to {{understand}} what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's got a shot that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael J. Nelson, the show's head {{writer who}} also plays the {{character}} of the same name, said the staff initially felt strange making jokes at the expense of Rondo Hatton and his real-life illness; however, Nelson said, [...] "Then you realize it's {{the whole point of the}} movie: he's a <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> big ugly face...And he is a terribly bad actor." [...] Paul Chaplin, another writer with the series, said of the actor's acromegaly: [...] "That fact opens up a large, irresolvable issue concerning the movie industry's use of this poor afflicted fellow; he was paid, after all, and movie work is nice work. Yet it can seem exploitative of misfortune." ...|$|E
500|$|According to his colleagues, Hillenburg is [...] "a perfectionist workaholic". He is {{also known}} for his private nature. Julia Pistor, co-producer of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, noted that Hillenburg is [...] "very shy". She went on to say, [...] "He doesn't {{want people to know}} about his life or family. He's just a really funny, down-to-earth <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dry sense of humor who puts his family first and keeps us on our toes in keeping our {{corporate}} integrity." [...] Hillenburg said about himself, [...] "I make animation because I like to draw and create things. I have no real interest to be on camera or to be a celebrity.

500|$|The band {{toured the}} U.S. from April to August 2003, {{including}} Jenny Lewis in the line-up {{for all but}} one of the performances. Lewis provided vocals as well as guitar and keyboards. In the sole performance that Lewis missed, a festival in Spain, friend Joan Hiller sang and Chris Walla played her guitar and keyboard parts. Death Cab for Cutie bassist Nick Harmer was in charge of the tour's visuals. Tamborello later said in an interview that Gibbard had been nervous about touring, as the audience may have been bored by what they saw as [...] "a <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> computer onstage". This was partly the motivation for using visual effects such as videos and lights, which included small films for each song.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{had already}} {{established}} himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for The Monthly, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was [...] "a skinny <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When I First Met Your Ma" [...] (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.|$|E
500|$|For Deadpool's scarred appearance, Miller {{wanted him}} to appear [...] "fucking horrible" [...] to justify his anger in the film, while makeup {{designer}} Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics [...] "he’s everything from a rotten corpse to a <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> couple of lines on his face". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as disfigured but also {{wanted him to}} be [...] "still kind of charming and iconic". He wanted to avoid comparisons to Freddy Krueger, and looked to Sin City for inspiration. The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply. For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply the full-body makeup to Reynolds. Corso described the makeup {{for the rest of the}} film's characters as [...] "pretty simple. Tim wanted to keep it really grounded." ...|$|E

500|$|Gailard Sartain plays Ray Stuckey, {{the sheriff}} of Jessup County — a {{character}} based on former Neshoba County sheriff Lawrence A. Rainey. Sartain described Stuckey as [...] "an elected official... {{who has to}} be gregarious - but with sinister overtones". Stephen Tobolowsky plays Clayton Townley, a Grand Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The character is based on [...] White Knights leader Samuel Bowers. Michael Rooker plays Frank Bailey, a Klansman involved in the murders of the three civil rights activists. Pruitt Taylor Vince, who had a small role in Parker's previous film Angel Heart, plays Lester Cowens, a Klansman who unknowingly becomes a pawn in the FBI's investigation. Vince described the character as [...] "goofy, stupid and geeky" [...] and stated, [...] "I never had a prejudiced bone in my body. It gave me a funny feeling to play this <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hood and everything. But when you're {{in the midst of}} it, you just concentrate on getting through it." ...|$|E
500|$|When Lasance {{secured the}} role, he said [...] "Aden causes {{a bit of}} {{mischief}} in the Bay but he's really a good guy." [...] Aden {{has been described as}} a [...] "good looking <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> smile that melts every heart." [...] Aden is initially portrayed as an [...] "anti-social bully with a huge chip on his shoulder" [...] where authority figures are concerned. Aden's mother died while he was young and he was raised by his father Larry Jefferies (Paul Gleeson). Aden is a keen football player, though Larry did not approve or support his ambitions. When Lasance returned to the serial in 2007, he described Aden as being [...] "an absolute bad-arse". When he read the scripts, he thought Aden seemed like an idiot and that viewers would take a dislike to the character. He added that Aden is a strong character and he enjoyed making him [...] "believable". Lasance said that he did not want Aden to turn into a [...] "good guy". The good thing about Aden is the fact [...] "he never quite shakes off the bad-boy image" [...] despite his [...] "different facets".|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{characters}} {{on most of}} the American television shows he has appeared on have shared similar character traits, which Dale describes as the [...] "go-to powerful guy" [...] role. Following his appearance as Senator Eaton in The Killing in 2011, reviewers commented on his tendency to play powerful, wealthy and mysterious characters in many shows. Maureen Ryan of TV Squad wrote that it was [...] "lovely to see Alan Dale playing a typically Alan Dale-ian character. He's always so great at playing That Sketchy Wealthy <b>Guy</b> <b>With</b> <b>a</b> Hidden Agenda, which he has now played on, I believe, 87 different shows. And he always does it well." [...] Coincidentally, Dale's characters in Neighbours, The O.C. and Ugly Betty have all been killed off by a fatal heart attack. Christopher Rosen of The New York Observer wrote in 2008 that [...] "with his square jaw and seemingly no nonsense attitude, Mr. Dale is the go-to actor when casting directors need a conservative-looking authoritarian. When he comes onto the screen, audiences immediately take him seriously, since he radiates rich, smug and serious. He demands your respect." [...] Rosen says that Dale is [...] "not even...a particularly good actor" [...] but is [...] "fine enough" [...] and [...] "bring a no frills, no gimmicks style to his roles," [...] and [...] "manages to give a consistent performance in every show he appears on." ...|$|E

500|$|One of Young's first actions was to hire Ray Perkins as head coach. Perkins was an {{offensive}} assistant coach on the Dallas Cowboys under Hall of Fame coach Tom Landry. In his first draft, Young drafted quarterback Phil Simms from Morehead State University with the seventh overall draft pick {{to the surprise}} of many. Simms had never played on a winning team at Morehead State, and acknowledged after he was drafted that [...] "ost people have never heard of me." [...] Young was certain of the choice though saying, [...] "nce in a while {{you get a chance to}} get a <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> great arm and great potential and you'd darn sight better take it." [...] Simms was unhappy with the selection, and had other teams which he favored playing on over the Giants. The Giants lost their first five games of the season with Joe Pisarcik starting at quarterback. Simms came on in relief of Pisarcik in the fifth game and started the next four, all of which the Giants won. They lost five out of their last seven however, finishing 6–10 for the year. They fell to 4–12 in 1980. Simms play was inconsistent, as he combined for 28 touchdowns against 33 interceptions while completing 48.8% of his passes over his first two seasons.|$|E
500|$|The animators and {{character}} designers {{had a lot}} of discussion about what Frank Grimes should look like. He was originally designed as a [...] "burly ex-marine <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crew cut", but would later be modeled after Michael Douglas in the movie Falling Down and director Jim Reardon's college roommate. Hank Azaria provided the voice of Frank Grimes, even though such a role would normally have been performed by a guest star. The producers decided Azaria was more suitable because the role involved a great deal of frustration and required extensive knowledge of the show. Azaria felt that the role should instead go to William H. Macy. According to Azaria, [...] "I based the character on William Macy. I can't really copy him vocally, but I tried to get as close as I could and copy his rhythms and the way he has that sort of seething passion underneath that total calm exterior." [...] The producers worked a lot with Azaria to help him perfect the role, and gave him more guidance than they normally would. Azaria felt that it was the role he worked hardest on, adding [...] "I think it's the one we did the most takes on, the most emotional, it felt like the one I worked on the hardest from a performance point of view, in preparation and in execution." ...|$|E
500|$|It took 25 days to film, {{requiring}} 500 extras, 600 {{crew members}} and 70 horses. Benioff described {{the difficulty of}} coordinating horses in battle scenes, {{which is why they}} are rarely used except in [...] "big budget war films". Weiss added, [...] "Miguel's really outdone himself. Fully fleshed out medieval battles require a tremendous amount of resources and choreography to get them right. It feels like we're doing something fresh that you don't see on TV and movies very often." [...] Four camera crews were used for the battle scene. The 500 extras were largely the Snow and Bolton armies as Wildlings, archers, swordsmen and spearmen. Each army was trained separately to create off-screen rivalry between the two groups, and visual effects were used to expand the army to thousands. Kristofer Hivju, who plays Tormund Giantsbane, said about the intensity of filming the scenes: [...] "It was pretty intense, actually. When you have 20 people running around getting squeezed together, and you're trying to chop at another bearded <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sword, you are not out of danger. You're laying down in the mud, and one wrong step, you won't have a face anymore. It was very intense, and Miguel insisted on making it that muddy and messy. War is not beautiful. Sometimes you see action sequences where battles seem organized. I know that from how the Vikings fought. It's not beautiful. It's hard. It's hard work. We had to shoot moment-to-moment, chronologically. We would shoot one sequence 80 times per day." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} for manga, anime, video games, {{and other}} related media have provided praise and criticism on Ichigo's character. ANN's Melissa Harper commented that Ichigo's initial rebellious actions make him almost a stereotypical anti-hero, but note that he is soon revealed {{to be a more}} complex character with a sad past. Los Angeles Timess Charles Solomon comments Ichigo's character has little in common with protagonists from other series due to his bad temper and how he tends to fight. However, he added that readers from the series still [...] "love" [...] Ichigo. The way Ichigo becomes a Soul Reaper was found to be relatively common by Carlos Alexandre. He noted that Ichigo's character of a [...] "tough <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heart of gold" [...] had already been done in several series. Charles White from IGN praised Ichigo's climactic fight against Byakuya Kuchiki {{as one of the best}} fights in the Bleach series, and later Ramsey Isler gave additional praise to both the design and voice acting for Ichigo's inner Hollow. Ichigo's development during the Rescue arc in which he sets to save Rukia Kuchiki from being executed have been praised by ANN's Theron Martin. He praised the scenes in which Ichigo manages to stop Rukia's execution and his subsequent demonstration of his Bankai as one of the [...] "eminently satisfying landmark moments in the series". Wired News's Corrina Lawson stated that she liked Ichigo's strong sense of responsibility, and commented it was one of the reasons of the series' popularity.|$|E
500|$|Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "If this is torture porn, it's {{as if it}} was {{designed}} to be enjoyed by Michael Moore." [...] He closed his review saying, [...] "As usual, what gives the film whatever interest it has -- beyond satisfying the rapacious appetites of gore aficionados -- is the moral element attached to the various Rube Goldberg-style set pieces. Here, it's exemplified by a well-staged sequence in which a man must choose who lives or dies during a particularly lethal variation of musical chairs." [...] Roger Moore of Orlando Sentinel gave the film two out of five stars. He said the script [...] "has a more lyrical bent, and a more satiric bite, {{than any of the other}} Saw sequels" [...] and called the acting [...] "perfunctory on most fronts". [...] Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a negative review, writing [...] "But, really, do reformers and victims of callous health insurers really want a <b>guy</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> penchant for elaborately constructed death panels of his own to be their advocate? Elsewhere, the usual critiques apply: terrible acting, zero suspense, laughable logic and the promise of another one next year. How can we get this policy canceled?" [...] Chris Hewitt of the St. Paul Pioneer Press gave the film a negative review. He was displeased that the film offered nothing new saying, [...] "The first three Saw movies had some intriguing ideas and an unusual way of presenting them, but the three most recent films have barely bothered to come up with anything fresh." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave the film three out of five, stating [...] "Saw VI gets back to Saw basics in gripping, gruesome manner." ...|$|E
