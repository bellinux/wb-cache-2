5|$|In {{building}} the pipeline, engineers faced {{a wide range}} of difficulties, stemming mainly from the extreme cold and the difficult, isolated terrain. The construction of the pipeline {{was one of the first}} large-scale projects to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> caused by permafrost, and special construction techniques had to be developed to cope with the frozen ground. The project attracted tens of thousands of workers to Alaska, causing a boomtown atmosphere in Valdez, Fairbanks, and Anchorage.|$|E

5|$|Ecgbert {{was named}} to the see of York around 732 (other sources date the {{appointment}} to 734) by his cousin Ceolwulf, the king of Northumbria. Pope Gregory III gave him a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, in 735. After Eadberht became king, the brothers worked together, and were forbidden by the papacy to transfer church lands to secular control. They also worked together to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> that had developed in the relationship between the church and royal government. An example of the brothers' cooperation is {{the fact that some of}} Eadberht's coins feature Ecbert's image on the opposite face.|$|E

5|$|A secessionist {{rebellion}} {{in the southern}} province of Cisplatina in early 1825, and the subsequent attempt by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata to annex it, led the Empire into the Cisplatine War. In March 1826, PedroI briefly became king of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Dona MariaII. The situation worsened in 1828 when {{the war in the}} south resulted in Brazil's loss of Cisplatina. During the same year in Lisbon, MariaII's throne was usurped by Prince Dom Miguel, PedroI's younger brother. The Emperor's concurrent and scandalous sexual affair with a female courtier tarnished his reputation. Other difficulties arose in the Brazilian parliament, where a struggle over whether the government would be chosen by the monarch or by the legislature dominated political debates from 1826 to 1831. Unable to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, on 7 April 1831 PedroI abdicated in favor of his son Dom PedroII, and sailed for Europe.|$|E

5|$|Near the {{beginning}} of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields and—with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916—he published a paper on general relativity. He continued to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the universe.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> with {{thousands}} of variables, {{it is necessary to}} use a different approach. One is to first sample one ordering, and then find the optimal BN structure with respect to that ordering. This implies working on the search space of the possible orderings, which is convenient as it is smaller than the space of network structures. Multiple orderings are then sampled and evaluated. This method has been proven to be the best available in literature when the number of variables is huge.|$|E

25|$|Andronikos II {{ordered the}} Union of the Orthodox and Catholic Churches to be canceled, a move which pleased many. But he also ordered drastic {{reductions}} in the military, and effectively disbanded the navy, which his father had worked hard to build up. As a result, tax reductions throughout the Empire were possible, earning him greater popularity while seriously undermining Byzantium's abilities to deal with its opponents. He debased the hyperpyron currency and heavily taxed the military elite of the pronoiarioi, thereby further reducing Byzantium's military capability. Whilst these solved some problems that Michael VIII had left for his son, it unraveled his father's attempts at restoring {{the power of the}} Byzantine Empire; where Michael VIII had attempted to <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>problems</b> outside the Empire, Andronikos aimed to solve the internal problems resulting from his father's reign.|$|E
