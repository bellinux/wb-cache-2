In all, Wellesley had 4,500 troops at his disposal plus 5,000 Mysore and Maratha horse and 17 cannon.

They crushed England by 409 runs in the Second Test at Lord's, Abefore defeating Surrey by ten wickets and crushing Gloucestershire by an innings and 363 runs, after amassing 774/7 declared, their highest score of the season.

5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made a joke about his team's bowling being no worse than Bosanquet's.|$|E
5|$|Brescia's {{army was}} easily dispersed, and Constantine quickly {{advanced}} to Verona, where a large Maxentian force was camped. Ruricius Pompeianus, {{general of the}} Veronese forces and Maxentius' praetorian prefect, was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> defensive position, since the town was surrounded on three sides by the Adige. Constantine sent a small force north of the town {{in an attempt to}} cross the river unnoticed. Ruricius sent a large detachment to counter Constantine's expeditionary force, but was defeated. Constantine's forces successfully surrounded the town and laid siege. Ruricius gave Constantine the slip and returned with a larger force to oppose Constantine. Constantine refused to let up on the siege, and sent only a small force to oppose him. In the desperately fought encounter that followed, Ruricius was killed and his army destroyed. Verona surrendered soon afterwards, followed by Aquileia, Mutina (Modena), and Ravenna. The road to Rome was now wide open to Constantine.|$|E
