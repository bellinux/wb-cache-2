5|$|Augustine {{believed}} that a physical Hell exists, but that physical punishment <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to the punishment of being separated from God. He proposed two reasons for this: Firstly, humans have free will, and only those who choose to follow God will be forgiven and able to avoid Hell. Secondly, he {{believed that}} Adam and Eve's choice to sin affected our free choice, and that humans are left unable to resist sin. Augustine proposed that the grace of Jesus Christ freed humans from original sin, but he maintained that humans can only be saved {{if they choose to}} receive grace, and that this choice is formed by the character of individual humans. Accepting that even those who will be saved continue to sin, Augustine proposed that those who choose God's grace will still go to Hell for a time to purge them of their sin, before going to Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{advances}} {{in the identification of}} the tethers between the mitochondrial and ER membranes suggest that the scaffolding function of the molecular elements involved <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to other, non-structural functions. In yeast, ERMES, a multiprotein complex of interacting ER- and mitochondrial-resident membrane proteins, is required for lipid transfer at the MAM and exemplifies this principle. One of its components, for example, is also a constituent of the protein complex required for insertion of transmembrane beta-barrel proteins into the lipid bilayer. However, a homologue of the ERMES complex has not yet been identified in mammalian cells. Other proteins implicated in scaffolding likewise have functions independent of structural tethering at the MAM; for example, ER-resident and mitochondrial-resident mitofusins form heterocomplexes that regulate the number of inter-organelle contact sites, although mitofusins were first identified for their role in fission and fusion events between individual mitochondria. Glucose-related protein 75 (grp75) is another dual-function protein. In addition to the matrix pool of grp75, a portion serves as a chaperone that physically links the mitochondrial and ER Ca2+ channels VDAC and IP3R for efficient Ca2+ transmission at the MAM. Another potential tether is Sigma-1R, a non-opioid receptor whose stabilization of ER-resident IP3R may preserve communication at the MAM during the metabolic stress response.|$|E

Eastern Catholics have similar emphasis in their calendars, and many of their liturgical customs are very similar.|$|E

It was only recently that Maithili was also included {{as one of}} the state's official languages, although such use of it is negligible. Presently, the Bihari languages, except Maithili, are considered one of the five subgroups of Hindi by the government of India. Surajpuri is spoken in northeastern districts such as Kishanganj.|$|E

25|$|Cobras, vipers, {{and closely}} related species use venom to {{immobilize}} or kill their prey. The venom is modified saliva, delivered through fangs. The fangs of 'advanced' venomous snakes like viperids and elapids are hollow to inject venom more effectively, while the fangs of rear-fanged snakes such as the boomslang merely have a groove on the posterior edge to channel venom into the wound. Snake venoms are often prey specific—their role in self-defense <b>is</b> <b>secondary.</b>|$|E

25|$|Various ecumenical {{movements}} have attempted cooperation or {{reorganization of the}} various divided Protestant denominations, according to various models of union, but divisions continue to outpace unions, {{as there is no}} overarching authority to which any of the churches owe allegiance, which can authoritatively define the faith. Most denominations share common beliefs in the major aspects of the Christian faith while differing in many secondary doctrines, although what is major and what <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> is a matter of idiosyncratic belief.|$|E
25|$|Among most hadithists, the {{importance}} of ahadith <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to Qur'an, since Islamic conflict of laws doctrine, in theory, holds Qur'anic supremacy above ahadith in developing Islamic jurisprudence. A minority of hadithists, however, have historically placed ahadith at a par with Qur'an, while others have even upheld ahadith that contradict the Qur'an, in practice thereby placing ahadith above Qur'an, {{and in some cases}} claiming contradicting ahadith abrogate those parts of the Qur'an with which those ahadith conflict.|$|E
25|$|Type 4 RTA is not {{actually}} a tubular disorder at all {{nor does it}} have a clinical syndrome similar to the other types of RTA described above. It was included in the classification of renal tubular acidoses as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a physiological reduction in proximal tubular ammonium excretion (impaired ammoniagenesis), which <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to hypoaldosteronism, and results in a decrease in urine buffering capacity. Its cardinal feature is hyperkalemia, and measured urinary acidification is normal, hence it is often called hyperkalemic RTA or tubular hyperkalemia.|$|E

25|$|Vasodilators – {{calcium channel}} blockers, {{such as the}} dihydropyridines {{nifedipine}} or amlodipine, preferably slow release preparations – are often first line treatment. They have the common side effects of headache, flushing, and ankle edema; {{but these are not}} typically of sufficient severity to require cessation of treatment. The limited evidence available shows that calcium channel blockers are only slightly effective in reducing how often the attacks happen. Peoples whose RP <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to erythromelalgia often cannot use vasodilators for therapy as they trigger 'flares' causing the extremities to become burning red due to there being too much blood.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the middle}} and lower reaches, the forest <b>is</b> <b>secondary,</b> betraying the {{heritage}} of banana farms and slash-and-burn practises used historically in this area. Today much of this area is protected as the Payne's Creek National Park. Here, relatively dense jungle canopy has returned, resulting in a closed canopy of approximately 15 to 20 metres in height. Yellow bay cedar and other significant sized broadleaf species abound, along with numerous tropical vines and thorny undergrowth flora. A machete is essential for exploration even where there is an established trail. Black howler monkey troops are plentiful, each troop maintaining a home range of 40,000 to 70,000 square metres in this forest.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of {{the view}} that the prayer <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> argue that (1) the context {{requires}} a prayer of illumination and not a communal confession of sin, and (2) {{the beginning and end of}} the prayer are marked by duplications in verses 3-4a and verses 20-21a that are most plausibly interpreted as redactional seams. However, these considerations have not proved decisive, and arguments in favor of the prayer's authenticity have also been advanced. In particular, the concluding passage in verses 20-27 contains several allusions to the language in the prayer, suggesting that it was included purposefully by the author(s) of the chapter, even if it was not originally composed by the same author(s).|$|E

25|$|Electrical {{immersion}} heaters may heat water immediately {{adjacent to the}} heating element high enough to promote the formation of scale, commonly calcium carbonate, in hard water areas. This accumulates on the element, and over time, as the element expands and contracts through its heating cycle, the scale cracks off and drops {{to the bottom of}} the tank, progressively filling up the tank. This reduces the tank's capacity and, where the immersion heater <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to the heating of the water by a coil fed from a gas or oil-fired boiler, can reduce the efficiency of the primary heating source by covering that other coil and in turn reducing its efficiency. Regular flushing-out of accumulated sediment can reduce this problem.|$|E
25|$|Tree species {{adapted to}} {{seasonal}} inundation {{have adapted to}} maximize fruit production during periods of flooding {{in order to take}} advantage of newly available seed dispersal methods. Fish consume nearly all fruit that fall into the water, and species that are unable to digest the seeds eventually excrete and disperse them into the water. Dispersal by other vectors such as birds and monkeys <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> to that of fishes in igapó. An important factor in seed survival is the presence of seed predators. Fishes that lack the strong jaws found in characins, such as catfish, digest the fleshy material of the fruit while the seeds pass through the gut unharmed. Because many catfishes are bottom-feeders, they are critical dispersers for seeds that sink upon entering the water.|$|E
25|$|Another {{group of}} {{hypotheses}} contended that dark skin pigmentation developed as antibacterial protection against tropical infectious diseases and parasites. Although {{it is true}} that eumelanin has antibacterial properties, its importance <b>is</b> <b>secondary</b> as a physical absorbed to protect against UVR induced damage. This hypothesis is not consistent with the evidence that most of the hominid evolution took place in savanna environment and not in tropical rainforests. Humans living in hot and sunny environments have darker skin than humans who live in wet and cloudy environments. The antimicrobial hypothesis also does not explain why some populations (like the Inuit or Tibetans) who live far from the tropics and are exposed to high UVR have darker skin pigmentation than their surrounding populations.|$|E
