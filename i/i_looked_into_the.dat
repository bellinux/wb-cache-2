For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the wrong font. After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E
