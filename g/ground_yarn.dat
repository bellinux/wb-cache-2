40|$|Fiber {{shedding}} is {{a critical}} problem in biomedical textile debridement materials, which leads to infection and impairs wound healing. In this work, single fiber pull-out test was proposed as an in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of a textile pile debridement material. Samples with different structural design (pile densities, numbers of ground yarns and coating times) were prepared and estimated under this testing method. Results show that single fiber pull-out test offers an appropriate in vitro evaluation for the fiber shedding property of textile pile debridement materials. Pull-out force for samples without back-coating exhibited a slight escalating trend with the supplement in pile density and number of <b>ground</b> <b>yarn</b> plies, while back-coating process significantly raised the single fiber pull-out force. For fiber shedding mechanism analysis, typical pull-out behavior and failure modes of the single fiber pull-out test were analyzed in detail. Three failure modes were found in this study, i. e., fiber slippage, coating point rupture and fiber breakage. In summary, to obtain samples with desirable fiber shedding property, fabric structural design, preparation process and raw materials selection {{should be taken into}} full consideration...|$|E
40|$|Chenille yarns are {{traditionally}} {{used in the}} manufacture of furnishing fabrics, fashion knitwear, and as decorative threads in many types of broad and narrow fabrics. Chenille yarn has a very distinct weakness-it does not have very good inherent abrasion resistance. When the yarns are in use, clearly the abrasion resistance of the chenille yarn is crucially important. Either during further processing or during the eventual end-use, any removal of the effect yarn forming the beard will expose the <b>ground</b> <b>yarns,</b> which in turn will result in a bare appearance. To avoid this undesirable result, several options are available. Therefore, the studies on this area are about the investigation of the influences of some material types and machine parameters on the abrasion resistance of chenille yarns and fabrics produced with these yarns. In this paper, the experimental studies about the abrasion properties of chenille yarns in yarn, knitted and woven fabric forms are summarized...|$|R
40|$|Antimicrobialfinishing is {{increasingly}} used for various purposes in textile products. Therefore, {{it is important}} to determine whether the antimicrobial finishchanging comfort properties (air permeability, water absorption, etc.) ofknits. The objective of this research was to establish the influence ofantimicrobial treatment conditions on air permeability and water absorptionproperties of plain plated knits. The investigations were carried out with threegroups of single plain plated knits. The <b>ground</b> and plating <b>yarns</b> of I group ofknits is pure fiber cotton, man-made bamboo, polyester. The <b>ground</b> <b>yarns</b> of IIand III groups of knits are accordingly polyamide and elastane threads. Theplating yarns in mentioned groups are the same as in I group – cotton, man-madebamboo, polyester yarns. Part of the knits of all groups were treated in anantimicrobial solution of iSys AG and organic-inorganic binder iSys MTX (CHT,Germany) {{as well as the other}} part of the knits were treated in the sameconditions as treated in antimicrobial solution, however, an antimicrobialmaterial and binder weren’t used. Itwas established that air permeability of investigated knits changedinsignificant regardless of whether reagents providing an antimicrobial effectwere used or not used in finishing process. This means that the chemicalsubstance used for antimicrobial finishing do not worsens an air permeabilityof knits. Meanwhile, the water absorption of antimicrobial treated knits wassignificantly lower than of blank treated knits because the organic-inorganicbinder, used in antimicrobial treatment, forms the sol-gel layer on the surfaceof fiber.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} an investigation on the design options available for positioning the inlaid yarn in fillet warp knit structures. The geometry and structural parameters using our previously published methodology are also presented. It is shown, for example, that if inlaying guide bar does the shifting behind the needles at two needle pitch (variants 1. 11 - 1. 13, Table. 1) the filling yarn wraps the junctures from G 1 <b>ground</b> <b>yarns</b> according to repeat. This position of in-laying yarn provides good stability in the fabric structure, which improves {{with the amount of}} wrapping. Thus, the different positions of the inlaid yarn within the structures offer other possibilities that could be explored when designing fillet warp knit auxetic structures. The array of data for the various design options provide analytical tool for making comparisons about the physical, structural and mechanical properties of the warp knit fillet structures. It is observed that the position of in-laying yarn has some effect on stretch characteristics of warp knit structure...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper,the 5 {{types of}} fabrics were knitted by plain-plated, 1 + 1 and 1 + 3 float-plated, 1 + 1 and 2 + 2 tuck-plate stitch and density P 6,which {{are made of}} cooldry {{absorption}} and quick-drying polyester yarns as the facing yarn and the core-spun spandex yarn of nylon as the <b>ground</b> <b>yarns.</b> The absorption and quick-drying were tested and analyzed. The significance of influence of fabric textures and stretch on absorption and quick-drying was analyzed by means of two variance analysis. Results show that the influence of texture and stretch on absorption and quick-drying are significant. The absorption and spreading speed and the accumulative one-way transport capacity of 1 + 3 and 1 + 1 float-plated and 2 + 2 tuck-plated fabric are bigger. As the fabric texture is the same, the absorption and spreading speed are smaller and the accumulative one-way transport capacity are worse {{with the increase of}} fabrics stretch. The research results can provide a certain reference for the design & development and choice of seamless underwear...|$|R
