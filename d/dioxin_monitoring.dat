40|$|The pork chain {{has been}} seriously {{affected}} by dioxin incidents in recent decades. Hence, <b>monitoring</b> <b>dioxins</b> {{is crucial for}} detecting contaminations in the pork chain. This study aims to develop a decision support tool (optimization model) to determine cost-effective monitoring schemes for detecting and tracing a dioxin contamination over multiple control points along the pork production chain. The optimization model considers four control points (i. e. at the supplier of fatty feed ingredients, the feed mill, the slaughterhouse and the fat melting facility). It was applied to several hypothetical contamination scenarios involving contaminated animal fatty feed ingredients. The cost-effective allocation of resources for detecting and tracing the dioxin contamination from an integrated chain approach (i. e. considering all control points) focuses on monitoring at the feed mill, followed by the supplier of fatty feed ingredients and - {{to a lesser extent}} - by the slaughterhouse. The number of contaminated feed mills, the frequency of dioxin contaminations, the required level of effectiveness, and the cost of screening are main factors driving the total monitoring costs. Sharing the responsibility of <b>monitoring</b> <b>dioxins</b> within control points along the chain largely reduces the total monitoring costs. In each of the evaluated scenarios, the total costs of <b>monitoring</b> <b>dioxins</b> at individual control points are larger than the costs resulting from an optimal allocation of resources among all control points integrated in one overarching chain monitoring scheme. These results elicit the economic benefits of a chain approach to <b>monitoring</b> <b>dioxins</b> over an approach where each chain actor independently <b>monitors</b> <b>dioxins.</b> The developed model can be used by decision makers in the feed and food industry for determining optimal schemes for <b>monitoring</b> <b>dioxins</b> in the pork chain focusing on preventing specific contamination...|$|R

This paper describes the first inter-laboratory study on dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs by HRGC/HRMS method in animal feedingstuffs. Two different statistical approaches (ISO 5725 and Cofino's statistics) were used for the statistical evaluation.

40|$|The {{need for}} a {{continuous}} emissions monitor (CEM) for the determination of dioxins and furans at realistic (parts per trillion or lower) concentrations in real time (minutes) is widely recognized in the waste management community.

It would also be extremely useful in laboratory kinetics experiments seeking to understand formation, interconversion, and destruction processes for dioxins and their precursors.

40|$|Dioxins are {{environmental}} pollutants, potentially {{present in}} milk products, which have negative consequences {{for human health}} and for the firms and farms involved in the dairy chain. <b>Dioxin</b> <b>monitoring</b> in feed and food has been implemented to detect their presence and estimate their levels in food chains. However, the costs and effectiveness of such programs have not been evaluated. In this study, the costs and effectiveness of bulk milk <b>dioxin</b> <b>monitoring</b> in milk trucks were estimated to optimize the sampling and pooling monitoring strategies aimed at detecting at least 1 contaminated dairy farm out of 20, 000 at a target dioxin concentration level. Incidents of different proportions, {{in terms of the number}} of contaminated farms, and concentrations were simulated. A combined testing strategy, consisting of screening and confirmatory methods, was assumed as well as testing of pooled samples. Two optimization models were built using linear programming. The first model aimed to minimize monitoring costs subject to a minimum required effectiveness of finding an incident, whereas the second model aimed to maximize the effectiveness for a given monitoring budget. Our results show that a high level of effectiveness is possible, but at high costs. Given specific assumptions, monitoring with 95 % effectiveness to detect an incident of 1 contaminated farm at a dioxin concentration of 2 pg of toxic equivalents/g of fat [European Commission's (EC) action level] costs € 2. 6 million per month. At the same level of effectiveness, a 73 % cost reduction is possible when aiming to detect an incident where 2 farms are contaminated at a dioxin concentration of 3 pg of toxic equivalents/g of fat (EC maximum level). With a fixed budget of € 40, 000 per month, the probability of detecting an incident with a single contaminated farm at a dioxin concentration equal to the EC action level is 4. 4 %. This probability almost doubled (8. 0 %) when aiming to detect the same incident but with a dioxin concentration equal to the EC maximum level. This study shows that the effectiveness of finding an incident depends not only on the ratio at which, for testing, collected truck samples are mixed into a pooled sample (aiming at detecting certain concentration), but also the number of collected truck samples. In conclusion, the optimal cost-effective monitoring depends on the number of contaminated farms and the concentration aimed at detection.

An injection volume of 10 mul {{was found to be}} the best compromise between the sensitivity requirements and the robustness required for a high throughput method. PTV-LV-GC/MS/MS and Splitless-GC/HRMS were compared by performing analysis on five different matrices such as beef fat, yolk eggs, milk powder, animal feed and serum samples covering a concentration range of two orders of magnitude (i. e. 0. 2 - 25 ng WHO-TEQ kg(- 1)). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out. Fisher tests pointed out that the method effect for all the 2, 3, 7, 8 congeners was not significant, indicating that the null hypothesis (H- 0 : mu(1) = mu(2) = [...] . = mu(n)) was not rejected. Moreover, the interaction effects between methods and matrices were not significant for most of the 2, 3, 7, 8 congeners. However, three congeners (2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDF; 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -HxCDD and I, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 -HpCDD) were characterized by P-values lower than the significance level (alpha = 0. 05).

40|$|To {{decrease}} dioxin uptake by {{the general}} population the European Union (EU) has set limits to the dioxin content of many foodstuffs including eggs. Eggs from free foraging chickens {{are known to have}} a higher dioxin content as compared to confined laying hens and it is the question whether these eggs can adhere to current EU regulations. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate parameters that are involved in the contamination of eggs from chickens raised under “organic” conditions. Samples from 34 organic farms including soil and earth worm samples were collected between September and December of the year 2003. Dioxin levels were assayed by GC/MS. Various parameters were collected by on farm interviews. Egg dioxin content varied between 0. 4 and 8. 1 pg Toxic Equivalents (TEQ) /g egg fat with a mean of 2. 2 pg TEQ/g egg fat. Nine out of 34 farms exceeded the EU limit of 3 pg TEQ/g egg fat. In addition dioxin-like (dl) PCBs were measured and 8 samples exceeded the limit for the sum of dioxins and dl-PCBs. Overall, egg samples from 10 farms were non-compliant with either the dioxin or total TEQ limits. No statistically significant relation could be observed between egg dioxin levels and the concentration observed in soil or earth worms. A statistically significant association was observed between flock size and egg dioxin and dl-PCB content. This effect is most likely attributable to the fact that flock size is related to the time chickens spend outside. Restricting outdoor run use on one of the farms resulted in a decrease of the egg dioxin content to a level that was within the EU limits. This demonstrates that the most likely contamination source is the soil or soil organisms but that the behaviour of the hens determines the extent of the contamination.

40|$|Introduction A lot of {{has been}} heard about dioxins and dioxins-like compounds. These {{molecules}} are typically connected in public awareness with affairs. The {{main source of}} dioxins for humans is food (90 % of typical exposition); thus, assessment of <b>dioxins</b> intake and <b>monitoring</b> of levels of dioxins in food remain an important issue. Objective The aim of the presented work was checking the reproducibility of the authors’ semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire, focusing on products that may contain dioxins and related compounds among adolescents. The uptake of these compounds was also assessed using obtained data. For survey purposes, an album of food products from the questionnaire was constructed. Material and Methods A modified semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was constructed and distributed twice in a 2 -week time span among 55, 15 -year-old, students of secondary schools. Results The correlation coefficient for both declared frequencies and assessed amounts {{in the case of}} the majority of food items was above 0. 70. The average assessed intake of dioxins and related compounds was 1. 57 pgWHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day, and 1. 85 pgWHO-TEQ/kg body weight per day, during test and retest, respectively. Conclusions The modified semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire is a reproducible tool that can be used for adolescents. Average intake in the analyzed group was lower than the Tolerable Daily Intake, but in contrast to other countries remains one of the highest intakes in a comparable age group.

A primary {{objective of the}} {{field experiment}} {{was to assess the}} capacity of the different cap designs to reduce bioavailability of dioxins as well as the disturbance and recovery expected of the benthic habitat and macrofauna communities. The test fields were investigated in samples collected in 2009, shortly after capping, and in 2010, one year after capping. The bioavailability was determined in box-cores transferred from the test fields to a mesocosm laboratory for ex situ measurements of uptake of dioxins in sediment-living organisms and passive samplers exposed in the overlying water. The results showed that caps containing activated carbon effectively reduced the bioavailability of dioxins, but adverse effects were found on benthic communities. In one of the two test fields treated with activated carbon, the community severely deteriorated during the first year after capping. In order to follow the further succession of the benthic community and the degree of sustainment of <b>dioxin</b> immobilization, extended <b>monitoring</b> was performed in 2012 and 2013, 3 - 4 years after cap placement. Here we report the results from this latter investigation and compare with the results obtained in the previous investigations.

40|$|Under {{contract}} DE-AC 26 - 98 FT- 40370, SRI International {{has completed}} {{the third phase}} of a planned three-phase effort to develop a laboratory prototype continuous emission <b>monitor</b> (CEM) for <b>dioxins</b> and furans generated during the incineration of waste materials at DOE remediation sites. The project was initiated on July 29, 1998 with the technical effort completed in October 2001. During this research effort, SRI has made numerous improvements in our jet-REMPI instrument. These improvements have involved characterization and optimization of the molecular cooling in the gas jet, implementation of a custom-fabricated, four pulsed valve assembly, new data acquisition and display software, and preliminary development of a wavelength and mass calibration approach. We have also measured the REMPI excitation spectra of numerous organic compounds {{that are likely to}} be present in the exhaust stream of a waste incinerator. These spectra must be well characterized in the laboratory to understand any potential interferences that might arise when <b>monitoring</b> for <b>dioxin</b> and furan congeners. Our results to date continue to validate the original concept of using jet-REMPI as the detection method in a dioxin CEM. Using only commercial components with minor modifications, we have already demonstrated a detection sensitivity in the low ppt range with sufficient chemical specificity to separately detect two closely related congeners of dichlorodibenzodioxin present in a mixture. To demonstrate the utility of this methodology outside of the controlled conditions of the laboratory, we performed a series of pseudo-field experiments at the US Environmental Protection Agency's National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, NC. The instrument used for those studies was built by SRI under contract with US EPA, and was an exact duplicate of the SRI system. This duplication allowed the experiments to be conducted without transporting the SRI system to the EPA site. Using the jet-REMPI system in conjunction with a combustion flow reactor, the joint SRI-EPA team discovered several new, and unexpected, chemical species in the exhaust stream of a pure methane flame. Based on our work in this project, we have developed a number of concepts for instrumental improvements that will substantially increase our sensitivity while maintaining the exceptional selectivity required of a dioxin CEM. In addition, we have developed several system configurations with varying degrees of functionality that can be further developed and deployed for process monitoring, surrogate measurements, and potentially, as a dioxin control CEM. Due to the extremely demanding regulatory compliance monitoring requirements involving both congener specificity and sub-part-per-trillion sensitivity with near real-time speed, we believe it is not as yet possible to specify a system configuration for a true <b>dioxin</b> compliance <b>monitor.</b> While a true TEQ compliance monitor is not yet possible using the jet-REMPI approach, the technique may prove useful as a surrogate, or indicator monitor. This application would involve continuous measurement of surrogate compounds, such as lowly chlorinated dioxins and furans, whose concentrations have been previously correlated with the TEQ. Such an instrument would not require the extreme sensitivity of a compliance monitor although the high degree of chemical selectivity would remain important...|$|R

Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate the association between dioxin exposure and chronic kidney disease (CKD) and identify the related factors. We conducted a community-based cross-sectional study and recruited participants from {{an area where the}} residents were exposed to dioxin released from a factory. We defined a "high dioxin level" as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) ≥ 20 pg WHO 98 -TEQDF/g lipid in the serum and defined CKD as having an estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) ≤ 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 or a diagnosis of CKD by a physician. The renal function was assessed between 2005 and 2010, and we excluded those who had had kidney diseases before the study started. Comparisons between patients of CKD {{and those who did not}} have CKD were made to identify the risk factors for CKD. Of the 2898 participants, 1427 had high dioxin levels, and 156 had CKD. In the univariate analyses, CKD was associated with high dioxin levels, age, gender, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and high insulin and uric acid levels. After adjusting for other factors, we found high dioxin levels (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1. 76, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1. 04 - 2. 99), female gender (AOR = 1. 74, 95 %CI: 1. 20 - 2. 53), hypertension (AOR = 1. 68, 95 %CI: 1. 17 - 2. 42), high insulin levels (AOR = 2. 14, 95 % CI: 1. 26 - 3. 61), high uric acid levels (AOR = 4. 25, 95 % CI: 2. 92 - 6. 20), and older age (AOR = 4. 66, 95 % CI: 1. 87 - 11. 62 for 40 - 64 year and AOR = 26. 66, 95 % CI: 10. 51 - 67. 62 for age ≥ 65 year) were independent predictors of CKD.

40|$|The Swedish {{national}} monitoring (tradition) {{for environmental}} pollutants {{is widely considered}} {{as one of the}} most comprehensive in Europe. First monitoring related studies began in 1960 s and the national monitoring program (PMK) was officially started in late 1970 s. The monitoring system has been developed gradually, according to discovered effects/threats of toxic contaminants to the environment, but the focus has been on concentrations. The future will set new kinds of demands for monitoring. Already the program has undergone substantial changes since 1995. In addition to monitoring of existing contaminants, data are needed to predict the possible harmfulness of new chemical substances before they can cause damage in the environment. The concept of risk is introduced to the objectives of monitoring in the 1999 paper. Persistent brominated flame retardants (PBDE) are an example of new substance group, which should be monitored more extensively in biota, not only in precipitation. A relevant way to decrease monitoring intensity of &# 8220;old sins&# 8221; including mainly organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), should be a focus for both scientific and policy discussion. Some of the OCPs have reached low levels often below critical limit for aquatic biota. Many time series have shown most of their &# 8220;slope&# 8221; already in 1970 s and 1980 s. This means statistically that you would need more time and data to show significant changes in the future. The importance to show significance has to be put in perspective if the environmental quality standards are not violated. Many of the &# 8220;old sins&# 8221; like PCBs and related substances <b>dioxins</b> should be <b>monitored</b> also in near future because of their toxicity to biota and human in the Baltic Sea and in the circumpolar regions. Elevated dioxin levels in fish is a main reason that the EU Commission has decided to ban all commercial use of herring and Baltic salmon after 2006. It is recommended to continue with collection of traditional long-time series of biota into the environmental specimen bank (ESB) for retrospective monitoring studies of new unknown chemicals. At the same time, new matrices should be studied. In the Baltic Sea environment, tissue samples (subcutant fat) from seals during legal hunting or when found dead, could be stored and studied. Sediment studies should be utilized fully for mass balance and modeling work. In the freshwater environment, pike should be considered more extensively as a top consumer, especially for Hg monitoring. In the terrestrial environment, the herbivorous reindeer, moose and small rodents are not the best indicator species for organic persistent pollutants. For that reason, top consumers (predators) like pine marten (Martes martes L.) or common shrew (Sorex araneus) should be considered. Evaluation of the regional monitoring showed that quality and efficiency of monitoring in the counties gave picture of large variation. Monitoring is well coordinated at least in those counties that have had common projects with EPA. The counties have many monitoring projects of their own. Vast amounts of samples are taken every year. The geographical coverage of local monitoring could be better. If the meaning really is to have a regional monitoring system that will complete the national monitoring, it will require more common planning and coordinative action by the Swedish EPA. Evaluation of the international reporting showed that Sweden and Finland are signatories/reporting to same international agreements/programmes relevant to contaminants. It was proposed that razorbill (Alca torda L) eggs should be an additional common indicator for monitoring of contaminants in bird colonies in the Baltic Sea area (HELCOM). It was also considered that POPs should be measured at some IM stations in several compartments (deposition, sediment traps, biota). The data analysis and reporting should put more weight on the metals stored in the soil (humus) and risk associated with that (mass balances and modelling) (ECE/LRTAP). The project "Global Network for monitoring of Chemicals in the Environment" seems to be a forum, to which Sweden, and other Nordic countries, could have plenty of information and experience to give (UNEP POP). In a circumpolar perspective, few lakes with very long-term data (Abisko, Storvindeln) and &# 8220;master&# 8221; station at Pallas could represent sufficiently the &# 8220;clean northern Europe&# 8221; (AMAP). The so-called Priority Substances (PS) within the Water Framework Directive will be a part of international reporting in near future. Swedish (and Danish) screening programmes have already been started which will benefit all Nordic countries (EU WFD). The review of Swedish-Finnish co-operation pointed some former and on-going projects on contaminants. One major project is the Bothnian Bay Life -project aiming to establish common database for physical and chemical properties of marine and river water (incl. heavy metals and loading data). Readiness to study and monitor oil pollution should be of interest because of 4 to 6 fold increasing transportation of oil in the Gulf of Finland in 2003 - 2006. It was also supported the possibilities of the Pallas &# 8220;master&# 8221; station which should be utilized more and enhance monitoring and research of airborne contaminants both in terrestrial and in aquatic biota. Environmental problems (air pollution, climate change, loss of biodiversity) are more and more understood to link together, and so should be the monitoring activities. The aspect of integrating presently separate monitoring networks on larger (than small catchments) geographical area, should be discussed. Also it is worth to note if some of new EU WFD directed priority chemicals could be screened and monitored together in the common sea areas and the boundary areas of Sweden and Finland &# 8211; this matter should also be a target for discussion and planning...|$|R
