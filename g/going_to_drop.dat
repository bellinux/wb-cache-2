500|$|At the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, Minaj {{announced}} the reissue of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, commenting [...] "I'm putting {{lots of new}} songs on there and I'm actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> my new single like next week. Barbz, you are gonna spaz. You are gonna love it. You are gonna go crazy!" [...] Its artwork was released the following month, featuring an image of Minaj from the music video of her song [...] "I Am Your Leader". In November, she added that the expanded album would contain an additional disc with seven newly recorded songs and an exclusive behind-the-scenes DVD to supplement the standard edition of the original album. The project served as {{the main focus of}} her three-part E! special Nicki Minaj: My Truth.|$|E
500|$|The band {{went into}} the album with the {{assumption}} that Dreamworks was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> them at any moment, so they wanted {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity by working with their [...] "dream producer". They chose Garth Richardson, who was known for his work with heavier sounding bands like Rage Against the Machine and Sick of It All. While writing songs for the album, Rise Against's lineup once again changed; Mohney left the band, and was replaced by Chris Chasse. The recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences, the biggest of which was the transition from Dreamworks to Geffen Records. In November 2003, Dreamworks was acquired by Universal Music Group, and eventually merged with Geffen. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives.|$|E
500|$|In September 2012, Minaj {{announced}} the reissue of Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded, subtitled The Re-Up, containing an additional disc with eight newly-recording songs and an exclusive behind-the-scenes DVD {{to supplement the}} standard edition of the original album. Minaj commented at the 2012 MTV Video Music Awards, [...] "I'm putting lots of new songs on there and I'm actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> my new single like next week. Barbz, you are gonna spaz. You are gonna love it. You are gonna go crazy!" [...] Production {{of the project was}} a main focus on Minaj's three-part E! special, Nicki Minaj: My Truth, which aired in November 2012. On On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Minaj stated that [...] "I feel like the music is such a better representation of me where I am now as an artist in my career. As long as people can hear the music, I'm good." ...|$|E

500|$|On-screen the storyline {{involves}} Kathleen blackmailing the McQueens for money, {{threatening to}} reveal their roles in Calvin's murder. Kathleen is described as Jacqui's [...] "worst enemy", of this Cooper stated: [...] "She hates her with a passion - her worst enemy ever has been dragged back! It's funny and comedic at times, but then it can get deadly serious." [...] Although she knows the risks of crossing Danny, she tries to fix the poker game; of this Cooper comments that [...] "It's pure desperation" [...] on Jacqui's behalf. When Danny exposes her, he threatens her with Rhys' life, stating if she does not sleep with him, he will kill Rhys. In a turn of events Jacqui turns him down. Cooper defends Jacqui's actions stating {{that she is a}} [...] "bright girl" [...] and adding [...] "She doesn't want to sleep with him and also she knows he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> Rhys in front of so many people. So when he says it, she considers her options, weighs them up." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{rehearsal}} in March 1942 {{was intended}} to be three hours long, but had to be stopped after 15 minutes because the 30 musicians present were too weak to play their instruments. They frequently collapsed during rehearsals, especially those playing brass instruments. Eliasberg himself had to be dragged to rehearsals on a sledge, and was eventually moved by Communist officials to an apartment nearby and given a bicycle for transport. His first attempts at conducting were like a [...] "wounded bird with wings that are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> at any moment". A report by Babushkin noted that [...] "the first violin is dying, the drum died on his way to work, the French horn is at death's door...". Orchestral players were given additional rations (donated by civilian music enthusiasts) in an effort to combat starvation, and hot bricks were used to radiate heat; nevertheless, three performers died during rehearsals. Posters went up around the city requesting all musicians to report to the Radio Committee for incorporation into the orchestra. Performers were also recalled from the front or reassigned from Soviet military bands {{with the support of the}} Soviet commander of the Leningrad front, Leonid Govorov.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding Oliveri's backing vocal contributions, Homme noted: [...] "Nick and I {{have been}} friends since a couple weeks after {{everything}} went down in 2004. People don't know that, {{and it would be}} awkward for me to run around making sure everyone knew it. Nick recorded his new record at my studio, and then he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> off some records and he said, 'Hey, need anyone to sing backup?' And I was like, 'Actually, yeah, come on in.' That's a nice thing. It was easy. It's nice to know someone since you were a little kid, and still know them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, Mr. Prosper, pretty well. My {{anxiety is}} all for Matilda." [...] Matilda had been Matilda to her {{since she had}} been a little girl, and Miss Tickle was not <b>going</b> now <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> the {{advantage}} which the old intimacy gave her.|$|R

2500|$|The band {{went into}} the album with the {{assumption}} that Dreamworks was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> them at any moment, so they wanted {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity by working with their [...] "dream producer". They chose Garth Richardson, known for his work with heavier sounding bands like Rage Against the Machine and Sick of It All, to produce the album. The recording sessions for Siren Song of the Counter Culture were split between Plumper Mountain Sound in Gibsons, British Columbia, and The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Richardson insisted on recording the guitar and bass one measure at a time, to ensure perfect timing; as a result, each song took nearly twelve hours to record. Canadian politician Nicholas Simons contributed the cello to four songs. Simons met the band while in Gibsons, and recalled not knowing who they were.|$|E
2500|$|Lamar's major-label debut, good kid, m.A.A.d city, was {{released}} on October 22, 2012. The album was met with critical acclaim and debuted at number two in the US, selling 242,100 copies in its first week. Later that year, Fuse TV listed Lamar's single, [...] "Backseat Freestyle" [...] among the top 40 songs of 2012. In a few months' time, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). HipHopDX named Lamar [...] "Emcee of the Year" [...] for their 2012 Year-End honors. In November, after Cole posted pictures of himself and Lamar working in the studio, the latter revealed that the two are still working on a project, but an exact release date was not given for the joint album: [...] "We are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> that out the sky though. I don't want to give dates. I'm just {{going to let it}} fall" [...] {{in an interview with the}} LA Leakers.|$|E
2500|$|Gabe Konrad writes: [...] "The 1919 winner, van Lerberghe, {{showed up}} on the line in full racing attire but, for some reason, without a bike. He {{borrowed}} one from the brother-in-law of another competitor and, prior to the starting gun, threatened the pack that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> them all at their own front doors on the way to victory. Van Lerberghe hadn't had, and would never have, an impressive career, and all the cyclists laughed as he pulled away immediately– never to be caught. Just prior to entering the velodrome for the finish, van Lerberghe stopped off at a pub to take in a few beers. His manager, worrying that he would miss a chance at victory, had to track him down and get him back on the bike. After he had crossed the line and done his lap of honour, van Lerberghe {{stood in front of the}} crowd and, in all seriousness, told them 'to go home; I'm half a day ahead of the field.'" ...|$|E
30|$|In the {{implementation}} of DST over LACK, an additional multi-layer buffer is involved. The DST is implemented {{in and around the}} packets which are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dropped.</b> As the DST has to be implemented in the physical level, a multi-layer buffer is required. The real-time DST guarantees that the voice frames can be correctly packed in the new packets after DST.|$|R
30|$|Alternatively, the BE {{traffic class}} is not {{provided}} with a TB policer, this assumption is made considering that this traffic type {{does not need to}} adjust a committed rate. Therefore, when the BE queue is full, no particular algorithms are needed to decide which packet is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>dropped.</b> As a result, a simple drop tail (DT) mechanism is implemented.|$|R

2500|$|The {{damage caused}} by the Suez Crisis to the Prime Minister's already frail health persuaded the Edens to seek a month's rest cure at [...] "Goldeneye", Ian Fleming's [...] "plain, low roofed" [...] {{bungalow}} on the north coast of Jamaica. Lady Avon's concern for her husband's health {{appears to have been}} decisive in the choice of destination, but it was regarded by many, including Macmillan and the Government's Chief Whip, Edward Heath, as politically unwise. In addition, although Goldeneye had a private beach and a large living room with glassless louvre windows that enabled [...] "the moist tropical air [...] blow through", Ian Fleming's close friend, the journalist Denis Hamilton, who visited Goldeneye around that time, recalled a [...] "shack-like house" [...] which Fleming [...] "went around pretending ... a great palace ... a miniature Ritz". Its bedrooms have been described as [...] "insignificant and small" [...] Ann Fleming warned Lady Avon about some of its primitive aspects and suggested that Torquay, a seaside resort in the south west of England, and a sun-lamp might have been preferable. However, Lady Avon has insisted that [...] "Berkshire [...] or somewhere instead" [...] would not have been suitable: [...] "I thought if we didn't go to Jamaica, he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> down dead, literally".|$|E

50|$|The Reds, {{who were}} looking to build off of a solid 68-60 record during the 1918 season, their highest winning {{percentage}} since 1904, started off the 1919 season with seven consecutive wins, and nine wins in their first 10 games, to take an early lead in the National League standings. The Reds did slump over their next 26 games, <b>going</b> 11-15 <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> their overall record to 20-16, and slipped into second place, four games behind the New York Giants.|$|R

60|$|With {{his head}} uncovered, the silver top-knot of his brushed-up hair {{completed}} {{the character of}} his physiognomy, all bony ridges and sunken hollows, clothed in a perfect impassiveness of expression. His meagre brown hands emerging from large white cuffs came and went breaking bread, pouring wine, and so on, with quiet mechanical precision. His head and body above the tablecloth had a rigid immobility. This firebrand, this great agitator, exhibited the least possible amount of warmth and animation. His voice was rasping, cold, and monotonous in a low key. He could not be called a talkative personality; but with his detached calm manner he appeared as ready to keep the conversation <b>going</b> as <b>to</b> <b>drop</b> it at any moment.|$|R
