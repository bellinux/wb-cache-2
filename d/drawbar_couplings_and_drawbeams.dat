50|$|A {{trackless}} train — or tram (U.S. English), road train, land train, {{parking lot}} tram, Dotto train or Choo-Choo train — is a road-going articulated vehicle {{used for the}} transport of passengers, comprising a driving vehicle pulling one or more carriages connected by <b>drawbar</b> <b>couplings,</b> {{in the manner of}} a road-going railway train.Similar vehicles may be used for transport of freight or baggage for short distances, such as at a factory or airport.|$|R
50|$|As in {{a regular}} road vehicle, the tractor unit is steered through the front wheels by a {{steering}} wheel operated by a human driver, and powered by its rear single or double axle. The following carriages are then steered through the <b>drawbar</b> <b>couplings</b> between the carriages. Simple trains with few carriages or short in overall length may feature single- or double-axle carriages with just front-axle steering only. Larger or longer trains feature four-wheel steering by way of mechanical linkages. Four-wheel steering ensures that longer trains need less side clearance while turning, as the carriages are able to maintain the same path, describing a constant radius of arc. This adds to the impression of the vehicle being on rails. The drawbar connections of more complex trains may feature a shock absorber {{to mitigate the effect}} of acceleration or braking.|$|R

40|$|We {{study in}} detail the renomalization group {{evolution}} of Yukawa <b>couplings</b> <b>and</b> soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number violation. We obtain the exact solutions of these equations in a closed form, and then depict the infrared fixed point structure of the third generation Yukawa <b>couplings</b> <b>and</b> the highest generation baryon and lepton number violating couplings. Approximate analytical solutions for these Yukawa <b>couplings</b> <b>and</b> baryon and lepton number violating <b>couplings,</b> <b>and</b> the soft supersymmetry breaking couplings are obtained {{in terms of their}} initial values at the unification scale. We then numerically study the infrared fixed surfaces of the model, and illustrate the approach to the fixed points.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{renormalization}} group evolution and infra-red stable fixed {{points of the}} Yukawa <b>couplings</b> <b>and</b> the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with baryon and lepton number (and R-parity) violation involving the heaviest generations. We show analytically that in the Yukawa sector {{there is only one}} infra-red stable fixed point. This corresponds to non-trivial fixed point for the top-, bottom-quark Yukawa <b>couplings</b> <b>and</b> the B violating coupling λ_ 233 ", and a trivial one for the τ-Yukawa coupling. All other possible fixed points are either unphysical or unstable in the infra-red region. We then carry out an analysis of the renormalization group equations for the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear <b>couplings,</b> <b>and</b> determine the corresponding fixed points for these couplings. We also study the quasi-fixed point behaviour, both algebraically and with numerical solutions of the evolution equations, of the third generation Yukawa <b>couplings</b> <b>and</b> the baryon number violating coupling, and those of the soft supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings. From the analysis of the fixed point behaviour, we obtain upper and lower bounds on the baryon number violating coupling λ_ 233 ", {{as well as on the}} supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings.
