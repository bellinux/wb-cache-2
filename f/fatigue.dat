5|$|Fatigue: <b>fatigue</b> is {{very common}} and {{disabling}} in MS, {{and at the same}} time it has a close relationship with depressive symptomatology. When depression is reduced <b>fatigue</b> also tends to improve, so patients should be evaluated for depression before other therapeutic approaches are used. In a similar way, other factors such as disturbed sleep, chronic pain, poor nutrition, or even some medications can contribute to fatigue; medical professionals are therefore encouraged to identify and modify them. A few medications have been studied to treat MS-related <b>fatigue,</b> such as amantadine pemoline (which is a psychostimulant also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy), or modafinil, as well as psychological interventions of energy conservation, but the effects of all of them are small. <b>Fatigue</b> is therefore a very difficult symptom to manage for which no drugs are recommended.|$|E
5|$|The main {{failure mode}} for die casting dies is wear or erosion. Other failure modes are heat {{checking}} and thermal <b>fatigue.</b> Heat checking is when surface cracks {{occur on the}} die due to a large temperature change on every cycle. Thermal <b>fatigue</b> is when surface cracks occur on the die due to {{a large number of}} cycles.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fatigue</b> is a {{subjective}} feeling of tiredness which {{is distinct from}} weakness, and has a gradual onset. Unlike weakness, <b>fatigue</b> can be alleviated by periods of rest. <b>Fatigue</b> can have physical or mental causes. Physical <b>fatigue</b> is the transient inability of a muscle to maintain optimal physical performance, and is made more severe by intense physical exercise. Mental <b>fatigue</b> is a transient decrease in maximal cognitive performance resulting from prolonged periods of cognitive activity. It can manifest as somnolence, lethargy, or directed attention <b>fatigue.</b>|$|E

25|$|Depression {{and other}} {{psychological}} conditions can produce <b>fatigue,</b> {{so people who}} report <b>fatigue</b> are routinely screened for these conditions, along with drug abuse, poor diet, and lack of physical exercise, which paradoxically increases <b>fatigue.</b>|$|E
25|$|Muscle <b>fatigue</b> can be central, neuromuscular, or {{peripheral}} muscular. Central muscle <b>fatigue</b> manifests as {{an overall}} sense of energy deprivation, and peripheral muscle weakness manifests as a local, muscle-specific inability to do work. Neuromuscular <b>fatigue</b> {{can be either}} central or peripheral.|$|E
25|$|Muscle <b>fatigue</b> is {{the decline}} in ability of a muscle to {{generate}} force. It can {{be a result of}} vigorous exercise but abnormal <b>fatigue</b> may be caused by barriers to or interference with the different stages of muscle contraction. There are two main causes of muscle fatigue: the limitations of a nerveâ€™s ability to generate a sustained signal (neural <b>fatigue)</b> and the reduced ability of the muscle fiber to contract (metabolic <b>fatigue).</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Fatigued</b> {{driving is}} a {{well-known}} road safety issue. While <b>fatigued</b> driving is usually investigated from an individual perspective, this study used a novel approach to identify the system-wide factors influencing this issue. An online survey methodology was used to gather the perceptions of 150 Queensland drivers about the {{factors that contribute to}} <b>fatigued</b> driving, and recommendations for reducing its prevalence. The results suggested that drivers perceive individual factors to be the predominant cause of <b>fatigued</b> driving. However, some wider system-level factors and recommendations were identified. Implications for practical countermeasures to reduce the incidence of <b>fatigued</b> driving are discussed...|$|R

25|$|There is anecdotal {{evidence}} {{that the use of}} nitrox reduces post-dive <b>fatigue,</b> particularly in older and or obese divers; however a double-blind study to test this found no statistically significant reduction in reported <b>fatigue.</b> There was, however, some suggestion that post dive <b>fatigue</b> is due to sub-clinical decompression sickness (DCS) (i.e. micro bubbles in the blood insufficient to cause symptoms of DCS); the fact that the study mentioned was conducted in a dry chamber with an ideal decompression profile may have been sufficient to reduce sub-clinical DCS and prevent <b>fatigue</b> in both nitrox and air divers. In 2008, a study was published using wet divers at the same depth and confirmed that no statistically significant reduction in reported <b>fatigue</b> is seen.|$|E
25|$|Medically, <b>fatigue</b> is a {{non-specific}} symptom, {{which means}} that it has many possible causes and accompanies many different conditions. <b>Fatigue</b> is considered a symptom, rather than a sign {{because it is a}} subjective feeling reported by the patient, rather than an objective one that can be observed by others. <b>Fatigue</b> and 'feelings of fatigue' are often confused.|$|E

50|$|The Barrayaran uniform {{consists}} of four different sets. Ranging from informal to formal: Black <b>fatigues,</b> a Green Undress uniform, a Green Dress Uniform and a Parade Red and Blue uniform. <b>Fatigues</b> and Undress Greens are generally worn during regular duty, while dress Greens are for meetings with superior officers and Red and Blues for formal functions. Except for <b>fatigues,</b> the uniforms are accompanied by black cavalry boots, evidence {{that the military is}} descended from a cavalry-based ground force.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} of the involvement of type II fibres in the V. O (2) slow component phenomenon by using two prior <b>fatiguing</b> protocols on the knee extensor muscles. Nine subjects performed three constant-load cycling exercises at a work rate corresponding to 80 % of their V. O (2) max: (i) preceded by a 20 -min <b>fatiguing</b> protocol using electromyostimulation (EMS), (ii) preceded by a 20 -min <b>fatiguing</b> protocol using voluntary contractions (VOL), and (iii) without <b>fatiguing</b> protocol (NFP). Voluntary and evoked neuromuscular properties of the knee extensor muscles were tested before (PRE) and after (POST) the two <b>fatiguing</b> protocols. Results show a significant reduction in voluntary force after both <b>fatiguing</b> protocols (- 19. 9 % and - 11. 8 %, in EMS and VOL, respectively p< 0. 01). After EMS, this decrease was greater than after VOL (p< 0. 05) and was combined with a slackening of muscle contractile properties which was absent after VOL (p< 0. 05). Regarding the effects on oxygen uptake kinetics, the appearance of the slow component was delayed after EMS and its amplitude was lower than those obtained in VOL and NFP conditions (0. 48 +/- 0. 07 vs. 0. 75 +/- 0. 09 and 0. 69 +/- 0. 08 L. min (- 1), respectively; p< 0. 05). It can thus be concluded that exercises dedicated to preferentially <b>fatiguing</b> type II fibres may alter V. O (2) kinetics...|$|R
25|$|<b>Fatigue</b> {{may be a}} {{consequence}} of the cancer or its treatment, and can last for months to years after treatment. One physiological cause of <b>fatigue</b> is anemia, which can be caused by chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, primary and metastatic disease or nutritional depletion. Anaerobic exercise {{has been found to be}} beneficial in reducing <b>fatigue</b> in people with solid tumours.|$|E
25|$|Bose {{performed}} a {{comparative study of}} the <b>fatigue</b> response of various metals and organic tissue in plants. He subjected metals {{to a combination of}} mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical stimuli and noted the similarities between metals and cells. Bose's experiments demonstrated a cyclical <b>fatigue</b> response in both stimulated cells and metals, as well as a distinctive cyclical <b>fatigue</b> and recovery response across multiple types of stimuli in both living cells and metals.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} {{to this idea}} {{is the one that}} <b>fatigue</b> is due to peripheral â€˜limitationâ€™ or â€˜catastropheâ€™. In this view, regulation by <b>fatigue</b> occurs as a consequence of a failure of homeostasis directly in muscles.|$|E
