The badge for the prelate shows the Lesser George <b>encircled</b> by the Garter, which is surmounted by a bishop's mitre. The badge for the chancellor is a rose <b>encircled</b> by the Garter. The badge for the register is two crossed quills over a book <b>encircled</b> by the Garter surmounted by a crown. The badge for Garter Principal King of Arms is the royal arms impaled with St George's Cross <b>encircled</b> by the Garter and surmounted by a crown.

5|$|In 1638, the Santa Margherita Lines {{began to}} be built <b>encircling</b> the land fronts of Birgu and Sengela. Works were {{suspended}} in 1645 {{due to a lack}} of funds, and they remained unfinished for many years. Following the fall of Candia to the Ottomans in 1669, a second line of fortifications, the Cottonera Lines, {{began to be}} built <b>encircling</b> both Birgu and Senglea, as well as the unfinished Santa Margherita Lines. They were begun in 1670, but works stopped in 1680 again {{due to a lack of}} funds. By this time, the bastioned enceinte had been built, although other crucial parts had not yet been constructed. Eventually, some effort was done to complete both the Santa Margherita and Cottonera Lines in the early 18th century, although some of the planned ravelins, cavaliers, ditch and other fortifications were never constructed. Fort San Salvatore was built on one of the Cottonera Lines bastions in 1724.|$|E
5|$|Once Soviet {{resistance}} {{along the}} Vyazma-Bryansk front was eliminated, German forces were to press east, <b>encircling</b> Moscow by outflanking {{it from the}} north and south. Continuous fighting had reduced their effectiveness, and logistical difficulties became more acute. Guderian wrote that some of his destroyed tanks had not been replaced, and there were fuel shortages {{at the start of the}} operation.|$|E
5|$|The French {{success at}} {{completely}} <b>encircling</b> Cornwallis left them firmly {{in control of}} Chesapeake Bay.

5|$|The {{population}} of Paris dropped from 2,850,000 in 1954 to 2,152,000 in 1990, as middle-class families {{moved to the}} suburbs.

5|$|The pre-273 {{walls were}} narrow and while <b>encircling</b> the whole city, {{they do not}} seem to have {{provided}} real protection against an invasion. No signs of towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed the city as many gaps appears to have never been defended. The earlier walls seem to have been designed to protect the city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier.|$|E
5|$|After {{the raft}} was {{attacked}} and {{destroyed by the}} Others, Sawyer (Josh Holloway) surfaces in the ocean. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screams for Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of flotsam and performing CPR. Michael then wakes up, and blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, the two notice a shark is <b>encircling</b> them; Michael believes the shark was attracted to Sawyer's bleeding wound, and the two have continuous arguments.|$|E
25|$|The Soviets {{deployed}} three brigades with armor {{support to}} open the road connections to the <b>encircled</b> divisions but Finnish efforts prevented them. Renewed attacks distracted the Finns enough to allow the <b>encircled</b> Soviet forces to escape through the dense forests by abandoning their heavy equipment. Given {{the element of surprise}} and due to the superior numbers of the Soviets, the Finnish troops guarding the <b>encircled</b> divisions had little hope of containing organized breakouts, especially in the forests, and so many of the <b>encircled</b> Soviets managed to escape to their own side with the last escaping on August 10.|$|R

5|$|Five KPA {{divisions}} amassed {{to oppose}} the UN at Taegu. From south to north, the 10th, 3rd, 15th, 13th, and 1st Divisions occupied a wide line <b>encircling</b> Taegu from Tuksong-dong and around Waegwan to Kunwi. The KPA planned to use the natural corridor of the Naktong valley from Sangju to Taegu as its main axis of attack for the next push south, so the divisions all eventually moved through this valley, crossing the Naktong at different areas along the low ground. Elements of the DPRK 105th Armored Division also supported the attack.|$|E

5|$|Images of Bhikshatana {{are found}} {{throughout}} Shaiva temples of South India, but are almost unknown in Northern India.

In South Indian temples, Bhikshatana is prescribed to be enshrined as an avarana-devata (a deity depicted on the circumambulatory path <b>encircling</b> the central shrine). Similarly in Orissan temples, Bhikshatana may be worshipped and depicted as parshva-devata (an attendant deity) or avarana-devata.|$|E

5|$|In February, the Soviets entered Silesia and Pomerania, while Western Allies entered western Germany {{and closed}} to the Rhine river. By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine {{north and south of}} the Ruhr, <b>encircling</b> the German Army Group B, while the Soviets {{advanced}} to Vienna. In early April, the Western Allies finally pushed forward in Italy and swept across western Germany capturing Hamburg and Nuremberg, while Soviet and Polish forces stormed Berlin in late April. American and Soviet forces met at the Elbe river on 25 April. On 30 April 1945, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1943, the 5th Division {{moved to}} the Morobe Province of New Guinea to replace the 3rd Division, which was then {{participating}} in the Salamaua–Lae campaign. Milford was tasked with continuing offensive operations against the Japanese around Salamaua to divert resources away from the nearby Japanese base {{in the town of}} Lae. Once the neighbouring 9th Division commenced their attack to capture Lae on 4 September by landing east of the town to begin an <b>encircling</b> movement, the 5th Division moved to take Salamaua, which eventually fell to the Australians on 11 September.|$|E

40|$|The <b>encircled</b> {{energy of}} a {{focusing}} lens {{is one of the}} parameters directly affecting the target efficiency in high-power laser facilities. The direct measurement method of the <b>encircled</b> energy for the focusing lens based on the scanning Hartmann test is proposed in this paper. With the scanning Hartmann test setup, the information in the whole aperture of the focusing lens can be achieved. The <b>encircled</b> energy can be obtained by analyzing the spot diagram on the focal plane of the focusing lens. In experiments, the <b>encircled</b> {{energy of a}}n aspheric focusing lens is measured using this method. The measurement result is in good agreement with that derived from measurement data by an interferometer and the difference is 7. 7 %. (C) 2006 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|Licori and Armida were Monteverdi's final {{theatrical}} {{works for}} the Mantuan court. Vincenzo II's death ended the main Gonzaga line; the dukedom was inherited by a distant relative, Charles of Nevers, and Mantua was subsequently engulfed {{in a series of}} conflicts, which by 1630 had reduced much of the city to ruins. Monteverdi's last known letter to Striggio is dated 8 July 1628; Striggio died in Venice on 8 June 1630, while heading a mission requesting aid against the armies that were <b>encircling</b> Mantua.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the oldest}} sectors of Dubrovnik was {{constructed}} around a Late Antique castle by the sea, which stretched landwards {{a bit more than}} it does today.

The harbour was designed and constructed by engineer Paskoje Miličević in the late 15th century. Notably, the harbour was noticeably painted on the palm of St. Blaise in a triptych painted by the artist Nikola Božidarević around 1500.|$|E
5|$|The German {{offensive}} against the Soviet Union began early on 22 June 1941 with an artillery barrage. The 16th Panzer Division was subordinated to Heeresgruppe Süd (Army Group South) {{under the command}} of Generalfeldmarschall Von Rundstedt. The goal, together with the 6. Armee and 17. Armee as well as Panzergruppe I, was to follow the pincers of both armies, heading for Kiev and rolling up the Soviet flanks in the process, and finally <b>encircling</b> them at the Dnieper River. The main objective was to conquer the economically important Donets Basin as well as the oil field in the Caucasus.|$|E
