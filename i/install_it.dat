5|$|The mission's second spacewalk officially {{began at}} 12:49 UTC, and the pair {{set to work}} {{removing}} and replacing the telescope's three gyroscope rate sensing units (RSUs). Each unit contains two gyroscopes that allow the telescope to point itself. The first unit, RSU 2, was replaced without problems, but when they attempted to replace the second unit, RSU 3, the unit would not align onto the guide pins, and they could not seat it into the equipment bay. Managers decided to put the unit originally intended for the RSU 1 bay into the RSU 3 bay, and it was installed without problems. The pair then attempted to install the second unit into {{the third and final}} bay, but the unit again would not seat properly, and they were unable to <b>install</b> <b>it.</b> Instead, it was decided that an additional unit carried as a spare would be placed into the final bay. The spare unit was one that was removed during the STS-103 mission, and had been refurbished on the ground. The installation of all three gyro units was a critical objective of the servicing mission, as three had failed, one was offline due to electrical issues, and the other two had also been experiencing issues with performance. Ground controllers at Goddard Space Flight Center confirmed that all six gyroscopes and the new battery passed preliminary tests.|$|E

50|$|Requirements for {{handling}} the {{vast amount of}} shipboard communications during the intensifying Vietnam War led to tasking for an internal message handling system. In response, the lab developed the Message Processing and Distribution System (MPDS), <b>installing</b> <b>it</b> aboard the Seventh Fleet flagship USS Oklahoma City a month ahead of schedule. The lab improved substantially on that system later and <b>installed</b> <b>it</b> aboard Nimitz-class aircraft carriers.|$|R
25|$|In 2001, the {{original}} AstroTurf was eventually {{replaced by a}} new surface, NexTurf. It was far softer, and reportedly much easier on the knees. However, the city crew that installed the new turf reportedly did not <b>install</b> <b>it</b> properly, resulting in seams being visible in several places.|$|E
25|$|The updated {{licensing}} agreement prohibits application developers from packaging the WinHelp libraries with their installers. This means that WinHelp manuals for legacy applications are not readable {{on a new}} Windows Vista installation.

25|$|The Schenck {{family owned}} {{the house for}} three generations, finally selling it in 1784. Beginning in the 1920s, as {{real-estate}} development increased, a number of preservation plans that might have maintained the house on site were put forward but were never realized. Finally in 1952, the Brooklyn Museum {{made a commitment to}} save the house, dismantled it, and stored it for about ten years until plans to <b>install</b> <b>it</b> in the Brooklyn Museum were finalized. The house was opened to the public in 1964.|$|E
25|$|In 1925, Lou Dubois of Kingston, {{across the}} Hudson River from Red Hook, bought a popular Silk City Diner from the Paterson Vehicle Company, {{one of the}} leading diner manufacturers. He chose to <b>install</b> <b>it</b> first in an area along {{recently}} designated Route 9, the Albany Post Road, just north of nearby Rhinebeck called Astor Flats. They called it the Halfway Diner because he thought it was about halfway along Route 9 between New York City and Albany. Dubois's wife managed the diner while her husband continued to drive trucks for a beer distributor.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, {{the church}} was reordered and extended. A new altar was consecrated by the Bishop of Brentwood, Patrick Casey. In 1982, the church's {{dedication}} was changed the Immaculate Conception to Our Lady Immaculate. In 1985, the present organ was <b>installed.</b> <b>It</b> was brought from a United Reformed Church in Felsted.

In the meantime he has extended this collection to all positive ions, and he kept it updated till his death. It was important to him to compare these data statistically with various theories, in order to judge {{the quality of the}} data (and of the theories). His private interests included extended travels, the participation in a church choir and work on the genealogy of his family.|$|E
25|$|According to Oracle in 2010, the Java Runtime Environment {{was found}} on over 850 million PCs. Microsoft has not bundled a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) with its {{operating}} systems since Sun Microsystems sued Microsoft for adding Windows-specific classes to the bundled Java runtime environment, and for making the new classes available through Visual J++. Apple no longer includes a Java runtime with OS X as of version 10.7, but the system prompts the user to download and <b>install</b> <b>it</b> the first time an application requiring the JRE is launched. Many Linux distributions include the OpenJDK runtime as the default virtual machine, negating the need to download the proprietary Oracle JRE.|$|E
25|$|Windows Installer can {{advertise}} {{a product}} rather than actually <b>install</b> <b>it.</b> The product will appear installed to the user, {{but it will}} not actually be installed until it is run for the first time by triggering an entry point (by means of a Start menu shortcut, by opening a document that the product is configured to handle, or by invoking an advertised COM class). A package can be advertised by an administrator using Group Policy or other deployment mechanism, or by running the msiexec executable with the /jm (for per-machine advertisement) or /ju (for per-user advertisement) switch. Some MSI packages authored in InstallShield may prevent the use of these and other native MSI features.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} quite {{common in the}} 1980s to use {{physical}} floppy disks and the postal service for spreading software, in an activity known as mail trading. Prior to the sale of software that came on CD-ROM discs and after hard drives had become available, the software did not require the floppy disc {{to be in the}} drive when starting and using the program. So, a user could <b>install</b> <b>it</b> onto his/her computer and mail the disk to the next person, who could do the same. Particularly widespread in continental Europe, mail trading was even used by many of the leading cracker groups as their primary channel of interaction. Software copyright violation via mail trading was also the most common means for many computer hobbyists in the Eastern bloc countries to receive new Western software for their computers.|$|E
25|$|In 1807, Nicéphore Niépce and {{his brother}} Claude created what was {{probably}} the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore), but they chose to <b>install</b> <b>it</b> in a boat on the river Saone in France. Coincidentally, in 1807 the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own 'de Rivaz internal combustion engine' {{and used it to}} develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine. The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder (dried spores of the Lycopodium plant), finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil, whereas de Rivaz used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen. Neither design was very successful, {{as was the case with}} others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey, and Etienne Lenoir with his hippomobile, who each produced vehicles (usually adapted carriages or carts) powered by internal combustion engines.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the wake}} up call, the two crews began the {{procedures}} {{to move the}} Leonardo MPLM out of the orbiter's payload bay to <b>install</b> <b>it</b> on the Earth-facing port of the Harmony module. Using the station's robotic arm, Pettit and Kimbrough began maneuvering the 27,000 lb container around 16:45 UTC, and by at 18:04 UTC it was locked in place. After performing leak checks, the hatch was opened at 23:43 UTC. The crews took air samples and examined the container for any signs of condensation or shifting of the contents during launch. The container had no issues, and transfer of cargo between the container and the station began shortly after the hatch was opened. The team also worked on experiments that were flown with Endeavour, including one that involves observing spiders and butterflies in space. The experiment from Florida, Texas and Colorado schoolchildren is being conducted to compare spider webs created in microgravity with those on Earth. The insects {{will be returned to}} Earth with the shuttle for additional study.|$|E

500|$|Marochetti {{proposed}} to <b>install</b> <b>it</b> in Old Palace Yard outside the south window of Westminster Hall. His idea was {{considered by the}} Fine Arts Commission for the Palace of Westminster and was deemed acceptable, although Sir Charles Barry again opposed it. His reasoning was that Old Palace Yard was [...] "too limited in area, and too irregular and unsymmetrical in its form and approaches, to give due effect to it, {{as a work of}} art ..." [...] For his part, Marochetti positively preferred the location's irregularity to the symmetry of a formally laid-out square. The dispute continued until 1859 when the Commissioner of Works, Lord John Manners, finally agreed to install the statue in Marochetti's favoured location. By this time Sir Charles Barry was seriously ill (and died on 12 May 1860) so was no longer in a position to offer opposition.|$|E
500|$|The {{offer was}} {{promoted}} and delivered via the [...] "Get Windows10" [...] application ("GWX"), which was automatically installed via Windows Update ahead of Windows 10's release, and activated on systems deemed {{eligible for the}} upgrade offer. Via a notification area icon, users could access an application that advertised Windows10 and the free upgrade offer, check device compatibility, and [...] "reserve" [...] an automatic download of the operating system upon its release. On July 28, a pre-download process began in which Windows10 installation files were downloaded to some computers that had reserved it. Microsoft said that those who reserved Windows10 {{would be able to}} <b>install</b> <b>it</b> through GWX in a phased rollout process. The operating system could alternatively be downloaded at any time using a separate [...] "Media Creation Tool" [...] setup program (similar to Windows8's setup program), that allows for the creation of DVD or USB installation media.|$|E
500|$|Some {{equipment}} {{had been}} removed when Australia was decommissioned for use in other ships, but after the November 1923 decision by the Cabinet confirming the scuttling, RAN personnel and private contractors began to remove piping and other small fittings. Between November 1923 and January 1924, £68,000 of equipment was reclaimed; over half was donated to tertiary education centres (some of which was still in use in the 1970s), while the rest was either marked for use in future warships, or sold as souvenirs. Some consideration was given to reusing Australias 12-inch guns in coastal fortifications, but this did not occur as ammunition for these weapons was no longer being manufactured by the British, {{and the cost of}} building suitable structures was excessive. It was instead decided to sink the gun turrets and spare barrels {{with the rest of the}} ship. There was also a proposal to remove Australias conning tower and <b>install</b> <b>it</b> on the Sydney Harbour foreshore; although this did not go ahead, the idea was later used when the foremast of [...] was erected as a monument at Bradleys Head. The ship's outer port propeller is on display at the Australian War Memorial, while other artefacts are in the collections of the War Memorial, the Australian National Maritime Museum, and the Royal Australian Navy Heritage Centre.|$|E
