"I'd like {{to think}} that the John Wayne 'school of acting' {{consists}} of three things: (1) Be on time <b>for</b> <b>your</b> <b>call.</b> (2) Know your dialogue; and (3) Don't leave the camera, even if you're not in the shot. So many times, especially if you're working with younger actors, the director says [...] "cut" [...] and, boom, they scatter like quail. They've got to go make a phone call or leave for a date. Duke usually ends up directing a picture about halfway into it and he wants his actors on the set. He doesn't want to have to look around for them at the honey wagon or in their trailer. He wants them there around the camera. If you remember those three things, you could work with John Wayne. He'd like you.

And, saith he, if it be preposterous and wicked for a man and woman to cohabit together, and to enjoy the privileges of a married state without the passing of that public solemnity: So it is NO less disorderly upon a spiritual account, for any to claim the privileges of a church, or be admitted to the same, till the passing of this solemnity by them.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Media {{coverage}} of sites and institutions {{have been linked}} to an increase in Call Bombings recorded in those areas. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has published a list of bomb threats from 1969-1980. Of hundreds of threats recorded, a graphical timeline of Call Bomb frequency and Media coverage relating {{to the site of the}} threat, show great parity between the two (Mazur, 1982). This points to media {{coverage of}} a site having strong suggestive powers on potential Call Bombers. Interestingly 10% of Call Bombings were made from a phone within the site of attack (Mazur, 1982). Suggesting the possibility of perpetrators Call Bombing only with the desire to get a day off from the resulting shut down of the site. In conclusion media coverage makes a topic more salient and therefore makes it a prime target <b>for</b> <b>your</b> typical <b>Call</b> Bomber. Threats follow coverage not the other way around. Increases in media coverage is seen graphically as happening before the increase in Call Bombing, therefore debunking the possibility of a spurious correlation. Any action that gives Call Bombing notoriety will cause an increase in the number of bomb threats in general. This can be done slowly through word of mouth, but technological media expedites the process and can make a bomber famous within hours.|$|R
