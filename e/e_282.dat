40|$|The lysin LysGH 15, {{which is}} derived from the staphylococcal phage GH 15, {{demonstrates}} a wide lytic spectrum and strong lytic activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Here, we find that the lytic activity of the full-length LysGH 15 and its CHAP domain is dependent on calcium ions. To elucidate the molecular mechanism, the structures of three individual domains of LysGH 15 were determined. Unexpectedly, the crystal structure of the LysGH 15 CHAP domain reveals an "EF-hand-like" calcium-binding site near the Cys-His-Glu-Asn quartet active site groove. To date, the calcium-binding site in the LysGH 15 CHAP domain is unique among homologous proteins, and it represents the first reported calcium-binding site in the CHAP family. More importantly, the calcium ion plays an important role as a switch that modulates the CHAP domain between the active and inactive states. Structure-guided mutagenesis of the amidase- 2 domain reveals that both the zinc ion and <b>E</b> <b>282</b> are required in catalysis and enable us to propose a catalytic mechanism. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and titration-guided mutagenesis identify residues (e. g., N 404, Y 406, G 407, and T 408) in the SH 3 b domain that are involved in the interactions with the substrate. To the best of our knowledge, our results constitute the first structural information on the biochemical features of a staphylococcal phage lysin and represent a pivotal step forward in understanding this type of lysin...|$|E
40|$|The {{glycoprotein}} (G) of {{rabies virus}} assumes {{at least three}} different conformations: the native state detected at the viral surface above pH 7, the activated state involved in {{the first step of}} the fusion process, and the fusion-inactive conformation (I). A new category of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which recognized specifically the I conformation at the viral surface has recently been described. These MAbs (17 A 4 and 29 EC 2) became neutralizing when the virus was preincubated at acidic pH to induce the conformational change toward the I state of G. Mutants escaping neutralization were then selected. In this study, we have investigated the fusion and the low-pH-induced fusion inactivation properties of these mutants. All of these mutants have fusion properties {{similar to those of the}} CVS parental strain, but five mutants (<b>E</b> <b>282</b> K, M 44 I, M 44 V, V 392 G, and M 396 T) were considerably slowed in their conformational change leading to the I state. These mutants allow us to define regions that control this conformational change. These results also reinforce the idea that structural transition toward the I state is irrelevant to the fusion process. Other mutations in amino acids 10, 13, and 15 are probably located in the epitopes of selecting MAbs. Furthermore, in electron microscopy, we observed a hexagonal lattice of glycoproteins at the viral surface of mutants M 44 I and V 392 G as well as strong cooperativity in the conformational change toward the I state. This finding demonstrates the existence of lateral interactions between the spikes of a rhabdovirus...|$|E
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) and simian (SIV) {{immunodeficiency virus}} entry is mediated by binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) to CD 4 and chemokine receptors, CCR 5 and/or CXCR 4. CD 4 induces extensive conformational changes that expose and/or induce {{formation of a}} chemokine receptor binding site on gp 120. CD 4 -independent Env’s of HIV type 1 (HIV- 1), HIV- 2, and SIV have been identified that exhibit exposed chemokine receptor binding sites and can bind directly to CCR 5 or CXCR 4 {{in the absence of}} CD 4. While many studies have examined determinants for gp 120 -CCR 5 binding, analysis of gp 120 -CXCR 4 binding has been hindered by the apparently lower affinity of this interaction for X 4 -tropic HIV- 1 isolates. We show here that gp 120 proteins from two CD 4 -independent HIV- 2 Env’s, VCP and ROD/B, bind directly to CXCR 4 with an apparently high affinity. By use of CXCR 4 N-terminal deletion constructs, CXCR 4 -CXCR 2 chimeras, and human-rat CXCR 4 chimeras, binding determinants were shown to reside in the amino (N) terminus, extracellular loop 2 (ECL 2), and ECL 3. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of charged residues, ty-rosines, and phenylalanines in extracellular CXCR 4 domains implicated multiple amino acids in the N terminus (E 14 /E 15, D 20, Y 21, and D 22), ECL 2 (D 187, R 188, F 189, Y 190, and D 193), and ECL 3 (D 262, E 268, E 277, and <b>E</b> <b>282)</b> in binding, although minor differences were noted between VCP and ROD/B.

Propionates are naturally occurring substances in the normal diet. The Panel considered that forestomach hyperplasia reported in long-term studies in rodents is not a relevant endpoint for humans because humans lack this organ. Based on the reported presence of reversible diffuse epithelial hyperplasia in the oesophagus the LOAEL for a 90 -day study in dogs was considered by the Panel to be 1  % propionic acid in the diet and the NOAEL to be 0. 3  % propionic acid in the diet. The Panel considered that there is no concern with respect to genotoxicity and carcinogenicity. The Panel concluded that the present database did not allow allocation of an ADI for propionic acid - propionates. The overall mean and 95 th percentile exposures to propionic acid - propionates resulting from their use as food additives (major contributor to exposure) ranged from 0. 7 - 21. 1 and 3. 6 - 40. 8 mg/kg bw/day, respectively. The Panel noted that the concentration provoking site of contact effect in the 90 -day study in dogs (1 % propionic acid in the diet) is a factor of three higher than the concentration of propionic acid - propionates in food at the highest permitted level and concluded that for food as consumed, there would not be a safety concern from the maximum concentrations of propionic acid and its salts at their currently authorised uses and use levels as food additives...|$|E

Design: A prospective randomized, controlled trial was conducted in a university hospital after ethical approval and was carried out among children (from birth to 18 yrs). Setting: São Paulo Hospital, São Paulo, Brazil. Patients: the sample comprises 42 peripherally inserted central catheters insertions allocated randomly into two groups: 1) an ultrasound group with 21 peripherally inserted central catheters guided by ultrasound; and 2) a control group with 21 catheters, in which the peripherally inserted central catheters were inserted using vein visualization and palpation. Interventions: the procedure was performed by two trained nurses using a standard protocol for peripherally inserted central catheter insertion and ultrasound use. Ultrasound group equipment was ILook 25 (Sonosite, Bothell, WA) with a 25 -mm, 10 - to 15 -MHz linear array transducer that reaches a 4 -cm depth. Measurements and Main Results: Success in the first puncture attempt was higher (p=. 003) in the ultrasound group (90. 5 %) than in the control group (47. 6 %). the catheter positioning success rate was 85. 7 % in the ultrasound group and 52. 4 % in the control group (p=. 019). the median time spent on the procedure for the ultrasound group was 20 mins, whereas it was 50 mins for the control group (p=. 001). Conclusion: {{the use of}} ultrasound increased the successful positioning of peripherally inserted central catheters in comparison with the venous anatomic landmark visualization and palpation technique and further optimized the time spent on the procedure.

40|$|The Chilean Lake District {{is located}} in Southern Chile, between 38 ° and 42 °S. Several long {{sediment}} cores were collected in these lakes. Their analysis aims at {{a better understanding of}} the climate mechanisms related to ENSO in this part of the world. The recognition of ENSO related periodicities and their stability is studied through the analysis of two cores collected in Lago Puyehue. Several methods of spectral analysis were applied to identify potential periodicities in the signal. Blackman-Tuckey, Maximum Entropy, Multi-Taper Methods (MTM) and singular spectrum analysis were applied on the whole record. In addition evolutive MTM and wavelet analyses allow identifying temporary influence of some periodicities. First, annual varve thickness was analysed for two pilot cores. The first core is rather short, i. <b>e.</b> <b>282</b> years. A period at ˜ 3. 0 year appears in a large part of the interval, mostly in the most recent part. Periods at ˜ 5. 2 year and ˜ 23 years also show up. The second one (longer than 550 years) displays the most robust periodicities at around 15, 9, 4. 4, 3. 2 and 2. 4 years. These periodicities are in good agreement with the sub-decadal periods identified by Dean and Kemp (2004) and linked to the Quasi-Biennal Osciallation, El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Moreover, the evolutive MTM analysis and the wavelet analysis suggest a striking break in the periodicities at around 1820 A. D. This could be coherent with the end of the Little Ice Age. In fact the sedimentation process is slightly different for the two cores. Varves in the first one can be related to the flood of the Rio Golgol and in all the drainage basin, while in the second core they are more directly related to local precipitation. This could explain the difference in the recorded periodicities in the two sites. Second, magnetic susceptibility of a longer core, covering the last 18 kyr, was also analysed. It suggests several periods, i. e. 950, 750, 380, 280, 220, 208, 180 years, although their significance is questionable...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} proton-coupled peptide transporter PepT 1 is {{the major}} route of uptake for dietary nitrogen, {{as well as the}} oral absorption of a number of drugs, including β-lactam antibiotics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Here we have used site-directed mutagenesis to investigate further the role of conserved charged residues in transmembrane domains. Mutation of rabbit PepT 1 arginine 282 (R 282, transmembrane domain 7) to a positive (R 282 K) or physiologically titratable residue (R 282 H), resulted in a transporter with wild-type characteristics when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Neutral (R 282 A, R 282 Q) or negatively charged (R 282 D, R <b>282</b> <b>E)</b> substitutions gave a transporter that was not stimulated by external acidification (reducing pHout from 7. 4 to 5. 5) but transported {{at the same rate as}} the wild-type maximal rate (pHout 5. 5); however, only the R <b>282</b> <b>E</b> mutation was unable to concentrate substrate above the extracellular level. All of the R 282 mutants showed trans-stimulation of efflux comparable to the wild-type, except R 282 E-PepT 1 which was faster. A conserved negatively charged residue, aspartate 341 (D 341) in transmembrane domain 8 was implicated in forming a charge pair with R 282, as R 282 E/D 341 R- and R 282 D/D 341 R-PepT 1 had wild-type transporter characteristics. Despite their differences in ability to accumulate substrate, both R 282 E- and R 282 D-PepT 1 showed an increased charge:peptide stoichiometry over the wild-type 1 : 1 ratio for the neutral dipeptide Gly-l-Gln, measured using two-electrode voltage clamp. This extra charge movement was linked to substrate transport, as 4 -aminobenzoic acid, which binds but is not translocated, did not induce membrane potential depolarisation in R 282 E-expressing oocytes. A model is proposed for the substrate binding/translocation process in PepT 1...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Porphyria cutanea tarda is {{the most}} common form of porphyria, {{characterized}} by the decreased activity of the uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase enzyme. Several reports associated HFE gene mutations of hereditary hemochromatosis with porphyria cutanea tarda worldwide, although up to date only one study has been conducted in Brazil. OBJECTIVES: Investigation of porphyria cutanea tarda association with C 282 Y and H 63 D mutations in the HFE gene. Identification of precipitating factors (hepatitis C, HIV, alcoholism and estrogen) and their link with HFE mutations. METHODS: An ambispective study of 60 patients with PCT was conducted during the period from 2003 to 2012. Serological tests for hepatitis C and HIV were performed and histories of alcohol abuse and estrogen intake were investigated. HFE mutations were identified with real-time PCR. RESULTS: Porphyria cutanea tarda predominated in males and alcohol abuse was the main precipitating factor. Estrogen intake was the sole precipitating factor present in 25 % of female patients. Hepatitis C was present in 41. 7 %. All HIV-positive patients (15. 3 %) had a history of alcohol abuse. Allele frequency for HFE mutations, i. <b>e.,</b> C <b>282</b> Y (p = 0. 0001) and H 63 D (p = 0. 0004), were significantly higher in porphyria cutanea tarda patients, compared to control group. HFE mutations had no association with the other precipitating factors. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol abuse, hepatitis C and estrogen intake are prevalent precipitating factors in our porphyria cutanea tarda population; however, hemochromatosis in itself can also contribute to the outbreak of porphyria cutanea tarda, which makes the research for HFE mutations necessary in these patient...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Leishmaniasis is {{expanding}} across Brazil, including the State of Mato Grosso (MT). The {{aim of this}} study was to characterize the phlebotomine sandfly fauna at threerural settlements located in the municipality of Cáceres, MT, from August 2010 to July 2011. METHODS: Sandfly captures were conducted at the forest border and in intra and peridomicile areas with automatic light traps, biweekly, from 5 pm to 6 am. RESULTS: Of the 630 sandflies collected, 348 were female, and 282 were male. Captured specimens were distributed across 11 genera - Brumptomyia, Evandromyia, Expapillata, Lutzomyia, Martinsmyia, Micropygomyia, Nyssomyia, Pintomyia, Psathyromyia, Psychodopygus, and Sciopemyia - and 28 species. Among these, six species had not been marked yet in MT (Brumptomyia avellari, Br. mangabeirai, Evandromyia aldafalcaoae, Micropygomyia echinatopharynx, Micropygomyia peresi, and Pa. campograndensis). Nyssomyia whitmani was the most abundant species across ecotopes at all settlements. Interestingly, Lutzomyia longipalpis and Lutzomyia cruzi were found in sympatry. CONCLUSIONS: The disorganized occupation of the environment that is happening at the rural settlements of Mata Comprida, Laranjeira I and II could provide opportunities for the domiciliation of wild populations of phlebotomine, including vectors of leishmaniasis. Therefore, more studies are needed to understand the epidemiology of the disease in these areas and its impact on the human population. INTRODUÇÃO: As leishmanioses encontram-se em expansão no Brasil, inclusive no Estado de Mato Grosso (MT). A presente pesquisa teve como objetivo estudar a fauna flebotomínica emtrês assentamentos rurais localizados no município de Cáceres, MT, entre agosto de 2010 e julhode 2011. MÉTODOS: As coletas foram realizadas na margem da mata, no intra e peridomicílio com armadilhas automáticas luminosas, quinzenalmente, das 17 h às 6 h. RESULTADOS: Foram coletados 630 exemplares, sendo 348 fêmeas <b>e</b> <b>282</b> machos. Os espécimes foramdistribuídos em 11 gêneros: Brumptomyia, Evandromyia, Expapillata, Lutzomyia, Martinsmyia,Micropygomyia, Nyssomyia, Pintomyia, Psathyromyia, Psychodopygus e Sciopemyia e 28 espécies, sendo que dentre estas, seis não haviam sido assinaladas em MT (Brumptomyia avellari, Br. mangabeirai, Evandromyia aldafalcaoae, Micropygomyia echinatopharynx, Micropygomyia peresi e Pa. campograndensis). Ressalta-se o encontro de Nyssomyia whitmani, espécie mais abundante nos diferentes ecótopos em todos os assentamentos. Destaca-se também a presençadas espécies Lutzomyia longipalpis e Lutzomyia cruzi em simpatria.

METHODS: A population-based case-control study was performed. Data collection was carried out from May 16, 2002 to October 15, 2002 {{in the city of}} Botucatu, southeast Brazil. Cases were defined as workers who had suffered typical work-related injuries in a 90 -day period previously to the study, and who identified through systematic random sampling of their households. Controls were non-injured workers randomly sampled from the same population, matched on 3 : 1 ratio according to sex, age group and census track. A multiple logistic regression model was adjusted, where the independent variable was exposure to occupational noise, controlled for covariates of interest. RESULTS: A total of 94 cases and 282 controls were analyzed. An adjusted multiple regression model showed that "work always exposed to high-level noise" and "work sometimes exposed to high-level noise" were associated to a relative risk for work-related injuries of about 5. 0 (95 % CI: 2. 8 - 8. 7; p< 0. 001) and 3. 7 (95 % CI: 1. 8 - 7. 4; p= 0. 0003) respectively, when work not exposed to noise was taken as a reference, controlled for several covariates.

A infectividade dos vírus, em diferentes períodos de armazenamento, foi testada em plantas de datura e glutinosa, para se determinar a longevidade in vitro. Constatou-se que, quando guardados em baixas temperaturas,os extratos preservam por mais tempo a infectividade dos vírus. No caso de datura e glutinosa, por exemplo, resultados positivos foram obtidos até 413 <b>e</b> <b>282</b> dias de armazenamento, respectivamente, em congelador. Entretanto, com relação às espécies de Chenopodium testadas, mesmo alguns extratos recém-preparados conduziram a resultados negativos, confirmando a presença de inibidores de infecção viral nestas plantas. Das três espécies, é sugerida a utilização apenas de C. quinoa para o preparo de extratos visando preservar estes vírus e, assim mesmo, por um período relativamente curto (entre 53 e 80 dias). A avaliação geral dos resultados mostra que, para os tymovírus estudados neste trabalho, é possível conservar a infectividade através da técnica de armazenamento de extratos foliares de plantas sistemicamente infectadas.

The extracts were kept at room temperature, at about 5 +C and at about 20 +C. Sap containing viruses were periodically inoculated in test-plants (datura and glutinosa) {{in order to}} determine the longevity in vitro. It was verified that viruses remained infective for longer periods if extratcs were kept at low temperatures as compared with those maintained at room temperature.

However, many negative results were obtained with Chenopodium species even when freshly prepared leaf juice were used. This fact may be understood by the presence of virus inhibitors in these plants. Only C. quinoa is a valuable host to be used to preserve four EMV isolates, although for a short period (more than 53 and less than 80 days).

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} recent efforts undertaken to examine the mechanical properties and microstructural stability of first-stage silicon nitride blades and nozzles after field testing in an industrial gas turbine. Two commercially available silicon nitrides, i. <b>e.,</b> Kyocera SN <b>282</b> vanes and SN 281 blades, were successfully evaluated in the 100 h final phase engine test at Solar Turbines Incorporated. The turbine rotor inlet tempera-ture was increased from 10101 to 11211 C at 100 % speed during the engine test with efficiency increasing from 28. 8 % to 30. 1 %. Results of scanning electron microscopy showed that apparent materials recession still occurred during the 100 h engine test, especially in the leading and trailing edge regions where the gas pressure or velocity was the highest. The apparent material re-cession of the airfoils resulted from the volatilization of the nor-mally protective silica layer, evidenced by the increased surface roughness and porous Lu 2 Si 2 O 7 surface layer features. On the other hand, mechanical results generated using a ball-on-ring test technique showed that little strength degradation was meas-ured after the 100 h engine test...|$|R
40|$|Tick-borne {{encephalitis}} is {{a natural}} focal transmissible zooanthroponosis. The causative agent of the disease is a tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) belonging to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae and is widespread in Eurasia. Current TBEV classification based on molecular genetic data comprises three phylogenetically separate subtypes: Far Eastern, European and Siberian (TBEV-Sib). Further differentiation of TBEV isn't developed, {{making it difficult to}} investigate the origins, distribution and evolution of the virus. In the present study we determined the nucleotide sequence of the gene <b>E</b> fragment for <b>282</b> TBEV-Sib isolates from Ixodes persulcatus ticks or their pools from various natural foci in Russia. Analysis of these sequences and sequences obtained from the GenBank database (more than 600), made it possible to cluster TBEV-Sib strains by identical amino acid sequences of a glycoprotein E fragment. In total, 18 groups were identified (from 3 to 285 strains in the group). It was shown that TBEV strains belonging to the same group are phylogenetically related and have a territorial attachment showing either a local or a corridor type distribution. These groups were named as clusterons showed to be the smallest unit of TBEV classification. The grouping of TBEV strains allows characterization of endemic areas both in quantitative and qualitative composition of the clusterons. The approach could be successfully used to record and monitor the TBEV populations. © 2012 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

As plantas em casa de vegetação foram inoculadas com os vírus individualmente e em mistura aos 12 e 22 dias após emergência (DAE) e aos 5, 15 e 25 DAE no campo. Em casa de vegetação, as infecções com PRSV-W + ZYMV, PRSV-W e ZYMV, na primeira época de inoculação, ocasionaram reduções de área foliar de 39, 6 %, 36, 8 % e 12, 1 %, respectivamente. As massas fresca e seca também foram significativamente afetadas na primeira época de inoculação. No campo, as plantas com infecções individuais ou mistas dos potyvírus produziram frutos não comerciais em quantidades que variaram de 14 a 861 g/planta, dependendo da idade que foram inoculadas. As plantas tratadas com tampão fosfato aos 5, 15 e 25 DAE produziram em média 573 g, 937 g e 1172 g de frutos comerciais <b>e</b> <b>282</b> g, 221 g e 192 g de frutos não comerciais, respectivamente. A redução na massa fresca das plantas foi diretamente relacionada com a época de inoculação, com médias de 60, 7 % para aquelas inoculadas aos 5 DAE e de 22, 7 % para aquelas inoculadas aos 15 DAE.

40|$|OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste estudo é o de identificar as diversas causas que nos obrigam a novo procedimento cirúrgico. Apesar de várias alterações técnicas como platinectomia total, platinectomia parcial, interposição óssea, fenestra na platina e o emprego de vários tipos de próteses, os problemas continuam a existir, talvez também pelo pouco treinamento feito pelos residentes nos Centros Universitários, onde o número de cirurgias estapedianas vem caindo ano a ano, o que leva à pouca experiência destes residentes em sua vida futura. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Avaliação Retrospectiva. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Baseou-se em 74 casos de revisões de estapedectomia, {{realizadas}} em 68 pacientes, sendo 47 ouvidos submetidos à primeira revisão e 4 ouvidos submetidos à uma segunda revisão, todos operados anteriormente pelo autor, de uma população de 725 estapedectomias realizadas na clínica privada <b>e</b> <b>282</b> estapedectomias realizadas no Hospital Universitário Antônio Pedro (HUAP) - Universidade Federal Fluminense/Niterói-RJ, de julho de 1980 a junho de 1999. Acrescentamos mais 21 casos operados de primeira revisão e de 2 casos operados de segunda revisão oriundos de outros serviços. RESULTADOS: Considerando todos os casos de revisões cirúrgicas realizadas, os ganhos auditivos obtidos foram os seguintes: em 78, 3 % dos pacientes os ganhos auditivos alcançados foram de até 20 dB; em 10, 8 % dos pacientes de 20 dB a 25 dB; em 8, 2 % dos pacientes acima de 25 dB, tendo ocorrido anacusia em 2, 7 % dos pacientes. A avaliação auditiva incluiu o limiar aéreo-ósseo de 250 a 8000 Hz com a discriminação vocal e o SRT, sendo que nas freqüências de 500, 1000 e 2000 Hz os limiares das vias aérea e óssea foram calculados através dos audiogramas realizados nos pré e pós-operatórios. Os resultados auditivos pós-operatórios dependem da afecção cirúrgica encontrada, principalmente pela presença ou ausência da bigorna e pela reobliteração óssea na janela do vestíbulo. Fizemos o acompanhamento audiológico de todos os ouvidos operados após seis meses da cirurgia e de sessenta e seis ouvidos operados com um ano de cirurgia e com oito pacientes não retornando ao segundo exame. AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study is to identify the various reasons for a new surgical procedure to be decided on. In spite of several technical alterations, such as total platinectomy, partial platinectomy, bone interposition, fenestration in the footplate and the use of different types of prosthesis, there are still many problems concerning the improvement of impaired hearing, partly due to insufficient training of resident doctors at the University Centers, where the number of stapedial surgeries has been decreasing year after year. This creates a situation in which our resident doctors have little opportunity to gain experience in this area. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Evaluation. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was based on 74 cases of revision stapedectomy, performed in 68 patients, being that 47 ears were submitted to revision and all of them have been previously operated on by the first author above mentioned, out of a population of 725 stapedectomies performed at Antonio Pedro University Hospital (HUAP) Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro (UFF) / Niterói-RJ, from July 1980 to June 1999. We added 21 more cases of revision surgery originated elsewhere. As far as obliteration of the oval window was concerned, for which cutting drills were used, there were 04 cases of variable sensorineural hearing loss and 02 cases of anacusis. The cases of vertigo and / or loss of balance with possible perilymphatic fistula were solved by means of replacement of the long prosthesis by a smaller one, the vertigo and/or loss of balance being thus eliminated. We conducted the audiologic follow-up of all operated ears 06 months after the surgery and of 66 operated ears, 08 patients had not undergone a second examination 01 year after. Auditory postoperative results depend on the surgical pathology found, {{not only because of the}} presence or absence of the incus but also because of the osseous reobliteration of the oval window. CONCLUSION: Considering all revisionsurgery cases, the auditory gains obtained were the following: for 78. 3 % of the patients, the auditory threshold was as low as 20 db, for 10. 8 % of the patients, it ranged from 20 dB to 25 dB, and for 8. 2 % of the patients, it was only above 25 %; there was anacusis in 2. 7 % of the patients. The standard audiologic evaluation included pure tone threshold for air and bone conduction at 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 8000 Hz, speech recognition threshold and speech discrimination score. The PTA at 500, 1000 and 2000 was calculated for air and bone curves from both preoperative and postoperative audiograms...|$|E
40|$|To {{assess the}} subsites {{involved}} in substrate binding in Aspergillus niger endopolygalacturonase II, residues {{located in the}} potential substrate binding cleft stretching along the enzyme from the N to the C terminus were subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. Mutant enzymes were characterized {{with respect to their}} kinetic parameters using polygalacturonate as a substrate and with respect to their mode of action using oligogalacturonates of defined length (n = 3 - 6). In addition, the effect of the mutations on the hydrolysis of pectins with various degrees of esterification was studied. Based on the results obtained with enzymes N 186 <b>E</b> and D <b>282</b> K it was established that the substrate binds with the nonreducing end toward the N terminus of the enzyme. Asn 186 is located at subsite 4, and Asp 282 is located at subsite 2. The mutations D 183 N and M 150 Q, both located at subsite 2, affected catalysis, probably mediated via the sugar residue bound at subsite 1. Tyr 291, located at subsite 1 and strictly conserved among endopolygalacturonases appeared indispensable for effective catalysis. The mutations E 252 A and Q 288 E, both located at subsite 2, showed only slight effects on catalysis and mode of action. Tyr 326 is probably located at the imaginary subsite 3. The mutation Y 326 L affected the stability of the enzyme. For mutant E 252 A, an increased affinity for partially methylesterified substrates was recorded. Enzyme N 186 E displayed the opposite behavior; the specificity for completely demethylesterified regions of substrate, already high for the native enzyme, was increased. The origin {{of the effects of the}} mutations is discussed...|$|R

First published May 22, 2012; doi: 10. 1152 /ajpendo. 00053. 2012. -The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate whether treatment with tributyrin (Tb; a butyrate prodrug) results in protection against diet-induced obesity and associated insulin resistance. C 57 BL/ 6 male mice fed a standard chow or high-fat diet were treated with Tb (2 g/kg body wt, 10 wk) and evaluated for glucose homeostasis, plasma lipid profile, and inflammatory status. Tb protected mice against obesity and obesity-associated insulin resistance and dyslipidemia without food consumption being affected. Tb attenuated the production of TNF alpha and IL- 1 beta by peritoneal macrophages and their expression in adipose tissue. Furthermore, in the adipose tissue, Tb reduced the expression of MCP- 1 and infiltration by leukocytes and restored the production of adiponectin. These effects were associated with a partial reversion of hepatic steatosis, reduction in liver and skeletal muscle content of phosphorylated JNK, and an improvement in muscle insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and Akt signaling. Although part of the beneficial effects of Tb are likely to be secondary to the reduction in body weight, we also found direct protective actions of butyrate reducing TNF alpha production after LPS injection and in vitro by LPS- or palmitic acid-stimulated macrophages and attenuating lipolysis in vitro and in vivo. The results, reported herein, suggest that Tb may be useful for the treatment and prevention of obesity-related metabolic disorders.

The author has decided the parturition period, litter size and sex-ratio of this mouse from the result of collection of the nest, suckling and young. This study has chiefly been carried out from May, 1957 to December, 1959 at the dry-river bed of the Chikugo which runs {{in the suburbs of}} Kurume City, Fukuoka Prefecture. The results are as follows: 1) The parturition period of this kind of mouse is divided into two periods, namely, May to June and September to December under natural conditions. Among many environmental factors, temperature seems to have a close relation with the parturition period. 2) The average litter size in May to June is 4. 00 ± 0. 34 (S. E.) (total number of suckling and young are 68 in 17 cases), while 6. 11 ± 0. 23 (S. E.) (total number 214 in 35 cases) in September to December. As the result of statistical inspection using the confidence of intervals of the population mean (under the level of significance 1 %), significant difference has been found between these two figures. The average litter size throughout a year is 5. 42 ± 0. 23 (S. <b>E.)</b> (total number <b>282</b> in 52 cases). 3) The sex-ratio is ♀ 100. 00 : ♂ 115. 94, but it has been clarified that there is {{no significant difference between the}} number of male and female as the result of X^ 2 -test. ここ数年間に主として福岡県久留米市郊外の筑後川河原で観察,採集を行なつた乳幼仔および球巣に基づいて,九州産カヤネズミの出産期, 1 腹産仔数,性比について調べた,結果は次の通りである. 1) 野外での九州産カヤネズミの出産期は 5, 6 月と 9 ～ 12 月の 2 期にわけられ,温度ともつとも関係があると考えられる. 2) 産仔数の平均値土標準誤差は, 5, 6 月は 4. 00 ± 0. 34 頭(乳幼仔総数 68 頭, 17 例), 9 ～ 12,月には 6. 11 ± 0. 23 頭(乳幼仔総数 214 頭, 35 例) で,母集団平均の信頼限界(危険率 1 %) を使つて検討した結果,有意差が認められた. 年平均産仔数は 5. 42 ± 0. 23 頭(乳幼仔総数 282 頭, 52 例) となる. 3) 性比は雌 100. 00 :雄 115. 94 で,X^ 2 検定の結果,雌雄数に有意差は認められなかつた...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: avaliar a associação da expressão das proteínas p 53 e Ki- 67 no tumor com achados clínico-patológicos em pacientes com {{carcinoma}} invasor de colo uterino. MÉTODOS: foram estudadas amostras de tumor obtidas de 36 pacientes submetidas a histerectomia radical para tratamento de carcinoma invasor do colo uterino estádio IB (FIGO). Amostras do tumor foram fixadas em formol e incluídas em parafina. O material foi analisado pela histopatologia (hematoxilina e eosina) e processado para marcação imuno-histoquímica por anticorpos monoclonais contra as proteínas p 53 e Ki- 67. Os dados foram analisados pelo teste de chi 2 para a avaliação das diferenças entre os grupos. RESULTADOS: a idade das pacientes variou de 27 a 73 anos (48, 7 ± 10, 4 anos). O estadiamento clínico (FIGO) foi IB 1 em 27 casos (75 %) e IB 2 em 9 casos (25 %). A expressão tumoral da proteína p 53 foi positiva em metade dos casos. Em relação à expressão do Ki- 67, foi evidenciado alto grau de proliferação celular em 73, 3 % dos casos. Não houve associação da expressão das proteínas p 53 e Ki- 67 no tumor com idade (p= 0, 091 e 0, 900), estadiamento (p= 0, 054 e 0, 667), tipo histológico (p= 0, 674 e 0, 674), grau de diferenciação (p= 0, 07 <b>e</b> 0, <b>282),</b> presença de invasão linfovascular (p= 0, 248 e 0, 667), acometimento parametrial (p= 0, 729 e 0, 763) e metástases para os linfonodos pélvicos (p= 0, 729 e 0, 636, respectivamente). CONCLUSÕES: a expressão tumoral das proteínas p 53 e Ki- 67 não se associou com achados clínico-patológicos em pacientes com carcinoma invasor do colo uterino estádio IB. PURPOSE: {{to evaluate}} the association between p 53 and Ki- 67 expression in the tumor and clinicopathological features in patients with carcinoma of the cervix. METHODS: samples {{were taken from the}} tumor of 36 patients with stage IB (FIGO) cervical carcinoma submitted to radical hysterectomy. Tissue samples were taken from the tumor, fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. The specimens were analyzed by histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin) and immunohistochemically evaluated using monoclonal antibodies for p 53 and Ki- 67. Data were analyzed statistically by the chi 2 test to evaluate eventual differences between the groups. RESULTS: the age of the patients ranged from 27 to 73 years (48. 7 ± 10. 4 years). Clinical stage (FIGO) was IB 1 in 27 cases (75 %) and IB 2 in 9 cases (25 %). A positive tumoral expression of the p 53 protein was found in half of the cases. In relation to the Ki- 67 expression, a high cell proliferation index was shown in 73. 3 % of the cases. There was no association between tumoral p 53 and Ki- 67 expression with age (p= 0. 091 and 0. 900), clinical stage (p= 0. 054 and 0. 667), histological classification (p= 0. 674 and 0. 674), grade of differentiation (p= 0. 070 and 0. 282), presence of lymphatic vascular space invasion (p= 0. 248 and 0. 667), parametrial involvement (p= 0. 729 and 0. 763) and pelvic lymph node metastasis (p= 0. 729 and 0. 636, respectively).

40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis virus (IPNV) is the causative {{agent of}} IPN, an important disease of salmonids. IPNV infections result in either sub-clinical or overt {{disease and the}} basis of this difference is not well understood. The objective {{of the present study was}} to determine the VP 2 gene of the virus associated with the different forms of clinical manifestation. Groups of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) reared in farms located in different IPN disease pressures were monitored from brood stock until grow-out over a 3 year period. Hatcheries A 1 and B 1 as well as cooperating seawater farms were located in a low disease risk area while hatcheries A 2 and B 2 as well as their cooperating seawater farms were in high IPN risk areas. Samples including eggs, milt, whole fry, kidney depending on the stage of production were collected during outbreaks or in apparently healthy populations where no outbreaks occurred. The virus was re-isolated in CHSE cells and the VP 2 gene amplified by RT-PCR followed by sequencing. During the freshwater stage, there were no disease outbreaks at hatcheries A 1, A 2 and B 1 (except in one fish group that originated from hatchery B 2), although IPNV was isolated from some of the fish groups at all 3 hatcheries. By contrast, all fish groups at hatchery B 2 suffered IPN outbreaks. In seawater, only groups of fish originating from hatchery A 1 had no IPN outbreaks albeit virus being isolated from the fish. On the other hand, fish originating from hatcheries A 2, B 1 and B 2 experienced outbreaks in seawater. The VP 2 amino acid fingerprint of the virus associated with subclinical infections from A 1 and co-operating seawater sites was V 64 A 137 P 217 T 221 A 247 N 252 S 281 D <b>282</b> <b>E</b> 319. By contrast, all virus isolates associated with clinical infections had the motif I 64 T 137 T 217 A 221 T 247 V 252 T 281 N 282 A 319, where underlined amino acids represent the avirulent and highly virulent motif, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequences showed 2 clades, one of isolates associated with subclinical infections (from A 1 and cooperating seawater farms) and the other of isolates from fish with overt disease (all other sites). Furthermore, the clustering pattern of isolates suggests more circulation of virus within fish groups rather than between them...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the functional {{activity of the}} classical and alternative pathways of the complement system and the levels of C 3, C 4, and factor B during the first episode of meningococcal infection and during the convalescence period. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ten Brazilian children {{ranging in age from}} 8 months to 8 years, admitted from 1991 to 1993 with a clinical-laboratory diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis, were studied during acute infection (up to 7 days from diagnosis) and during the convalescence period (1 to 6 months after the acute episode). C 3, C 4, and Factor B were measured using nephelometry, and the lytic activity of classical and alternative pathways were evaluated by a kinetic method and expressed as the time needed to lyse 50 % of an erythrocyte suspension (T 1 / 2, expressed in seconds). Low T 1 / 2 values for classical and alternative pathways correlate with high activities of the classical and alternative complement pathways, respectively. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed between the alternative pathway lytic activity during infection and the convalescence period (282 vs 238 seconds, respectively, P =. 01). No differences were detected in the other complement parameters analyzed. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of meningococcal meningitis, the alternative pathway is preferentially activated. This is probably due to the greater ability of the meningococcal endotoxin to activate this pathway in vivo. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a atividade funcional das vias clássica e alternativa do sistema complemento e os níveis de C 3, C 4 e fator B durante o primeiro episódio de infecção meningocócica e durante a convalescença. PACIENTES E MÉTODOS: Dez crianças brasileiras com idades entre 8 meses e 8 anos, admitidas de 1991 a 1993, com diagnóstico clínico-laboratorial de meningite meningocócica, foram estudadas durante infecção aguda (até 7 dias do diagnóstico) e no período de convalescença (entre 1 e 6 meses após). C 3, C 4 e fator B foram quantificados por nefelometria e a atividade lítica das vias clássica e alternativa foi avaliada por método cinético e expressa como tempo necessário para lisar 50 % de uma suspensão de eritrócitos (T 1 / 2, expresso em segundos). Baixos valores de T 1 / 2 das vias clássica e alternativa se correlacionam com elevadas atividades de via clássica e via alternativa, respectivamente. RESULTADOS: Observaram-se diferenças significativas entre a atividade lítica da via alternativa durante a infecção e no período de convalescença (<b>282</b> <b>e</b> 238 segundos, respectivamente, P=. 01). Nenhuma diferença foi detectada nos outros parâmetros analisados. CONCLUSÕES: Na presença de meningite meningocócica a via alternativa é preferencialmente ativada, provavelmente devido à maior capacidade da endotoxina meningocócica para ativar esta via, in vivo...|$|R
