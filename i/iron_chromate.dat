40|$|I. The {{thermomagnetic}} {{behavior and}} infrared spectroscopic features of KFe 3 (SO 4) 2 (OH) 6 (jarosite), (H 3 O) Fe 3 (SO 4) 2 (OH) 6 (hydronium jarosite), KFe 3 (CrO 4) 2 (OH) 6, Fe(OH) SO 4 (basic iron sulfate), and Fe(OH) CrO 4 (basic <b>iron</b> <b>chromate)</b> are reported. Fe(OH) CrO 4 and KFe 3 (CrO 4) 2 (OH) 6 are {{shown to be}} weak ferro magnets with Curie temperatures of 73 and 71 °K, respectively. This unusual magnetic behavior is rationalized {{in terms of the}} ionic spin configurations of the phases. Exchange coupling through chromate bridging groups is shown to be weak. II. The magnetic behavior and the influence of preparative history on the magnetic behavior of δFeO(OH) is reported. δFeO(OH) is shown to be a fine-particulate, uniaxial, magnetic species. Magnetization data for this species are shown to be consistent with the existence of magnetically inactive layers surrounding magnetic particles. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} {{behavior and}} infrared spectroscopic features of KFe_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 (jarosite), (H_ 3 O) Fe_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 (hydronium jarosite), KFe_ 3 (CrO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6, Fe(OH) SO_ 4 (basic iron sulfate) and Fe(OH) CrO_ 4 (basic <b>iron</b> <b>chromate)</b> are reported. Spectroscopic data are {{in accord with}} X-ray data which show that KFe_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6, (H_ 3 O) Fe_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6, and KFe_ 3 (CrO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 are isostructural with KAl_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 (akunite). All the species exhibit negative deviations from Curie-Weiss behavior over the temperature range 300 - 76 °K. The compounds KFe_ 3 (CrO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 and Fe(OH) CrO_ 4 undergo ferrimagnetic transitions at 73 and 71 °K, respectively. Maxima occur in the susceptibilities of KFe_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 and (H_ 3 O) Fe_ 3 (SO_ 4) _ 2 (OH) _ 6 at 45 and 50 °K...|$|E
40|$|The coulometric {{titration}} of thiosulfate with iodine {{has been}} investigated at different hydrogen ion concentrations. The applicability of this titration to the determination of oxidizing agents has been demonstrated by determining microgram quantities of ferric <b>iron,</b> <b>chromate,</b> and selenious acid. A modification of the Norris and Fay method for the volumetric determination of selenious acid {{has been compared to}} a proven, but less direct method. It has been shown that tripositive antimony can be titrated in concentrated hydrochloric acid solutions more successfully with chlorine than with bromine. Evidence concerning the nature of the species of tripositive and pentapositive antimony existing hydrochloric acid solutions has been obtained amperometrically during the coulometric titrations in hydrochloric acid of tripositive antimony with bromine and chlorine, and of pentapositive antimony with cuprous copper. The indicator currents obtained with an amperometric system during the reduction of iodate with cuprous copper and during the oxidation of iodide with both chlorine and ceric cerium have been investigated as functions of the hydrogen ion concentration, the chloride concentration, and the applied potential. A quantitative study of the amperometric system used for above measurements has been made. An equation has been derived which relates the indicator current to the applied potential and to the concentrations of electrode-reactive species in the solution. Experimental tests have been made on the ferrocyanide-ferricyanide half-cell. The amperometric end point is discussed...|$|E

40|$|If an {{iron wire}} ic brought {{into contact with}} the surface of mercury, kept under a dilute {{solution}} of sulphuric acid, containing a little potassium dichromate, the mercury begins to pulsate. This interesting phenomenon has been referred to as the " Mercury Heart ". Its exact mechanism has been a puzzle, as can be gathered from the following observation of Thompson 2 : " Why <b>iron</b> and <b>chromate</b> are the only means of producing this effect, however, {{does not seem to have}} been explained. ...|$|R
50|$|Chromating {{is often}} {{performed}} on galvanized parts {{to make them}} more durable. The chromate coating acts as paint does, protecting the zinc from white corrosion, thus making the part considerably more durable, depending on the chromate layer's thickness. Steel and <b>iron</b> cannot be <b>chromated</b> directly. Chromating zinc plated steel does not enhance zinc's cathodic protection of the underlying steel from rust.|$|R
5|$|For the {{production}} of pure chromium, the iron must {{be separated from the}} chromium in a two step roasting and leaching process. The chromite ore is heated with a mixture of calcium carbonate and sodium carbonate in the presence of air. The chromium is oxidized to the hexavalent form, while the iron forms the stable Fe2O3. The subsequent leaching at higher elevated temperatures dissolves the chromates and leaves the insoluble <b>iron</b> oxide. The <b>chromate</b> is converted by sulfuric acid into the dichromate.|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristic}} potential obtained {{just before}} decay of passivity (Flade potential) was measured for iron passivated by ferrates, nitrites, chromates, molybdates, tungstates, conc. HNOs, and by anodic polarization in H~SO,. The Flade potential is linear with pH, of slope 0. 059 up to approximately pH 4. 5. Above this value up to pH 11. 5, the potentials tend to follow {{an extension of}} the data in acids in the case of <b>iron</b> passivated by <b>chromates</b> and nitrites, but reach a constant value for iron passivated anodically or by conc. HNOs. The standard Flade potential (pH ~ 0) for various passivators i increasingly noble in the order: nitrite ( [...] 0. 50 v); chromate, ferrate, molybdate ( [...] 0. 54 v); tungstate ( [...] 0. 61 v); and anodic polarization or conc. HNO 8 ( [...] 0. 64 v). The average of these values is in reasonable accord with previously reported values and only small observed eviations from the average indicate that the structure and composition of the passive film on iron is largely independent of the passi-vation process...|$|R
