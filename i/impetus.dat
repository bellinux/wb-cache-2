5|$|Jean Buridan (1300–1358) also {{rejected}} {{the notion that}} this motion-generating property, which he named <b>impetus,</b> dissipated spontaneously. Buridan's position was that a moving object would be arrested by {{the resistance of the}} air and the weight of the body which would oppose its <b>impetus.</b> He also maintained that <b>impetus</b> increased with speed; thus, his initial idea of <b>impetus</b> was similar in many ways to the modern concept of momentum. Despite the obvious similarities to more modern ideas of inertia, Buridan saw his theory as only a modification to Aristotle's basic philosophy, maintaining many other peripatetic views, including the belief that there was still a fundamental difference between an object in motion and an object at rest. Buridan also maintained that <b>impetus</b> could be not only linear, but also circular in nature, causing objects such as celestial bodies to move in a circle.|$|E

40|$|This study examined: first, the <b>impetuses</b> {{college faculty}} respond to as they propose new degree programs; and, second, whether these <b>impetuses</b> can be {{correlated}} with the components of either resource dependence or institutional theory. It also examined implications of "vertical extension " (whereby institutions extend their academic programs upwardly) and "academic drift " (the tendency of institutions to copy the role and mission of prestige institutions) as related to new degree programs. Institutional theory suggests that three type of isomorphic forces influence organizations: mimetic forces, normative forces, and coercive forces. Resource dependence theory proposes {{that the key to}} an organization's success is its ability to acquire and maintain resources within an interdependent model of causes or agents. Interviews were conducted with the 39 faculty at 13 research or comprehensive universities who had been active in the proposal and implementation of new degree programs. Faculty cited three major <b>impetuses</b> for adding new degree programs: (1) intra-university competition for stature; (2) competition for new faculty members; and (3) community need and student demand. Results support both resource-dependence theory and institutional theory. (Contains 29 references.) (DB) Reproductions supplied by EDRS are the best that can be made from the original document...|$|R

40|$|The {{view that}} {{agriculture}} is undergoing replacement {{of one kind}} of human capital by another is offered as altemative to the traditional view that resources are chronically oversupplied to farming. The hypothesis that high level management farms have experienced favorable cost curve shifts explains farm number declines as primarily replacement of many low management by fewer high management farms. The replacement raises efficiency modestly. Occupational supply behavior relations for management levels lead to inferences about income distribution and future structure of agriculture. A price-income policy is suggested to compensate outmoded management for obsolescence. D E CLI NE S IN NUMBER of persons and in-creases in material inputs in farmingin {{the past two decades}} may be the largest shifts in resource use ever to occur in such a short period. Explaining the rate at which these changes occur remains a challenge.

5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in a vacuum, bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan <b>impetus</b> dynamics in which <b>impetus</b> is self-dissipating and free-fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E
