Optimal growth frequency (1 / 13) was obtained when Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) -transformed donor B lymphocytes were used as stimulators (D-BLCL) {{in the presence of}} interleukin 2 (IL- 2). The 55 clones analyzed were all T 1 and T 3 +, and all expressed DR antigens (45 % were T 8 + and 55 % T 4 +). Only one clone had a double-labeled (T 4 + T 8 +) surface. All cells proliferated significantly against D-BLCL, although T 4 + clones had a significantly shorter average doubling time than T 8 clones. Nearly all T 8 clones were specifically cytotoxic for D-BLCL, while both T 4 and T 8 did not react against K 562, autologous EBV-BLCL, and third-party EBV-BLCL.

30|$|The {{culture of}} <b>harvested</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> with a soluble anti-CD 3 {{antibody}} (OKT 3) {{in the presence}} of interleukin (IL)- 2 (Riddell and Greenberg, 1990) has been widely used and continues to be used in current cell therapy trials. Preliminary studies suggest that this method of expansion produces cells that are largely effector memory and effector T cells in phenotype (Gattinoni et al., 2005; Powell et al., 2005). Potential improvements have been explored, including the addition of feeder cells and the use of supplemental cytokines (Yang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2013). In our current study, we sought to develop a novel T cell ex vivo expansion method that could easily be improved further. It has been reported that T cells can be stimulated and expanded by the K 562 cell line expressing OKT 3 scFv and other immune accessory molecules (Butler et al., 2012) and that synergy between CD 28 and 4 - 1 BB co-stimulation can be achieved by including their cytoplasmic domains arranged in tandem (Kloss et al., 2013; Stephan et al., 2007; Watts, 2005). In our study, an OKT 3 - 28 BB molecule was designed to combine stimulation (Anti-CD 3 scFv is expressed on the cell surface to provide cis- and trans-stimulation to T cells) and co-stimulation (CD 28 and 4 - 1 BB, provided in cis form to T cells stimulated via anti-CD 3 scFv) in a single structure for efficient human T cell expansion. It was found that T cells could only be expanded by starting with PBMCs, not with purified T cells (data not shown), suggesting that some cell components in the PBMCs essentially served as feeder cells to support efficient T cell expansion.|$|E

This treatment reduced concanavalin A and lipopolysaccharide stimulation of <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from these animals by 90 % {{when compared with the}} stimulation of <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from untreated animals.

In order to extend our findings and determine a means for selecting the most immunogenic ca influenza A vaccine, the intracellular cytokine responses by CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) T cells to AA-ca, Len/ 47 -ca and Len/ 17 -ca and their respective wild-type parental viruses were compared in mice. Day 5 after infection with Len/ 17 -ca, when levels of IL- 2, - 4 and - 10 were highest in the mediastinal lymph nodes (MLN) and lungs, was chosen as the optimum time to <b>harvest</b> <b>lymphocytes</b> and 72 h was determined to be the optimum restimulation period for lymphocytes by APCs. Under these conditions, the frequency of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+) cells expressing cytokines was highest in the lungs compared with the MLN.

While the CD 8 (+) cytokine response appeared non-specific, the cytokine response elicited in the lungs by CD 4 (+) cells to Len/ 17 -ca-inoculation was greater than that induced by Len/ 47 -ca, or AA/ca.

Methods: We determined basal and stimulated ex vivo expression of HO- 1 and cell viability in lymphocytes from volunteers after lycopene supplementation. Twenty-four healthy young men on a low lycopene diet consumed 1) 170 g of passata sauce with butter or 2) butter alone for 3 wk in a randomized crossover design. Results: Plasma lycopene concentrations {{at the end of the}} tomato and control trials were 0. 54 +/- 0. 20 versus 0. 20 +/- 0. 15 mu mol/L, respectively (P < 0. 05). There was a significant increase in the proportion of live cells (91 +/- 5 % versus 87 +/- 9 %) and a corresponding reduction in apoptosis (6 +/- 4 % versus 11 +/- 9 %) in untreated lymphocytes after supplementation (P < 0. 05), with no effect. on cell viability in response to hydrogen peroxide treatment. HO- 1 protein expression in basal conditions and induction of HO- 1 after hydrogen peroxide treatment was not different between trials.

The DMSe instillation resulted in phlogistic responses that had the neutrophil as the main leukocyte; they were present in BAL samples, mostly at days 1 and 7. Macrophages were also increased during DMSe-induced inflammation. The lower DMSe dose resulted in an inflammatory reaction lasting for 2 weeks.

We believe these proteins, in general, may modulate directly some homeostatic functions in organ-derived cells, and now report that our ThF represses specifically the cellular transcription and secretion of basement membrane type IV collagen in tubular epithelium. These in vitro findings of reduced levels of mRNA encoding type IV collagen correlate well with in situ hybridization studies performed on kidneys expressing early autoimmune lesions, and predict a progressive drop in the expression of type IV collagen in the interstitium.

CD 4 (+) T-cell response to Vpr peptides was more disperse and involved six different peptides depending on the HLA-DR molecules of the donors. Two overlapping peptides were T-cell stimulating in at least half of the donors. T-cell response to Vpr in multiple donors is the result of a combination of several CD 4 (+) T-cell epitopes with good to moderate immunoprevalence.

Functionally, pulmonary DCs bound 125 I-SP and displayed increased motility in vitro in response to graded concentrations of SP. However, SP had no effect on the accessory cell activities of DCs. To examine the role of neural influences on the pulmonary immune response to inhaled antigen, Lewis rats were pretreated with capsaicin (CAP), which damages small nerves and depletes neuropeptide stores, and then challenged intratracheally (i. t.) with hen egg lysozyme (HEL).

Correspondingly, the number of cells expressing the test antigens in MLNL is greater than in controls after a few days of treatment and is maintained high up to the end of treatment but returns to control values after treatment withdrawal; CD 4 :CD 8 ratio is decreased by EWL in favour of CD 8 positive cells. Treatment with EWL does not modify the ratio between CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells vs controls in IEL nor does it change the % of CD 3 positive cells or the expression of IL- 2 receptor at this level.

C 57 BL/ 6 mice do not normally resist growth of EL 4 or C 1498 leukaemia tumour cells. Following transplantation of cyclophosphamide-treated C 57 BL/ 6 with T-depleted C 3 H bone marrow cells, or for the EL 4 tumour, immunization of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with tumour cells transfected with a vector encoding the co-stimulatory molecule CD 80 (EL 4 -CD 80), mice resist growth of tumour challenge. Immunization of C 57 BL/ 6 mice with EL 4 cells overexpressing CD 86 (EL 4 -CD 86) is ineffective. Protection from tumour growth in either model is suppressed by infusion of CD 200 Fc, an effect enhanced by co-infusion of CD 200 r+ macrophages. CD 200 Fc acts on both CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells to produce this suppression. These data {{are consistent with the}} hypothesis that immunosuppression following CD 200 –CD 200 r interaction can regulate a functionally important tumour growth inhibition response in mice...|$|R
40|$|Adoptive {{immunotherapy}} with IL 2 {{is associated}} with severe cardiovascular toxicities including peripheral and pulmonary edema, hypotension decreased systemic vascular resistance, increased heart rate, and an increased cardiac index. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to determine whether IL 2 alone or in combination with lymphokine-activated killer cells (LAK) cells depress cardiac function using the isolated, perfused, working rat heart preparation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250 - 350 g) were anesthetized and the hearts were removed and placed on the perfusion apparatus. Hearts were perfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB), or oxygenated KHB containing IL 2 alone, IL 2 -Media (cell culture media supplemented with 1, 500 U IL 2 /ml), LYMPH (cell culture media from cultured mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers), or LAK (cell culture media from cultured <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from patients receiving IL 2 /LAK in the presence of 1, 500 U/ml IL 2). The cells were removed before perfusion (n = 9). Cardiac output and coronary flow were measured at 20 -min intervals with preload constant (afterload varied or afterload constant (preload varied). The results indicate a significant depression in cardiac function in hearts treated with LAK. This depression was evident at 20 min and was more pronounced at 60 min. Washout of the KHB plus LAK reversed this depression. Thus, IL 2 -stimulated/cultured human mononuclear cells produce a soluble factor that produces a reversible severe depression of cardiac function...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to delineate the pathway of complement activation that is crucial for the induction of experimental autoimmune anterior uveitis (EAAU). We studied the development of EAAU in melanin-associated antigen (MAA) -sensitized Lewis rats treated with antibody against C 4 or factor B. Control animals received isotype IgG control. Antibody against C 4 had no effect on EAAU, and all of the animals developed EAAU similar to those injected with control IgG. In contrast, EAAU was completely inhibited in all MAA-sensitized Lewis rats injected with factor B antibody. Treatment with anti-factor B antibody resulted in suppression of ocular complement activation. Adoptive transfer of T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from draining lymph nodes of donor animals treated with anti-factor B did not transfer EAAU to naïve syngenic rats. Anti-factor B antibody inhibited the ability of MAA-specific CD 4 + T cells to proliferate (in vitro) in response to MAA in a dose-dependent manner. Level of TNF-α and IFN-γ decreased in the presence of anti-factor B. Collectively, our results provide the novel finding that complement activation via the alternative pathway contributes to intraocular inflammation in EAAU, and anti-factor B-mediated inhibition of EAAU is due to diminished antigen-specific CD 4 + T cell responses to MAA. Our findings explain the interactions between the complement system and T cells that are critical for the induction of EAAU and may lead to the development of therapy for idiopathic anterior uveitis based on selective blockade of the alternative pathway...|$|R
40|$|Many {{currently}} available diagnostic tests for typhoid fever lack sensitivity and/or specificity, especially {{in areas of}} the world where the disease is endemic. In order to identify a diagnostic test that better correlates with typhoid fever, we evaluated immune responses to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (serovar Typhi) in individuals with suspected typhoid fever in Dhaka, Bangladesh. We enrolled 112 individuals with suspected typhoid fever, cultured day 0 blood for serovar Typhi organisms, and performed Widal assays on days 0, 5, and 20. We <b>harvested</b> peripheral blood <b>lymphocytes</b> and analyzed antibody levels in supernatants collected on days 0, 5, and 20 (using an antibody-in-lymphocyte-supernatant [ALS] assay), as well as in plasma on these days. We measured ALS reactivity to a serovar Typhi membrane preparation (MP), a formalin-inactivated whole-cell preparation, and serovar Typhi lipopolysaccharide. We measured responses in healthy Bangladeshi, as well as in Bangladeshi febrile patients with confirmed dengue fever or leptospirosis. We categorized suspected typhoid fever individuals into different groups (groups I to V) based on blood culture results, Widal titer, and clinical features. Responses to MP antigen in the immunoglobulin A isotype were detectable at the time of presentation in the plasma of 81 % of patients. The ALS assay, however, tested positive in all patients with documented or highly suspicious typhoid, suggesting that such a response could be the basis of improved diagnostic point-of-care-assay for serovar Typhi infection. It can be important for use in epidemiological studies, as well as in difficult cases involving fevers of unknown origin...|$|R
40|$|Chronic obstructive {{pulmonary}} disease (COPD) {{is characterized by}} an excessive inflammatory response to inhaled particles, mainly tobacco smoking. T lymphocytes are important regulatory cells that secrete several cytokines and participate actively in this inflammatory response. According to the pattern of cytokines secreted, the immune response is classified as cytotoxic or type 1 [interferon (IFN) -γ-, interleukin (IL) - 2 -dependent] and humoral or type 2 (IL- 4 -, IL- 5 -, IL- 10 - and IL- 13 -dependent). This paper sought to compare the intracellular profile of cytokine expression determined by flow cytometry in T <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and peripheral blood in patients with COPD, smokers with normal lung function and never smokers. We found that BAL T lymphocytes from COPD patients had {{a higher percentage of}} positive stained cells for most of the cytokines analysed when compared to never smokers or smokers with normal lung function. Differences reached statistical significance for IL- 4, IL- 10 and IL- 13, particularly in CD 8 + T cells. Furthermore, the expression of most of these cytokines was related inversely to the degree of airflow obstruction present suggesting local activation and/or selective homing of T lymphocytes to the lungs in COPD patients. These observations were not reproduced in circulating T lymphocytes. These results suggest that BAL T lymphocytes in patients with COPD produce more cytokines than in controls and tend to show a type 2 pattern of intracellular cytokine expression, particularly a Tc- 2 profile. This is related inversely to the degree of airflow obstruction present...|$|R
40|$|Background: Parasympathetic nerves {{provide the}} {{dominant}} autonomic innervation {{of the upper}} and lower airways. They release acetylcholine that, activating post-junctional muscarinic receptors, causes bronchoconstriction, mucous secretion and vasodilation. Dysfunction of {{the upper and lower}} airways frequently coexist, and they appear to share key elements of pathogenesis. Objective: The present study has assessed the expression and pattern of cholinergic muscarinic receptor subtypes in peripheral blood <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from allergic rhinitis patients with different degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness detected by methacholine challenge test. Methods: Radioligand binding assay for determining the density of muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtypes; immunoblot analysis for assessing the characteristic of muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype protein and immunocytochemical techniques for investigating the cellular localization of receptors. Results: An increased expression of M 2 and M 5 receptor proteins was observed in peripheral blood lymphocytes of allergic rhinitis patients in comparison with healthy control individuals. M 3 receptor subtype decreased in allergic rhinitis patients with normal or mild responses to methacholine. A trend versus a return to normal value was found in moderate and severe responders. No changes of the M 4 receptor subtype were found. Conclusions and clinical implications: Increase in M 2 receptor expression correlated with disease severity and bronchial hyperreactivity. Changes in muscarinic cholinergic receptor expression in allergic rhinitis underline a role of cholinergic system of immune cells in allergic airway disease. Capsule summary: Studies addressed to rhinitis and asthma have identified many similarities. Our results indicate that changes in peripheral blood lymphocyte muscarinic receptor expression may reflect the cholinergic involvement into allergic airway diseases. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic disease {{caused by}} Lassa fever virus (LV). Although the precise host defense mechanism(s) that affords {{protection}} against LV {{is not completely}} understood, cellular immunity mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) plays {{a pivotal role in}} controlling viral replication and LV infection. To date, there have been no reports mapping major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-binding CTL epitopes for LV. Using computer-assisted algorithms, we identified five HLA-A 2. 1 -binding peptides of LV glycoprotein (GP) and two peptides from LV nucleoprotein (NP). Synthesized peptides were examined for their ability to bind to MHC class I molecules using a flow cytometric assay that measures peptide stabilization of class I. Three of the LV-GP peptides tested (LLGTFTWTL, SLYKGVYEL, and YLISIFLHL) stabilized HLA-A 2. The LV-NP peptides tested failed to stabilize this HLA-A 2. We then investigated the ability of the HLA-A 2 -binding LV-GP peptides to generate peptide-specific CTLs in HLA-A 2. 1 transgenic mice. Functional assays used to confirm CTL activation included gamma interferon enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays and intracellular cytokine staining of CD 8 + T cells from peptide-primed mice. CTL assays were also performed to verify the cytolytic activity of peptide-pulsed target cells. Each of the LV-GP peptides induced CTL responses in HLA-A 2 -transgenic mice. MHC class I tetramers prepared using one LV-GP peptide that showed the highest cytolytic index (LLGTFTWTL) confirmed that peptide-binding CD 8 + T cells were present in pooled <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from peptide-primed mice. These findings provide direct evidence for the existence of LV-derived GP epitopes that may be useful in the development of protective immunogens for this hemorrhagic virus...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the inhibition of human mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) reactions by rabbit antisera to intact and detergent solubilized, fractionated, human trophoblast membranes. Heat-inactivated antisera were passed through solid-phase immunoabsorption columns of normal human serum and extensively absorbed with human erythrocytes, lymphocytes and liver powder. Immunohistological experiments with these absorbed antisera showed that they reacted brilliantly with syncytiotrophoblast in cryostat sections of human but not baboon or monkey placentae, {{and not with}} other normal adult tissues including peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). Addition of these antisera to MLC reactions produced significant and reproducible suppression of responses without affecting cell viability. Absorption studies demonstrated complete removal of MLC inhibition and trophoblast membranes but not with PBL or suspensions of HEp- 2 cells. Timed experiments showed that optimal inhibition occurred when the antisera were added between 2 and 6 h after culture initiation, and that little suppression was achieved after 18 h. <b>Lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from MLC reactions after 2 h showed that 3 [...] 5 % of the cells reacted with PBL/liver-absorbed anti-trophoblast sera, and that unstimulated PBL were negative. Cultures of subhuman primate lymphocytes {{in the presence of}} heterologous antisera to human trophoblast membranes showed total inhibition of rhesus:human and human:rhesus MLC, and no suppression of baboon:human or human:baboon reactions, whereas human lymphocytes responded in an exagerated manner when stimulated by baboon cells. Modulated MLC responses to human, rhesus, or baboon lymphocytes, in the presence of anti-trophoblast sera indicate that the antisera recognize trophoblast cross-reactive lymphocytes antigens. We propose that these antigens are reaction products of cell-cell interactions, and that the nature of the antigens is determined by the specificity of the recognition signals which initiate the reaction...|$|R
40|$|Since it was {{previously}} shown that protein antigens applied epicutaneously in mice induce allergic dermatitis mediated by production of T helper 2 (Th 2) cytokines we postulated {{that this might}} induce suppression of Th 1 immunity. Here we show that epicutaneous immunization of normal mice with a different protein antigen applied on the skin {{in the form of}} a patch induces a state of subsequent antigen-non-specific unresponsiveness caused by suppressor T cells (Ts) that inhibit sensitization and elicitation of effector T-cell responses. Suppression is transferable in vivo by αβ-T-cell receptor CD 4 + CD 8 + double positive <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from lymphoid organs of skin patched animals and are not major histocompatibility complex-restricted nor antigen specific. Both CD 25 + and CD 25 − CD 4 + CD 8 + T cells are able to suppress adoptive transfer of Th 1 effector cells mediating cutaneous contact sensitivity. In vivo treatment with monoclonal antibodies showed that the cytokines interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10 and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) are involved in the induction of the Ts cells. Additionally, using IL- 10 −/− mice we found that IL- 10 is involved in skin induced tolerance. Further in vitro experiments showed that lymph node cells of skin tolerized mice non-specifically suppress [3 H]thymidine incorporation by antigen-stimulated immune cells and this effect can be abolished by adding anti-TGF-β, but not anti-IL- 4 nor anti-IL- 10 antibodies. These studies indicate the crucial role of TGF-β in skin induced tolerance due to non-antigen-specific Ts cells and also show that IL- 4, IL- 10 and TGF-β play an important role in the induction of epicutaneously induced Ts cell suppression...|$|R
40|$|Flow cytofluorometric {{analyses}} of <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from the {{mesenteric lymph node}} (MLN), mucosal epithelium, and lamina propria of C 57 BL/ 6 mice demonstrate that expression of alpha/beta or gamma/delta T-cell receptors (TCR) and CD 4 or CD 8 molecules by T lymphocytes in the intestinal immune system varies depending upon their anatomic location. The MLN contained equivalent numbers of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells, {{the vast majority of}} which were alpha/beta TCR positive (alpha/beta TCR+). The lamina propria T cells were predominantly CD 4 + and alpha/beta TCR+, while the intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes consisted of equivalent numbers of alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cells, the majority of which were CD 8 +. There were no significant changes in these T-cell phenotypic profiles when the mice were antibiotic decontaminated or monoassociated with Escherichia coli. Mice were depleted of CD 4 + T cells and/or CD 8 + T cells in vivo by intraperitoneal injections of monoclonal antibody GK 1. 5 (rat anti-mouse CD 4) and/or monoclonal antibody 2. 43 (rat anti-mouse CD 8). T-cell depletion was confirmed in the MLN, lamina propria, and the intestinal epithelium by flow cytometry. E. coli C 25 translocation from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract to the MLN was significantly increased in mice depleted of CD 4 + T cells, CD 8 + T cells, or both. T-cell-deficient athymic beige/nude mice also exhibited greater levels of E. coli C 25 translocation to the MLN than beige/het euthymic littermates. Salmonella typhimurium translocation also was increased following CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell depletion in mice monoassociated with S. typhimurium. Depletion of CD 4 + and/or CD 8 + T cells also increased the translocation to the MLN of certain indigenous GI flora bacteria. These results confirm that T-cell-mediated immunity is involved in the host defense against bacterial translocation from the GI tract...|$|R
40|$|In vivo or {{in vitro}} {{immunity}} to {{murine leukemia virus}} (MuLV) -induced leukemia cells which do not effectively produce virus, {{has been difficult to}} demonstrate. Because immunizations with allogeneic murine leukemia cells have been used to confer syngeneic tumor immunity to virus- producing cells, we attempted to generate lymphocytes, cytotoxic to syngeneic nonproducer leukemia cells, by stimulating normal murine spleen cells with allogeneic nonproducer leukemia cells in mixed tumor lymphocyte culture (MTLC) reactions in vitro. Secondary allogeneic MTLC of normal C 57 BL/ 6 or DBA/ 2 spleen cells effectively produced syngeneic tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Target cells lysed in lymphocyte- mediated cytolysis (LMC) assays, included both Friend and Rauscher virus- induced syngeneic murine leukemia cells and chemically-induced hematopoietic tumor cells. Syngeneic tumor cells were lysed regardless of whether they produced infectious MuLV or expressed viral antigens gp- 71, p- 30, or p- 12 at the cell surface. Syngeneic normal cells (thymus, lymph node, or Concanavalin A-stimulated spleen cells) used as targets in LMC assays were uneffected by <b>lymphocytes</b> <b>harvested</b> from secondary allogeneic MTLC. Several other in vitro culture treatments including secondary syngeneic MTLC and repetitive mixed lymphocyte culture stimulations were incapable of generating tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. Based upon these results, we propose that secondary MTLC stimulation of normal spleen cells with allogeneic nonproducer leukemia cells selects for the proliferation of two subpopulations of antigen-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes. The population capable of effecting syngeneic tumor cell lysis is directed against tumor-associated cell surface antigens which may be distinct from viral structural proteins or glycoproteins. The growth of these tumor-specific cytotoxic lymphocytes may be enhanced by a soluble allogeneic effect factor produced by the proliferation of the second subpopulation of lymphocytes generated in repetitive allogeneic MTLC, namely those lymphocytes with specificities directed against differing histocompatibility antigens...|$|R
