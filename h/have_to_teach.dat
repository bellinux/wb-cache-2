5|$|Both Gray and Torrey {{were elected}} to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in December 1841. Gray never {{returned}} to teach a course at Michigan. In 1833 Dr.Joshua Fisher, a resident of Beverly, Massachusetts, and a Harvard University alumnus, bequeathed $20,000 to Harvard to endow a chair in natural history. The university allowed the proceeds to accumulate until it could fund a full year's salary for a professor. Because of this and a few problems in finding a suitable professor, this chair was not filled until it was formally offered to Gray on March26, 1842. The offer was $1,000/year salary, teaching duties limited to only botany, and being superintendent of Harvard's botanic garden. While the salary was low, the teaching limitation, rare for the time, allowed him {{plenty of time to}} do research and work in the botanic garden. After an exchange of letters, Gray accepted this appointment as Fisher Professor of Natural History at Harvard. The formal appointment was made April30, 1842. Gray arrived at Harvard on July22, 1842, and began his duties in September. He did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in the fall of 1842, but began in spring 1843, the first classes he had taught in nine years. Early in his years at Harvard, Gray had to borrow money from his father. Soon he was able to repay his father and help his family because he supplemented his income by giving lectures outside of Harvard, including at the Lowell Institute. Gray was considered a weak lecturer, but because of his expert knowledge, he was highly regarded by his peers. His skills were better suited to teaching advanced rather than introductory classes. He also gained renown for his textbooks and high quality illustrations. Gray moved into {{what became known as the}} Asa Gray House in the Botanic Garden in the summer of 1844. It had been built in 1810 for William Dandridge Peck and later occupied by Thomas Nuttall. As the demands of teaching, collecting, selling specimens, taking care of the herbarium, and writing books increased and he himself was not a good illustrator, Gray found it necessary to hire a botanical illustratorIsaac Sprague, who illustrated much of Gray's works for decades to come.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain a}} Professional certificate, the {{applicant}} must have completed a NYS-approved {{teacher education program}} at a college/university and hold a master's degree or above. Each state has different requirements to become a permanently certified teacher, and the requirements keep increasing. For example, professional certification in NYS requires three years of classroom teaching experience. It also requires being mentored by a certified teacher within the first year teaching. However NYS no longer offers permanent certification to those who haven't already been certified by February 2004.The Professional certificate replaces it. To maintain a professional certificate, a teacher must complete 100 hours of professional development every five years. These professional development hours are decreased by a few percentages for every year teaching in a non-public school. One does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> in New York State to maintain their certificate as many New York teachers teach in Connecticut and New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|In England and Wales, sex {{education}} is not compulsory in schools as parents can refuse to let their children {{take part in the}} lessons. The curriculum focuses on the reproductive system, foetal development, and the physical and emotional changes of adolescence, while information about contraception and safe sex is discretionary and discussion about relationships is often neglected. Britain {{has one of the highest}} teenage pregnancy rates in Europe and {{sex education}} is a heated issue in government and media reports. In a 2000 study by the University of Brighton, many 14- to 15-year-olds reported disappointment with the content of sex education lessons and felt that lack of confidentiality prevents teenagers from asking teachers about contraception. However, in a 2008 study conducted by YouGov for Channel 4 it was revealed that only three in ten teenagers say they need more sex and relationships education. In most primary/junior schools, students are taught a (non-compulsory) formal sex education program from Upper Key Stage 2 (ages 10–11), and then onwards into secondary school, where it becomes a topic in the overall subject of Citizenship or PSHE (Personal Social Health Education). In March 2017 it was made complusory all schools <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> sex education.|$|E
50|$|Catherine Campbell, Begunto President, {{stated that}} workers hired since 2005 were {{essentially}} being paid less, {{because they were}} paid 250,000 yen per month, but <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> 40 lessons a week. Other teachers, hired before 2005, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> 35 lessons per week. Teachers hired in the early 1990s only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> 30 lessons per week. Berlitz lessons in Japan are for 40 minutes. In 2005, the union took action {{over a number of}} grievances, and claimed this forced Berlitz management into paying the performance increase for that year. But there was no across-the board pay increase or bonus.|$|R

500|$|There was one vice-presidential {{debate between}} Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , {{the result was}} proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush. At it, Ferraro criticized Reagan's initial refusal to support an {{extension}} to the Voting Rights Act. Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress stacked up with Bush's extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, [...] "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude that you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> me about foreign policy." [...] She strongly defended her position on abortion, which earned her applause and a respectful reply from her opponent. In {{the days leading up}} to the debate, Second Lady of the United States Barbara Bush had publicly referred to Ferraro as [...] "that four-million-dollar—I can't say it, but it rhymes with 'rich'." [...] Barbara Bush soon apologized.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2006, the Minneapolis Star Tribune {{reported}} that, in March 2006, Bachmann {{was on a}} Minneapolis {{radio show}} advocating for a state constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage.

2500|$|Critics of the Teach the Controversy {{movement}} and strategy {{can also be}} found outside of the scientific community. Barry W.

[...] "The movement is a veneer over a certain theological message. Every one of these groups is now actively engaged in trying to undercut sound science education by criticizing evolution," [...] said Lynn. [...] "It is all based on their religious ideology. Even the people who don't specifically mention religion are hard-pressed with a straight face to say who the intelligent designer is if it's not God."

2500|$|Another type of VEP {{used with}} {{applications}} is the P300 potential. The P300 event-related potential {{is a positive}} peak in the EEG that occurs at roughly 300 ms after {{the appearance of a}} target stimulus (a stimulus for which the user is waiting or seeking) or oddball stimuli. The P300 amplitude decreases as the target stimuli and the ignored stimuli grow more similar.The P300 is thought to be related to a higher level attention process or an orienting response Using P300 as a control scheme has the advantage of the participant only having to attend limited training sessions. The first application to use the P300 model was the P300 matrix. Within this system, a subject would choose a letter from a grid of 6 by 6 letters and numbers. The rows and columns of the grid flashed sequentially and every time the selected [...] "choice letter" [...] was illuminated the user's P300 was (potentially) elicited. However, the communication process, at approximately 17 characters per minute, was quite slow. The P300 is a BCI that offers a discrete selection rather than a continuous control mechanism. The advantage of P300 use within games is that the player does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>teach</b> himself/herself how to use a completely new control system and so only has to undertake short training instances, to learn the gameplay mechanics and basic use of the BCI paradigm.|$|E
2500|$|Gee's {{current work}} in the field of new literacies has seen him shift in his {{research}} focus somewhat from studying language-in-use to examining the D/iscourses of a range of new social practices—with a particular emphasis on video games and learning. Gee applies many key concepts from his previous research to studying video games. For example, Gee continues to argue that if we take reading to mean gaining understanding (instead of simply decoding letter sounds and words), one {{needs to be able to}} recognize or produce meanings inherent to any one semiotic domain in order to be literate in that domain. As such, and as Gee sets out in his text What Video Games <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> <b>Teach</b> Us About Learning and Literacy, one can be literate in the semiotic domain of video games if he or she “can recognize (the equivalent of “reading”) and/or produce (the equivalent of “writing”) meanings” in the video game domain. Therefore, because new literacies are multiple and attached to social and cultural practices, Gee explains that people need to (1) be literate in many different [...] semiotic domains, and (2) be able to become literate in other *new* semiotic domains throughout their lives. This theoretical orientation aligns with {{work in the}} broad field of [...] "new literacies" [...] research—by colleagues such as Colin Lankshear, Michele Knobel, Henry Jenkins, Kevin Leander, Rebecca Black, Kurt Squire, and Constance Steinkuehler, among others.|$|E
