The mammalian Xenotropic Polytropic Virus Receptor 1 (XPR 1) shares homology to the Arabidopsis PHO 1, a phosphate exporter expressed in roots. However, phosphate export activity of XPR 1 {{has not yet}} been demonstrated in a <b>heterologous</b> <b>system.</b> Here, wedemonstrate that transient expression in tobacco leaves of XPR 1 -GFP leads to specific phosphate export. Like PHO 1 -GFP, XPR 1 -GFP is localized predominantly to the endomembrane system in tobacco cells.

40|$|G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) compose one of {{the largest}} {{families}} of membrane proteins involved in intracellular signaling. They are involved in numerous physiological and pathological processes and are prime candidates for drug development. Over the past decade, an increasing number of studies have reported heteromerization between GPCRs. Many investigations in <b>heterologous</b> <b>systems</b> have provided important indications of potential novel pharmacology; however, the physiological relevance of these findings has yet to be established with endogenous receptors in native tissues. In this review, we focus on family A GPCRs and describe the techniques and criteria to assess their heteromerization. We conclude that advances in approaches to study receptor complex functionality in <b>heterologous</b> <b>systems,</b> coupled with techniques that enable specific examination of native receptor heteromers in vivo, are likely to establish GPCR heteromers as novel therapeutic targets...|$|R

40|$|The {{strategy}} {{to be followed}} in a transposon tagging experiment will be determined largely by the transposition pattern of the transposon in question. With a view to utilizing the maize element Activator (Ac) as a transposon tag in <b>heterologous</b> <b>systems,</b> we investigated the pattern of Ac transposition from six different loci in transgenic tobacco. We isolated germinal revertants from plants carrying mutable alleles of the antibiotic-resistant gene streptomycin phosphotransferase (SPT) and mapped {{the location of the}} transposed Ac (trAc) elements relative to the donor SPT gene. A comparison of the distributions of trAcs among the six loci revealed that, although the receptor sites for trAcs tend to be linked to the donor locus, the pattern of Ac transposition in tobacco displays surprising locus-to-locus variation. Some trAc distributions showed the same tight clustering around the donor locus previously seen in maize, whereas others were more dispersed. The possible meaning of these findings and their implication for transposon tagging in <b>heterologous</b> <b>systems</b> are discussed...|$|R

30|$|The cost {{of drugs}} used for {{diabetes}} treatment (insulin, glucagon, and others) reached US$ 548 billion in 2013. In the United States, {{it is estimated}} that the diabetes drug market will expand by about US$ 125 million (Biodel 2013; Hassan et al. 2014). Statistical data suggest a worldwide growth from 382 million diabetic people in 2013 to 592 billion people in 2035 (Ledford 2013; Guariguata et al. 2014). There is an estimated 200.000 people/year that are hospitalised due to severe hypoglycaemia, and only 20 % of this number use the glucagon emergency kit. One of the main causes for the lack of access to the kit is the elevated price (Biodel 2013). The first glucagon recombinant regimen was created by the NovoNordisk® Company in 1989 using a yeast <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) (patent n° 4.826. 763). In 1994, the Eli Lilly® Company used an E. coli <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> to produce recombinant glucagon (patent n° 5.512. 549).

With its two major partners, SsrA a small stable RNA and the SmpB protein, it promotes {{the release of}} ribosomes stalled on defective mRNAs and directs the corresponding truncated proteins to degradation pathways. We have recently shown that trans-translation is an essential function in the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Our results suggested that some properties of the H. pylori trans-translation machinery distinguishes it from the well known system in E. coli. Therefore, we decided to test the functionality of the SmpB and SsrA molecules of H. pylori in the E. coli <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> using two established phenotypic tests. Results: H. pylori SmpB protein was found to successfully restore the E. coli ΔsmpB mutant growth defect and its capacity to propagate λimmP 22 phage.

40|$|Eucaryotic {{transcription}} initiation by RNA polymerase II involves protein:DNA interactions {{during the}} formation of a transcription complex. In addition to RNA polymerase II there are at least five other general transcription factors necessary for initiation with the adenovirus major late promoter. One of these, TFIIA, is involved in the earliest events during transcription complex assembly. We have purified TFIIA from wheat germ and characterized it in an in vitro transcription system. Wheat TFIIA is a single polypeptide of Mr- 3 5 kd which functionally replaces human (HeLa) TFIIA to form a wheat/HeLa transcription system. [This polypeptide can be eluted from a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, refolded to a native conformation, and will function as wheat TFIIA in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>system.</b> ] The <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> requires a lower optimal incubation temperature than the HeLa system. Biochemical characterization, using the adenovirus major late promoter, indicates that transcription reaction parameters for both wheat and HeLa TFIIA are similar but the kinetics of transcription for both TFIIAs are somewhat dissimilar. A plant viral promoter, the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter, accurately and efficiently directs in vitro transcription in both the wheat/HeLa and HeLa systems with identical transcription kinetics. We conclude that TFIIA function has been conserved during evolution...|$|E
40|$|The {{diversity}} of protein isoforms is often generated from single genes by alternative splicing {{of the primary}} transcript. Using transfection of beta tropomyosin minigene constructs into homologous and <b>heterologous</b> cell <b>systems,</b> we show that there are differences, among higher vertebrates, in {{the components of the}} splicing machinery which control the conserved regulated splicing pattern of two mutually exclusive exons (6 A and 6 B) present in this gene. These experiments demonstrate that genes which give rise to alternative transcripts may require an appropriate combination of splicing factors which are species-specific, or at least restricted to the same taxonomic subgroup (class). An important practical implication is that the splicing of these genes may be deregulated in <b>heterologous</b> <b>systems</b> in vitro and in vivo, i. e. in transgenic animals...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMADS-box {{transcription}} factors play crucial {{roles in}} organ and cell differentiation in organisms ranging from yeast to humans. Most {{of the work}} on plant MADS-box proteins focused on their roles in floral development whereas less information is available on their function in fruit maturation. We cloned three distinct tomato cDNAs using a RT-PCR approach, encoding LeMADS 1, LeMADS 5 and LeMADS 6 factors and whose mRNAs mostly accumulate in tomato flowers and fruits. Phylogeny analysis indicates that LeMADS 1, 5 and 6 belong to the MEF 2 -like family. When transiently expressed in tobacco leaves or in human cells, LeMADS 1, 5 and 6 are targeted to the cell nucleus. As the endogenous target genes of these putative transcription factors are unknown, the transcriptional activity of these proteins was characterized in a <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> and we showed that, when fused to a Gal 4 -DNA-binding domain, they repress the transcription of heterologous reporter genes. Since histone deacetylases control MEF 2 transcriptional activity and since a putative histone deacetylase binding site was present in LeMADS 1, 5 and 6, we tested the potential interaction between these factors and HDAC 5 deacetylase. Surprisingly, in this <b>heterologous</b> <b>system,</b> LeMADS 1, 5 and 6 interacted with HDAC 5 N-terminal region. Our data suggest that, like mammalian MEF 2 A, plant MADS-box transcriptional activity might be regulated by enzymes controlling chromatin acetylation...|$|E
40|$|Improving {{the cereal}} grain using a {{transgenic}} approach {{would require the}} use of specific gene/s but also the use of specific promoter elements to control the spatial and temporal expression of the gene/s. We have studied several seed-specific cereal promoters to investigate if promoter strength and specificity is maintained from a homologous to a <b>heterologous</b> <b>system.</b> Transgenic rice, wheat and barley were generated to study promoters of the bifunctional alpha-amylase subtilisin inhibitor gene (Isa) form barley, the Em gene from wheat and a number of storage protein promoters from barley, rice and wheat. The isa promoter from barley show differential control of reporter gene expression in grains of transgenic wheat and rice. The wheat Em promoter shows comparable reporter gene expression in transgenic wheat, barley and rice. The seed-specific promoters from wheat, barley and rice directed seed-specific reporter gene expression in a homologous system. However, in a <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> the storage protein promoters either maintained seed-specific reporter gene expression, or showed differential control of reporter gene expression, or failed to direct any reporter gene expression. Analysis of transgenic rice and barley seeds is ongoing and data reflecting promoter strength will be discussed.

30|$|The metagenome insert {{sequence}} {{was similar}} to the sequence found in different strains of Shewanella, suggesting that the insert from metagenome could have been derived from a strain of Shewanella sp.

Thus it is presumed that members of Shewanella sp. are present in the microbiome of the goat skin during degradation. Members of Shewanella sp. are Gram-negative bacteria belonging to the class Gammaproteobacteria.

A cell-free system of oxidase activation consisting of a membrane fraction and cytosol from EBV B lymphocyte homogenate supplemented with guanosine 5 '-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]), arachidonic acid and Mg 2 + {{was found to be}} competent in the production of O 2 -, assessed by the superoxide-dismutase-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of NADPH. However, cytochrome c reduction was slow and largely insensitive both to superoxide dismutase, and to iodonium biphenyl, a powerful inhibitor of the oxidase activity in neutrophils. A markedly faster reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of NADPH was obtained with a <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> consisting of cytosol from EBV B lymphocytes and bovine neutrophil membranes, GTP[S], arachidonic acid and Mg 2 +; in this system, reduction of cytochrome c was totally inhibited by superoxide dismutase and iodonium biphenyl. These results show that EBV B lymphocytes contain a substantial amount of cytosolic factors of oxidase activation, and that the limiting factors for O 2 - production in B lymphocytes are the membrane components of the oxidase complex. The <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> of EBV B lymphocyte cytosol and bovine neutrophil membranes provided a rapid and convenient method to diagnose cytosolic defects in autosomal forms of chronic granulomatous disease.

40|$|The repressible Saccharomyces cerevisiae acid {{phosphatase}} (APase) coded by the PHO 5 gene is a cell wall glycoprotein {{that follows the}} yeast secretory pathway. We used in vitro mutagenesis to construct a deletion (delta SP) including the entire signal sequence and four amino acids of the mature sequence of APase. An APase-deficient yeast strain was transformed with a high-copy-number plasmid carrying the PHO 5 /delta SP gene. When expressed in vivo, the PHO 5 /delta SP gene product accumulated predominantly as an inactive, unglycosylated form located inside the cell. A large part of this unglycosylated precursor underwent proteolytic degradation, but up to 30 % of it was translocated, core glycosylated, and matured {{by the addition of}} mannose residues, before reaching the cell wall. It appears, therefore, that the signal sequence is important for efficient translocation and core glycosylation of yeast APase but that it is not absolutely necessary for entry of the protein into the yeast secretory pathway. mRNA obtained by in vitro transcription of PHO 5 and PHO 5 /delta SP genes were translated in vitro in the presence of either reticulocyte lysate and dog pancreatic microsomes or yeast lysate and yeast microsomes. The PHO 5 gene product was translocated and core glycosylated in the <b>heterologous</b> <b>system</b> and less efficiently in the homologous system.
