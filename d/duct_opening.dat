2500|$|The Arrowplane was not {{intended}} for production or to be roadable, but its success in the Vidal competition encouraged Waterman to form the Waterman Arrowplane Co. in 1935 for production of a roadable version. [...] The resulting Arrowbile, referred to by Waterman as the W-5, was similar both structurally and aerodynamically to the Arrowplane, though the fins differed in shape, with rounded leading edges and swept-back rudder hinges. For road use the wings and propeller could be quickly detached. [...] The main other differences were in engine choice, the need to drive the wheels and to use conventional car floor-type controls on the road. The air-cooled Menasco {{was replaced by a}} water-cooled engine as used by most cars. [...] Waterman modified a 6-cylinder upright, 100hp (75kW) Studebaker unit and placed it lower down in the pod, driving the propeller shaft {{at the top of the}} fuselage via six ganged V-belts with a 1.94:1 speed reduction. The radiator was in the forward fuselage, fed from a <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> in the extreme upper nose. On the ground the engine drove the main wheels through a differential gear, as normal, and the car was steered by its nosewheel. The wheels were enclosed in fairings, initially as a road safety measure. Instead of removing the propeller for the road, it could be de-clutched to prevent it windmilling the engine at speed.|$|E

50|$|A {{baseline}} radiograph (scout film) of {{the required}} salivary gland would be taken, the duct is dilated using graded lacrimal probes, a cannula then is inserted in this salivary gland <b>duct's</b> <b>opening</b> in the mouth, then a Radio-opaque fluid (Contrast medium) is injected in the duct through a small tube.|$|R
5000|$|Nicotinic {{stomatitis}} — {{the hard}} palate is whitened by hyperkeratosis {{caused by the}} heat from tobacco use or hot liquid consumption. This irritation also causes inflammation of the <b>duct</b> <b>openings</b> of the minor salivary glands of the palate, and they become dilated. This manifests as red patches or spots on a white background.|$|R
50|$|Once the {{endoscopes}} {{are introduced}} into gland, the internal anatomy is explored either for diagnosis or {{for treatment of}} a specific disease entity. The endoscope is introduced into the gland through its natural orifice in the mouth or by a making a small incision in the <b>duct</b> <b>opening.</b> These techniques for introduction are completely intraoral techniques.|$|E
50|$|Although {{some species}} are parthenogenic, {{both males and}} females are usually present, each with a single gonad located above the intestine. Two ducts run from the testis in males, opening through a single pore in front of the anus. In contrast, females have a single <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> either just above the anus or {{directly}} into the rectum, which thus forms a cloaca.|$|E
50|$|Other sources {{suggest a}} {{retrograde}} theory of lithogenesis, where food debris, bacteria or foreign bodies {{from the mouth}} enter the ducts of a salivary gland and are trapped by abnormalities in the sphincter mechanism of the <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> (the papilla), which are reported in 90% of cases.

50|$|Caenorhabditis briggsae {{is a small}} nematode, {{closely related}} to Caenorhabditis elegans. The {{differences}} between the two species are subtle. The male tail in C. briggsae has a slightly different morphology from C. elegans. Other differences include changes in vulval precursor competence and the placement of the excretory <b>duct</b> <b>opening.</b> C. briggsae is frequently used to study the differences between it and the more intimately understood C. elegans, especially at the DNA and protein sequence level. Several mutant strains of C. briggsae have also been isolated that facilitate genetic analysis of this organism. C. briggsae, like C. elegans, is a hermaphrodite. The genome sequence for C. briggsae was determined in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The {{mandible}} is {{the insect}} organ for biting and crushing, {{analogous to the}} jaw in mammals. In the genus Polistes, the lateral mandibular groove is smaller in size than in other genera of social wasps. A common misconception is that the mandibular gland is the anatomical portion shaped like a sac. In actuality, the sac formation is the gland reservoir that feeds into the gland itself. The actual gland is pressed up against the sac surface. Gland cells are shaped like polygons. Like poisonous structures in formicine ants, gland cells are continuous with the gland reservoir, but no filaments extend from the gland or sac {{as they do in}} the ants. The sac is closest to mandible’s medial portion. A duct exits the sac. The <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> is encircled by a sphincter muscle controlling the gland’s secretions. The duct is opened by sclerotized bars in conjunction with the hypopharynx. When the hypopharynx moves, pressure forms on the opening of the duct via the bars. When the bars dissipate this pressure, the duct closes.|$|E
50|$|Apoeccrine, {{found in}} the armpits and perianal region, have <b>ducts</b> <b>opening</b> onto the skin surface.

Apoeccrine glands secrete more sweat than both eccrine and apocrine glands, thus playing {{a large role in}} axillary sweating. Apoeccrine glands are sensitive to cholinergic activity, though they can also be activated via adrenergic stimulation. Like eccrine glands, they continuously secrete a thin, watery sweat.|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} {{the risk factors}} for recurrence after surgery for biliary pancreatitis. MethodsA total of 284 patients with biliary pancreatitis who were treated in The Fourth Hospital of PLA from January 2008 to December 2014 were followed up, and the risk factors for postoperative recurrence were analyzed. The chi-square test was used for categorical data, and the unconditional logistic regression model was used for multivariate analysis. ResultsThe follow-up period ranged from 6 to 27 months (mean 36. 4 ± 8. 4 months). Of all patients, 27 experienced recurrence, and the recurrence rate was 9. 51 %. The univariate analysis showed that postoperative recurrence {{was associated with a}} family history of gallstone disease, high-fat diet, sand-like stones, intrahepatic bile duct stones, biliopancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> stenosis, and diverticulum around the ampullar region (χ 2 = 8. 721, 5. 979, 8. 641, 15. 996, 33. 833, and 27. 203, all P＜ 0  05). The multivariate logistic analysis showed that high-fat diet (OR= 2. 296, P= 0. 012), biliopancreatic <b>duct</b> <b>opening</b> stenosis (OR= 2. 280, P= 0. 007), and diverticulum around the ampullar region (OR= 2. 522, P= 0. 009) were independent risk factors for recurrence after surgery for biliary pancreatitis.

40|$|Our group {{developed}} two in vivo {{methods to}} study secretions from submucosal glands in exposed tracheal epithelium. (1) The exposed mucosal surface was coated with powdered tantalum; accumulated secretions produced elevations (hillocks) in the tantalum layer {{under which the}} <b>duct</b> <b>openings</b> were located. The rate of formation of the hillocks was observed through a dissecting microscope, and recorded by television on a video tape recorder. (2) Micropipets were used to collect timed samples from individual gland <b>duct</b> <b>openings.</b> With these techniques, the innervation of the submucosal glands and the autonomic regulation of their secretions were studied. We studied the control of ion movement across tracheal epithelium because active ion transport forms local osmotic gradients across epithelia which could regulate transepithelial water movement. We mounted pieces of the posterior wall of dog trachea in Ussing-type chambers and measured unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ under short-circuit conditions with 36 Cl and 24 Na. We found active transport of Cl- toward the lumen and Na+ toward the submucosa. With this technique we investigated the effect of parasympathomimetic drugs on ion movement. With a new in vitro method we studied output of 35 bhound to sulfated mucins and movement of ions in cat trachea. We mounted pieces of anterior tracheal wall in Ussing-type chambers, added sodium 35 S-sulfate to the submucosal side and monitored secretion of bound 35 S in samples from the luminal side after dialysis. The unidirectional fluxes of Cl- and Na+ were measured with 36 Cl and 22 Na. With this method we examined the effect of a-adrenergic and (-adrenergic agonists on mucin secretion and ion movement.
