25|$|In this, {{the seminal}} Cambrinus short story, Cambrinus is an {{apprentice}} glassblower in the Flemish village of Fresnes-sur-Escaut, {{but he believes}} that he lacks the skill and upward mobility to succeed in glassblowing. He becomes smitten with the master glassblower's daughter, Flandrine. After she rebuffs him, he apprentices himself instead to a viol master, and learns the instrument. His first public performance goes excellently until he catches sight of Flandrine, and flubs his performance. The crowd turns on him violently, but when the case <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial</b> the judge, Jocko, is against Cambrinus. When Cambrinus is released he considers suicide, but Beelzebub intervenes {{in exchange for the}} promise of his soul. Beelzebub announces, too, that he has killed the judge.|$|E
25|$|On March 7, 2016, Vann {{was charged}} with murder {{in the deaths of}} five {{additional}} victims. The death penalty is being sought for each. The following day, Vann {{was charged with}} rape and attempted murder for an alleged February 2014 attack. Vann was also charged with battery by bodily waste for allegedly throwing a carton of urine and feces at a Lake County correctional officer at the jail on February 24, 2016. In April 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied a motion by Vann's attorneys to sever the murder cases of Anith Jones and Afrikka Hardy, and, as a result, the capital murder trial in said cases will continue as one. In a motion filed August 5, 2016, Vann's attorneys argued that Indiana's death penalty law is unconstitutional. In November 2016, Judge Samuel Cappas denied Vann's motion to declare the state's death penalty statute unconstitutional. In January 2017, a Lake County judge decided that Vann could make an appeal with his claims that Indiana's death penalty statute is unconstitutional. In April 2017, the Indiana Supreme Court turned down Vann's request to look at the constitutionality of the state's death penalty statute before he <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>trial.</b> At a status hearing in April 2017, Judge Samuel Cappas set jury selection to begin the week of February 12, 2018, with the actual jury trial beginning around March 12, 2018. In October 2017, Lake Superior Court Judge Samuel Cappas delayed the trial date, with jury selection being scheduled to begin September 17, 2018, and the trial beginning October 22, 2018.|$|E

50|$|A {{criminal}} case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a trial through a plea bargain.
