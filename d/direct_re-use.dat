40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a large water system within the production and packaging areas of a brewery. In order to accomplish the task, mathematical models were developed based on a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) formulation from the open literature. These models enable the investigation of several integration options: a) <b>direct</b> water <b>re-use</b> between batch and semi-continuous consumers operating within the same time interval and b) regeneration re-use options, by designing and scheduling an on-site wastewater treatment system. A multilevel strategy was applied for this large-scale industrial problem, which firstly decomposes design problem into several smaller integration problems concerning water consumers within each section of the brewery. At the following level, water re-use and regeneration re-use opportunities between the brewhouse and the packaging areas were explored for each working day. Finally, {{the design of a}}n integrated water system was performed over the entire working week by fixing identified intra-daily matches between sections. An optimum water integration scheme is proposed based on the results obtained. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{details the}} design, {{development}} {{and evaluation of}} an affective tutoring system (ATS) —an e-learning system that detects and responds to the emotional states of the learner. Research into the development of ATS is an active and relatively new field, with many studies demonstrating promising results. However, there is often no practical way to apply these findings in real-world settings. The ATS described in this paper utilizes a generic affective application model to infer and appropriately respond to the learner’s affective state. This approach brings several advantages, notably the potential <b>direct</b> support for <b>re-use</b> and retrospective addition of affect sensing functionality into existing e-learning software. Skin conductivity and heart rate variability measurements were used to infer affective activation and valence. The evaluation involved an experiment in which {{the effectiveness of the}} fully functional ATS was compared with that of a non-affective version, and was conducted with 40 adult participants.

40|$|Recently, a {{sensibility}} <b>directed</b> to the <b>re-use</b> of {{the vast}} and diffused building patrimony for the industrial production developed in Europe. Originally built {{in the second half}} of the 19 th and last century, such patrimony is now disused due to processes of economic transformation and urbanism. Even though considered minor buildings nevertheless, such buildings carry historic-cultural values which are recognized and appreciated. The idea of re-using these buildings is linked to the historical memories, which tend to enhance the cultural identity of a determined territory. However, a further challenge is added; the realization of redevelopments based on sustainable criteria. Through the analysis of case studies in the North-East of Italy, this work proposes to identify sustainable criteria of intervention for this building patrimony. Industrial buildings such as spinning and cotton mills have been analyzed; this paper focuses exclusively on spinning mills. In these cases, sustainability is intended in its wide meaning, it therefore regards: the application of the criterion of “least land consumption”; the identification of the building’s characteristics; the application of the criterion of the reuse compatible with the materials and the construction techniques of the building; the introduction of compatible and innovative technologies that can be integrated without altering of the historical characteristics of the building itself. From this detailed analysis, it is possible to extrapolate guidelines for a sustainable planning in this particular and specific context...|$|R
40|$|This vision paper {{discusses}} {{the advantages and}} disadvantages of the three main options for the recycling of rare-earth elements from end-of-life fluorescent lamps: (1) <b>direct</b> <b>re-use</b> of the lamp phosphor mixture; (2) separation of the lamp phosphor mixture into the different phosphor components; (3) recovery of the rare-earth content. An overview is given of commercial activities in Europe in the domain of recycling of materials from end-of-life fluorescent lamps and the recovery of rare earths from these lamps. The collection of end-of-life fluorescent lamps is currently driven by a legal framework that prohibited the release of mercury to the environment. The contaminations of the lamp phosphor powders by mercury and by small glass particles of crushed fluorescent lamps are limiting factors in the recycling process. Research should be directed to an advanced clean-up of the reclaimed lamp phosphor fraction, and in particular to the removal of mercury and glass fragments. The recovery of rare earths from the lamp phosphors could be facilitated by taking advantage of the differences in resistance of the different lamp phosphors by chemical attack by inorganic acids and bases. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDynamic {{reconfiguration}} {{of hardware}} resources is increasingly used in applications {{as a way}} to increase performances, resources integration or energy efficiency. As this evolution induces a change of the application execution paradigm, various tools have been set up to develop and manage these applications. But most do not allow <b>direct</b> <b>re-use</b> of legacy code, needing adaptation to match the provided environment. Moreover, partial reconfiguration is only at its early stages, and lacks easy ways of handling. We propose a design methodology and a runtime environment bringing fast integration of legacy hardware accelerators for partial and dynamic reconfigurable hardware architectures. Thanks to it, applications making use of dynamic hardware can be run directly on an Embedded Linux without noticing the reconfiguration flow. Moreover, our design methodology allows providing various implementations of a computation kernel, including both hardware and software ones. The implementation can then be chosen at execution time depending on available resources. In this article, we introduce the generic IP interface description making the re-use process possible. Furthermore, we present the results of a sample application running on our platform using software and hardware implementations. For hardware implementations, we obtain reconfiguration overhead as low as 0. 16 % of the total kernel execution time...|$|E
40|$|Authorities that {{regulate}} environmental issues pertaining to industrial wastes in South Africa regard landfill disposal {{as the only}} effective environmental management option for slag and other inorganic by-products from the ferro-alloy industry. Metallurgical slags are widely utilised in civil engineering and construction applications in {{other countries in the}} world and in line with the overall philosophy of conserving mineral and other natural resources, these materials should be assessed for the possibility of resource recovery, recycling, reclamation, <b>direct</b> <b>re-use</b> or alternative uses. This presentation describes a risk-based approach for the assessment of by-products from the ferro-alloy industry for alternative use. Once a by-product from an industrial process has been identified for alternative use, its intended use would be defined, but it will not be possible to control its actual use or misuse in society, nor will it be possible to control its fate during the application life cycle. In the interest of protection of human health and the environment, potential risks associated with the handling and uses of a material throughout its life cycle therefore have to be quantified. The assessment has to include both human health and ecological risks and must cover the entire life cycle of a product, from its production up to its end-of-life disposal. The presentation introduces the concept of tiered risk assessment and demonstrates how this applies in the overall assessment of by-products from metallurgical industry sector for safe use in society. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{solvent extraction}} process for purification of indium has been developed from a chloride aqueous feed solution using the ionic liquids Cyphos® IL 101 and Aliquat® 336. The high affinity of indium(III) for the ionic liquid phase gave extraction percentages above 95 % over the HCl concentration range from 0. 5 to 12 M. Attention was paid to the loading capacity of the ionic liquid phase and the kinetics of the extraction process. An extraction mechanism was proposed based {{on the relationship between}} the viscosity of the ionic liquid phase and the loading with indium(III) ions. Even for loadings as high as 100 g L− 1, equilibrium was reached within 10 min. Due to the very high distribution ratio for indium(III), stripping of indium(III) from the ionic liquid phase was very difficult with water or acid solutions. However, indium could conveniently be recovered as In(OH) 3 by precipitation stripping with a NaOH solution. Precipitation stripping has the advantage that no ionic liquid components are lost to the aqueous phase and that the ionic liquid is regenerated for <b>direct</b> <b>re-use.</b> The extraction of some metal ions that are commonly found as impurities in industrial indium process solutions, i. e. cadmium(II), copper(II), iron(III), manganese(II), nickel(II), tin(IV) and zinc(II), has been investigated. The distribution ratios for the different metal ions show that indium(III) can be purified efficiently by a combination of extraction, scrubbing and stripping stages. This new ionic liquid process avoids the use of volatile organic solvents. status: publishe...|$|E

The oily CRM sludge contains lots of valuable iron and alloying elements, along with plenty of hazardous organic components, which makes it an attractive secondary resource and an environmental contaminant at the same time At present, oily CRM sludge is mainly used as smelting raw materials Its <b>direct</b> <b>re-use</b> in sintering may lead to some problems because high oil content of oily CRM sludge results in increased emission of volatile organic compounds including dioxins and can lead to problems in waste gas purification systems, e. g glow fires in electrostatic precipitators. In this paper, micaceous iron oxide (MIO) pigment was synthesized from oily CRM sludge by means of the multi-step processes, including acid leaching, preparation of the ferric hydroxide precursor and hydrothermal synthesis. The experimental conditions, including NaOH concentration and hydrothermal reaction temperature were investigated {{in order to determine the}} optimal ones. The morphology and particle size of as-prepared MIO pigment were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The results showed that the obtained pigment had high purity (∼ 98. 7 %) and good oil absorption (∼ 18. 8 %). The synthesized MIO pigments met the required characteristics of MIO pigments for paints (ISO 10601 - 2007).

40|$|Abstract Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) in wastewaters {{from the}} {{chemical}} industry are of major concern because of their environmental and health impacts. The reclamation of VOCs from wastewaters would not only reduce the hazard to the environment but also contribute to an efficient use of resources. The thesis explores the reclamation of n-butanol and dichloromethane from sodium chloride containing mixtures by pervaporation. Another aim was to gain understanding of mass transport phenomena during the pervaporation of multicomponent systems, {{and the effect of}} sodium chloride on the pervaporation performance. In this work, the reclamation of n-butanol and dichloromethane was conducted as a sequence of pervaporation stages which utilised first hydrophobic and then hydrophilic membranes. The objective was to segregate the mixture of n-butanol/dichloromethane/sodium chloride/water into three different streams: a re-use quality concentrate of VOCs, brine, and discharge quality purified water. The effect of the experimental variables, VOCs feed concentration, feed temperature and sodium chloride content on the performance of the pervaporation stages was studied. A statistical design, response surface methodology, was used to further resource efficiency. The results indicate the potential of pervaporation for the reclamation of n-butanol and dichloromethane from aqueous mixtures. A single step of pervaporation of n-butanol/dichloromethane/sodium chloride/water systems using the CMX-GF- 010 -D (Celfa) and PERTHESE® 500 - 1 (P  500 - 1) membranes does not sufficiently concentrate the VOCs for <b>direct</b> <b>re-use.</b> It is also demonstrated that the electrolyte does not permeate through the membranes and does not affect their separation effectiveness significantly. The pervaporation of the water/dichloromethane/n-butanol system using the hydrophilic poly(vinyl alcohol) -titanium dioxide/polyacrylonitrile/polyphenylene sulfide (PVA-TiO 2 /PAN/PPS) membrane is effective for dewatering purposes. The membrane shows impermeable features towards dichloromethane in the studied conditions. The analysis of the mass transport phenomena demonstrates that, under the experimental conditions studied, the resistance towards the mass transport of the compounds through the membrane is mainly exhibited by the membrane itself. This study also shows the advantage of analysing the effect of temperature on membrane permeation by the permeation activation energy instead of by the apparent activation energy...|$|E
40|$|NdFeB magnets {{currently}} {{dominate the}} magnet market {{due to their}} superior magnetic properties with maximum volume minimization. NdFeB magnets are composed of 25 - 35 wt. % rare earth elements (REE) along with ca. 1 wt. % B and the rest being transition metals (mainly Fe). REE, other than Nd, such as Dy, Pr, Tb and Gd or exogen elements, other than Fe, such as Al, Co, Ga, Nb, Si, Cu and Zr can also be present as minor admixtures. Depending on the operation medium, these magnets are usually also coated with Ni, Zn, etc. or can be embedded in epoxy. The on-going monopoly of China on REE oxide production {{in the last two}} decades along with continuously increasing demand for REE impose serious supply risks for certain REE (e. g. Nd and Dy). Due to their high REE content along with their increasing production rate, efficient recycling options for pre-consumer and end-of-life (EOL) NdFeB magnets are needed to combat that supply problem. To achieve these goals, 3 different hydrometallurgical or combined hydro- and pyrometallurgical flow sheets have been developed and completed within this thesis. These are namely, (1) Sulfation, Selective Roasting and Water Leaching, (2) Nitration, Calcination and Water Leaching, and (3) Complete Leaching, Iron Removal and Electrolysis. Both of the first two flow sheets were a combination of pyro- and hydrometallurgical methods and enabled > 95 % REE and 90 wt. %). In the third flow sheet, a different and only-hydrometallurgical approach was taken. Here, in addition to previous targets, it was aimed to recover minor but valuable base metals (e. g. Co, Ni and Cu) along with complete recycling of consumed acid and chemicals after electrolysis stage. However, this stage was found to be problematic and not a good candidate for purification of the leachate for REE. Additional steps were studied to overcome these problems and were found to be quite successful. However, the overall flow sheet extended significantly thereby requiring a justification through economic analysis. In the last phase of the doctorate, a separate work flow was studied, namely, (4) Comparative Oxidation Behaviors of Hydrogenated NdFeB Magnets. Here, it was aimed to investigate the thermal oxidation behaviours of differently hydrogenated magnets. Hydrogenation treatments are the most promising methods to physically remove waste NdFeB magnets from their surroundings. The oxidation tendency of the product after such treatments can be of importance for both direct and indirect recycling routes. While the initial composition of the magnet was found to have little or no effect on the oxidation behaviour of both hydrogenated and non-hydrogenated magnets, the hydrogenation treatment type had direct impact via both particle size distribution and oxidation mechanism. Among all 5 hydrogenation treatments, the hydrogenation decrepitation (HD) method was found to be the most effective treatment for subsequent conventional oxidative roasting-acid leaching flow sheet while disproportionated magnets were found to be the most stable powders.
