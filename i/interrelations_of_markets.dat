It was established that the approach of “break-even ” sale of a subject at liquidation value, which is predominating in the literature sources, shows the results essentially different from {{the ratio of the}} prices of free and accelerated sales that can be observed on the market. The article offers an alternative approach to definition <b>of</b> <b>market</b> value coefficient, which considers switching to liquidation value. This approach is based on functional dependence of the coefficient on the ratio of limited and unlimited period of exposition...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{innovative}} products’ demanded {{weight on the}} profitability <b>of</b> <b>marketed</b> commodities on the example of JSC "Barsky machine-building plant" are investigated. Four models <b>of</b> <b>interrelation</b> are selected and their statistical properties are identified. All comparisons except the linear one optimally describe the <b>interrelation</b> <b>of</b> profitability <b>of</b> <b>marketed</b> commodities and the innovative products’ demanded weight in the overall volume <b>of</b> <b>marketed</b> commodities. The best equation <b>of</b> <b>interrelation</b> is the exponential equation. The research results have shown that each percent <b>of</b> <b>marketed</b> commodities provided an average of 0, 107 % <b>of</b> the enterprise’s <b>marketed</b> commodities profitability...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the world}} economy faced the largest {{economic}} downturn since World War II. This recession was characterized by, among others, three properties: trembling financial markets, increasing uncertainty, and, {{in the aftermath of}} the recession, exploding public debt in major industrialized economies. The joint appearance of these characteristics stresses that a profound understanding of economic dynamics and interrelations is crucial for informative policy monitoring and for the conduct of effective policy intervention. This thesis focuses on historical and recent dynamics of financial and macroeconomic data. It discusses the <b>interrelation</b> <b>of</b> financial <b>markets</b> and the macroeconomy, the role of uncertainty and the sustainability of public debt. Linear and nonlinear state space modeling and regression techniques are used to investigate the informational content of time series and panel data...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} selected issues {{in regard to}} the mathematical modeling <b>of</b> electricity <b>markets.</b> In a first step the <b>interrelations</b> <b>of</b> electric power <b>market</b> modeling are highlighted a crossroad between operations research, applied economics, and engineering. In a second step the development of a large-scale continental European economic engineering model named ELMOD is described and the model is applied to the issue of wind integration. It is concluded that enabling the integration of low-carbon technologies appears feasible for wind energy. In a third step algorithmic work is carried out regarding a game theoretic model. Two approaches in order to solve a discretely-constrained mathematical program with equilibrium constraints using disjunctive constraints are presented. The first one reformulates the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and the second one applies the Benders decomposition technique. Selected numerical results are reported...|$|R

40|$|The article {{improves}} the theoretical and mathematical mechanism {{in order to}} put in order institutional grounds of state regulation <b>of</b> <b>interrelations</b> that appear between subjects <b>of</b> the energy <b>market</b> in the process of electric energy trade. The article establishes structural and logical links between institutional factors of economic development and those functions of the state, which the state regulation <b>of</b> <b>interrelations</b> <b>of</b> subjects of the electric energy market is based upon. Based on the evolution approach the article analyses institutional instruments of state regulation <b>of</b> <b>interrelation</b> <b>of</b> subjects of the electric energy market, which takes into account specific features of its operation, specific conditions of development and creates a scientific and methodical basis for formation of concepts, strategies and programmes of development <b>of</b> the <b>market</b> <b>of</b> electric energy at the state level. The article considers and offers ways of improvement of the regulatory and legal provision of the process of state regulation of inter-subject relations of participants of the electric energy market with the aim of increase of scientific justification of draft laws and taking into consideration urgent problems when improving and developing regulatory and legal acts...|$|R

40|$|The {{alignment}} of the strategic and the operational level of packaging development {{in relation to the}} integration of sustainability is not addressed extensively in current research. This paper aims to address this, by focusing on the decision-making <b>interrelations</b> <b>of</b> key actors (<b>marketing</b> and packaging development) within multidisciplinary product-packaging development teams. The research is conducted by means of a qualitative approach, consisting of semi-structured interviews with individual packaging development team members, complemented with a newly developed visualization tool. The research builds upon eight cases within brand owners, packaging material suppliers and packaging development consultants. The main findings of the study include the decision-making trade-offs between sustainability considerations and other project indicators, such as costs, time-to-market and technical challenges. These trade-offs are linked to the strategic and operational roles of key actors, and to internal and external factors influencing sustainable development processes. This research’s contribution is to address the {{alignment of}} the strategic and the operational levels of sustainable packaging development, in relation to (1) decision making and interrelations within multidisciplinary development teams; and (2) the relevance of development-influencing factors. This provides opportunities for further development of sustainable packaging models and tools, in order to align the strategic and operational level of development.
