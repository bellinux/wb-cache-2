The paper notes both {{the high level of}} industry concentration in South African manufacturing, and a rising trend in concentration across a wide range of industries.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Extant {{evidence}} of acquirers' post-merger underperformance is {{often viewed as}} support for the behavioral theory of mergers that investors overvalue acquirers during the pre-acquisition period. Motivated by recent developments in asset pricing, which show that firms' expected returns and <b>investment</b> <b>rates</b> are negatively related, this paper proposes a neoclassical-based explanation for acquirers' post-merger poor returns. Acquirers are predominantly high q firms with rich growth opportunities and high <b>investment</b> <b>rates,</b> and are thus vulnerable to investment shocks. It follows that the negative investment-expected return relation is especially important in pricing acquirers. The underperformance puzzle arises because {{of the failure of}} traditional asset pricing models to account for heterogeneous impacts of investment shocks and the links between firms' <b>investment</b> <b>rates</b> and expected returns. To solve the problem, I use an investment factor-augmented Fama French model and a q theory based model to examine acquirers' long-term performance, and find the puzzle largely disappears. Rather than interpreting negative abnormal returns as {{evidence of}} overvaluation of stock-financed acquirers and high q acquirers, I show that their low returns are explained by high <b>investment</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

Moreover, simulations of a calibrated version of the model in which distortions follow a stochastic process common to all countries account for around 90 % of the final disparity in relative <b>investment</b> <b>rates.</b> The model, however, cannot account for the disparity in income across countries and its evolution over time. ...|$|R
