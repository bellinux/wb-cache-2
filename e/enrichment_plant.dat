40|$|It {{has been}} few decades since the {{measures}} {{were taken to}} rehabilitate the forest after logging in peninsular Malaysia. <b>Enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> {{is one of the}} potential rehabilitation measures. The technical issues like line planting technique, spacing, species-site matching are crucially related to the success of rehabilitation effort. Different factors are directly or indirectly related to the success of it. These factors affect the overall performance of the plantation. The performance of different techniques varies from each other. The features of the new line planting technique are different from the other conventional planting techniques to some extent. Techniques of <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting,</b> thus, are needed to be reviewed to determine the role of new technique towards sustainability. The study focused on the potentialities of line <b>planting</b> technique of <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> in Peninsular Malaysia. It emphasized on sustainability perspective as well economic feasibility of the technique. The overview of the present <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> indicates that the plantations following line planting technique have good growth performance that leads to an increase in resource base. The salient criteria of line planting considers few aspects of planting technique that are required to be followed by the forest managers to make it sustainable. The use of improved techniques, thus, ensures the necessary conditions for regeneration of forest, its expected growth and sustainability. By carrying out a financial analysis, it was seen that the technique is also economically feasible. The Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return of the <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> with new technique are higher than the <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> with other techniques. In order to ensure it’s more scientific implementation, furthered in depth technical assessment such as species-site matching, biodiversity aspects and adequate information are necessary to establish it towards sustainable forest resource base. ...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{agroforestry}} management {{seems to}} be perfunctory thus the developed one is that a particular area is planted with as much trees as possible. Assumption developed among agroforester farmers is that more trees planted the greater the production or the economic value are. One of the traditional silviculture actions in agroforestry systems is <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting.</b> This study aims to identify the practice of <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> which is developed in agroforestry management and to devise the schemes to increase more prospective <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting.</b> The research was conducted in Gunung Kidul, Java, Indonesia which includes three zones namely the Batur Agung (Nglanggeran Village), Ledok Wonosari (Gari Village) and Gunung Seribu (Jetis Village). Data sampling method is done by purposive random sampling way. In each village it is selected 30 units of agroforestry land consisting of 10 initial agroforestries, 10 intermediate agroforestries and 10 advanced agroforestries. Analysis includes site conditions, microclimate, evolving patterns of agroforestry and traditional silvicultural practices. The result shows {{that the practice of}} <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> traditionally is still limited to the consideration of the tree numbers increase in agroforestry systems. Furthermore <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> has not been followed by intensive silvicultural actions. Based on these considerations it is necessary to make innovation to increase the agroforestry productivity (Batur Agung Zone) with intensive silviculture that synergizes <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> with pruning, commercial thinning and tebang butuh through the schemes: 1) Agroforestry for food, 2) Agroforestry transition from food-based initial agroforestry to advanced agroforestry and 3) Acceleration of initial agroforestry to advanced agroforestry. As for Ledok Wonosari and Gunung Seribu Zone through the schemes: 1) Acceleration of initial agroforestry to full teak advanced agroforestry and 2) The transition from initial to advanced agroforestry with enrichment. With the scheme of this traditional silviculture technology can enhance the role of agroforestry as a last resort of forest management outside the forest. </p...|$|R

40|$|Deforestation {{leads to}} the {{deterioration}} of soil fertility which occurs rapidly under tropical climates. Forest rehabilitation {{is one of the}} approaches to restore soil fertility and increase the productivity of degraded areas. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare soil biological properties under <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> and secondary forests at Tapah Hill Forest Reserve, Perak after 42 years of planting. Both areas were excessively logged in the 1950 s and left idle without any appropriate forest management until 1968 when rehabilitation program was initiated. Six subplots (20 [*]m × 20 [*]m) were established within each <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> (F 1) and secondary forest (F 2) plots, after which soil was sampled at depths of 0 – 15 [*]cm (topsoil) and 15 – 30 [*]cm (subsoil). Results showed that total mean microbial enzymatic activity, as well as biomass C and N content, was significantly higher in F 1 compared to F 2. The results, despite sample variability, suggest that the rehabilitation program improves the soil biological activities where high rate of soil organic matter, organic C, N, suitable soil acidity range, and abundance of forest litter is believed to be the predisposing factor promoting higher population of microbial in F 1 as compared to F 2. In conclusion total microbial enzymatic activity, biomass C and biomass N evaluation were higher in <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> plot compared to secondary forest. After 42 years of <b>planting,</b> rehabilitation or <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> helps to restore the productivity of planted forest in terms of biological parameters...|$|R

40|$|Many {{harvested}} timber {{species of}} tropical forests {{have not been}} regenerating sufficiently for future cutting cycles, which can demand the application of post-harvesting silvicultural treatments. This study analyzed the profitability of sawnwood produced through four treatments applied on seedlings and saplings naturally present or planted in logging gaps as follows: (1) the standard procedures of reduced-impact logging or control; (2) the tending of the naturally established regeneration; (3) <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> 1 (EP- 1); and (4) <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> 2 (EP- 2). In EP- 1 commercial species were planted in 2 -year-old gaps with no logging residuals removal from the gap while in EP- 2 seedlings were planted in 1 -year-old gaps with logging residuals removal from the gap. The planted timber species in EP- 2 had higher financial value and higher growth rates than the timber species planted in EP- 1. The experiment {{was carried out in}} a certified managed forest in the Eastern Amazon, Brazil. The growth rates of the treated seedlings and saplings were projected in 30 and 60 years from the treatment establishment to simulate sawnwood production. The simulations indicated that, increases of 25 and 50 % in growth rates and increases up to 500 % in timber prices under annual interest rates of 4 and 6 %, the treatments of tending and <b>enrichment</b> <b>planting</b> can be profitable at year 60.
