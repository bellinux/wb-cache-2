40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a free {{rigid body}} of {{dimension}} three is extended and analysed both in classical and quantum mechanics. The extension is performed by bringing the inverse inertia tensor, {{which is a}} positive-definite symmetric matrix for the ordinary rigid body, into an arbitrary real symmetric one. With an arbitrary real symmetric matrix chosen, associated is a Lie–Poisson structure on the Euclidean space of dimension three, through which the classical dynamics for an <b>extended</b> <b>free</b> rigid body is defined, and characterized by two first integrals. In parallel to this, the quantum dynamics is formulated as the problem of simultaneous spectral resolution of the two operators which are viewed as the quantization of the two classical first integrals. Intensive use is made of the unitary representation theory for Lie groups concerned. The explicit spectral resolution is obtained, in particular, when the <b>extended</b> <b>free</b> rigid body is an <b>extended</b> <b>free</b> symmetric top...|$|R

Meanwhile, however, the city of Curst has [...] "slid" [...] from the border of the Outlands to the neighboring chaotic plane Carceri due to the chaos unleashed by Trias after The Nameless One freed him. After a fight, Trias tells The Nameless One that the portal to the Fortress of Regrets is located in Sigil's mortuary, in the very room where the game began.|$|R
