500|$|Through {{the winter}} months of the 2007–08 season, Gilberto started {{a limited number of}} games for the Gunners, though he kept his place in the Brazil team, {{starting}} several games for A Seleção. After becoming more and more frustrated with not playing regularly, Gilberto admitted in February 2008 that he had been made to feel [...] "totally useless" [...] by Wenger. Despite this, he declined to make a decision on his future; something which prompted Wenger to promise talks with Gilberto. Amidst Gilberto's frustration at Arsenal, he targeted playing in Brazil's Olympic team in Beijing during August 2008; a competition which he had never played in. Off the pitch, Gilberto was reported to have passed his UK Citizenship test, and that he would subsequently apply for a British passport. April saw Gilberto's season take a turn for the better; making 5 starts – a substantial portion of his seasonal total of 12 – even managing to score a goal. The goal came against Reading on 19 April, and despite its <b>deflective</b> nature leading to some classing it as a possible own goal, the Premier League's Dubious Goals Committee eventually credited the goal to Gilberto. However, Gilberto's return to favour did not stop Arsenal's 2007–08 season ending trophyless. The club subsequently faced the possibility of several players leaving; among those rumoured to leave was Flamini, the player who had kept Gilberto out of the first team. The Frenchman ended up moving to A.C. Milan on 6 May, and a subsequent gap was left in the Arsenal midfield. Gilberto became less likely to leave the club during Summer 2008 as a result, and Wenger remarked that he wanted to keep Gilberto; Gilberto saying he wanted to stay and possibly even renew his contract at Arsenal. Gilberto finished the 2007–08 season with 36 appearances for Arsenal, albeit only 12 of these being Premier League starts.|$|E
2500|$|Occlusion {{is defined}} most simply as [...] "contacts between teeth", {{and is the}} meeting of teeth during biting and chewing. The term does not imply any disease. Malocclusion is a medical term {{referring}} to less than ideal positioning of the upper teeth relative to the lower teeth, which can occur both when the upper jaw is ideally proportioned to the lower jaw, or {{where there is a}} discrepancy between the size of the upper jaw relative to the lower jaw. Malocclusion of some sort is so common that the concept of an [...] "ideal occlusion" [...] is called into question, and it can be considered [...] "normal to be abnormal". An occlusal interference may refer to a problem which interferes with the normal path of the bite, and is usually used to describe a localized problem with the position or shape of a single tooth or group of teeth. A premature contact is one part of the bite meeting sooner than other parts, meaning {{that the rest of the}} teeth meet later or are held open, e.g., a new dental restoration on a tooth (e.g., a crown) which has a slightly different shape or position to the original tooth may contact too soon in the bite. A <b>deflective</b> contact/interference is an interference with the bite that changes the normal path of the bite. A common example of a <b>deflective</b> interference is an over-erupted upper wisdom tooth, often because the lower wisdom tooth has been removed or is impacted. In this example, when the jaws are brought together, the lower back teeth contact the prominent upper wisdom tooth before the other teeth, and the lower jaw has to move forward to allow the rest of the teeth to meet. The difference between a premature contact and a <b>deflective</b> interference is that the latter implies a dynamic abnormality in the bite.|$|E

50|$|Speakers of Chinese {{seem to have}} a very <b>deflective</b> {{approach}} to praise and compliments, and in comparison to American English speakers, may compliment one another in conversation less frequently. Chinese culture highly values the group over the individual, as well as modesty. As a means of reinforcing one's humility, Chinese speakers tend to respond to a compliment by rejecting it or lowering themselves by returning the compliment back to the original speaker. Wolfson (1984) noted that it is often inappropriate for a man to compliment a Chinese woman on her physical attributes, especially if {{they do not have a}} close relationship. A study by Gabriele Kasper found that over 80% of Chinese speaking women from her sample gave more explicit compliments and responses in comparison to less than half of the men.|$|E
50|$|This {{goes back}} to the notion of the fag discourse. Pascoe states “becoming a fag has {{as much to do with}} failing at the {{masculine}} tasks of competence, heterosexual prowess, and strength or in any way revealing weakness or femininity as it does with a sexual identity. This fluidity of the fag identity is what makes the specter of the fag such a powerful disciplinary mechanism. It is fluid enough that boys permanently adhere and definitive enough so that boys recognize a fag behavior and strive to avoid it”. No homo is a <b>deflective</b> mechanism used to avoid the identity of fag being placed upon the speaker. When the speaker adds no homo to the end of their sentence, it is because “the problem is not necessarily that they commited a sexual transgression, but that they have committed a gender transgression”.|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the spray pattern {{appears as a}} flat sheet of liquid. The pattern is formed by an {{elliptical}} or a round orifice on a <b>deflective</b> surface that is tangent to the exit orifice. The orifice has an external groove with a contoured internal cylindrical radius, or “cat’s eye” shape. In the elliptical orifice design, the pattern sprays out of the orifice {{in line with the}} pipe. In the deflector design, the spray pattern is perpendicular to the pipe. There are two categories of flat spray, tapered and even, depending on the uniformity of the spray over the spray pattern. Flat spray patterns with tapering edges are produced by straight-through elliptical spray nozzles. This spray pattern is useful for overlapping patterns between multiple nozzle headers. The result is uniform distribution across the entire sprayed surface. Non-tapered flat spray nozzles are used in cleaning applications that require a uniform spray pattern without any overlap in spray area.|$|E
5000|$|In July, 2013, art and {{criticism}} journal The Baffler published a lengthy {{article on the}} book and its associated [...] "movement" [...] LeanIn.org. In the article, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Susan Faludi argues that self-described feminist Sandberg's message of women's workplace empowerment is actually a corporate-backed campaign that encourages women to promote themselves individually as [...] "marketable consumer objects" [...] for professional advancement, while discouraging solidarity and downplaying the damaging effects of systemic gender bias felt collectively by women in the workplace. The article further questions the selection criteria used by LeanIn.org for its corporate [...] "Platform Partners", {{many of whom are}} burdened by [...] "recent or pending EEOC grievances and state and federal court actions involving sex discrimination, sexual harassment, pregnancy discrimination, unfair promotion policies, wrongful terminations, and gender-based retaliations against female employees." [...] Faludi's analysis concludes with a detailed account of her failed attempts to contact Sandberg for an on-record interview, along with a section directly quoted from Faludi's email correspondence with Sandberg's public relations staff. In the emails, Faludi's requests for specific examples of LeanIn.org's supposed workplace activism and clarification of the group's support policy for its heavily marketed [...] "Lean In Circles" [...] peer group package appear to be met with <b>deflective</b> responses.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, when Adamson {{stepped into}} the role, Noah becomes more outspoken about his parents behavior. According to Adamson, [...] "Noah will be giving his parents more of a hard time, while {{figuring}} out who he is." [...] Adamson observed that Noah is a guy [...] "who has transitioned into being a man" [...] and [...] "is recognizing the difficult position he was given as a kid. He's a middle man, a kid who's learned to be <b>deflective</b> and you may see some self-righteousness" [...] in his attitude toward his parents, realizing his mistakes [...] "are not nearly as bad" [...] as theirs. Adamson's first major storyline as Noah starts very subtly. Luke Kerr noted that Noah seemed to be hiding something because of his mysterious and vague phone calls. This led {{to the introduction of}} New York City police detective, Alex Chavez portrayed by Adamson's former Lincoln Heights costar, Ignacio Serricchio. Chavez demands information from Noah about his ex-girlfriend, Adriana Stone. As Noah denies having contact with her, the series introduced Jhoanna Flores as Adriana. As of April 5, 2013, Noah was stated to be 23 years old. Noah begins Genoa City Police Officer Courtney Sloane (Kelli Goss). Adamson viewed Courtney as marking Noah's first [...] "strong relationship", saying: [...] "His past relationship with Adriana, it was all trouble all around. So he sees this as a grown up relationship." [...] Courtney is later murdered as part of a killer storyline in 2015, on the day she and Noah were planning to marry.|$|E

40|$|Background: Predators {{preferentially}} attack vital {{body parts}} to avoid prey escape. Consequently, prey adaptations that make predators attack less crucial body parts {{are expected to}} evolve. Marginal eyespots on butterfly wings have long been thought to have this <b>deflective,</b> but hitherto undemonstrated function. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we report that a butterfly, Lopinga achine, with broad-spectrum reflective white scales in its marginal eyespot pupils deceives a generalist avian predator, the blue tit, to attack the marginal eyespots, but only under particular conditions—in our experiments, low light intensities with a prominent UV component. Under high light intensity conditions with a similar UV component, and at low light intensities without UV, blue tits directed attacks towards the butterfly head. Conclusions/Significance: In nature, birds typically forage intensively at early dawn, when the light environment shifts to shorter wavelengths, and {{the contrast between the}} eyespot pupils and the background increases. Among butterflies, deflecting attacks is likely to be particularly important at dawn when low ambient temperatures make escape by flight impossible, and when insectivorous birds typically initiate another day’s search for food. Our finding that the <b>deflective</b> function of eyespots is highly dependent on the ambient light environment helps explain why previous attempts have provided little support for the <b>deflective</b> role of marginal eyespots, and we hypothesize that the mechanism that we hav...|$|E

The results show that {{at the head of}} the pulsed jet forms a <b>deflective</b> slug structure which is consistent with the result from high-speed photography experiments.

40|$|One {{dimensional}} torsional micro mirrors for laser steering applications {{have been}} developed and manufactured at Fraunhofer Institute of Photonic Microsystems. Several design variations with rectangular plates are available. The device can be operated in resonant mode and quasistatic mode as well. The device is fabricated out of a BSOI wafer and a second conductive silicon wafer. The structure is assembled by conductive adhesive bonding. Torsional springs connect the mirror plate to the mirror frame mechanically and electrically. Filled isolation trench structures separate volumes of different electrical potentials at the frame and at the <b>deflective</b> mirror respectively. Comb drive structures at {{both sides of the}} deflectable mirror and the part of frame located opposite increases capacitance at both mirror half sides. Applying a low level drive voltage between the combs, the mirror can be operated in resonant mode. The second silicon wafer is placed below the <b>deflective</b> mirror and is electrically at ground. Applying a electrical potential of higher level {{to one side of the}} deflectable mirror, the mirror can be driven quasistatic and resonant as well. While the drive voltage is applied to one side of the mirror, the comb drive structure of the opposite side can be used for capacitance based position read out...|$|E
40|$|When a {{wood board}} {{is exposed to}} a change in {{relative}} humidity on only one of its surfaces, e. g. in case of flooring or a panel painting, the resulting asymmetric moisture content profile induces differential expansion over the thickness. Consequently a bending moment causes the board to curve. A theory is presented to describe the bending of a wood board due to a step change in relative humidity. The board is assumed to be homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly elastic. Moisture transport is presumed to obey the diffusion equation with constant coefficients, such that moisture transport can be directly related to the bending of the board. It is shown that the transient <b>deflective</b> behavior provides the diffusion coefficient and the final length change yields the linear hygroscopic expansion coefficient. Derived diffusion coefficients are in good agreement with values in literature. Furthermore, a scaling law for the deflection of the board is proposed, which is seen to be followed qualitatively but not quantitatively by experiments. Finally, by assuming the deflection of the board to be the response of a linear system, the <b>deflective</b> frequency response of the board can be predicted from its step response. The results allow upscaling of deflection and expansion, such that behavior of thick boards can be determined from an experiment using a thin board...|$|E
