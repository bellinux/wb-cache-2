Quasi-static compressive testing is used {{to examine the effects of}} different sizes of dual centrally-located circular hole discontinuities on the crush characteristics of the extrusion absorber test specimens. Test specimens fabricated from three types of aluminum alloy extrusion stock material, AA 6061 -T 4, AA 6061 -T 6, and AA 6063 -T 5, and two wall thicknesses were considered in the <b>crush</b> <b>testing.</b> Finite element models of each of the test specimens were developed using a material model incorporating damage mechanics. The material models were developed using a two-stage calibration process employing data from tensile tests conducted on specimens extracted from the extrusion stock material. The results of the quasi-static compressive testing showed that large improvements in energy absorption characteristics may be achieved in the types of axially-loaded structures considered in this research through the addition of circular hole discontinuities. Several new collapse modes were observed in the experimental <b>crush</b> <b>testing</b> and are characterized in the text using photographs of the experimental process. The collapse modes and energy absorption of the <b>crush</b> <b>test</b> specimens were found to be dependent largely on material properties. Furthermore, a good correlation was observed between the results of the experimental quasi-static compressive tests and the results of the finite element simulations.
