5|$|In February 1998, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Ricardo Torres {{dismissed}} Coppola's claim. Although Torres {{agreed that}} Sagan violated some {{terms of the}} contract, he explained that Coppola waited too long to file his lawsuit, and that the contract might not be enforceable as it was written. Coppola then appealed <b>his</b> <b>suit,</b> {{taking it to the}} California Courts of Appeal (CCA). In April 2000, the CCA dismissed <b>his</b> <b>suit,</b> finding that Coppola’s claims were barred because they were brought too late. The court noted that it was not until 1994 that the filmmaker thought about suing over Contact.|$|E

5|$|Florindo {{opens with}} {{celebrations}} to mark Apollo's {{victory over the}} dragon Python. Apollo boasts that he is more proficient with the bow than Cupid. This offends the latter, who mischievously wounds Apollo with a drugged arrow which causes him {{to fall in love}} with Daphne. She, however, has pledged her love for Florindo, who is at the centre of a complex tangle of infatuations: he is secretly loved by Alfirena and more openly by the scheming shepherdess Lycoris, who in turn is the object of the shepherd Damon's desires. The various would-be lovers are consoled or advised by Damon's friend Thyrsis, and by the ageing nymph Galathea, who has herself not quite given up on love, though her advances to Thyrsis are rejected. Daphne and Florindo prepare to marry, but Apollo remains hopeful and continues <b>his</b> <b>suit.</b> Lycoris is prepared to await the outcome of events, but Damon, Galathea and Alfirena are in despair, as the opera ends with another spectacular celebration in honour of Apollo.|$|E

He claims to get <b>his</b> <b>suits</b> in a golf pro shop in Kentucky; no one else makes his kind of clothes anymore due to anti-pollution laws. While Herb's co-workers mock his fashion sense ("Somewhere there's a Volkswagen without seat covers"), Herb claims that <b>his</b> <b>suits</b> put <b>his</b> clients at ease, conveying the message [...] "trust me, sign my deal! I know what I'm doing." [...] He is proven right in the episode [...] "Changes", when he switches over to a tasteful wardrobe; his lowbrow clients don't trust someone with such a highbrow wardrobe, and Herb quickly returns to his old way of dressing.|$|R
5|$|In 1991, Gregory Banks, {{a convicted}} felon, filed {{a civil suit}} for $16 million in damages against Burge, three colleagues, and the City of Chicago for condoning {{brutality}} and torture. He {{said that he had}} falsely confessed in 1983 to murder after he was tortured by officers: they placed a plastic bag over his head, put a gun in his mouth, and performed other acts. He said that the officers allegedly abused eleven other suspects, using such measures as electro-shock. The suit was brought by the People's Law Office attorneys who had represented Andrew Wilson in the 1989 police brutality case. The suit described 23 incidents against black and Hispanic suspects between 19721985. The Bank's suit named Sergeant Peter Dignan as one of the officers involved in the abuses. In 1995 Dignan was promoted for meritorious service, even though the City of Chicago had settled out of court with Banks on <b>his</b> <b>suit.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mary was courted by Duke Philip of Bavaria {{from late}} 1539, {{but he was}} Lutheran and <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> for her hand was unsuccessful. Over 1539, the king's chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, {{negotiated}} a potential alliance with the Duchy of Cleves. Suggestions that Mary marry the Duke of Cleves, who was the same age, came to nothing, but a match between Henry and the Duke's sister Anne was agreed. When the king saw Anne {{for the first time}} in late December 1539, a week before the scheduled wedding, he did not find himself attracted to her but was unable, for diplomatic reasons and in the absence of a suitable pretext, to cancel the marriage. Cromwell fell from favour and was arrested for treason in June 1540; one of the unlikely charges against him was that he had plotted to marry Mary himself. Anne consented to the annulment of the marriage, which had not been consummated, and Cromwell was beheaded.|$|E
5|$|During the turmoil, Harald {{was arrested}} and imprisoned, but the sources {{disagree}} on the grounds. The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure, {{as well as for}} requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe, called Maria (<b>his</b> <b>suit</b> supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself). William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman, while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder. DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor. The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison, but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape {{in the midst of the}} revolt that had begun against the new emperor. While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor, Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt. The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary, blinded and exiled to a monastery, and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V (or at least claimed to have done so).|$|E

5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson {{to invest in}} the {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth and his wife Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan was based on a $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Jade burial suit: Burial suits made of jade {{existed in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in jade burial suits, archaeologists {{discovered}} in June 1968 the tombs and jade burial suits of Prince Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC) {{and his wife}} Dou Wan in Hebei province. Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green jade with holes punctured in {{the four corners of}} each piece so that they could be sewn together with gold thread. The total weight of the gold thread used in <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> was 1,110 g (39oz). Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of jade stitched together with 703 g (24.7oz) of gold thread. Although jade burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC), with the earliest being found in the Shizishan site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25–220 AD) complete and partial jade burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan, as well as at Yangjiawan, Dongyuan, Guangzhou, Mawangdui, Mianyang and Shizhaishan. The jade burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by Emperor Wen of Wei.|$|E
5|$|The lawyers {{argued the}} case before the Appellate Division in Brooklyn on October 21, 1927. On December 9, the Appellate Division affirmed the trial court's judgment, 3–2. Albert H. F. Seeger wrote the {{majority}} opinion for the five justices hearing the case, and was joined by Justices William F. Hagarty and William B. Carswell. Seeger {{had been born in}} Stuttgart and came to the United States as a child; he had been elected to the Supreme Court in 1917 and was elevated to the Appellate Division by Governor Al Smith in 1926. Aged 68 at the time of Palsgraf, he could serve only two more years before mandatory retirement. Justice Seeger ruled that the finding of negligence by the jury was supported by the evidence, and speculated that the jury might have found that helping a passenger board a moving train was a negligent act. He wrote that while the set of facts might be novel, the case was no different in principle from well-known court decisions on causation, such as the Squib case, in which an explosive (a squib) was lit and thrown, then was hurled away repeatedly by people not wanting to be hurt until it exploded near the plaintiff, injuring him; <b>his</b> <b>suit</b> against the man who had set the squib in motion was upheld. The majority also focused on the high degree of duty of care that the LIRR owed to Palsgraf, one of its customers.|$|E
