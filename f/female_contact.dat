40|$|We preliminarily {{find that}} {{providing}} sustainable land management (SLM) training to standard contact farmers and having them maintain demonstration plots {{within the community}} on a whole had low impact on the knowledge and adoption of SLM practices. However, the aspect of our intervention that targeted a traditionally disadvantaged group {{as far as their}} access to extension services, women, was somewhat successful in terms of improving their SLM knowledge and adoption rates. Having a <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> farmer increased the number of SLM techniques adopted by women by 10 percent. Both male and female farmers in this treatment group identified female (not male) contact farmers as a source of learning for both SLM practices and non SLMpractices suggesting knowledge spillovers. Furthermore, farmers were additionally inclined to teach others what they have learned in the communities with <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> farmers. While we are currently analyzing additional factors that may affect the ability of the intervention to influence behavior, our results have broader implications for improving extension services overall.

40|$|One {{function}} of aggression in animals is {{to gain access}} to mates. Aggression may therefore be avoured by sexual selection, the strength of which can be assessed using repeatability of ggressive behaviour. Here, we tested the hypotheses that male swordtails, Xiphophorus sp., are consistent in the aggressive and mating behaviours exhibited and in the time spent at a close distance to females (female attendance), and that aggressive males gain increased opportunity to attempt copulation compared to their less aggressive conspecifics (sneak frequency). As predicted, aggression between males, and male display and sneak frequency were repeatable. However, male aggression was not significantly correlated with sneak frequency. The {{function of}} aggression in this species is not clear-cut and may have an indirect female access function through formation of dominance hierarchies or defence of resources. A surprising finding highlighted by this study was the contradictory results for consistency in <b>female</b> <b>contact,</b> with high repeatability scores indicating consistency in behaviour but the within-subjects component of repeated measures ANOVA showing differences in <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> between trials. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are discussed. </strong...|$|E
40|$|Halofenozide, a dibenzoylhydrazine insect growth regulator, {{was applied}} topically to female {{individuals}} {{of the most}} prevalent German cockroach species, Blattella germanica, {{and its effects on}} sexual behaviour, cuticular hydrocarbons and reproduction were investigated. Dissection of treated females showed clearly reduced numbers of oocytes and volume of basal oocytes. Interestingly, the ecdysteroid amounts were also significantly lower. Characterization of the cuticular hydrocarbons by gas chromatography showed 13 major compounds, including the <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> sex pheromone precursor. It was clear that halofenozide application resulted in significantly lower amounts of all the investigated cuticular components. Finally, behavioural tests revealed that halofenozide treatment of females caused a significant decrease in sexual receptivity of the untreated conspecific males. Thus, exposure to the ecdysteroid agonist can negatively affect the male's response to a calling female, which is linked with and most likely caused by lesser production of <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> sex pheromone and a delay in the up-regulation of ecdysteroid amounts, and in turn this provoked an obvious lower oocyte number and basal oocyte size as measures of reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Welfare {{impacts of}} an {{intensive}} dairy technology package {{on women and}} their families are investigated on 32 smallholder crop-livestock farms in the sub-humid zone of Kilifi District, Coast Province, Kenya. Farms were stratified according to male or female extension contact. A female enumerator interviewed the wife or female head of household on each farm regarding her present and past household responsibilities and the effects of the intensive dairy enterprise on these duties and upon the welfare of the household. On three-quarters of the male contact farms, dairy operators were women. Across all farms, women performed half of all dairy-related activities, but only on <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> farms did income from the dairy enterprise accrue to women in proportion to their labor input. The equitable return of benefits to labor corresponded with better dairy unit performance on <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> farms, where women also indicated greater access to and autonomy over household resources and decision-making. Irrespective of extension contact, there was broad consensus among the women interviewed that intensive dairying has led to improved household welfare, primarily through increased household income and milk consumption. There was also wide agreement, however, that these gains have been achieved at the expense of more work for women. Women on <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> farms were observed spending dairy income on food for the household and childrens' schooling more often than their counterparts on male contact farms. Based on these and other findings, the study concludes that gender of the extension contact, dairy operator and farm owner were determinants of the intra-household impacts of intensive dairying on the smallholder farms in this study. Recommendations for design and delivery of livestock technologies for crop-based farming systems, with special emphasis on how to minimize negative impact on vulnerable household members, are inferred from study findings...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the signal function of vocal imitation of contact calls in orange-fronted conures (OFCs; Aratinga canicularis) in Costa Rica. OFCs live in dynamic social systems with frequent flock fusions and fissions. Exchanges of contact calls precede these flock changes. During call exchanges, {{the similarity between}} the contact calls of different individuals may either increase (converge) or decrease (diverge). We conducted a playback experiment on wild-caught captive birds in which we simulated convergent, divergent and no-change interaction series with male and <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> calls. OFCs responded differently to convergent and divergent series of contact calls, but only when we considered {{the sex of the}} test birds. Males called most in response to convergent series, whereas females demonstrated high calling rates in response to both convergent and divergent interactions. Both sexes responded most to contact calls from the opposite sex, but overall females produced more calls and had shorter latencies to calling than males. These results demonstrate that OFCs can discriminate between male and <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> calls and that subtle changes in contact call structure during interactions have signal function. The stronger overall response to convergent series suggests that convergence of contact calls is an affiliative signal...|$|E

50|$|Lysmata wurdemanni {{employs a}} 'pure searching' tactic for mate-finding {{in which the}} males are {{constantly}} searching for receptive females. Males use olfactory organs (aesthetascs) on their antennnules to detect soluble female sex pheromones (distance pheromones). These pheromones are released 2-8 hours prior to female moulting. Guided by these chemical signals, males {{make their way to}} the female and will approach her. The male will then 'taste' the <b>female's</b> <b>contact</b> pheromones with his aesthetascs to make sure she is a suitable mate. If the chemicals are right, courtship may commence and, if courtship goes well, copulation will ensue. This process is very brief and occurs immediately post-moult, while the female's cuticle is new and soft.|$|R

40|$|Mate {{choice is}} based on the {{comparison}} of the sensory quality of potential mating partners and sex pheromones are important with regard to mate choice. In Drosophila melanogaster, male and <b>female</b> <b>contact</b> pheromones diverge both for their occurence and for their effects — respectively inhibitory and stimulatory — on male courtship. To investigate the genetic basis of sex pheromones discrimination in male flies, we experimentally selected, during 20 generations, lines in which males showed either the higher or the lower ability to discriminate sex pheromones. This experimental selection was carried out with wild-type and desat 1 mutant genetic backgrounds in which parental males respectively showed high and low discrimination ability. Male perception of male and of female pheromones were separately affected during the process of selection. The comparison of transcriptomic activity between high and low discrimination lines revealed two genes which differently varied according to the genetic background. This suggests that male discrimination of sex pheromone depends on genes whose activity depends on the genetic context...|$|E

The results suggest that this approach can be applied to internet and contact sex offences to develop understanding of the progression of offending, including issues such as sexual arousal and the impact of a male co-perpetrator. In this case, the results indicate a post-intervention improvement in areas such as affect control, ability to maintain positive relationships, self-support, and reduced dissociation and dysfunctional sexual behaviour.
