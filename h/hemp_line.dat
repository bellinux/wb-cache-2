60|$|He next {{endeavored}} to purchase {{three of their}} dogs, but they objected to this, and refused to accept of three knives as a price for them. They were tempted, however, by the offer of a whale harpoon and a <b>hemp</b> <b>line,</b> and at last agreed to let him have three of their best dogs. This the young doctor considered a piece of great good fortune, and being afraid that they would repent, he prepared to leave the place at once. The dogs were fastened by lines to the sledge of their new masters. A whip was made out of a strip of walrus hide, a bone served for a handle, and away they went for the brig at a rattling pace, after bidding the natives farewell, and making them understand that they hoped to meet again {{in the course of}} the winter.|$|E
50|$|Historically, {{for most}} Asian type fighters, a thin cotton or <b>hemp</b> <b>line</b> is {{coated with a}} mixture of finely crushed glass and rice glue. In recent years, {{synthetic}} line has been coated with a variety of abrasives and stronger glue. Also, there have been some reports of metallic line being used. Some cultures use line that has metal knives attached to hook and cut the opponent's line.|$|E

5000|$|Within days of {{his first}} jump, Smitty was jumping again, for an audience, {{collecting}} pay for the effort. While his original career was as a sign-painter, he soon began finding money in exhibition parachuting. Borrowing gear from others until 1934, he eventually was given an old parachute, with <b>hemp</b> <b>lines,</b> and fashioned additional rigging and harness for it from leather and a Ford Model A (some say [...] "Model T") steering wheel.|$|R
50|$|Knots, {{such as the}} {{clove hitch}} and half hitch, are used for rope line terminations. For example, hitches are used to {{terminate}} <b>hemp</b> lift <b>lines</b> at battens and operating lines at counterweight arbors.|$|R

50|$|Shotline {{was also}} just as {{critical}} to the accurate operation of the Lyle gun. <b>Hemp</b> <b>line</b> {{was found to be}} too brittle. Braided linen was usable, but it was too heavy with sea water after it was fired and had to be dried out before firing again. The best line was waterproofed braided linen. It cut through the air best and provided improved range. New lines were too stiff and were difficult to properly flake (to wind in a pattern so the line could be shot without getting tangled), so a new line needed to be fired several times to make it more flexible for flaking. One of the critical drills of the USLSS crew was flaking the line. If the first shot failed to go over the stranded ship, the line would have to be hauled in, reflaked, and shot again. An efficient flaking crew could minimize the time required {{to get ready for the}} second shot. On average, a crewman with two assistants could flake 700 yd of line in about 25 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|On November 23, the German U-boat U-172 intercepted {{and struck}} the Benlomond with two torpedoes in {{position}} , some 750 {{miles east of}} the Amazon. As the ship was sinking, Poon Lim took a life jacket and jumped overboard before the ship's boilers exploded. [...] Benlomond sank in approximately two minutes, allowing only six survivors, including Poon Lim, to abandon ship. After approximately two hours in the water, Poon Lim found and climbed aboard an 8' square wooden raft. The raft had several tins of biscuits, a 40-litre jug of water, some chocolate, a bag of sugar lumps, some flares, two smoke pots, and a flashlight. Lim was ultimately the only survivor of the sinking. 53 of the crew of 54 were lost at sea, including the master, 44 sailors and eight gunners.Poon Lim initially kept himself alive by drinking the water and eating the food on the raft, but later resorted to fishing and catching rainwater in a canvas life jacket covering. He could not swim very well and often tied a rope from the boat to his wrist, in case he fell into the ocean. He took a wire from the flashlight and made it into a fishhook, and used hemp rope as a fishing line. He also dug a nail out of the boards on the wooden raft and bent it into a hook for larger fish. When he captured a fish, he would cut it open with a knife he fashioned out of a biscuit tin and dry it on a <b>hemp</b> <b>line</b> over the raft. Once, a large storm hit and spoiled his fish and fouled his water. Poon, barely alive, caught a bird and drank its blood to survive.|$|E

5000|$|Counterweight rigging {{replaces the}} hemp rope and sandbags of rope <b>line</b> (<b>hemp)</b> rigging with wire rope (steel cable) and metal counterweights, respectively. Those substitutions permit the flying of greater loads {{with a high}} degree of control, but with a loss of {{flexibility}} inherent to most hemp systems. Flexibility is lost because most components of a hemp system may be repositioned, while counterweight system components are relatively fixed. Old [...] "hemp houses" [...] lacked counterweight rigging, but today most manual rigging houses use a combination of counterweight rigging and, at least some, hemp rigging. For example, theaters that incorporate built-in, grid-based counterweight fly systems often will also support additional, spot <b>hemp</b> system <b>line</b> sets for spot-rigging (to spot something, in theatre jargon, simply means to (re)position something).|$|R
5000|$|Harveys SeatbeltBags {{first started}} using solid colors of seatbelts with names including, {{but not limited}} to, Limo Black, SUV Navy, and Stainless Steel. They {{introduced}} their first print bag {{in the summer of}} 2006. The SeatbeltBug design was a print of different insect silhouettes on a green or pink background with matching interior lining. Since then, the development and ability to print on seatbelt webbing has been a creative outlet for the company and allows them to design unique patterns. Print collections in the past have included many floral designs, geometric patterns, camo, animal prints, plaid, argyle, polka dots. The Treecycle collection has been a popular collection for Harvey's and features 100% reclaimed seatbelts in a variety of natural tones, with a <b>hemp</b> <b>lining</b> using organic dyes. Collections also feature different silhouettes, including a ruffled [...] "Lola" [...] design, a horizontally side by side stitched [...] "Boat Tote" [...] collection, a mini seatbelt woven [...] "Madison" [...] collection, a vertically stitched [...] "Stella" [...] collection as well as bags with wool and leather accents. Bags have incorporated items like lace, sequins, zippers and bows into their design as well.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a typical}} hemp system, a [...] "line set" [...] {{consists}} of multiple <b>hemp</b> <b>lines</b> running from a batten above the stage {{up to the}} grid, through loft blocks to a headblock and then down to the fly floor where they are tied off in a group to a belaying pin on the pin rail. The lift lines and hand (operating) lines {{are one and the}} same. Typically, a lift line runs from the sand bag (counterweight) assigned to a specific line set, up to [...] "a single loft block" [...] above the fly floor and back down to the fly floor. A trim clamp (a.k.a. knuckle-buster) or a [...] "Sunday" [...] (a circle of wire rope) is used to attach this sandbag to the [...] "line set" [...] to balance the load placed on the batten. The sandbags are usually filled to weigh the same as the loads, making the two weights (the weight of the batten and the weight of the bag) equal. This arrangement assures greater safety. When the flyman wishes to fly a batten (scenery or lights) [...] "In" [...] (i.e., to the floor), the flyman pulls down on the lift line thereby raising the sandbag off the fly floor and the batten descends. When the flyman wishes to fly the batten [...] "Out", he pulls down on the line set (leaving it tied off) and the batten flies out as the sand bag descends to the flyfloor. This arrangement allows the flyman to control the speed of ascent and/or descent and provides greater safety for people on the stage below. The proper [...] "Out" [...] position for the batten is set when the sand bag reaches the fly floor in its descent (adjustable) and the proper [...] "In" [...] position for the batten is established when the line set (previously tied off to the pin rail) is fully extended (adjustable). This makes it unnecessary to [...] "spike" [...] or [...] "mark" [...] either the line set or the lift line. (An [...] "unbalanced working line set" [...] should never be allowed to exist over the stage.) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{interaction}} of the electromagnetic pulse environment generated by high altitude bursts (<b>HEMP)</b> with transmission <b>lines.</b> The environments is determined from the EXEMP computer code (Theoretical Notes Nos. 363 to 365). The coupling of these fields to above-ground conductors is then obtained by time-domain transmission line theory (TLT) assuming a perfectly conducting earth. In particular, the contributions of the vertical potential differences at the end of semi-infinite horizontal lines and different types of vertical line elements (vertical risers) are also discussed {{within the framework of the}} TLT rules. The paper presents open-circuit voltages induced in transmission lines at distinct locations within the illuminated area as well as contour plots of peak voltages and cumulative voltage distribution functions...|$|R
5000|$|General Price had {{established}} his headquarters in Lexington {{in a bank}} building at 926 Main Street on September 18, 1861, located {{across the street from}} the Lafayette County Courthouse. During the Battle of Lexington, Price directed State Guard operations from a room on the second floor. On the following day a cannonball, probably fired from Captain Hiram Bledsoe’s State Guard Battery, struck the courthouse only about one hundred yards from General Price’s headquarters. [...] According to accounts dating from 1920, the ball did not originally lodge in the column, but fell out and was recovered by a collector. Decades after the battle the then elderly gentleman signed an affidavit with his story, and gave the cannonball to County Commissioners who had the ball screwed onto a two-foot iron rod embedded in the column for the purpose. On the evening of September 19, soldiers of Brig. Gen. Thomas A. Harris's 2nd Division (State Guard) began using hemp bales seized from nearby warehouses to construct a moveable breastwork facing the Union entrenchment. These bales were all soaked in river water overnight, to render them impervious to any heated rounds fired from the Federal guns. Harris's plan was for his troops to roll the bales up the hill the following day, using them for cover as they advanced close enough to the Union garrison for a final charge. The <b>hemp</b> bale <b>line</b> started in the vicinity of the Anderson house, extending north along the hillside for about 200 yards. In many places the hemp bales were stacked two high to provide additional protection.|$|R
