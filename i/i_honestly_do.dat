2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>do.</b> I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; I think he did a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madame Christophor," [...] Julien said earnestly, [...] "I am most {{grateful}} for your offer. At the same time, <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> {{not believe that}} I have anything to fear anywhere. Herr Freudenberg has made one attempt upon me and has failed. I {{do not think that}} he is likely to risk everything by any open assaults. In these civilized days of the police, the telephone and the law courts, one is not so much at the mercy of a strong man as in the old days. I do not fear Herr Freudenberg." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I saw {{her on the}} stage," [...] he said, with {{a return}} of his boyish earnestness; [...] "and I learned {{something}} which I wanted you to first hear from me. She is MARRIED,--and to Mr. Hooker, {{who is in the}} same theatrical company with her. But I want you to think, as <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>do,</b> that it is the best for her. She has married in her profession, which is a great protection and a help to her success, and she has married a man who can look lightly upon certain qualities in her that others might not be so lenient to. His worst faults are on the surface, and will wear away in contact with the world, and he looks up to her as his superior. I gathered this from her friend, for I did not speak with her myself; I did not go there to see her. But as I expected to be leaving you soon, I thought it only right that as I was the humble means of first bringing her into your life, I should bring you this last news, which I suppose takes her out of it forever. Only I want you to believe that YOU have nothing to regret, and that SHE is neither lost nor unhappy." ...|$|E
5000|$|Alyse Wax from Fearnet gave a good {{review to}} the episode {{saying that it}} was good and brutal. [...] "I don’t think I have ever seen such intense torture on network television. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>did</b> not see it coming that Jenna would be {{compelled}} to stab herself. It was an intense episode, with lots of darkness, and not too much mushy-gushy stuff." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, a film {{adaptation}} of Little Tree was released, which revived publicity about Asa Carter. Carters widow, India Carter, refused most interview requests during these years. In 1991, she did confirm to Publishers Weekly that Forrest and Asa {{were the same}} person. Eleanor Friede, Little Trees original editor, defended Carters background in 1997, telling the Times, [...] "He was {{not a member of}} the Ku Klux Klan. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>dont</b> see the point of all this nasty gossip dragged out years ago." ...|$|R
2500|$|Former New Zealand All Blacks wing Stu Wilson {{writes in}} the tribute book David Campese that, [...] "When asked by a {{television}} reporter if he {{was looking forward to}} mark Stu Wilson he replied, 'Stu who?'" [...] Campese responded in the same book by replying that, [...] "The story is true, but Stu misunderstood why I said it. I didn't say it because I was cocky. I said it because <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>did</b> not know who Stu Wilson was. I was a nineteen-year-old boy from Queanbeyan. My background had been in rugby league, not rugby union." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December, Abreu was loaned out to Felgueiras {{until the}} end of the season. He played his first game for Felgueiras in a home loss to Porto, and he was {{directly}} involved in injuries to two Porto players, Pena and Drulovic. The first required 15 stitches to his right hand and the latter lost two teeth and was knocked-out. He received criticism from Porto president, Pinto da Costa, to which he defended himself, describing the events: [...] "The clash with Pena, was in my opinion, casual and without intent. I think everybody saw it. I am not the blame he got injured, it could happen to me. About Drulovic, <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> not remember anything and besides, it is irrelevant because it is thing that happen all the time in football." ...|$|E
5000|$|Various {{other authors}} also cited Niebuhr {{as the source}} of the prayer from 1937 on. The Federal Council of Churches (NCC) {{included}} the prayer in a book for army chaplains and servicemen in 1944 and the USO circulated the prayer (with Niebuhr's permission) to soldiers on printed cards during World War Two. In 1950, in response to questions about the already quite widely known prayer's provenance, Niebuhr wrote that the prayer [...] "may have been spooking around for years, even centuries, but I don't think so. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> believe that I wrote it myself." [...] He confirmed this in 1967. His daughter, Elisabeth Sifton, thought that Niebuhr had first written it in 1943, while Niebuhr's wife Ursula believed it had been written in 1941 or '42, adding that it may have been used in prayers as early as 1934.|$|E

6000|$|... 'No. I {{think it}} was a mistake altogether, Mrs. Dean,' Dorothy said thoughtfully. 'I did not become engaged to him for that--I mean for rank and wealth. I don't say they did not count for something, but <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>did</b> think <b>I</b> liked him, and there was no real reason for its being broken off, except that I found that I had made a mistake. I should not say so, of course, to anyone but an old friend like you. I shall never say {{anything}} about it, but let people think what they like; and I know that you will never repeat it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, but, Anne, he {{will not}} {{interrupt}} me now. I have much more to say. I want you to remember that we were sweethearts ere ever I, as a child of twelve, knew that I was contracted to that poor babe, and bidden to think only of her. Poor child! <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>did</b> my best to love her, so far as I knew how, and mayhap we could have rubbed on through life passably well as things go. But--but--It skills not talking of things gone by, except {{to show that it}} is a whole heart-- not the reversion of one that is yours for ever, mine only love." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{contrast}} to the images in his photo essay, A Journey to North Vietnam (1969), Riboud says in the accompanying interview:"My impression is that the country's leaders will not allow the slightest relaxation of {{the population at large}} ... it is almost as if ... they are anxious to forestall the great unknown - peace." [...] In the same Newsweek article, he expanded further in his observations on life in North Vietnam:"I was astonished, for example, at the decidedly gay atmosphere in Hanoi's Reunification Park on a Sunday afternoon ... <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>did</b> not have the impression they were discussing socialism or the 'American aggressors' ... I saw quite a few patriotic posters crudely 'improved' with erotic graffiti and sketches." ...|$|R
40|$|DEDICATION I {{dedicate}} {{this work}} to my lovely parents, siblings, and extended family {{who are a}} constant source of support and encouragement, particularly in this journey. Thank you for all that you have done. <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> not think that I would have made it without you people. To my friends in Kenya and Egypt who have checked up on me and encouraged me particularly in times when I felt homesick and doubted whether I was doing the right thing. Thank you for keeping me grounded and reminding me that perseverance is a virtue we should all strive for. Knowing that you all are in my corner gave me the motivation to complete this work. To my amazing housemate who has been {{a constant source of}} laughter, understanding, and encouragement. Thanks so much for making my stay in Egypt as comfortable as possible and dragging me out of the apartment especially when I was frustrated and felt discouraged. I will never forget all that you have done for me. It is truly an honor to have lived with you. To my boyfriend whose patience and belief in me still amazes me. I know I left at a very critical time but you never made me feel like I had abandoned you. Thank you for being so supportive and understanding, and letting me be myself...|$|E

60|$|AT a {{time when}} French readers were {{altogether}} unaware {{of the existence of}} any books of my writing, a critical examination of my novels appeared under your signature in the Revue des Deux Mondes.

5000|$|It is true—true indeed I did. I {{loved the}} woman dearly and soundly: She was a {{handsome}} girl—would have made a good, loving wife… <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>honestly</b> and truly love the girl and think often, often of her now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course. I know. I suppose that's so. <b>Honestly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> love children. But there's lots {{of women}} that can do housework, but I--well, if you HAVE got a college education, you ought {{to use it for}} the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Truly," [...] said he, [...] "we are in straits. Yet, could I but win out of {{this house}} for half an hour, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>honestly</b> tell myself that all might still go well; and for the marriage, it should be prevented." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to try," [...] the captain said. [...] "My orders were to go to Leghorn, and to Leghorn I mean to go if the ship floats; but <b>I</b> tell you <b>honestly</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think there is much chance of our getting there. Still, {{as long as the}} ship floats, the British flag will float over her." ...|$|R
60|$|I made {{no attempt}} to remonstrate with her: perhaps, because I {{sincerely}} appreciated the fearless candour which let me see, what other women in her position might have had reasons for concealing even from their dearest friends--perhaps, because I felt, in my own heart and conscience, that in her place I should have asked the same questions and had the same thoughts. All <b>I</b> could <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> was to reply that I had not written to him or heard from him lately, and then to turn the conversation to less dangerous topics.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was he {{who asked}} about you, he thinks you are {{reliable}} and quick and clever, and I was very glad to say a good word for you, my dear, since <b>I</b> could <b>honestly</b> <b>do</b> so." [...] Miss Ottway drew Janet's arm through hers and patted it affectionately.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS These couple of years have been the most trying years of my entire life. Taking a decision to further my studies was the one thing I always wanted to do. It was an experience that showed how difficult it is to stay focused and how easy it is to give up.

I do think Aunt Lily has been the making of you, {{and that it is}} very hard that you should have to be uprooted from her, just as you had learnt to value her, I will tell your father so; but <b>honestly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think it is likely to make him change his mind.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! Claude, no such thing,' said Lily, 'you {{know what}} I meant, {{or did not}} mean. It was nonsense--I hope nothing worse.' Lily felt that she might take his arm again. There was a little silence, and then Lily resumed in a timid voice, 'I {{do not know whether}} you will be angry, Claude, but <b>honestly,</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think that if--that Eleanor would be so wretched about you as I should.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} my instructions, and assumed an enthusiasm which <b>I</b> <b>honestly</b> confess <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel. I privately thought the new vegetable {{a great deal}} too rich, and in other respects quite unworthy of the fuss {{that had been made}} about it. Miserrimus Dexter lingered and languished over his truffles, and sipped his wonderful Burgundy, and sang his own praises as a cook until I was really almost mad with impatience to return to the real object of my visit. In the reckless state of mind which this feeling produced, I abruptly reminded my host that he was wasting our time, by the most dangerous question that I could possibly put to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is he {{sorry he}} did it? At times, is he just a weeny bit sorry?" [...] She watched him, and decided rightly {{that he was}} not sorry the weeniest bit.

Yes, of course he is happy when he is writing; but is he quite contented at other times? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>honestly</b> think he is. And if he is happy now, how much happier I shall be able to make him when I have put away all my selfish thoughts and think only of him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Our {{success has}} not been as great or {{complete}} as we should have desired. ... Under ordinary circumstances the Federal Army should have been destroyed. General Robert E. Lee [...] My conscience is clear at least to this extent - viz.: that <b>I</b> have <b>honestly</b> <b>done</b> the best <b>I</b> could; I shall leave it to others to decide whether that was the best that could have been done - & if they find any who can do better am perfectly willing to step aside & give way. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan, letter to his wife The Seven Days Battles ended the Peninsula Campaign. The Army of the Potomac encamped around Berkeley Plantation, birthplace of William Henry Harrison. The Union defensive position was a strong one that Lee did not consider attacking, withdrawing instead to the defenses of Richmond. With its back to the James River, the army was protected by Union gunboats, but suffered heavily from heat, humidity, and disease. In August, they were withdrawn by order of President Lincoln to reinforce the Army of Virginia in the Northern Virginia Campaign and the Second Battle of Bull Run.|$|R
