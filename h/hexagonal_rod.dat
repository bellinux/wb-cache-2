By investigating structure and disorder for four columnar benzene- 1, 3, 5 -trisamides by total X-ray scattering and DFT calculations, we demonstrate that the column orientation, and thus the columnar dipole moment, is receptive to geometric frustration if the columns aggregate in a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>rod</b> packing. The frustration suppresses conventional antiferroelectric order and heightens the sensitivity towards collective intercolumnar packing effects. The latter finding allows for the building up of mesoscale domains with spontaneous polarization.

40|$|Using {{complementary}} physical-chemical methods including turbidimetry, quasielastic light scattering, gel filtration, and phase analysis, {{we examined}} the interactions between dilute concentrations of the common bile salt, taurochenodeoxycholate (TCDC), and uni- and multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) composed of defined molecular species of lecithin (L) and varying contents of cholesterol (Ch). Dissolution rates of MLVs with micellar TCDC, as assessed by turbidimetry, were more rapid with vesicles composed of sn- 1 palmitoyl species, typical of biliary L, compared with those composed of the more hydrophobic sn- 1 stearoyl species. Incorporation of Ch retarded MLV dissolution rates {{in proportion to the}} Ch content, and only at high Ch contents were dissolution rates appreciably influenced by the sn- 2 fatty acid composition of L. When MLVs contained Ch in amounts characteristic of intracellular membranes (Ch/L approximately 0. 1), the dissolution rates of the individual L species by TCDC accurately predicted the steady state L composition of human bile. TCDC interacted with small unilamellar L/Ch vesicles (SUVs) at concentrations well below, as well as appreciably above, its critical micellar concentration. In accordance with the TCDC-egg yolk L-H 2 O phase diagram, perimicellar concentrations of TCDC interacted with SUVs to form aggregates that were approximately twice the size of the SUVs. These were consistent with the formation of a dispersed hexagonal (rod-like) phase, which co-existed with aqueous bile salt (BS) monomers and either micellar or unilamellar SUV phases. Micellar TCDC completely solubilized SUVs as mixed micelles, putatively via this transient hexagonal phase. With modest Ch-supersaturation, dissolution was followed by the reemergence of a new vesicle population that coexisted metastably with mixed micelles. With high Ch supersaturation, TCDC extracted L and Ch molecules from SUVs in different proportions to form Ch-supersaturated mixed micelles and Ch-enriched SUVs, in accordance with the metastable phase diagram. These experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that sn- 1 palmitoyl L species are subselected for bile, in part, by physical-chemical interactions of intracellular BS concentrations with Ch-poor membranes and that the subsequent evolution of Ch-rich vesicles and Ch-saturated mixed micelles occurs via a transitional <b>hexagonal</b> (<b>rod)</b> phase. These liquid-crystalline states are likely to be transient in Ch-unsaturated biles, but may persist in Ch-supersaturated human biles because of their high Ch contents which retard or inhibit these phase transitions...|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{worldwide}} {{demand for the}} fossil fuels, the increase of crude oil prices, and the environmental impacts from its applications, research has been increasingly oriented to finding materials to improve existing energy storage devices and to generate clean and renewable energy resources. Hydrogen storage and hydrogen generation are two methods which have great potential to produce and provide cleaner energy source. The advantage of using hydrogen as a fuel source is because water is the final product after combusting reaction. As part of this energy production / storage process, new generation materials are required to be developed for other applications including ammonia decomposition for producing the hydrogen for fuel cells and carbon electrodes for supercapacitor, which is the energy storage device. The aim of the project is to develop ordered mesoporous carbon with graphitic framework (OGMC) and measure the electrochemical performance in aqueous (1 molL- 1 H 2 SO 4) and organic (1 molL- 1 C 8 H 2 NBF 4) / Acetontirle electrolytes. Physical properties such as surface area, pore size distributions, the degree of graphitisation and surface functionalities of mesoporous carbon materials are important factors for electric double layer capacitor (EDLC). The widths of micropore were reported to enhance the capacitance and the mesopore are responsible for charge transfer at high current load. The high degree of graphitisation increases the conductivity improves the charge – discharge kinetics of supercapacitors. The first stage of the project is to synthesize ordered mesoporous carbon with graphitic framework using templating method. SBA – 15, which is a highly ordered 2 D <b>hexagonal</b> <b>rod</b> structured silica, and Ia 3 d with ordered 3 D bicontinuous structure, were selected as the suitable templates for the OGMC. Chemical vapour deposition (CVD) was employed as the synthesis technique. Benzene, Acenaphthalene, Pyrene, which contains aromatic rings, was used as carbon precursors. These carbon precursors form graphitic framework at high temperature. Preliminary results show that after impregnation of carbon precursors, and template removal, OGMC are produced. Replicated carbon materials are made into carbon electrodes and measure in cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic cycling. Results showed that all replicated carbon produced using different precursors, particularly benzene, have good electrical conductivities; however, the electrochemical capacitance is low compared to carbon electrodes using activated carbon. Reasons are due to a low surface area and a low micropore volume. Further more, the amount of oxygen functional group are reduced after treated at high temperature. The second stage of the project {{is to increase the}} surface functional groups of replicated carbon materials from stage one using strong HNO 3 and further treated at 400 °C. Results show that there is a decrease in surface area and the graphitic degree of replicated carbon. The capacitance has increased compared to that was measured in stage one of the project. The XPS results provide evidence of oxygen and nitrogen functional groups were successfully introduced on the edge plane of replicated carbon. The third stage includes electrochemical measurement of replicated carbon materials with and without surface modifications in organic electrolyte. The capacitive contribution from micropore and mesopore were estimated. Results show that micropore dominated the contribution of overall capacitance. There are drops in normalised capacitance of micropore when the current loads are increased whereas mesopore shows no chance at all current loads. Results from the first stage of the project show a low surface area, a pore volume and low effective functional groups. Due to this reason, the second stage of the project aims for further improvement in surface area and micropore volume using combinations of wet impregnation and CVD using benzene as precursor. Results show that surface area, micropore volume has greatly enhanced, resulting in higher capacitance. Although replicated carbon materials from wet and dry impregnation has improved the surface area and the capacitance is higher than that were measured in the first stage. The electrochemical active surface functional group was found not exist, resulting in a lower surface area than what is been reported of carbon electrodes made from activated carbon...|$|E
30|$|Even {{with several}} {{advantages}} of biosynthesis approaches for nanoparticles, polydispersity of nanoparticles {{is always a}} major problem for researchers. Hence, the nanoparticle should be homogenous in size and morphology. Several studies have been carried out to obtain and establish a stable root for production of nanoparticles with definite size, shape and dispersity. Shape and size of the nanoparticle can be controlled by either constricting their environmental growth or calculating the functional molecule. Gurunathan et al. [92] reported the biosynthesis of 20  nm gold nanoparticles by Ganoderna sp. by altering the reaction conditions including temperature, pH, metal ion concentration, mixing ratio, aeration, incubation period and redox conditions. Similar study was carried out by Karbasian et al. [93]; they used response surface methodology to explore the effect of pH, temperature, incubation period, metal ion concentration, agitation rate and amount of enzyme secreted by the fungal biomass on the formation of metal nanoparticles. They synthesized spherical-shaped silver nanoparticles by addition of Fusarium oxysporum in 3  mM silver nitrate solution at pH 6 and incubated with 180  rpm for 96  h. The maximum optimal growth temperature for the growing microorganisms is suggested for the synthesis of metal nanoparticles because the enzymes and proteins responsible for the synthesis of nanoparticles are highly active at high temperature [94]. Dhillon et al. [95] reported that temperature {{plays an important role in}} controlling the fungal activities and the movement of metal ions. So, it is concluded that temperature has remarkable effect on the growth of fungus as well as metal uptake from the surrounding reaction mixture. Effect of metal ion concentration was studied by Kathiresan et al. [96]. They synthesized silver nanoparticles with fungus Penicillium fellutanum. They found that high concentration of metal ion would hamper the synthesis of nanoparticles. As the concentration of silver ions increases, particles size and the monodispersity of particles vary from desired nano-size range. When compared to chemical reactions, results are similar, the concentration of reactants greatly affects the particle size and monodispersity of the nanoparticles. Another study was carried out by Gericke and Pinches [97], they synthesized gold nanoparticles by Verticillium luteoalbum. The study concluded that when the AuCl 4 − concentration was below 500  mg/L, synthesized gold nanoparticles was uniform, narrow in the width with 20  nm in size and when the concentration increased, the size and shape of the nanoparticles increased from 50 to 100  nm. pH is also one of the most important factors that influences the important role during the biosynthesis of nanoparticles. On the other hand, different metal nanoparticles can be synthesized at different pH values. Isaria fumosorosea [98] showed synthesis of nanoparticles at alkaline pH while Fusarium acuminatum required acidic pH and Penicillium fellitanum required pH around 6.0. In case of bacteria usually basic pH is required to synthesize silver nanoparticles, E. coli synthesizes silver nanoparticles at pH 10 [92]. It has been concluded that acidic pH nanoparticles gets aggregated during synthesis process. The shape and size of nanoparticles can be manipulated by altering the pH of the reaction mixture. pH changes the electrical charges of biomolecules which might affect the reducing and stabilizing ability and frequent growth of nanoparticles. This might be also helpful in obtaining desirable shape and size of the nanoparticles. Gericke and Pinches [97] studied the role of pH in the synthesis of nanoparticles and their possible effect on shape along with crystal structure by varying the pH of the reaction mixture. On the basis of their experiment, they concluded that the nanoparticles synthesized by Verticillium luteoalbum at pH 3 were spherical in shape with 10  nm size while they were <b>hexagonal,</b> <b>rod,</b> triangle and spherical in shape at pH 5. However, at pH 7 and 9, the small particles synthesized are mostly spherical in shape and bigger particles are irregular and undefined shapes. It was also found that the number of particles synthesized was highest at pH 7 and lower at pH 9. Similar report was obtained by Sanghi and Verma [98]; they used Coriolus versicolor fungus for the synthesis of nanoparticles. In one study, Ahmad et al. [99] confirmed that silver nanoparticles were not synthesized in the presence of Fusarium moniliforme, while it was frequently synthesized with another strain of Fusarium, i.e., Fusarium oxysporum. Protein assay of these two fungi revealed that F. oxysporum contains a specific reductase enzyme (NADH-dependent reductase), while the other reductase enzymes are similar in both the fungal species. So, it was confirmed that NADH-dependent reductase is the possible reductase enzyme which plays a crucial role in the reduction process of nanoparticles. When F. oxysporum was used for the synthesis of titania nanoparticles from aqueous anionic complexes TiF 6 − 2, extracellular protein-mediated hydrolysis of the anionic complexes results in the facile room temperature synthesis of crystalline titania nanoparticles [54]. Similar study was carried out by Bansal et al. [62], they reported that enzymes secreted by F. oxysporum were used for the synthesis of silica nanoparticles. F. oxysporum selectively bioleached the silicates present in the zircon sand, into silicic acid and finally to silica nanoparticles. On the basis of previously results of related studies, it was confirmed that the several experimental parameters like the growth medium, and the synthesis conditions will greatly affect the shape, size and dispersity of nanoparticles.|$|E
40|$|Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC {{materials}} {{have become the}} state-of-the-art sidewall block materials used in aluminium electrolysis cells. Despite its outstanding properties, the material properties degradate in the cell over time. The mineralogical transformations and chemical reactions cause changes in the physical and thermal properties, which influence the thermal balance of the electrolysis cell. Sodium {{plays an important role}} in the degradation of the sidewall block, as in the other parts of the cathode lining, and the transportation of sodium in the cathode lining has been in focus in the study in order to understand the degradation mechanisms. Commercial virgin Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC {{materials have}} been thoroughly characterized with respect to microstructure and phase composition. α -Si 3 N 4 was found more pronounced in the area close to the surface of the virgin block than in the center by refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns. The morphology of the phases of the materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The needle grains in the nitride binder were confirmed to be α -Si 3 N 4 by transmission electron microscopy, while β -Si 3 N 4 was proposed to be <b>hexagonal</b> <b>rod</b> shaped grains. The apparent porosity was lower in the area close to the surface while the density was higher. The degradation of the Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC materials was studied by investigating spent blocks. The degradation mechanisms in the gas zone (top part) and the electrolyte zone (bottom part) of the spent sidewall block were different due to the different chemical environments in the cell. In the electrolyte zone, the degradation involves reactions with sodium, and the main degradation phase was Na 2 SiO 3 or a mixture of Na 2 SiO 3 and Na 2 Si 2 O 5. The presence of only Na 2 SiO 3 points to a higher chemical potential of sodium. The formed silicates filled up the pores and dramatically decreased the apparent porosity. The layer structure of the sodium silicate was confirmed by SEM. In the gas zone, the degradation mechanism was more complicated. The material underwent active oxidation, and the main degradation phase was Si 2 ON 2 or cristobalite depending on the partial pressure of oxygen. The apparent porosity and density of the bulk material was not significantly changed compared to the virgin material. At the surface of the block towards the pot, material loss was observed. The remaining material at the surface appeared porous and a significantly higher porosity was inferred. The needles in the binder in the gas zone was found thinner compared to the ones found in the virgin material. HF was proposed to play an important role in the material loss at the surface and the change in the morphology of the binder. The thermal conductivity of the Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC materials before and after operation was measured by the lasher flash method. The thermal conductivity was found to be higher in the area close to the surface of the virgin block than in the center despite a higher apparent porosity at the surface. Moreover, the thermal conductivity dropped dramatically in both the electrolyte zone and the gas zone of the spent blocks. The variation in the thermal conductivity of the material was modeled taking into account the phase composition, the apparent porosity and the microstructure related properties such as grain boundary resistance, pore shape and orientation factor and finally a thermal resistance layer. Both analytical models and computer simulations showed that the microstructure evolution had a strong influence on the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the computer simulation demonstrated that the drop in the thermal conductivity of the sidewall block would result in a hotter surface of the block towards the bath and a thinner side ledge. Sodium diffusion and reaction throughout the whole cathode lining has been investigated by a computer simulation by taking into consideration the different degradation mechanisms in each material of the cathode lining. The simulation demonstrated that the dominant transport of sodium in the carbon cathode was solid phase diffusion. The diffusion in the sidewall block was gas phase diffusion, and the diffusion is to some degree limited by the chemical reactions. Using the diffusion constant of sodium in the refractory layer close to the sodium selfdiffusion in an albite like molten oxide reproduced the sodium penetration depth found in autopsies. As shown in the work, sodium causes the severe degradation in the cathode lining. Moreover, it “opens” the way for the bath to penetrate into the cathode lining resulting in more severe degradation. Two approaches were applied to estimate the bath infiltration rate into the carbon cathode block. The simulations demonstrated that the infiltration rate was determined by the changes in the wetting property of the carbon material towards the bath, meaning that it was determined by the sodium diffusion rate, which explains that sodium always infiltrates faster than the bath. A diffusion barrier (like a steel plate or a chemical barrier) is recommended to be placed between the ramming paste (big joint) and the sidewall block, which could inhibit/reduce the sodium infiltration into the sidewall block and so eliminate further degradation. That will not only improve the chemical stability of the sidewall block but also its thermal stability, and thereby maintain the thermal balance during the cell operation. This may also open up for heat recovery from the heat flux through the side walls. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|E
