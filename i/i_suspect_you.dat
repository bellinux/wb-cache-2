We not only know him, but (as the French say) we don't know anybody else; he is our {{intimate}} and adored original; and – prepare your mind – he was, is, and ever will be, TOMMY HADDON! As I don't believe you to be inspired, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> to have suspected this. At least it was a mighty happy suspicion. You are quite right: Tommy is really 'a good chap,' though about as comic as they make them." ...|$|E
60|$|Har. Though <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> {{joined in}} my son's murder, Yet, {{since it is}} not proved, you have your life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, little gentleman, {{do not be}} so {{particularly}} scandalised," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "I promise you <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> of no audacity of gallantry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really? You know, Major, for {{a little}} while <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you.</b> Because you wouldn't let me kill him. I thought you might be {{protecting}} him." [...] She laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I went {{this morning}} to Westmor eland House to ask you for my sister's address, and to {{acknowledge}} plainly that <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> of being again in correspondence with Mrs. Lecount.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Brown {{with an air}} of apology. [...] "You see, <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> when {{we first}} met. It's that little bulge up the sleeve where you people have the spiked bracelet." ...|$|R
60|$|Fail. Madam, I {{like not}} your enquiring after Sir Timorous: <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> have some design upon him: You would fain {{undermine}} your cousin, and marry him yourself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I {{believe her}} when I was meditating on our interview, {{alone in my}} room? Or did <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> of having robbed me of the only {{consolation}} that makes my life endurable? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you dear goose. Can't you guess, or must I tell you? Sidney and I did {{the very}} same, {{and had just}} such a melancholy parting last night as <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> and Ned had tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{feel all}} the unkindness of it, Ailie, {{but it must}} be so; and that was the reason that I {{attempted}} to conceal myself from <b>you,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> would not let me part from you so easily." ...|$|R
60|$|Tow. Prepare; <b>I</b> shall <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> {{stay for}} further help, And think not this enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; I've {{found that}} {{human nature is}} much the same the world over," [...] replied the detective. [...] "Of course <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> would {{undertake}} to give Mershone his chance by grabbing me, and that is exactly what you have done. But, my lads, what do you suppose I have done in the meantime?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, maybe I'd better hedge on the bet," [...] he said, {{laughing}} again. [...] "You {{have more}} in you than <b>I</b> <b>suspect.</b> <b>You</b> sure fooled me when you stood for the sheep-dip. But, come on, I'll take you anyway." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter had a pause; {{he thought}} an {{examination}} of this issue premature. [...] "Flirtations are not passions," [...] he replied. [...] "No, you're simple--at least <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> are; for of course with a woman one would be clever to know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} think that I am in the least angry with you, or that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> of having done or said, or even thought {{anything}} that is wrong. I feel quite confident that I have no cause to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see, doctor, that I {{have been}} in error. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> of being an {{accomplice}} of Netta's in a little scheme in which she is engaged on her own account." [...] And she then told him about her disappearance, of the letter that she had received, and of the conversation with her aunt. Dr. Leeds was seriously disturbed.|$|R
6000|$|SIR PETER. Give me your hand--Charles--I believe <b>I</b> have <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> wrongfully; but you mustn't {{be angry}} with Joseph--'twas my Plan-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, Master Soothsayer, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>thee</b> to be {{an officer}} {{of some of the}} Holy Brotherhoods, sent in this guise to {{question}} us poor travellers to our ruin!" [...] answered Maso. [...] "I am, what thou seest, but a poor mariner that hath no better bark under him than this of Baptiste, and on a sea no larger than a Swiss lake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} nothing to me," [...] {{answered}} the gentle Sorceress; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> have been guilty of several wicked actions; and if I find {{it is true that}} you have so abused your knowledge of magic, I intend to punish you severely." ...|$|E
6000|$|But, beside all this, {{there is}} a question, which {{ought to be a}} curious one to you (for <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> cannot answer it)--Why does the farmer take the trouble to send his cart and horses eight miles and more, to draw in chalk from Odiham chalk-pit? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's enough," [...] {{declared}} Old Mother Nature, and {{her voice}} was very sharp. [...] "You two cousins never have agreed and I am afraid never will. As {{long as you are}} neighbors, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> will quarrel. Have you told us all you know about Happy Jack, Chatterer?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But your fair lines so grossly flatter, Pray do they praise me or bespatter? <b>I</b> must <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> {{mean the}} latter-- [...] Ah! slyboot! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Bianca," [...] exclaimed I, in anguish, [...] "could I have {{dreamt of}} this; could <b>I</b> have <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> {{would have been}} false to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Without leave, <b>I</b> <b>suspect.</b> Have <b>you</b> no {{brothers}} or sisters {{to go with}} you?" [...] asked Miss Celia, wondering where the little runaway belonged.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am Colonel Beekman, at {{the head}} of a regular force," [...] was the answer, [...] "and if, as <b>I</b> <b>suspect,</b> <b>you</b> are Major Willoughby, you know you are safe. In the name of Congress, I command all good {{citizens}} to keep the peace, or they will meet with punishment for their contumacy." ...|$|E
60|$|Friend, {{as to the}} sin you {{committed}} yesterday, {{confess that}} to God, not me. And if you confess it to Him, He is faithful and just to forgive it. But just because you think yourself the most unfit person {{to come to the}} Holy Sacrament, for that very reason <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> to be fit.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{would be}} indeed an {{extraordinary}} mode of proceeding for an intelligent and virtuous people, Mr. Blunt; and I {{must take the}} liberty of saying that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> of pleasantry. If you wish an answer, I will say, at once by such a process we might get a knave, or a fool, or a traitor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you, brute beast," [...] he {{answered}} me. [...] "I question <b>you</b> because <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> that <b>you</b> are hiding something from me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Really, sir," [...] said Mrs Tipps, laughing, [...] "you talk so enthusiastically of this Insurance Company that <b>I</b> almost <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> to be a {{director}} of it." ...|$|R
60|$|That is what <b>I</b> <b>suspected.</b> <b>You</b> know, Anne, {{the longer}} I live the more inexplicable I find human beings. I always thought I was {{by way of}} being a fairly decent fellow. I never knew what mean beastliness there was inside me. It would be quite {{impossible}} for me to tell you how I hate your brother. I've had to be jolly and affable with him and, by George, I wanted to kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By Jove! {{you admire}} her so much, <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> {{must be in}} love with her yourself. Why don't you marry her? I'll make you my prime minister, and then we shall have the use of her wits without the trouble of her fancies. By the twelve Gods! If you marry her and help me, I'll make you what you like!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As we are here," [...] said Sir Piercie Shafton, [...] "unaccompanied by any patrons or seconds, it {{were well}} you should pass your hands over my sides, as I shall over yours; not that <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> {{to use any}} quaint device of privy armour, {{but in order to}} comply with the ancient and laudable custom practised on all such occasions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You seem to {{have been}} quite {{comfortable}} without me: at least you look extremely well. <b>I</b> <b>suspect</b> <b>you</b> are becoming a little lazy and attached to your dinner. Your old haughtiness seems to have faded into a mere habit. It used to be the most active principle in you. Are you quite sure that nobody else has been helping you to live, as you call it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An old skinflint, at the least. Shame on you, Nan! Ingua is a dear little girl, and you--you're {{an unnatural}} mother. Why, <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> were even married." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Hilyer, I protest. I know. Not {{anything}} you can say will alter my opinion one jot. Don't try. <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> were nearly such an interesting man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{mischief}} {{was beyond}} all present remedy, when I received {{the news of}} it. Whatever had happened, whatever might happen, I {{made up my mind}} to persist in my resolution of seeing Norah before I did anything else. <b>I</b> <b>suspected</b> <b>you</b> of being concerned in the disaster which had overtaken me--because I felt positively certain at Aldborough that you and Mrs. Lecount had written to each other. But <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> Norah. If <b>I</b> lay on my death-bed at this moment I could say with a safe conscience <b>I</b> never <b>suspected</b> Norah.|$|R
