Wyatt paused two or three seconds and replied very forcibly: [...] "I won't be arrested today. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> here and am not going away." [...] Dr. George Goodfellow treated the Earps' wounds.|$|E
500|$|Britten's early musical {{life was}} {{dominated}} by the classical masters; his mother's ambition was for him to become the [...] "Fourth B" [...] – after Bach, Beethoven and Brahms. Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations". He developed a particular animosity towards Brahms, whose piano music he had once held in great esteem; in 1952 he confided that he played through all Brahms's music from time to time, [...] "to see if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> about him; I usually find that I underestimated last time how bad it was!" ...|$|E
500|$|During {{their writing}} sessions, Malay noticed Ocean's use of gender pronouns in his lyrics, but {{attributed}} it to Ocean's poetic license {{rather than his}} sexuality. In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now and that was the aim. It's about the stories. If I write 14 stories that I love, then the next step is to get the environment of music around it to best envelop the story and all kinds of sonic goodness." ...|$|E

500|$|Milian wrote So Amazin {{based on}} her own life, and each record pertained to a {{different}} aspect, especially focused on relationships. During early production of the album, Milian was dealing with her break-up with actor Nick Cannon and wrote several records based on that. While writing the mid-tempo track [...] "My Lovin' Goes", Milian felt she turned a new leaf. She said, [...] "you see the change in So Amazin where life was just really coming into place. I was finally becoming the woman that I feel that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now. Also, I was leaving old love behind and learning about new types of love. Which is great, whether it be life, and also the dating scene is really nice." [...] Two tracks which Milian wrote about Cannon were [...] "Gonna Tell Everybody" [...] and [...] "Who's Gonna Ride". When Milian and Cool & Dre had discussions, her break-up with Cannon was regularly mentioned. Milian felt a need to express herself, and writing became therapeutic for Milian; {{she was able to}} get through the break-up by writing songs. The production by Cool & Dre also inspired Milian to write the tracks, as she felt comfortable with them and was able to be open.|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 1942, {{soon after}} making his reports to Roosevelt and the American people, Willkie argued {{the case of}} Schneiderman v. United States before the Supreme Court. William Schneiderman, {{secretary}} of the California Communist Party, was a naturalized American until the government revoked his citizenship, stating that he had concealed his membership on his application for naturalization in 1927. Two lower federal courts upheld the denaturalization. Representing a communist, even in wartime, did nothing to shore up Willkie's diminishing support in the Republican Party, but he wrote to a friend saying, [...] "I am sure <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> in representing Schneiderman. Of all the times when civil liberties should be defended, it is now." [...] In his argument Willkie quoted Lincoln and Jefferson {{by saying that the}} people could, if they deemed it necessary, remake the government, and he stated that Marx's view of revolution was mild by comparison. In 1943, the Supreme Court ruled for Schneiderman, 5—3, restoring his citizenship. Although Willkie refrained from criticizing Roosevelt's internment of Japanese Americans, he stated in a speech that war was no excuse for depriving groups of people of their rights. He spoke out against those who blamed the Jews for the war, warning against [...] "witch-hanging and mob-baiting". For his activities, he received the American Hebrew Medal for 1942.|$|E

2500|$|Writing in the Financial Times, Philip Stephens, {{one of the}} panellists, later {{accused the}} BBC's director-general, Mark Thompson, of misrepresenting the panel's conclusions.

If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right,</b> the BBC, too, is lost". Mark Thompson published a rebuttal in the FT the next day.|$|E

De Gaulle retorted that the French people thought he was a reincarnation of Joan of Arc, to which Churchill replied that the English had had to burn the last one. Clementine Churchill, who admired de Gaulle, once cautioned him, [...] "General, you must not hate your friends more than you hate your enemies."

2500|$|Ocean {{released}} the cover art for his debut studio album's lead single, titled [...] "Thinkin Bout You", revealing the song {{would be released}} to digital retailers on April 10, 2012. However, a month earlier, a re-mastered version of the song had already leaked. About the prospective single he said: [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now {{and that was the}} aim," [...] he said of the follow-up to his acclaimed Nostalgia, Ultra. [...] "It's about the stories.

2500|$|Notable {{songwriter}}s on {{the album}} include Australian singer-songwriter Sia Furler, American singer-songwriters Christina Perri and Bonnie McKee, and Academy Award-nominated songwriter Anne Preven. Furler penned four of the tracks that feature {{on the album}}, including [...] "Cannonball" [...] and [...] "If You Say So", the latter of which was co-written with Michele. Most of the songs on the album are of the pop, dance-pop, and pop rock genres, mixed with some traditional pop ballads including [...] "If You Say So" [...] and [...] "Battlefield". Before {{the release of the}} lead single [...] "Cannonball", Michele stated, [...] "I just felt that [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now and it's been such an inspirational song for me." [...] The second single, [...] "On My Way", was released on May 4, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prosecution}} counsel {{opened the}} case for the Crown by describing the events of February 1983 leading to the identification of human remains in the drains at Cranley Gardens and the subsequent arrest of the defendant; the discovery of three dismembered bodies in Nilsen's property; his detailed confession; his leading investigators to the charred bone fragments of 12 further victims killed at Melrose Avenue; and the efforts Nilsen had taken to conceal his crimes. In a tactful reference to the primary dispute between opposing counsels at the trial, Allan Green closed his opening speech with a reply Nilsen had given to police {{in response to a question}} as to whether he needed to kill: [...] "At the precise moment of the act , I believe <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> in doing the act". To counteract this argument, Green added: [...] "The Crown says that even if there was mental abnormality, that was not sufficient to diminish substantially his responsibility for these killings".|$|E
2500|$|The single [...] "Cannonball" [...] {{was written}} by Sia Furler. Originally, this song wasn't meant for Michele; it was {{introduced}} to her a month after her boyfriend's death and she had an instant connection with its lyrics because they encapsulated her feelings in that moment. Michele has stated, [...] "I just felt that [...] "Cannonball" [...] was the perfect first song for people to hear from this record. It just really explains where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now and it's been such an inspirational song for me. The minute I heard the song, I had a physical reaction to it. For me, it's been my strength. I listen to it every day. I know it was brought into my life for a reason. It's really been so helpful for me and I hope it's the same for other people as it's been for me." [...] Because of this, Furler gave the song to her. Furler also wrote the song [...] "Battlefield" [...] especially for Michele, and co-wrote [...] "If You Say So" [...] with her. [...] "If You Say So" [...] was confirmed to be dedicated to Cory Monteith, Michele's Glee co-star and late boyfriend, who died in July 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Keys {{began working}} on the album in May 2009. During this time, Keys and her audio {{engineer}} bought several vintage keyboards, describing the Moog as her [...] "special best friend". Recording took place in The Oven Studios in Long Island, New York. Keys expressed that she [...] "didn't know what to do" [...] when she {{began working on}} the album, but knew to do it. After exhausting herself, she stated that she [...] "finally found the key, {{and that is to}} allow yourself to be free". She explained that the album dealt with overcoming depression. She went on to say, [...] "I found more freedom. Before, I thought I could only show the strong side of me. Now there’s a mixture of strong and delicate. A new sound, a new emotion. That’s a lot of who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>right</b> now" [...] Recording for the album was completed between August and September 2009. Keys described that she [...] "love melody so much", but approached the album with a [...] "free zone". The album includes production by Kerry [...] "Krucial" [...] Brothers, Jeff Bhasker, Noah [...] "40" [...] Shebib and Swizz Beatz.|$|E
