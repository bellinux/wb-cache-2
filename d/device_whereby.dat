In his first speech as leader, Pearson (recently returned from Oslo {{where he had been}} awarded the Nobel Peace Prize), moved an amendment to supply (a technical <b>device</b> <b>whereby</b> oppositions attempt to secure the government's resignation), and called, not for an election, but for the Progressive Conservatives to resign, allowing the Liberals to form a government. Pearson stated that the condition of the economy required [...] "a Government pledged to implement Liberal policies". Government MPs laughed at Pearson, as did members of the press who were present. Pearson later recorded in his memoirs that he knew that his [...] "first attack on the government had been a failure, indeed a fiasco". Diefenbaker spoke for two hours and three minutes, and devastated his Liberal opposition. He mocked Pearson, contrasting the party leader's address at the Liberal leadership convention with his speech to the House: ...|$|E

Every one knows the natural and almost irresistible tendency of the human mind to relax in vigilance when the demand on attention is continual--that the act, by becoming a mere matter of daily routine, loses much of its intensity. The crews of floating lights are, more than most men, required to be perpetually on the alert, because, besides the danger that would threaten innumerable ships should their vessels drift from their stations, or any part of their management be neglected, there is great danger to themselves of being run into during dark stormy nights or foggy days. Constant vigilance is partly secured, no doubt, by a sense of duty in the men; it is increased by the feeling of personal risk that would result from carelessness; and it is almost perfected by the order for the hoisting of a flag as above referred to.|$|E

No hidalgo was ever more generous in the expression of giving, while I am sure that few hidalgos were ever as generous in the actual practice. We quickly discovered that we dare not admire their possessions, for whenever we did admire a particular object it was immediately presented to us.

Charmian admired a sewing basket--the best example she had seen of Polynesian basketry; it was hers. I admired a bonita hook, carved in one piece from a pearl-shell; it was mine. Charmian was attracted by a fancy braid of straw sennit, thirty feet of it in a roll, sufficient to make a hat of any design one wished; the roll of sennit was hers. My gaze lingered upon a poi-pounder that dated back to the old stone days; it was mine. Charmian dwelt a moment too long on a wooden poi-bowl, canoe-shaped, with four legs, all carved in one piece of wood; it was hers. I glanced a second time at a gigantic cocoanut calabash; it was mine. Then Charmian and I held a conference in which we resolved to admire no more--not because it did not pay well enough, but because it paid too well. Also, we were already racking our brains over the contents of the Snark for suitable return presents. Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving-feast.|$|E

Proposed approaches in literature consider either the synthesis of device behavior or only of shape depending on the limitations of the device model and computational approaches used such as rule-based systems, constraint satisfaction, qualitative reasoning and graph grammars.

40|$|Nanoscale heating {{production}} using nanowires {{has been}} shown to be particularly attractive for a number of applications including nanostructure growth, localized doping, transparent heating and sensing. However, all proof-of-concept devices proposed so far relied on the use of highly conductive nanomaterials, typically metals or highly doped semiconductors. In this article, we demonstrate a novel nanoheater architecture based on a single semiconductor nanowire field-effect transistor (NW-FET). Nominally undoped ZnO nanowires were incorporated into three-terminal <b>devices</b> <b>whereby</b> control of the nanowire temperature at a given source-drain bias was achieved by additional charge carriers capacitatively induced via the third gate electrode. Joule-heating selective ablation of poly(methyl methacrylate) deposited on ZnO nanowires was shown, demonstrating the ability of the proposed NW-FET configuration to enhance by more than one order of magnitude the temperature of a ZnO nanowire, compared to traditional two-terminal configurations. These findings demonstrate the potential of field-effect architectures to improve Joule heating power in nanowires, thus vastly expanding the range of suitable materials and applications for nanowire-based nanoheaters...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{software}} development is characterised {{by a strong}} customer focus and electronic delivery mechanisms which make it very easy for customers to buy and install a vendor’s software. However, it also makes it very easy for customers to buy and install software from competing vendors and as such {{it is more important}} than ever for deployed software to be as correct and bug-free as possible. Whilst certain types of testing can be done in the lab {{with a high degree of}} confidence that results will hold when the software is deployed in the wild, in reality software systems are subject to influence from whatever environment they end up being deployed in. Varying factors in customer environments can include operating systems, services packs, device drivers, network connectivity, resource usage by other software, and so on. Any variation or combination of these factors can lead to a situation where a system deviates from its expected behaviour. The problem is amplified even further on mobile <b>devices</b> <b>whereby</b> <b>devices</b> can move between different networks, interrupt apps for phone calls, have varying screen sizes, have user interference in the form of turning features on and o↵ to preserve battery power, vendor-specific operating system code, and so on.
