5|$|Between 18 and 19 May 2012, Hill {{along with}} Mark Blundell, Perry McCarthy, Martin Donnelly and Julian Bailey {{participated in the}} first round of the VW Scirocco R-Cup at Brands <b>Hatch</b> <b>to</b> raise funds for the Halow Charity. Hill only managed to {{complete}} seven laps of the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Animal remains {{have been}} found in the wreck of the Mary Rose. These include the skeletons of a rat, a frog and a dog. The dog, a mongrel between {{eighteen}} months and two years in age, was found near the <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> the ship's carpenter's cabin and is thought to have been brought aboard as a ratter. Nine barrels {{have been found}} to contain bones of cattle, indicating that they contained pieces of beef butchered and stored as ship's rations. In addition, the bones of pigs and fish, stored in baskets, have also been found.|$|E
5|$|Initiating the {{explosive}} egress system called for pushing, or hitting, a metal trigger with the hand, {{which would have}} left an unavoidably large obvious bruise, but Grissom was found {{not to have any}} of the telltale hand bruising. Still, controversy remained, and fellow Mercury astronaut Wally Schirra, {{at the end of his}} October 3, 1962, flight, remained inside his spacecraft until it was safely aboard the recovery ship, and made a point of deliberately blowing the <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> get out, bruising his hand.|$|E

5|$|The three-member Expedition 1 crew {{successfully}} {{launched on}} 31 October 2000, at 07:52 UTC, atop a Soyuz-U rocket on Soyuz TM-31 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan; they used launch pad Gagarin's Start, {{from which the}} first human to fly in space, Yuri Gagarin, was launched in 1961. After 33 orbits of the Earth, {{and a series of}} rendezvous maneuvers performed by Gidzenko, they docked the Soyuz capsule to the aft port of the Zvezda Service Module on 2 November 2000, at 09:21 UTC. Ninety minutes after docking, Shepherd opened the <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> Zvezda and the crew members entered the complex.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, {{a man by}} {{the name}} of Henry Weems wins $100,000 playing poker against a mobster named Joe Cutrona, though Weems appears ignorant of the basic rules of poker. Suspecting that Weems cheated, Cutrona {{attempts}} to kill him by throwing him off the 29th story of the building they are in. After Weems lands in an access <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> a basement, he stands right back up and walks away, completely uninjured. Two agents in a car stationed outside witness the event and eventually tell Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who promptly take the case. Mulder initially believes the man has the ability to cure himself, but Scully thinks he may just be very lucky by landing in a pile of laundry that was right under the access hatch.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{retirement}} of Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr. in 1987, President Ronald Reagan considered appointing Senator Orrin <b>Hatch</b> <b>to</b> fill his seat. But Congress had, during the term which he was still serving, enacted a salary increase for the judiciary. In July 1987, Bork was nominated instead, {{although it is not}} clear how important a role the Ineligibility Clause issue played in the selection. Two months later, Assistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper rejected the Saxbe fix in a written opinion, concluding that it did not resolve the Ineligibility Clause issue. (The Bork nomination was rejected by the Senate, and the seat ultimately went to Anthony Kennedy.) According to Jan Crawford Greenberg, the Justice Department had previously done the same to Senator Hatch the year prior when Hatch put forth his name as a replacement for retiring Chief Justice Warren Burger. According to Greenburg, Michael Carvin used the Ineligibility Clause as a pretext to allow the White House to quietly say no to Hatch.|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in the soil and take {{anywhere}} from three to nine months <b>to</b> <b>hatch.</b> From <b>hatching</b> <b>to</b> adulthood takes 16-17 months, and adults live for 6-10 months after their final moult.|$|R

5|$|It {{took five}} {{minutes for the}} pad workers to open all three hatch layers, and they could not drop the inner <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> the cabin floor as intended, so they pushed {{it out of the}} way to one side. Although the cabin lights {{remained}} lit, they were at first unable to find the astronauts through the dense smoke. As the smoke cleared, they found the bodies, but were not able to remove them. The fire had partly melted Grissom's and White's nylon space suits and the hoses connecting them to the life support system. Grissom had removed his restraints and was lying on the floor of the spacecraft. White's restraints were burned through, and he was found lying sideways just below the hatch. It was determined that he had tried to open the hatch per the emergency procedure, but was not able to do so against the internal pressure. Chaffee was found strapped into his right-hand seat, as procedure called for him to maintain communication until White opened the hatch. Because of the large strands of melted nylon fusing the astronauts to the cabin interior, removing the bodies took nearly 90 minutes.|$|E

25|$|The {{eggs are}} {{laid on the}} host plants and the larvae <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> feed on them. The plants include members of the Oxalidaceae {{including}} Oxalis corniculata, some Leguminosae and Acanthaceae.|$|E
25|$|The {{cracks and}} crevices in the wattle's bark are home for many insects and invertebrates. The rare Tasmanian {{hairstreak}} butterfly lays her eggs in these cracks, which <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> produce caterpillar larva attended by ants (Iridomyrmex sp.) that feed off the sweet exudates from the larva.|$|E
25|$|Normal crew access was via {{a ladder}} on the aft {{bulkhead}} of the nosewheel well to a hatch {{on the left}} side of the wheel well, then forward to the observer nose or up through another <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> the main deck. There was also a hatch in the floor of the aft fuselage, near the sonobuoy chutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{back plate}} assembly, by {{absorbing}} {{the energy of}} the lock frame, reduced the shock against the carrier pin as the lock frame was <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> the rear.|$|R
5|$|The {{period from}} <b>hatching</b> <b>to</b> {{pupation}} lasts 10 days to two years, exceptionally {{up to six}} years. Climate is a major factor, because development is slower in colder regions.|$|R

25|$|Eggs <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> become larvae, which grow {{until they}} are able to change into pupae. The adult {{mosquito}} emerges from the mature pupa as it floats at the water surface. Bloodsucking mosquitoes, depending on species, sex, and weather conditions, have potential adult lifespans ranging from as short as a week to as long as several months.|$|E
25|$|The PT-76 {{was used}} by the US Army for OpFor training. They were {{modified}} {{in a number of ways}} including the replacement of the engine with a Caterpillar diesel engine, changing the turret <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> a rear hinged arrangement and the fitting of US radios and antennae mounts. Due to the new engines different exhaust arrangements, the exhausts were rerouted to use the water-jet ports rather than the original engine exhaust.|$|E
25|$|Tectus niloticus {{can live}} {{for up to}} 15 years {{and are able to}} {{reproduce}} at about 2 years of age. Females release more than 1 million eggs. Breeding period occurs during spring tides with nocturnal spawning. The eggs fertilised by males <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> larval stages. Embryos develop into free-swimming planktonic marine larvae (trocophore) and later into juvenile veligers that drift with currents before settling on a rocky surface. After 2 or more years they may become adults.|$|E
40|$|The zoeal and megalopal {{stages of}} Austinixa bragantina Coelho, 2005, a small pinnotherid crab found in {{association}} with ghost shrimps Callichirus major (Say, 1818) and Lepidophthalmus siriboia Felder & Rodrigues, 1993 in the northeastern region {{of the state of}} Pará, Brazil, were reared in the laboratory from <b>hatching</b> <b>to</b> the megalopal stage. The duration of the larval period from <b>hatching</b> <b>to</b> megalopa was 28 days and the mean of duration for each larval stage was 6, 5, 5, 6, and 6 days, respectively. In the present study, the zoeal and megalopal stages are described and illustrated in detail...|$|R
50|$|Long-term pair {{bonds are}} usually {{formed in the}} second year, {{although}} breeding does not usually start until the third year. Females are strongly philopatric, meaning they {{will return to the}} place they <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> breed.|$|R
50|$|The {{young of}} cinereous {{tinamous}} {{are capable of}} moving around when they are <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> {{the point that they}} can almost run as soon as they’re hatched. They are dark brown with a reddish speckling.|$|R
25|$|Adult females lay {{large numbers}} of eggs (between 2000 and 6000) in leaf and branch litter, under the scaly or fibrous bark of certain trees and shrubs, or in dense fine foliage near the tips of branches. They utilise a wax-like {{substance}} to make a cohesive mass of eggs and attach these at the selected site. A {{small fraction of the}} eggs survive and <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> larvae after 40–110 days incubation. Development occurs with suitable warmth and high humidity (e.g. moist leaf litter).|$|E
25|$|The labyrinthodonts had an amphibious {{reproduction}} — {{they laid}} eggs in water, {{where they would}} <b>hatch</b> <b>to</b> tadpoles. They would remain in water throughout the larval stage until metamorphosis. Only the metamorphosed individuals would eventually venture onto land on occasion. Fossil tadpoles from several species are known, as are neotenic adults with feathery external gills {{similar to those found}} in modern lissamphibian tadpoles and in the fry of lungfish and bichirs. The existence of a larval stage as the primitive condition in all groups of labyrinthodonts can be fairly safely assumed, in that tadpoles of Discosauriscus, a close relative of the amniotes, are known.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Chalmers's {{actions in the}} west, across the river to the east Confederate cavalry commander Forrest attempted to turn the Union left. Union cavalry commander Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson learned at 3 p.m. that Forrest was crossing the river, he ordered his division under Brig. Gen. Edward <b>Hatch</b> <b>to</b> move south from {{his position on the}} Brentwood Turnpike and attack Forrest from the front. He ordered Brig. Gen. John T. Croxton's brigade to move against Forrest's flank and held Col. Thomas J. Harrison's brigade in reserve. The dismounted cavalrymen of Hatch's division charged the Confederate cavalrymen, also dismounted, and drove them back across the river.|$|E
50|$|Singer {{and lead}} man of Rolandz is the {{character}} Roland Järverup, whom Robert Gustafsson {{played in the}} 1999 movie Screwed in Tallinn by Killinggänget. Later, the idea was <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> create Rolandz using the Roland Järverup character.|$|R
50|$|Nymphs {{emerge from}} the eggs the {{following}} May or June. The nymphs, which resemble wingless adults, but have a more spiny appearance, descend from the trees where they <b>hatched</b> <b>to</b> feed on grasses, weeds, and other nonwoody plants.|$|R
50|$|A nymph is an {{immature}} louse that hatches {{from the}} nit (egg). A nymph {{looks like an}} adult body louse, but is smaller. Nymphs mature into adults about 9-12 days after <b>hatching.</b> <b>To</b> live, it must feed on blood.|$|R
