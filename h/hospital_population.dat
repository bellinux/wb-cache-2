50|$|During the 1890s, the N.S.W. {{government}} decided {{to establish an}} asylum for inebriates (alcoholics) {{where they could be}} treated in isolation from the general prison and <b>hospital</b> <b>population.</b> Relevant legislation was passed in 1900, and Dr J. M. Creed, a member of the N.S.W. Legislative Council from 1885 to 1930, selected Peat, and nearby Milson Island, as the site for the female and male asylums respectively.|$|E

50|$|The primary {{buildings}} were constructed between 1907 and the mid-1920s, and the newer {{buildings were}} constructed between 1940 and 1953. The facility included over fifty buildings such as {{male and female}} dormitories, an infirmary, kitchens, laundry, administration, a chapel and a morgue. The <b>hospital's</b> <b>population</b> grew rapidly, quickly exceeding its capacity; the peak patient population was over 7,000 in 1960.|$|R
50|$|In 1960 the <b>hospital's</b> <b>population</b> {{reached a}} peak of 453.

50|$|The <b>hospital</b> <b>population</b> grew {{to nearly}} 12,000 in the 1960s. During the {{following}} decade, the population began to decrease {{due to the}} emphasis on deinstitutionalization, the addition of other public psychiatric (regional) hospitals throughout the state, the availability of psychotropic medications, an increase in community mental health programs, and many individuals moving to community living arrangements. During FY2004-FY2005, the hospital served more than 9,000 consumers (duplicates counted) - from nearly every Georgia county.|$|E
5000|$|As {{social attitudes}} towards the mentally {{disabled}} evolved, many Pineland Center residents were reintegrated into society. The most able of the <b>hospital</b> <b>population</b> were re-homed into apartments in the 1990s.

At the lock hospital during 1940, 162 patients were admitted for treatment; 184 were discharged cured, 34 died and 198 were still under treatment {{at the end of}} the year. In the period between 1940 and 1945, the lock <b>hospital's</b> <b>population</b> ranged between 190 and 214 patients. The high death rate at the lazaret and lock hospital means that many people living on Palm Island have at least one family member buried on Fantome Island.|$|R
5000|$|Ongoing {{issues with}} staffing, funding, and patient {{conditions}} persisted in the 20th century, {{and the state}} began transitioning mental health care into community settings in 1920. Legal action surrounding patient care and funding in its hospital facilities in the 1980s resulted in a more focused effort to reduce the <b>hospital</b> <b>population.</b> In 1996, the two campuses were consolidated, with 410 beds. Buildings no longer used for patient care, for a time housed offices of the state Department of Mental Health. The historic Mills building housed the Department of Health & Environmental Control.|$|E
50|$|During the 1970s and 1990s the <b>hospital</b> <b>population</b> {{started to}} fall rapidly, {{mainly because of the}} deaths of {{long-term}} inmates. Significant efforts were made to re-house large numbers of former residents in a variety of suitable or otherwise alternative accommodation. The first 1,000+ bed hospital to close was Darenth Park Hospital in Kent, swiftly followed by many more across the UK. The haste of these closures, driven by the Conservative governments led by Margaret Thatcher and John Major, led to considerable criticism in the press, as some individuals slipped through the net into homelessness or were discharged to poor quality private sector mini-institutions.|$|E
5000|$|Stephanie Uhlrig {{worked as}} a music and {{activity}} therapist in the general <b>hospital</b> <b>population.</b> One of the patients at Topeka State Hospital was Kenneth D.

Waddell was initially placed in the Larned State Security Hospital, but on April 1, 1987, he was transferred to the Topeka State Hospital where he was placed in the Adult Forensic Ward (referred to as the [...] "AWL unit"), which was a special unit secluded from the other units because it contained higher risk patients. This unit was closed due to budgetary constraints, and Waddell was eventually moved into the general population.|$|E

5000|$|Dr. Clarke was {{a student}} and {{brother-in-law}} of Dr. Joseph Workman, Superintendent of the Toronto Asylum. Clarke was an early proponents of eugenics, emphasizing the importance of restrictive laws that would limit the immigration and marriage of the [...] "mentally defective." [...] To them, such laws seemed necessary to stem the explosive growth of state and provincial mental asylums where foreign-born patients made up more than 50 percent of the <b>hospital</b> <b>population.</b> Further, the growth of hereditarian views in science supported eugenic proposals; psychiatry's desire for greater respectability in the medical profession made eugenic [...] "science" [...] attractive. By 1905, Clarke had abandoned the movement, {{and many of the}} other leading psychiatrists would follow suit by the end of World War I, when it was clear that eugenic measures were not having the desired effects.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning {{with about}} 600 patients, the <b>hospital</b> <b>population</b> {{increased}} {{year by year}} until the peak was reached in December 1945 with a total patient census/population of 1,729, beds in every hall and every building being overtaxed. Then began the gradual campaign to send patients who had reached maximum hospital benefits back to their own counties. Initially, social workers found placements for the mentally-retarded and the indigent {{in the community and}} at the [...] "county farms." [...] With the discovery of psychotropic drugs in the 1950's, the push for getting rid of restraints, community-based services and the establishment of Mental Health Centers in the 1960's, the massive asylum census continued its decline. Today, the average daily census is approximately 44 patients as the emphasis for community-based services increases and lengths of stay shorten due to medical advances and psychosocial rehabilitation.|$|E
5000|$|As time progressed, numbers had {{steadily}} {{dropped and}} efforts {{had been made}} to reduce new long stay patients over the previous decades, discharges and deaths amongst the <b>hospital</b> <b>population</b> gradually brought numbers back below 1,000. In {{the latter half of the}} 20th century there was an effort by central government to shift the focus of concentration of mental health care away from large psychiatric institutions and into the community. This idea was formally enshrined in the Care in the Community government policy of the 1980s. By the end of the 1980s, Rainhill Hospital had diminished in size and capacity. Wards were combined and new mental health units developed at district general hospitals in the catchment area. The hospital complex had also fallen into disrepair, with peeling walls and a vermin infestation of cockroaches and mice. The national mental health charity Mind (charity) and local commissioners described the conditions as [...] "wholly unacceptable", further contributing to the eventual demise of Rainhill.|$|E
50|$|When the {{hospital}} {{opened its doors}} on July 29, 1890 it received two men from an Otter Tail judge. The next day it received 80 patients transferred from the St. Peter hospital.

5000|$|In {{the article}} “Assessing the Contribution of the Deinstitutionalization of the Mentally Ill to Growth in the U.S. Incarceration Rate” {{researchers}} Steven Raphael and Michael A. Stoll discuss transinstitutionalization, {{or how many}} patients released from mental hospitals in the mid-twentieth century ended up in jail or prison. Using U.S. census data collected between 1950-2000, they concluded that “those {{most likely to be}} incarcerated as of the 2000 census experienced pronounced increases in overall institutionalization between 1950 and 2000 (with particularly large increases for black males). Thus, the impression created by aggregate trends is somewhat misleading, as the 1950 demographic composition of the mental <b>hospital</b> <b>population</b> differs considerably from the 2000 demographic composition of prison and jail inmates.” However, when estimating (using a panel data set) how many individuals incarcerated between 1980 and 2000 would have been institutionalized in years past, they found significant transinstitutionalization rates for all men and women, with the largest rate for white men.|$|E
5000|$|The {{hospital}} had a 760 acre working farm {{on some of}} the hospital grounds. The farm provided vegetables, pigs, poultry, grains, strawberries, peas, beans, carrots, fruit trees and 120 Holstein cows for dairy products. The produce was used by the hospital for internal consumption as well as was canned and sold to other institutions in the state. In 1951, the farm and slaughterhouse provided 32 percent of the food needed to sustain the <b>hospital</b> <b>population.</b> The hospital patients were used to provide the labor in the fields and during the food production process. It was felt that the [...] "open air work provides relief from the boredom of the hospital wards." [...] The work was voluntary and supervised when the patients were in the field. In 1951, the cannery turned out 60,000 gallons of caned vegetables and fruit and over 60,000 pounds of pork. There were forty acres of apple and peach trees on the farm.|$|E
50|$|Talmage is {{the site}} of the Mendocino State Mental Hospital (formerly the Mendocino State Asylum for the Insane), the {{destination}} for inmates charged with crimes but found {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity. The hospital first opened in 1893 with one building at a site near the town of Ukiah, California. Its first patients, all male, were transferred from state mental institutions in Stockton and Napa. Female patients were accepted beginning in 1894. Two additional wards were built in 1910 and 1918, respectively. A major renovation and expansion of the facility took place between 1925-1933. By 1932, the hospital had over 1900 patients and 300 employees. By 1935, the figure had risen to over 2600 patients. <b>Hospital</b> <b>population</b> hit a high in 1955 at over 3,000 patients and 700 employees.

For example, if the risk factor is diabetes and the disease is cholecystitis, a hospital patient without diabetes is more likely to have cholecystitis than a member of the general population, since the patient must have had some non-diabetes (possibly cholecystitis-causing) reason to enter the hospital in the first place. That result will be obtained regardless of whether there is any association between diabetes and cholecystitis in the general population.|$|R
