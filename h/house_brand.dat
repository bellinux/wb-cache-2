25|$|Costco {{focuses on}} selling {{products}} at low prices, often {{at very high}} volume. These goods are usually bulk-packaged and marketed primarily to large families and businesses. Furthermore, Costco does not carry multiple brands or varieties where the item {{is essentially the same}} except when it has a <b>house</b> <b>brand</b> to sell, generally by the Kirkland Signature label. This results in a high volume of sales from a vendor, allowing further reductions in price, and reducing marketing costs. A typical Costco warehouse carries only 4,000 distinct products, while a typical Walmart Supercenter carries approximately 140,000 products.|$|E

25|$|Brown gravy: Traditionally a {{light and}} thin chicken, veal, or turkey gravy, {{somewhat}} salty and mildly spiced {{with a hint of}} pepper, or a sauce brune which is a combination of beef and chicken stock, a variant originating in Quebec. The gravy should be substantial, but still thin enough to easily filter down into the mass of fries and cheese curds. These sauces typically also contain vinegar or a sour flavouring to balance the richness of the cheese and fries. Traditional poutine sauces (mélange à sauce poutine) are sold in Quebec, Ontario, and Maritime grocery stores in jars or cans and in powdered mix packets; some grocery chains like Sobeys even offer their own <b>house</b> <b>brand</b> versions. Many places also offer vegetarian gravy as an option to cater to vegetarians.|$|E
500|$|Twenty {{years after}} its opening, chef Roger Fessaguet left the kitchen to become an owner with Meyzen due to the {{retirement}} of Fred Decré. In 1984, [...] Robert Meyzen retired and Fessaguet and André Jammet took over ownership of the restaurant. The following year, a New York Magazine article cited {{it as one of}} the best restaurants in New York City, and mentioned that most guidebooks gave it their highest rating. Fessaguet retired in 1988, leaving ownership with Jammet and his wife. The Jammets redecorated La Caravelle in 1990, replacing the original red carpets and banquettes with a color scheme of green and peach. [...] Artist Nina Duran was hired to create a small mural for the restaurant's foyer. The restaurant closed on May 22, 2004, despite garnering the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the same year. The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its <b>house</b> <b>brand</b> in 1997.|$|E
500|$|The {{customers}} who arrived on La Caravelle‍s {{last night of}} business were a mixture of regulars who had come for one last meal and bid farwell, {{as well as those}} who had never visited it before and wanted to see a piece of New York history before it was no more. Mr. and Mrs. Walter Cronkite dined with colleague Andy Rooney and his daughter; the Cronkites said they had been patrons of La Caravelle for 43 years. A couple came with their teenage daughter, who was so fussy about food, the La Caravelle chef would cook a packaged macaroni and cheese dinner for her. [...] Another family of three made reservations for four; one for the husband's mother who had been a La Caravelle regular and had died in 2000. People with no reservations managed to gain entrance to the restaurant's bar and were able to be seated at a table. [...] A young couple who had come to have a drink on La Caravelles last night was graciously seated at the table which was formerly reserved for Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, who continued to patronize the restaurant after her marriage to Aristotle Onassis. Upon entering the restaurant's main room, a woman exclaimed that it was her best New York moment and she could now move to the suburbs. Though the restaurant never offered music or entertainment, the Jammets had arranged for Robert White, a tenor and teacher at the Juilliard School to perform [...] "Danny Boy". White was a patron of La Caravelle on the restaurant's first night of business in 1960. It was awarded the James Beard Foundation's Most Outstanding Restaurant in the Country award in the year of its closing. [...] The name is now known for champagnes produced by the Jammets; the restaurant began serving them as its <b>house</b> <b>brand</b> in 1997.|$|E

2500|$|Steve Jobs, the {{co-founder of}} Apple, {{returned}} as interim CEO in 1997. According to Jobs' biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs began a concerted campaign to help sales by improving the retail presentation of Macintosh computers. Even with new products launched under Jobs' watch, like the iMac and the PowerBook G3 and an online store, Apple still {{relied heavily on}} big box computer and electronics stores {{for most of their}} sales. There, customers continued to deal with poorly trained and ill-maintained Mac sections that did not foster customer loyalty to Apple and did not help differentiate the Mac user-experience from Windows. In fact, the retailer trend was towards selling their own generic in-house brand PCs which used even cheaper components than those by major PC makers, increasing retailer overall margins by keeping the manufacturing profits. This [...] "provided a powerful profit motive to convert customers interested in buying a Mac into the owners of a new, cheaply assembled, <b>house</b> <b>brand</b> PC".|$|E
