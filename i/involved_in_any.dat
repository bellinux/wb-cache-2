5|$|After this, {{the units}} of I Anzac Corps {{returned}} to the Somme, to relieve units of the Fourth Army, which had managed to push their lines to a position just below the Bapaume heights throughout September. The 2nd Battalion was not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> major actions during this time, although elements from the 1st Brigade—specifically the 1st Battalion {{with support from the}} 3rd—put in an attack on a salient that had developed in the front line north of Gueudecourt, which failed amid exceptionally muddy conditions.|$|E

50|$|Individualism: Individualism {{rests on}} the idea that the {{individual}} is the relevant unit of social analysis. Contraditório emphasizes the dignity of each individual, which entails both rights and responsibility. It is a misunderstanding, in scientific and ethical grounds, to think that individualism <b>involves</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> sense an egoistic system of values. Egoism is inconsistent both with the idea that individuals are ends in themselves and the defense of individual rights.|$|R

5|$|Around 1960, ANAK held {{a series}} of secret dinner {{meetings}} with the families of Ford Greene, Ralph A. Long, Jr. and Lawrence Michael Williams, Georgia Tech's first three African American students. The goal of these meetings, facilitated through the Georgia Tech YMCA, was to discuss the range of potential situations that could arise when the three students enrolled at Georgia Tech the following year, as well as appropriate reactions to each of these situations. When Greene, Long, and Williams enrolled in the fall semester of 1961, ANAK members discreetly kept a close watch on the three students for the first two weeks to ensure their safety. As a result of ANAK's efforts and those of other Institute and city organizations, none of the students was <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> serious incident, paving the way for continued peaceful racial integration.|$|E
5|$|Currently Umbriel is not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> orbital {{resonance}} {{with other}} Uranian satellites. Early in its history, however, {{it may have}} been in a 1:3 resonance with Miranda. This would have increased Miranda's orbital eccentricity, contributing to the internal heating and geological activity of that moon, while Umbriel's orbit would have been less affected. Due to Uranus's lower oblateness and smaller size relative to its satellites, its moons can escape more easily from a mean motion resonance than those of Jupiter or Saturn. After Miranda escaped from this resonance (through a mechanism that probably resulted in its anomalously high orbital inclination), its eccentricity would have been damped, turning off the heat source.|$|E
5|$|From January 1916, all patrolling {{east of the}} Suez Canal {{was left}} to the British yeomanry and the Australian Light Horse formations. The Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade {{concentrated}} on patrolling the Sweet Water Canal, the railway line between Suez and Port Said, and the Suez Canal Zone {{to the west of}} the canal, which was a restricted area for non-military personnel. On 31 March, Major-General W.A. Watson assumed command of the Nile Delta region and was replaced as brigade commander by Brigadier-General M.H. Henderson. In May 1916, the brigade was reduced to two cavalry regiments when the Patiala Lancers left for Mesopotamia. The brigade also carried out weapons and signal training, but the year ended without them being <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> contact with the Turkish.|$|E

5|$|Harada {{was born}} in the village of Asajawa in Nagano Prefecture on 11 August 1916. After {{completing}} school, he joined the Imperial Japanese Navy's naval infantry force in 1933, aged 17. He later transferred to the Navy's aviation branch, and graduated first in the 35th pilot training class in February 1937. Harada was posted to China in October that year during the Second Sino-Japanese War, but was not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> aerial combat. While in China he witnessed Japanese military personnel indiscriminately killing Chinese civilians in the mistaken belief that they were soldiers in disguise. He also participated in the USS Panay incident. Harada returned to Japan in January 1938, and subsequently served in several training positions.|$|E
5|$|In 1758, Washington {{participated in}} the Forbes Expedition to capture Fort Duquesne.

Washington was not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> other major fighting on the expedition, and the British scored a major strategic victory, gaining control of the Ohio Valley when the French abandoned the fort. Following the expedition, he retired from his Virginia Regiment commission in December 1758. He did not return to military life until the outbreak of the revolution in 1775.|$|E
5|$|In late August, the 7th Battalion, with a {{frontage}} {{equal to}} just over half its authorised strength, was transferred to Ypres, in Belgium, where they manned trenches near the Ypres–Commines canal. During this time they were not <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> major attacks, however, each night they sent patrols out into no man's land and established listening posts to gather intelligence. On 30 September, the 7th Battalion, along with its sister battalion, the 8th Battalion, mounted a raid on the German line at Hollebeke with a force roughly equivalent to two platoons. The raid was a great success, with the Australians overwhelming the defenders and capturing {{a section of the}} German line and killing up to 13 Germans, before withdrawing.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1996, Deal {{changed the}} name of the group back to the Breeders, {{originally}} with almost the same line-up as the Amps. Until then, Deal had been waiting for Wiggs and Kelley to rejoin the Breeders and record a new album together, and had held back from reforming the Breeders out of respect for them. In May 1996, Wiggs revealed that she would not be <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> immediate Breeders activity; Kelley also chose to stay in Saint Paul, to be close to her rehabilitation facility. Deal then decided that {{she did not want to}} wait any longer to reform the group, partly because the Breeders' repertoire was larger than the Amps', thereby allowing longer concerts. Deal added violinist Carrie Bradley (who had played on the Breeders' Pod album), and with Macpherson, Lerma, and Farley, played some shows in 1996 with Primus.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the company}} {{developed}} Resistance 3—the sequel to Resistance 2—which {{was designed to}} be similar to Fall of Man. The team at Insomniac reviewed players' feedback regarding the negative aspects of Resistance 2, re-introduced some mechanics from Fall of Man, and focused on narrative. They considered such an approach can differentiate a franchise from other first-person shooters. Resistance 3 was regarded by the team as the best game in the series, but it sold poorly and was a financial failure. According to Price, the team was disappointed but were still proud of the project. In early 2012, Price announced that the company would not be <b>involved</b> <b>in</b> <b>any</b> future Resistance projects. Sony retained the intellectual property rights to the franchise.|$|E

The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming.

As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II.
