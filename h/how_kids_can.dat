5000|$|He {{argues that}} the appeal of video games is not through their (possibly violent or sexual) content, but rather through {{the fact that the}} [...] "structure" [...] of the video games uniquely invites {{exploration}} and stimulates the reward centers of the brain. In pointing out arguments for the support of video games, Johnson sheds light on <b>how</b> <b>kids</b> <b>can</b> be more involved in games than in class, but this involvement can teach them that which could be taught in class. To substantiate this argument, he discusses how games and other virtual worlds have immediate rewards, whereas in reality, rewards can take a while to obtain. Johnson states “if you create a system where rewards are both clearly defined and achieved by exploring an environment, you’ll find human brains drawn to those systems, even if they’re made up of virtual characters and simulated sidewalks. It’s not the subject matter of these games that attracts…it’s the reward system”. Finally, he argues for the support of video games because they also require one to make decisions, whereas books and other forms of art may conjure up imagination and emotions but don’t require decision-making.|$|E

500|$|<b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! resurfaced in 2014, when Harris was {{prosecuted for}} twelve counts of indecently assaulting young girls. The {{prosecutors}} found <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! on YouTube {{and wanted to}} show it at trial to illustrate its unintentional irony, but the film was not admitted as evidence.

During the trial, it was learned that, while Harris was filming <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No!, he {{was in the midst of}} a casual sexual relationship with his daughter Bindi's best friend and, by its release, he had committed nine of the twelve assaults. According to Richard Guilliatt and Jacquelin Magnay in an article in The Australian, Harris' campaign against paedophilia in <b>Kids</b> <b>Can</b> Say No! can [...] "be seen in retrospect as either monumental self-delusion or a sign of deep, self-lacerating guilt".|$|R
