5000|$|Data formats {{for data}} exchange. Digital message bitstrings are exchanged. The bitstrings are divided in fields and each field carries {{information}} {{relevant to the}} protocol. Conceptually the bitstring {{is divided into two}} parts called the <b>header</b> <b>area</b> and the data area. The actual message is stored in the data area, so the <b>header</b> <b>area</b> contains the fields with more relevance to the protocol. Bitstrings longer than the maximum transmission unit (MTU) are divided in pieces of appropriate size.|$|E
50|$|Usually, {{a message}} or {{a stream of}} data is divided into small pieces, called {{messages}} or streams, packets, IP datagrams or network frames depending on the layer in which the pieces are to be transmitted. The pieces contain a <b>header</b> <b>area</b> and a data area. The data in the <b>header</b> <b>area</b> identifies the source and the destination on the network of the packet, the protocol, and other data meaningful to the protocol like CRC's of the data to be sent, data length, and a timestamp.|$|E
5000|$|Address formats {{for data}} exchange. Addresses {{are used to}} {{identify}} both the sender and the intended receiver(s). The addresses are stored in the <b>header</b> <b>area</b> of the bitstrings, allowing the receivers {{to determine whether the}} bitstrings are intended for themselves and should be processed or should be ignored. A connection between a sender and a receiver can be identified using an address pair (sender address, receiver address). Usually some address values have special meanings. An all-1s address could be taken to mean an addressing of all stations on the network, so sending to this address would result in a broadcast on the local network. The rules describing the meanings of the address value are collectively called an addressing scheme.|$|E

50|$|When {{the system}} was adapted for use under Windows, the {{developers}} faced the problem that there were additional switches that {{did not apply to}} TopView. Instead of simply adding the new switches {{to the end of the}} file, they instead re-imagined the file as a database file containing any number of entries. In theory the file consisted of a number of <b>header</b> <b>areas</b> describing what operating system should read the section, and an offset to the next section. Systems would read down the list until they found the most appropriate one.|$|R
50|$|Generation-one Advanced Format, 4K sector technology, {{uses the}} storage surface media more {{efficiently}} by combining data {{that would have}} been stored in eight 512-byte sectors into one single sector that is 4096 bytes (4 KiB) in length. Key design elements of the traditional 512-byte sector architecture are maintained, specifically, the identification and synchronization marks at the beginning and the error correction coding (ECC) area {{at the end of the}} sector. Between the sector <b>header</b> and ECC <b>areas,</b> eight 512-byte sectors are combined, eliminating the need for redundant <b>header</b> <b>areas</b> between each individual chunk of 512-byte data. The Long Data Sector Committee selected the 4K block length for the first generation AF standard for several reasons, including its correspondence to the paging size used by processors and some operating systems as well as its correlation to the size of standard transactions in relational database systems.|$|R

50|$|A hybrid disc has an ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor, {{which makes}} it a valid ISO 9660 disc, and an Apple {{partition}}. It may also have an Apple partition map, although this is not necessary. The ISO 9660 portion of the disc can co-exist with an Apple partition because the <b>header</b> <b>areas</b> which define the contents of the disc are located in different places. The ISO 9660 primary volume descriptor begins 32768 bytes (32KB) into the disc. If present, an Apple partition map begins 512 bytes into the disc; if there is no partition map, the header for an Apple HFS partition (known as a Master Directory Block, or MDB) begins 1,024 bytes into the disc.|$|R

By minimizing the channel’s overhead depending on the set of supported protocols between mobile hosts, we also minimize the attention raised through the channel’s traffic. We also show how existing covert network channel infrastructure can be modified without replacing all existing infrastructure elements by proposing the handling of backward-compatible software versions...|$|R
40|$|OPPS is a window-based {{graphics}} {{tool that}} provides easy and fast on-screen WYSIWYG editing capabilities. It has a canvas area which displays a full {{image of the}} schedule being edited. The canvas contains a <b>header</b> <b>area</b> (for text) and a schedule area (for plotting graphic representations of milestone objects in a flexible timeline). The OPPS tool is object-oriented, but it is unique in its capability for creating objects that have date attributes. Each object on the screen can {{be treated as a}} unit for moving, editing, etc. There is a mouse interface for simple control of pointer location. The user can position objects to pixel resolution, but objects with an associated date are positioned automatically in their correct timeline position in the schedule area. The schedule area has horizontal lines across the page with capabilities for multiple pages and for editing the number of lines per page and the line grid. The text on a line can be edited and a line can be moved with all objects on the line moving with it. The timeline display can be edited to plot any time period in a variety of formats from Fiscal Year to Calendar Year and days to years. Text objects and image objects (rasterfiles and icons) can be created for placement anywhere on the page. Milestone event objects with a single associated date (and optional text and milestone symbol) and activity objects with start and end dates (and an optional completion date) have unique editing panels for entering data. A representation for schedule slips is also provided. A milestone schedule can be saved to an ASCII file on another computer to be read by OPPS. The program can also print a schedule to a PostScript file. This program is not intended to replace a commercial scheduling/project management program. It does not provide the capability for defining dependencies between activities; dates must be provided manually. However, because OPPS has an ASCII file interface it can be used in conjunction with a project management tool to produce schedules with a quality appearance. OPPS is written in C-language and runs under Sunview on a Sun Workstation with SunOS 4. 0 or higher. Memory requirements are 375 K main memory and 1. 5 Mb free disk space. There is a binary included for Sun 4 computers. OPPS was developed in 1990 and version 2. 2 was released in 1991. OPPS is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in NASA.

The results show that velocity distribution and pressure distribution in the tapered header were not uniform and the mass flow rate out of branch pipes was obviously accrescent from inlet of header to outlet of header. There was remarkable deviation comparison to expected value of mass flow rate. The real backwall shape of the rectangularly tapered head was a complicated curve that was obviously different to the simplified <b>header</b> at <b>area</b> of the inlet and the outlet. The pressure distribution in the optimally designed header was more uniform and the pressure curve at the location corresponding to branch pipes was nearly a horizontal line.

The deviation of the mass flow rate in every branch pipe was less than 1 %...|$|R
50|$|In disk drives, each {{physical}} {{sector is}} made up of three basic parts, the sector <b>header,</b> the data <b>area</b> and the error-correcting code (ECC). The sector header contains information used by the drive and controller; this information includes sync bytes, address identification, flaw flag and header parity bytes. The header may also include an alternate address to be used if the data area is undependable. The address identification is used to ensure that the mechanics of the drive have positioned the read/write head over the correct location. The data area contains the recorded user data, while the ECC field contains codes based on the data field, which are used to check and possibly correct errors that may have been introduced into the data.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to evaluate and optimize the performance of 1 kW integrated heat exchanger module for new generations of air cooled heat exchangers. The first objective is to minimize the ratio of the <b>header</b> frontal <b>area</b> to the entire heat exchanger frontal which will help to reduce the header size. The second objective is to minimize the pressure drop for the entire heat exchanger, i. e., inside the inlet and outlet headers in addition to pressure drop inside the tubes. A three step approach is proposed. First step involves selecting the header design based on previous header optimization studies and then simulating the header using a new 3 D CFD simulation approach. Second step includes solving the heat exchanger using information from the header simulation that accounts for the variation in refrigerant mass flow rate inside the tubes and obtain the performance for the entire heat exchanger. Finally, a solver is used to evaluate the overall module performance. Three different headers are investigated with different header height and size ratio. Then parametric studies are conducted to explore the effect of header size ratio on the optimum designs. Lastly, design guidelines to optimize the integrated heat exchange module are provided based on the study results...|$|R
