5|$|Generally sharks {{have only}} one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, {{depending}} on body size. The jaws of a large great white shark may <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> five layers. In the rostrum (snout), the cartilage can be spongy and flexible to absorb the power of impacts.|$|E
5|$|Lepidoptera {{have two}} large, {{immovable}} compound eyes which {{consist of a}} large number of facets or lenses, each connected to a lens-like cylinder which is attached to a nerve leading to the brain. Each eye may <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 17,000 individual light receptors (ommatidia) which in combination provide a broad mosaic view of the surrounding area. One tropical Asian family, the Amphitheridae, has compound eyes divided into two distinct segments. The eyes are usually smooth but may be covered by minute hairs. The eyes of butterflies are usually brown, golden-brown or even red as in the case of some species of skippers.|$|E
5|$|M-140 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like other state highways in Michigan. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-140 were the 10,176vehicles daily near in Watervliet; the lowest count was 1,536vehicles per day along Pokagon Road, on average. All of M-140 is a two-lane, undivided highway, except sections in cities like Watervliet which may <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four lanes. No section of the trunkline has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|Most starfish {{have five}} arms that radiate from a central disc, {{but the number}} varies with the group. Luidia ciliaris has seven arms, members of the Solasteridae have ten to fifteen while the Antarctic Labidiaster annulatus can <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> fifty. It is not unusual in species that {{typically}} have five arms for some individuals to possess six or more through abnormal development.|$|E
5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets can <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium {{to raise}} the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in other applications because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, {{but it is not}} uncommon to see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 100 droppings in them.|$|E

Users can <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 1,000 friends. The December 2016 software update added the new social networking feature Clubs, which allows users to join groups focused on specific interests or games, and Looking for group (LFG), a system to help users locate players to join their party for multiplayer play.|$|E
5|$|The driver's {{clothing}} was color-coded {{in accordance with}} his faction, which would help distant spectators {{to keep track of}} the race's progress. According to Tertullian, there were originally just two factions, White and Red, sacred to winter and summer respectively. As fully developed, there were four factions, the Red, White, Green, and Blue. Each team could <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> three chariots each in a race. Members of the same team often collaborated with each other against the other teams, for example to force them to crash into the spina (a legal and encouraged tactic). Drivers could switch teams, much like athletes can be traded to different teams today.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{have four}} stages to their lifecycle, namely egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Ixodid ticks have three hosts, taking {{at least a}} year to {{complete}} their lifecycle. Argasid ticks <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> seven nymphal stages (instars), each one requiring a blood meal. Because of their habit of ingesting blood, ticks are vectors of at least twelve diseases that affect humans and other animals.|$|E

5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} {{estimated that}} the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the Kuwaiti town of Wafra, {{in as many as}} 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.|$|E
5|$|After a {{gestation}} {{of about}} 25 days, {{three to five}} young are usually born, although litter sizes vary from one to seven. Females may <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> six litters a year. Newborns weigh 3 to 4g (about 0.10 to 0.15oz) and are blind and almost naked. About as many males as females are born. The external ears (pinnae) soon unfold and on the first day, claws are visible and the young emit high-pitched squeaks. On the second day, {{they are able to}} crawl, and during the third to fifth days, the whiskers and eyelids develop. On the two subsequent days, the mammae and incisors become visible and the animals become more active. Between the eighth and 11th days, the eyes open, the fur develops, and the young begin to take solid food. Weaning occurs on the 11th to 20th day, according to different studies. Considerable variation is reported in body masses at different ages, perhaps because of geographic variation. Sexual activity commences when the animals are about 50 to 60days old. In the wild, rice rats usually live for less than a year; one study suggested that the average lifespan is only seven months.|$|E
5|$|At Sinclair's home, Jenny {{discovers that}} he is a Nazi secret agent and knocks him out. She is later {{detained}} and forced to leave a message for Cliff to bring the rocket pack to the Griffith Observatory in exchange for her life. Just before he is arrested by the FBI and taken to Hughes and Peevy, Cliff hides the rocket pack. Hughes explains that his rocket pack is a prototype, similar to one that Nazi scientists <b>have,</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> now, been unsuccessful in developing, and shows them a horrifying propaganda film that reveals the scope of the Nazis' plans, depicting an army of flying soldiers invading the United States. The FBI agents mention that they are tracking a Nazi spy in Hollywood, whom Cliff realizes to be Sinclair. When Hughes demands the return of the rocket pack, Cliff explains that he needs it to rescue Jenny; he escapes, inadvertently leaving behind a clue to where he is headed.|$|E

5|$|Of the 56 riders that {{signed up}} to {{participate}} in the 1912 Giro d'Italia, 54 of them began the race on 19 May. Since the race's general classification was to be based around team points there were no independent riders as in years past. The organizers allowed the participating teams to <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four riders, with each team needing three riders to finish each stage to remain in the race. There were a total of fourteen teams that started the 1912 Giro d'Italia. A French team was planning on competing in the race, but opted not to and so all the teams that competed were based in Italy. This edition of the Giro d'Italia saw the first teams enter the race that were not sponsored by a bicycle related industry.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead {{in many of these}} applications.|$|E
5|$|The Sunda slow loris {{is greatly}} {{threatened}} by the pet trade, and is sold as an exotic pet throughout southeast Asia. The slow lorises are the most commonly traded protected primates in southeast Asia. When sold as a pet it often will have its teeth pulled out to prevent injury to the owner. This may cause dental infections which <b>have</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a 90% death rate. Once it has lost its teeth, reintroduction to the wild is impossible. Due to a very high mortality rate in captivity due to stress, improper nutrition and infection, the pet trade is inflated by replacements. With a greater purchasing power, the increasing human populations in the species' range could have an even more serious impact.|$|E
