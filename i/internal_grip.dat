40|$|Background and {{objectives}} Leading cognitive theories of OCD suggests that despite prevalent and persistent doubt, individuals with OCD {{do not have}} perceptual deficits. An alternate cognitive theory, the Seeking Proxies for Internal States hypothesis (SPIS), proposes that sensory distrust in OCD stems from actual deficits in accessing internal states. Consistent with the SPIS, previous {{research has found that}} high-OC individuals were less accurate than low-OC individuals in producing target levels of muscle tension in a biofeedback task and that OC symptoms were positively associated with reliance on an external proxy. Methods The current study aimed to replicate and extend the SPIS hypothesis in two experiments using {{a modified version of the}} biofeedback-aided muscle tensing task using grip strength as the sensory input and a distance perception task. We contrasted the performance of undergraduate students self-reporting high- and low-OC symptoms. Results Overall, our findings failed to substantially support the SPIS hypothesis such that OC symptoms were not associated with deficient access to <b>internal</b> states of <b>grip</b> strength and distance perception or increased reliance on feedback. Limitations As this study was conducted in a non-clinical sample, we were unable to generalise our findings to a clinical population. Conclusions Findings are commensurate with the wider OCD literature suggesting the absence of cognitive and perceptual deficits in OCD individuals...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the <b>internal</b> model regulating <b>grip</b> force (GF) /load force (LF) coordination during a brisk load increase is preserved when the lower extremities produce a perturbation during a single step-down task. We observed the coordination of the vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), GF and LF while holding a handheld object during a single step-down task. The 3 forces (vGRF, GF and LF) decreased during the start of the task. While the subject was descending, LF and GF became dissociated from vGRF and increased in value, probably to anticipate the first foot contact. Coordination of LF and GF was maintained until the maximal vGRF (knee extension). LF peaked in the same time window as vGRF, whereas GF peaked about 70 ms later. This desynchronization, which was previously observed in direct load increase on a handheld object, was interpreted to be a predictive action to ensure the smooth management of the brisk increase in load induced by the lower extremities. Incidentally, in this group, kinematic and dynamic differences were observed between men and women, which may highlight a gender-specific strategy to perform the step-down task. In conclusion, these results suggest that the internal model of precision grip is able to integrate a brisk load change, whatever its origin, and regulate the forces to provide an ideal GF to dampen a brisk load increase and secure the object...|$|R
