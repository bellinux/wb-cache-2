It was built between 1913 and 1917 by eight {{craftsmen}} of the shipyard Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino. The model <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> the original in structure, layout, and engine system. It is accurate to the point that, for instance, the painting in the wardroom of the model exactly replicates the original not only in subject {{but also in the}} painting technique (oil on canvas).|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Saw {{received}} mixed reviews. It {{was praised}} for the storyline and multiple endings, {{as well as}} the immersive environment that <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> the Saw film series. The controls and combat system, however, were panned by critics. Since Konami purchased the publishing rights after former publisher Brash Entertainment went bankrupt, Konami had a significant input on the games' final outcome. They stated that they had plans to make Saw their next big franchise as well as a spiritual successor to their other survival horror series, Silent Hill. A sequel, , was released on multiple platforms on October 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} {{student who has}} discovered a novel compound that allows a person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

Monocots rarely produce secondary growth and are therefore seldom woody, with Palms and Bamboo being notable exceptions. However, many monocot stems increase in diameter via anomalous secondary growth.|$|E

In 2014, more than 20 wine competitions were held in South Africa, many of them concentrating on specific styles or varietals. The only South African wine competition acknowledged as a truly international wine concours is the annual Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards, founded in 1997. The first Michelangelo Liqueur Awards were held in 2014 {{as part of the}} wine awards. Only accredited wine judges, wine makers and sommeliers from Europe, USA, Australia and Asia are invited to judge the approximately 1700 South African wines and spirits entered by producers in the Michelangelo International Wine & Spirits Awards (www.michelangeloawards.com). Another South African wine competition, the national Veritas award, was started in 1990. The Top 100 South African Wine Competition is a newer example of a local wine competition.|$|E

Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly found the film unoriginal, [...] "pointless and inert" [...] and awarded it a C grade.

500|$|Before Deadpools success, the R-rated comic-based films {{considered}} successful were 300 (2006) and Watchmen (2009), {{which received}} around half the opening weekend gross of successful PG-13 superhero films. Kick-Ass (2010), a film tonally similar to Deadpool, had made even less with a $19.8 million opening. Many reasons were given for why Deadpool {{went on to}} be more successful than these, including {{the popularity of the}} Marvel brand and Reynolds performance. Tom Huddleston, Jr. wrote for Fortune, that Deadpool was proof to Hollywood that R-rated films can be as successful as PG-13 films, [...] "particularly when fans see the rating itself as validation that the film <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> its source material." ...|$|E

Though Shylock is serious about revenge, he <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> himself in other ways that cast a less than favourable light on other characters in the play. After Hazlitt's account, according to Bromwich, it became less easy to find a simple resolution to the problems in the play or to withhold entirely our sympathy for Shylock, particularly in view of a passage like the following: ...|$|E

500|$|Anne Carroll Moore, then {{in charge}} of the children's section at the New York Public Library, wrote an {{enthusiastic}} review in the Atlantic Monthly and invited Geisel to speak at the library. In her review she called the book [...] "so completely spontaneous that the American child can take it to his heart on sight", and [...] "as original in conception, as spontaneous in the rendering as it <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> the imagination of a small boy." [...] Moore sent a copy of the book to English children's author Beatrix Potter, who wrote back, [...] "What an amusing picture book... I think it the cleverest book I have met with for many years. The swing and merriment of the pictures and the natural truthful simplicity of the untruthfulness... Too many story books for children are condescending, self-conscious inventions—and then some trivial oversight, some small incorrect detail gives the whole show away. Dr. Seuss does it thoroughly!" [...] Geisel himself was later critical of the book, saying on its 25th anniversary, [...] "I think I was a little aloof, too outside there. It was written {{from the point of view}} of my mind, not the mind of a child." ...|$|E
500|$|British novelist Justin Cartwright, {{who wrote}} the book The Song Before It Is Sung {{about one of the}} plot's conspirators, wrote, [...] "The film <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> most of the facts of the plot, but fails to convey any sense of the catastrophic moral and {{political}} vortex into which Germans were being drawn." [...] Though not depicted, but briefly mentioned in the film, von Stauffenberg was persuaded to become involved in the plot by his uncle, Nikolaus Graf von Üxküll-Gyllenband, who was disenchanted with the Nazis. The film also did not explore von Stauffenberg's philosophy and background, which Cartwright felt fit the German tradition of Dichter und Helden ("poets and heroes"). Cartwright described how von Stauffenberg was an appropriate leader for the plot: [...] "He was the man who unmistakably wore the mantle of a near-mystic German past, a warrior Germany, a noble Germany, a poetic Germany, a Germany of myth and longing." [...] The novelist felt that Cruise's portrayal was more akin to one as a [...] "troublesome cop". Cartwright also noted that the film did not raise the question of what kind of Germany von Stauffenberg had in mind if the plot succeeded.|$|E
500|$|Mythily Ramachandran of Gulf News {{praised the}} film's humour and performances: [...] "The anger and hatred one often {{associates}} with a revenge tale is missing"; humour takes over, {{and the film}} [...] "busts the notion that revenge tales must be laden with gore and violence". According to Deepa Gauri of the Khaleej Times, Maheshinte Prathikaram is a boon for a Malayalam cinema with an [...] "identity crisis". She praised the film's screenplay and direction: [...] "Every frame shows the minute detailing, which gives [...] its real heart. Charming you with wit, underlining humour and with characters who behave without any cinematic hangover". Raj Vikram of Metromatinee.com also gave a positive review: [...] "There {{is not a single}} scene in the film which appears cooked up ... He [...] must be commended for being sure-footed about what he intended to portray". Vikram praised the performances by Faasil and the supporting cast, the [...] "magnificent camera" [...] and the [...] "songs which seamlessly and melodiously merge with the narrative", concluding that it [...] "is a movie that <b>is</b> <b>true</b> <b>to</b> itself. It surprises with its all pervading simplicity and makes even revenge look like a stroll in the park".|$|E
