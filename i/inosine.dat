5|$|RNA is {{transcribed}} {{with only}} four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil), but these bases and attached sugars {{can be modified}} in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. Pseudouridine (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of tRNA). Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose nucleoside is called <b>inosine</b> (I). <b>Inosine</b> {{plays a key role}} in the wobble hypothesis of the genetic code.|$|E
5|$|Nucleotides {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed nucleotides. Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside <b>inosine</b> monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E
5|$|The type of RNA editing {{that is most}} {{prevalent}} in higher eukaryotes converts adenosine nucleotides into <b>inosine</b> in dsRNAs via the enzyme adenosine deaminase (ADAR). It was originally proposed in 2000 that the RNAi and A→I RNA editing pathways might compete for a common dsRNA substrate. Some pre-miRNAs do undergo A→I RNA editing and this mechanism may regulate the processing and expression of mature miRNAs. Furthermore, at least one mammalian ADAR can sequester siRNAs from RNAi pathway components. Further support for this model comes from studies on ADAR-null C. elegans strains indicating that A→I RNA editing may counteract RNAi silencing of endogenous genes and transgenes.|$|E
40|$|RNA editing by {{adenosine}} deaminases {{that act}} on RNA converts adenosines to <b>inosines</b> in coding and non-coding regions of mRNAs. <b>Inosines</b> are interpreted as guanosines and hence, {{this type of}} editing can change codons, alter splice patterns, or influence the fate of an RNA. A to I editing is most abundant in the central nervous system. Here, targets {{for this type of}} nucleotide modification frequently encode receptors and channels. In many cases, the editing-induced amino acid exchanges alter the properties of the receptors and channels. Consistently, changes in editing patterns are frequently found associated with diseases of the central nervous system.

40|$|Nucleotide deamination is a {{widespread}} phenomenon frequently leading to a change of the genetic information. Adenosine deaminases that act on RNA (ADARs) convert adenosines to <b>inosines</b> in double-stranded or structured regions of RNAs. <b>Inosines</b> are interpreted as guanosines by most cellular processes and hence, this type of modification can affect the coding potential of an RNA but also its splicing, folding, or stability, to name a few. While originally {{believed to be a}} rare event recent bioinformatic screens have demonstrated that RNA-editing by ADARs is widespread and very abundant in mammals. From these screens, editing sites were discovered in both coding and non-coding regions of mRNAs. In this review we focus on RNA-editing events that alter the coding potential of mRNAs and hence lead to the formation of proteins that differ from their genomically encoded versions.

25|$|As many as 16% of pre-miRNAs may {{be altered}} through nuclear RNA editing. Most commonly, enzymes known as {{adenosine}} deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) catalyze adenosine to <b>inosine</b> (A to I) transitions. RNA editing can halt nuclear processing (for example, of pri-miR-142, leading to degradation by the ribonuclease Tudor-SN) and alter downstream processes including cytoplasmic miRNA processing and target specificity (e.g., {{by changing the}} seed region of miR-376 in the central nervous system).|$|E
40|$|RNA editing is a {{molecular}} {{process through which}} some cells can make discrete changes to specific nucleotide sequences during tran-scription. the enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (AdAR) binds to specific double-stranded pre-mRNA structures and deaminates particular adenosine (A) nucleotides to <b>inosines</b> (i). <b>inosines</b> are then read as guanosines by the translation machinery. in some cases such a single-base change may lead to an alteration of RNA stability, or an aminoacid change that can have consequences such as {{the creation of an}} alternative splice site or a change in pro-tein function. RNA editing events have been reported for various protein types, including voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels. in a recent study, dr Richard Horn and co-workers showed that RNA editing at four sites in eag, a Drosophila voltage-gated potassium channel, results in the substitution of amino acids into the final protein product that are not encoded by the genome. in particular, editing resulted in the following changes: K 467 R (site RNA editing helps to fine-tune potassium channe...|$|R

2500|$|An {{anticodon}} is a unit made up {{of three}} nucleotides that correspond to the three bases of the codon on the mRNA. Each tRNA contains a distinct [...] anticodon triplet sequence that can base-pair {{to one or more}} codons for an amino acid. Some anticodons can pair with more than one codon due to a phenomenon known as wobble base pairing. Frequently, the first nucleotide of the anticodon is one not found on mRNA: <b>inosine,</b> which can hydrogen bond to more than one base in the corresponding codon position. In the genetic code, it is common for a single amino acid to be specified by all four third-position possibilities, or at least by both pyrimidines and purines; for example, the amino acid glycine is coded for by the codon sequences GGU, GGC, GGA, and GGG. Other modified nucleotides may also appear at the first anticodon position—sometimes known as the [...] "wobble position"—resulting in subtle changes to the genetic code, as for example in mitochondria.|$|E

Few candidate substrates for ADAR 1 editing are known {{at this point}} and it is not known how substrate recognition is achieved.

We have isolated two variants of Xenopus laevis ADAR 1 for which no editing substrates are currently known.

40|$|A {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA) -specffic modification {{activity from}} Xenopus oocytes and human cells (dsRNA modifier) converts adenosine residues present in dsRNA to <b>inosines.</b> The {{function of the}} dsRNA modifier is unknown, {{although it has been}} suggested that it may be part of the cellular antiviral response. We investigated the relationship between the activity of the dsRNA modifier, viral infection, and the antiviral response in human cells induced by poly(rI) -poly(rC) [poly(I C) ] treatment. We found, unexpectedly, that treatment of HeLa cells with poly(I. C) or other dsRNA molecules resulted in the dramatic inhibition of the dsRNA modifier. Mixing experiments, reconstruction experiments, and pretreatment of extracts with RNases indicated that inhibition of the dsRNA modifier did not result from the continued presence of a soluble inhibitor (such as dsRNA) in the in vitro modification reactions. Treatment of cells with cyclohexamide or dactinomycin simultaneously with the poly(I C) demonstrated that in vivo inhibition of the dsRNA modifier did not require new transcription or translation. The dsRNA mojification activity was also substantially inhibited in cells infected with poliovirus and was slightly inhibited in cells infected with adenovirus. The inhibition of the dsRNA modifier during the antiviral state is thus not consistent with an antiviral function, and instead suggests another cellular function for dsRNA modification. A double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) modification activity (dsRNA modifier) from Xenopus eggs (4) and mammalian cells (41), originally termed an RNA-unwinding activity (3, 32, 40), converts adenosines to <b>inosines</b> in RNA duplexes (4, 41). The adenosine-to-inosine conversion both destabilizes the RNA double helix and alters the informational content of the RNA (1).

40|$|Adenosine deaminases {{that act}} on RNA (ADARs) are RNA-editing enzymes that deaminate adenosines to create <b>inosines</b> in {{double-stranded}} RNA (dsRNA).

Transgene-induced gene silencing in adr- 1;adr- 2 mutants depends on genes required for RNAi, suggesting that a dsRNA intermediate is involved.
