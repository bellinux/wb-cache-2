25|$|Although {{natural law}} is often {{confused}} with common law, {{the two are}} distinct. Even though natural law theories have exercised a profound influence {{on the development of}} English common law, the latter is not based on inherent rights, but is the legal tradition whereby certain rights or values are legally recognized by virtue of already having judicial recognition or articulation. Natural law is often contrasted with the human-made laws (positive law) of a given state, political entity or society. In legal theory, the interpretation of a human-made law requires some reference to natural law. On this understanding of natural law, natural law can be invoked to criticize judicial <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> the law says, but not to criticize the best interpretation of the law itself.|$|E
25|$|He {{argues that}} the {{availability}} of federal research funds distorts “the natural market for scientific research” by inducing scientists to eschew pursuit of radical lines of potentially promising research that might not appeal to politicians and bureaucrats who hold influence over the allocation of grant monies. “Federal funding of medical research guarantees the politicization of <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> types of research for what diseases will be funded. Scarce tax resources are allocated according to who has the most effective lobby, {{rather than on the}} basis of need or even likely success. Federal funding also causes researchers to neglect potential treatments and cures that do not qualify for federal funds.” In his view, eliminating government sources of funds for medical research would probably improve the quality of research being performed.|$|E

25|$|The Nationals also faced several <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> to do {{with players}} set to reach free agency, as well as players who had 2016 options. On November 2, the team {{announced}} it would decline options for right-handed reliever Casey Janssen and outfielder Nate McLouth, after Janssen struggled with injury and poor performance during the 2015 season and McLouth spent the entire year on the 60-day disabled list. Janssen and McLouth joined utility infielder Emmanuel Burriss, shortstop Ian Desmond, starter-turned-reliever Doug Fister, outfielder Reed Johnson, center fielder Denard Span, left-handed reliever Matt Thornton, second baseman Dan Uggla, and starting pitcher Jordan Zimmermann in a sizable free agent class. Qualifying offers worth $15.8 million apiece were extended to Desmond and Zimmermann, although both rejected them, as expected. Right-handed reliever David Carpenter also elected free agency after being outrighted from the Nationals' 40-man roster on November 18, 2015. On December 2, 2015, the Nationals announced they had not tendered a contract to right-handed reliever Craig Stammen, who was eligible for arbitration.|$|E
25|$|Over 100 {{pieces of}} {{statuary}} {{had been sold}} from the gardens in 1848, 1921 and 1922, so {{it was decided to}} replace them gradually with replicas as and when funds could be raised. In 1989-90 Peter Inskip assessed the condition of the buildings. Work on the restoration of the buildings, based on this survey, was then prioritised. The major restorations have been the Grenville Column (1991), the Temple of Ancient Virtue (1992), the Oxford Gates and Lodges (1994), the Temple of Venus (1995) and the Temple of Concord & Victory (1996). This last had been severely compromised when 16 columns had been removed to build the new school chapel in 1926. Replacement columns were carved and the building re-roofed at the cost of £1,300,000. The cost of this first stage was £10,000,000, the money coming from several sources: a public appeal, the Heritage Lottery Fund and grants from English Heritage as well as private donors and other grant-giving bodies. The restoration process adopted an approach where each building, or element of the gardens was informed by archaeology. In order to make informed <b>decisions</b> <b>about</b> <b>what</b> to restore and why, archaeological techniques such as geophysics, excavation, building recording and monitoring {{in the form of an}} archaeological watching brief were all utilised.|$|E

He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's Troop 20 of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his Scouting {{experience}} to journalist David Gergen and said that it [...] "probably saved {{my life in the}} war.

The far-off North Pole was not mentioned as an option; the choice lay between two depots of food and ammunition laid down for their safety, one at Cape Flora in Franz Josef Land and one at Sjuøyane (Seven Islands) in Svalbard (see map). Inferring from their faulty maps that the distances to each were about equal, they decided to try for the bigger depot at Cape Flora. Strindberg took more pictures during this week than he would at any later point, including 12 frames that make up a 360-degree panorama of the crash site.|$|E
