40|$|AbstractEthnopharmacological relevancePterodon pubescens Benth is a {{medicinal}} plant commonly used for therapeutic purposes in folk medicine for rheumatic diseases' treatment. In the present work we analyzed the chemical {{composition of the}} oleaginous extract of P. pubescens Benth (OEPp) and extended the antinociceptive effect of OEPp evaluating its role on animal models of acute and chronic pain. Materials and methodsThe antinociceptive and antiedematogenic effects of OEPp (3 – 100 mg/kg, i. g.) were evaluated in the formalin test; mechanical allodynia in the postoperative pain and complex regional pain syndrome type-I (CRPS-I) animal models; and thermal hyperalgesia was induced by plantar incision. Finally, we performed a phytochemical analysis of OEPp. ResultsThe chemical composition of OEPp was analyzed by mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and eight sesquiterpene compounds were identified, i. e. three major sesquiterpene (E-cariofilene, γ-muurolene, biciclogermacrene), and nine vouacapane diterpenes, four of which showed in major concentration (6 α-acetoxyvouacapane, 6 α, 7 β-dimetoxivouacapan- 17 -ene, 6 α-acetoxy, 7 β-hidroxyvouacapane, 6 α, 7 β-diacetoxycouacapane). Furthermore, {{the results of the}} present study demonstrate, for the first time, that the OEPp reduced mechanical allodynia in the postoperative pain and CRPS-I animal models. OEPp also increased the paw withdrawal latency in hot- and cold-plate tests in the postoperative pain model. In addition, the present work confirms and extends previous data from literature showing that systemic administration of OEPp caused significant inhibition against both phases of pain response to formalin intraplantar injection and edema formation. ConclusionsTogether, present and previous findings show that OEPp given intra-gastrically caused significant inhibition against both phases of formalin intraplantar injection and <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibited</b> <b>mechanical</b> and thermal hyperalgesia in the postoperative pain and CRPS-I animal models...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} analyze the factors {{influencing}} sandstone mechanical compaction and its physical property evolution during compaction processes, simulation experiments on sandstone mechanical compaction were carried out with a self-designed diagenetic simulation system. The experimental materials were modern sediments from different sources, and {{the experiments were conducted}} under high temperature and high pressure. Results of the experiments show a binary function relation between primary porosity and mean size as well as sorting. With increasing overburden pressure during mechanical compaction, the evolution of porosity and permeability can be divided into rapid compaction at an early stage and slow compaction at a late stage, and the dividing pressure value of the two stages is about 12  MPa and the corresponding depth is about 600  m. In the slow compaction stage, there is a good exponential relationship between porosity and overburden pressure, while a good power function relationship exists between permeability and overburden pressure. There is also a good exponential relationship between porosity and permeability. The influence of particle size on sandstone mechanical compaction is mainly reflected in the slow compaction stage, and the influence of sorting is mainly reflected in the rapid compaction stage. Abnormally high pressure <b>effectively</b> <b>inhibits</b> sandstone <b>mechanical</b> compaction, and its control on sandstone mechanical compaction is stronger than that of particle size and sorting. The influence of burial time on sandstone mechanical compaction is mainly in the slow compaction stage, and the porosity reduction caused by compaction is mainly controlled by average particle size.|$|R

30|$|Despite {{recent studies}} {{reporting}} the mechanical properties of amyloid fibrils, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> mechanisms and fracture behaviors of prion amyloid fibrils {{have not been}} fully characterized. Though our recent study [19] provides the elastic properties of prion and non-prion amyloid fibrils, the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> characteristics and fracture properties of prion and non-prion fibrils have not been fully understood. Here, we note that ENM [43 – 45] used in our recent study [19] is unable to provide any insight into the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> mechanisms of amyloid fibrils, since ENM is applicable for analysis of elastic properties for protein materials undergoing small deformation. Here, we study the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> mechanisms and fracture properties of prion and non-prion amyloid fibrils using SMD simulations. Our simulations are aimed towards unveiling how the helical structure of (prion) amyloid fibrils determines their <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> mechanisms and properties. We found that the helical structure determines not only the elastic properties of (prion) amyloid fibrils but also their deformation mechanisms such as the failure pathways of prion fibrils. Specifically, our simulation results show that infectious prion fibrils can be more easily fragmented (or ruptured) than (non-infectious) non-prion fibril, and that the fracture toughness of (prion) amyloid fibrils is encoded in their helical structures. Our study provides insight into a design rule showing how the fracture toughness of (prion) helical amyloid fibrils are determined.|$|R

30|$|In {{experimental}} part, Kaniber et al. [28] {{utilized the}} piezoelectric device to apply different uni-axial strains to CNT. They mounted the CNT on two Au pads (source and drain) of a piezoelectric stack. When different voltages {{were applied to}} the piezoelectric device, the axial length of CNT can be adjusted. For CNT with different uni-axial strains, {{they found that the}} electronic properties of CNT can be affected by the uni-axial <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation.</b> From this experiment and references [23 – 28] it is obvious that besides {{the size and shape of}} nanomaterials, the electronic properties can be further adjusted by applying the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation.</b> Since BNNTs have some material properties superior to CNT, it is worth understanding how to adjust the electronic properties of BNNT by the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> for further applications, such as hydrogen storage for fuel cell. Therefore, this study utilizes DFT to investigate armchair (5, 5) and zigzag (8, 0) single-wall BNNTs under different uni-axial loadings. The HOMO-LUMO gap, radial bucking variety, and bond length are adopted to discuss the relationship between the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> and electronic properties for the two different chiralities.|$|R

An essential characteristics of this problem is that the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> and the flow have different time scales. In petroleum industry, one uses different very efficient simulators for the flow problem and the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformations,</b> which enables to handle complex models. Therefore it is necessary to be able to combine as efficiently as possible the exploitation of these simulators. We propose two alternative splitting approaches. The first one is the staggered algorithm used by engineers, which amounts to a Gauss-Seidel method in the one phase linear case. The second approach is based upon the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. We use a numerical multi-scale method in both of these algorithms. We compare these two approaches and we show that the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm is faster and more robust than the staggered algorithm. Applying the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm therefore seems to compensate for the fact that the inf-sup condition for the mixed discretization method is not satisfied when combining the simulators for the <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformations</b> and for the flow computations...|$|R
40|$|Severe <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> {{coupled with}} high heat {{generation}} prevails during drilling. Establishing correlations between microstructure and surface integrity {{has always been}} a challenge, which is the main focus of this work. High-speed drilling experiments were performed by varying speed, feed rate and machining environments (dry and wet). The changes in microhardness, residual stresses and microstructure on the drilled surfaces were analyzed. A dominant <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation</b> is found to lower grain size and increase grain boundary misorientation angle, whereas under a dominant thermal deformation higher grain size and lower grain boundary misorientation angle was evident. In dry drilling, a combined effect of temperature and <b>mechanical</b> <b>deformation,</b> the deformed and then recrystallized grains are observed to have orientation. The drilling parameters that increase strain rate aggravate machining-affected zone, whereas heat accumulation increases heat-affected zone, only in dry drilling.
