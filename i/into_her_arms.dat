25|$|In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had {{the real}} great {{training}}, {{maybe even the}} last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it {{is a sort of}} a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, {{whether you like it or}} not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.|$|E

Olivia gives him {{an address to}} a [...] "safe house" [...] in a suburban area, and, once there, thanks him and allows him to go. However, Henry remains parked on a nearby street. In the home, Olivia discovers her mother Marilyn (Amy Madigan), who, in the prime universe, had died when Olivia was a teenager.

500|$|The {{genesis of}} Trial by Jury began in 1868, when Gilbert wrote a single-page {{illustrated}} comic {{piece for the}} magazine Fun entitled Trial by Jury: An Operetta. [...] Drawing on Gilbert's training and brief practice as a barrister, it detailed a [...] "breach of promise" [...] trial going awry, in the process spoofing the law, lawyers and the legal system. [...] (In the Victorian era, a man could be required to pay compensation should he fail to marry a woman to whom he was engaged.) The outline of this story was followed in the later opera, and two of its numbers appeared in nearly their final form in Fun. [...] The skit, however, ended abruptly: the moment the attractive plaintiff stepped into the witness box, the judge leapt <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> and vowed to marry her, whereas in the opera, the case is allowed to proceed further before this conclusion is reached.|$|E
500|$|In the OVAs of the series, Kenshin {{is given}} a more humanized design. There are also {{numerous}} changes to his life story {{compared to that of}} the manga, including the way he received his X-shaped scar in [...] from 1999. In [...] released in 2001, as time passes, Kenshin becomes tortured with guilt for leading a happy life after such a destructive past. He decides to wander again, and Kaoru strongly supports him, promising to welcome him home with a smile and their child. Kenshin eventually becomes ravaged by an unknown disease. However, he decides to assist in the First Sino-Japanese War as he had promised the Meiji Government. After the war's end, Sanosuke discovers a gravely injured Kenshin on the shore, who has lost his memory and cannot return to Japan. Sanosuke arranges for Kenshin's return to Tokyo and Kaoru. The two finally meet, and Kenshin collapses <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> as he clutches her. Kaoru then notices Kenshin's scar has faded away, signifying his death. After watching the last OVA, Nobuhiro Watsuki was quite unhappy with how the story ended, saying that [...] "Kenshin went through so much crap and deserved a happy ending." ...|$|E

The Snow Queen's presence freezes a mother bird to death as she protects her young under her. These young birds will appear later in the story.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 August 2001, Mac issued {{his debut}} solo album, 3000 Feet High, which peaked in the top30 on the ARIA Albums Chart. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, felt {{the album was}} an [...] "emotional journey" [...] where [...] "hroughout, the {{dancefloor}} taunts us like a temptress, determined to lure us <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> but we're torn between her charms and the inner us which the dance beats may drown out". The lead single, [...] "Just the Thing" [...] (June 2001), reached No.17 on the ARIA Singles Chart and featured lead vocals by Peta Morris. In December 2001 he performed at Homebake on the Big Top stage. At the APRA Music Awards of 2002 [...] "Just the Thing" [...] won 'Most Performed Dance Work' and was nominated for 'Most Performed Australian Work'. In January 2002, and again in 2006, Mac appeared at Splendour in the Grass.

2500|$|... "With {{the release}} of Unexpected, Williams has welcomed R back <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> with a modern edge, a la Rihanna and Chris Brown, infusing her soulful lyrics with party beats and dance-like synths. Take the lead single, for instance. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] is an immensely catchy mid-tempo jam co-written by Williams and ex-Child Beyonce's sister, Solange Knowles. The track re-launched the {{ebullient}} singer back into the mainstream, sporting a new, edgy electronica look and sound. [...] "We Break the Dawn" [...] has {{a certain amount of}} memorability in the synth riff and the laid-back party lyrics. The song is carefree, and {{a far cry from the}} depth of Gospel music. The album features a collection of [...] "moods" [...] including the bouncy tracks [...] "Hello Heartbreak," [...] hilariously including [...] "It's time for the percolator" [...] as the bridge, and [...] "Lucky Girl" [...] once the smooth intro stops. These dance-pop R beats are the same light and noncommittal ones you've become accustomed to with artists like, as I said earlier, Rihanna and Chris Brown, along with the party feel of The Pussycat Dolls and other contemporaries. Another mood of Unexpected is the party jam feel exhibited by [...] "Private Party" [...] and [...] "Hungover," [...] the tracks you jam while driving down the road with your windows down. [...] "The Greatest," [...] a fantastic pop ballad, and [...] "Thank U," [...] a melodic song about thanking what held you down so you can appreciate how far you've come, round out the heavier, and slower, moods on the album. Summary; this album fits nicely into a lot of musical niches, making it a good addition to most collections. And you may be humming some of these tracks years down the line. Not my favorite of the year, but not too shabby either." ...|$|E
