The basic capitalization model is used as a starting point for the development of several models.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>interest</b> rate credit <b>subsidies</b> on {{economic}} development in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, occupational choice and financial frictions. There are two financial frictions: a cost to intermediate loans and a limited liability problem which maps into the degree of enforcement of credit contracts in the economy. Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously by an agent’s type (ability and net wealth) and the credit market frictions. We then add a credit program in this economy that subsidizes the interest rate on loans. There is a fixed cost (which might be null) to apply for such loans {{in the form of}} bureaucracy and regulations. We show that for the United States, an <b>interest</b> rate credit <b>subsidy</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} output per capita, but it can have important negative effects on wages and government finances. For Brazil, a developing country in which financial repression is high and the government subsidies heavily loans, our counter-factual exercises show that if the country cuts all <b>interest</b> <b>subsidies,</b> there will no significant quantitative effect on output per capita, wages, inequality and government finances. However, when the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> is fixed at the level observed in Brazil, but access to the credit program is increased, then output and wages might both increase, as long as the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> does not not affect directly the spread on non-subsidized loans...|$|R

40|$|Our paper sets up {{a simple}} model to assess, {{to the best of}} our {{knowledge}} for the first time, the relative pros and cons of housing downpayment and <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidies</b> on the access to and the stability of the mortgage market. Our analysis unveils a number of relevant policy lessons for the design of housing subsidy programs, namely: (a) Under fiscal neutrality (same government outlay), both subsidies have the same positive effect on the ability and willingness to repay. But, for such neutrality to hold, the percentage <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> must be larger than the downpayment subsidy, which is rare to happen in practice; (b) The <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> raises the loan size a bank is willing to grant, but the downpayment subsidy does not, the reason being that the latter actually diminishes the need for bank financing for a given property value; (c) When targeting lower income households, the downpayment subsidy is superior to the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy,</b> as the former increases the loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, two key criteria for mortgage borrower eligibility. By the same token, the downpayment subsidy is more likely to have a stronger effect on low and medium value housing units; (d) Such progressivity comes at the cost of a higher probability of default, meaning that some trade-off between equity and financial stability may emerge; (e) Subsidies are likely to put upward pressure on housing prices. The downpayment subsidy has a direct effect (by injecting fiscal resources to cover part of the property price) and an indirect effect (by easing the access to the mortgage market); (f) The <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy</b> only has the latter effect; and (g) Compared to the <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidy,</b> the downpayment support promotes a less aggressive competition in the real estate market...|$|R

Our critical innovation is to calculate repayment burdens for graduates with widely differing earnings, and we find that these generally are relatively low because the SLF is heavily subsidized. Even so, for graduates with very low income the burdens can be high. Importantly we analyze and illustrate what the repayment streams would be if the SLF was redesigned to have no <b>interest</b> rate <b>subsidies</b> and find that the burdens increase to extremely high levels for the lowest income graduates.

Two efforts at promoting the issuing of corporate bonds by creditworthy utilities, one supported by partial guarantees by USAID and the other by KfW, have failed [...] "because of the risk-averse culture which is so pervasive in Indonesian central and regional governments", according to a USAID report. Under a 2009 Presidential decree, however, state banks can provide partial credit guarantees of 70% of loans to creditworthy PDAMs plus an <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy.</b> As for direct lending by the Ministry of Finance, regional governments have to provide partial guarantees for these loans, which they are reluctant to provide.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture in Oman {{has been}} {{important}} for centuries. The government's economic development policy emphasizes {{the expansion of}} such non-oil sectors as agriculture, fishing, industry, and mining in its bid to diversify the economy and diminish its dependence on oil exports. The goal {{is to establish a}} sustainable economic base in preparation for the time when hydrocarbon reserves are depleted. The government launched several economic campaigns, naming 1988 and 1989 as Years of Agriculture and 1991 and 1992 as Years of Industry. Through these campaigns, the government has encouraged private-sector investment by allocating generous amounts of cash support for private industry to be disbursed mainly through official development banks. For example, the Oman Bank for Agriculture and Fisheries, created in 1981, extends loans at concessionary rates to individuals for whom farming or fishing is the principal activity. The bank acts as a distributive institution, receiving an <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy</b> from the government. In 1990 there were 1,308 loans, totaling RO4.7 million. Development programs also incorporate the government's policy of indigenization, with a large component of funds.|$|E

An observed practice is that the seller offers a loan, or <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy,</b> to the highest bidder. The work by Che and Gale [3] has given a partial answer for second-price auctions, with default risk assumed. away. This paper provides a complete solution for first-price auctions, with default risk included. For each level of the <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy,</b> we solve the auction game and give a closed form solution for its symmetric equilibrium. From this we determine each bidder's behavior {{as a function of}} the interest charged by the seller. This behavior exhibits the following novel bifurcation: for low interest rates, poor firms bid high and rich firms bid low; for high interest rates, the reverse is true. At the "critical" rate, bids from poor and rich firms are identical. From the seller's point of view, we obtain a formula showing expected profit {{as a function of the}} <b>interest</b> <b>subsidy.</b> This allows computation of a best subsidy. We show that the best rate is always larger than the critical rate. These results are especially applicable to auctions of large projects, where bidders' financial constraints are significant.
