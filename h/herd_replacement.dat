40|$|Cattle <b>herd</b> <b>replacement</b> {{management}} {{should be}} revisited {{because of the}} combined evolutions of animal type, size, and level of production, and of the evolutions {{of the economic and}} environmental context. This presentation will deal with both dairy and beef productions. In these two cases, the strategy of <b>herd</b> <b>replacement</b> has to be considered not only at the animal scale (rearing strategies and optimal lifespan duration), but also at the herd and farm levels according to the various objectives assigned to sustainable livestock systems. During this presentation, an update of the main effects of heifers rearing strategies on subsequent performances will be given, with focuses on the effects of feeding strategies on puberty attainment, fertility of heifers, production and reproduction performances when adults, calving difficulties, longevity of the animals and carcass characteristics at slaughter. Interactions with breed maturity will be highlighted. In the second part, considerations on the sustainability of the different ways of production will be developed, taking into account the various dimensions of sustainability.

40|$|Problem statement: Economic losses {{due to high}} {{mortality}} in young calves born in hot arid zone including Kuwait and a high cost of rearing are the main constraints to this region. Therefore, dairy producers {{have to depend on}} importation of pregnant heifers for <b>herd</b> <b>replacement.</b> Research data on cost of heifer rearing from their weaning to first lactation were lacking. The objectives of the present investigation were to compare the costs/benefits of raising heifers born in Kuwait without and with intervention measures and project the future financial benefits. Approach: Present study methods involved using cost-benefit model where without and with intervention scenarios were compared using a total of 58 herd parameters. These variables included in the spreadsheets in the model could be varied during each year of projection period. Production turnoff of 3 herds each of 245 cows in three scenarios namely baseline, improved and future were evaluated. Input costs of imported heifers (baseline), locally raised heifers with interventions (improved) and projected 10 year (future) and the income generated from these scenarios were analyzed. Results: Total income generated from baseline, improved and the future projection were KD 268, 715 /-, 281, 246 /-and 342, 251 /-respectively (1 KD Kuwaiti Dinar = US $ 3. 45); total operating costs of these scenarios were KD 249, 372 /-, 242, 276 /-and 205, 929 /-respectively.

40|$|Information was {{collected}} on cow and sire breeds in both dairy and suckler herds in the National Farm Survey (NFS) in autumn 1998. The {{number of farms}} {{included in the analysis}} was 1030 with farms containing less than 2 economic size units (equivalent to 3 to 4 dairy cows) excluded from the sample. The main findings of the survey were as follows: • Ninety-eight percent of dairy cows and 96 % of dairy <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> were Friesian/Holstein • The suckler cow herd contained 46 % early-maturing breed crosses (Hereford 31 %, Aberdeen Angus 12 % and Shorthorn 3 %) 2 % Friesians, 48 % of the three main continental breed crosses (Charolais 17 %, Simmental 16 %, Limousin 15 %) and 4 % other (mainly continental crosses). Compared to the adult cows <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> had less early-maturing breed crosses and Friesians (total 42 %) and more (55 %) of the three main continental breed crosses (Charolais 20 %, Simmental 15 %, Limousin 20 %). • Overall, in 1998, it was estimated that the national cow herd consisted of 52 % Friesian/Holstein, 23 % early maturing breed crosses and 26 % late maturing breed crosses. • Forty-seven percent of dairy cows were bred to Friesian/Holstein sires, 26 % were bred to early maturing sire breeds and 27 % were bred to continental sire breeds. The corresponding figure for dairy <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> were 40 %, 46 % and 13 %. • Seventeen percent of suckler cows were bred to early maturing sire breeds, 46 % were bred to Charolais, 16 % were bred to Simmental, 17 % were bred to Limousin and the remaining 6 % were bred to mainly other continental breed sires. The sires used on suckler <b>herd</b> <b>replacements</b> were 43 % early maturing breeds, 16 % Charolais, 10 % Simmental, 25 % Limousin and 5 % other. • Based on the sire breeds used in 1998, the breed composition of the 1999 calf crop was estimated to be 24 % Friesian/Holstein, 24 % early maturing breeds, 24 % Charolais cross, 10 % Simmental cross, 12 % Limousin cross and 6 % other (mainly other continental crosses). • Although the proportion of continental breed crosses in the calf crop continues to increase (48 % in 1993 to 52 % in 1999), the use of continental sire breeds is declining in the dairy herd (from 33 % in 1992 to 27 % in 1998), particularly where AI is the method of breeding. However, this trend may be at an end as the 1999 AI figures to date (September 30) show substantial decreases in Hereford and Aberdeen Angus inseminations with increases in Belgian Blue, Limousin and Friesian/Holstein. • The dairy herd is a relatively unimportant source of the better quality animals accounting for only 25 % of total continental breed crosses which have a lower proportion of continental breed genes than those from the suckler herd. • It was estimated that the 1999 calf crop from the suckler herd consisted of 18 % early maturing breeds, 29 % of half to threequarters continental breed genes and 53 % containing at least three-quarters continental breed genes. • A total of 48, 200 herds used bulls. The proportion of bulls of each breed used were 9 % Frieisan/Holstein, 17 % Hereford, 11 % Aberdeen Angus, 1 % Shorthorn, 29 % Charolais, 12 % Simmental, 16 % Limousin and 5 % other. Continental breeds accounted for 38 % and 84 % of bulls on dairy and suckler farm, respectively. • In the present study the number of animals (cows plus replacements) bred to continental sire breeds was 1. 22 million of which 40 % were by AI. • National AI figures show that the total number of inseminations (excluding DIY) have declined from 1. 03 million in 1992 to 0. 79 million in 1998. • Assuming that the suckler cow should be at least half continental breeding and that Belgian Blue crosses are unsuitable if increases in calving problems are to be avoided then the dair y herd may provide as little as 25 % of suitable suckler <b>herd</b> <b>replacements.</b> Thus, the main source of replacements would be from within the suckler herd. Factors to be considered include hybrid vigour which involves crossbreeding, milk production potential of the cow {{and the fact that the}} most widely used terminal sire is Charolais. In these circumstances one suitable crossbred cow would be obtained from alternate crossing with Limousin and Simmental sires. • Heat synchronisation was used on 3 % of herds. The figures for dairy and suckler herds was 6. 8 % and 0. 5 %, respectively. • Vaccination for leptospirosis was used on 29 % of dairy farms and 4 % of suckler farms.

40|$|End of Project ReportSummary The {{rationale}} for crossing dairy cows with beef bulls {{is to increase}} the beef productivity and value of the progeny. The proportion of dairy cows available for beef crossing is determined by the dairy <b>herd</b> <b>replacement</b> rate. The performance of cross-bred cattle is generally superior to the mean of the parent breeds because of heterosis. This is most pronounced for reproduction, maternal and calf survival traits. Crossing dairy cows with early maturing beef breeds (e. g. Angus, Hereford) has little effect on growth but improves carcass conformation and reduces feed intake. Crossing with most late maturing beef breeds also improves carcass conformation and reduces feed intake, but in addition, growth rate, kill-out proportion and carcass muscle proportion are increased. Cross breeding can have small negative effects on dam milk production, and subsequent reproduction can be impaired following a long gestation or difficult calving. There is little advantage in crossing with double muscled sire breeds (e. g. Belgian Blue, Piedmontese) compared with the larger conventional late maturing breeds (e. g.

40|$|A {{network model}} was {{developed}} to optimize dairy cattle replacement decisions under herd constraints. Herd constraints are limited resources, such as a limited supply of labor or heifers, which cause optimal replacement decisions for individual cows to be dependent of decisions for other cows in the herd.

Optimal replacement decisions need to be determined simultaneously for all cows in the herd. Previous approaches provided complex and approximate solutions, while exact solutions for realistic problems have not been developed. The approach presented here is to formulate the dairy cattle replacement problem as a network and solve it with a state-of-the-art network optimizer.

The higher costs appear to be due to reduced milk production, higher feed costs, higher average labor costs, significantly higher <b>herd</b> <b>replacement</b> costs and significant transition costs.

By nature, the cow attempts to isolate herself from other animals to deliver her calf, and this practice helps prevent contamination of the newborn calf with infectious agents. With increased confinement, this is not possible, and special precautions should be taken to provide a clean environment for the calf during and following calving, when it is highly susceptible to diseases. A clean, well bedded, well ventilated stall should be provided in a location where the cow can be observed frequently with a minimum amount of disturbance. Other. The udder of the cow should be cleaned before the calf nurses. It is especially important that bacteria do not gain entrance to the intestines before absorption of colostrum takes place...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Paratuberculosis (PTB) is {{a disease}} which causes {{considerable}} economic losses to producers of livestock, particularly dairy cows. Nowadays PTB {{is one of the}} most prevailing and costly infectious diseases of dairy cattle. The purpose of the present study was to review economic losses, which may be caused by Mycobac-terium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) above all in herds of dairy cattle. The most important losses caused by the presence of clinically ill animals have been thoroughly described: loss of milk production and poor body condition followed by death or culling. In contrast, losses arising from a subclinical disease have not been well documented and contradictory results have been published to date. The calculation of losses caused by PTB depends to a certain degree on the production system in a herd, efficiency level, herd management system and other factors. Direct economic losses are above all caused by decreased milk production concurrent to increased incidence of mastitis, changes in milk parameters and increased somatic cell counts, reproductive dysfunctions, poor feed conversion, shortened production age and increased predisposition to other diseases etc. Indirect eco-nomic losses are caused by premature culling of animals and their unrealized future income, expenses for non-active production, <b>herd</b> <b>replacement,</b> diagnostic testing, “unnecessary ” veterinary care and establishing disease control programmes. Genetic value of animals and their progeny is lost. Last but not least, the reputation of the farm where MAP infected animals are kept is lost for a long-time, which is also important...|$|E
30|$|In Kenya’s Northeastern Province, {{pastoralism}} is {{the main}} livestock production system and means of livelihood. However, pastoralists are facing increasing risks such as drought, insecurity, animal diseases, increasing human populations and land fragmentation. This study sought to evaluate household livestock herd structures and dynamics in view of such risks and subsistence and market demands. The {{study was conducted in}} Garissa County of Kenya, using a cross-sectional household survey. The data was analysed for descriptive statistics of household livestock status, dynamics and demographic parameters. The results showed that females of reproductive age formed over 50  % of all livestock species. Cattle had the highest turnover and all species’ mortalities accounted for the greater proportion of exits. Cattle had the highest multiplication and growth rates, but also the highest mortality, offtake, commercial offtake and intake rates. Goats had the lowest mortalities, offtake, commercial offtake and intake rates. Overall, the herds were structured to provide for both immediate and future needs in terms of milk, sales and <b>herd</b> <b>replacement</b> as well as for rapid recovery after disasters. The livestock herd dynamics indicate efforts at culling, restocking, retention of valuable categories of animals, and natural events. Livestock populations would be annihilated over time if the trends in end balances and negative growth rates were to continue and not be interrupted by the upward phases of the livestock cycles. It was recommended that the Government and development partners should undertake interventions to balance the herd dynamics in favour of entries by improvement of reproduction and reduction of mortalities, and support livelihood diversification to reduce dependence on livestock.|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: In many hot arid countries, {{pregnant}} Holstein Friesian heifers are&# 13; imported for <b>herd</b> <b>replacement.</b> The calves {{obtained from}} exotic cows {{are exposed to}} adverse climate&# 13; in feedlot system resulting in very high morbidity and mortality rates. Diarrhea, dehydration and deaths&# 13; are causing a major loss to the producers. This study examines the Risk Rates (RR) for morbidity and&# 13; mortality in pre-weaned calves. Approach: Thirteen commercial dairy farms of small, medium and&# 13; large sizes were surveyed using 1, 280 newborn calves. A survey was conducted for calves from their&# 13; birth to weaning at 90 day. Parameters {{of the study were}} birth weights, colostrum feeding, growth rate,&# 13; incidences of diseases, clinical symptoms, post-mortem findings and results of laboratory investigations&# 13; of samples obtained from sick and dead calves. Calf housing and feeding management of 13 farms were&# 13; investigated. Results: RR for morbidity and mortality ranged from 0. 3 - 1. 00 and being highest during the&# 13; first week. Most common disease was diarrhea representing 90. 6 % of the total calves affected. Common&# 13; pathogens causing diarrhea were E. coli, Salmonella sp. Klebsiella, Pasturella and rotavirus. &# 13; Relationship between calf management and morbidity RR for diarrhea was significant (r 2 = 627, p = 0. 01) &# 13; and the growth rate was positively correlated (r 2 = 0. 761, p = 0. 1). Diarrhea caused a significant negative&# 13; impact on gross margins of the calf enterprises. Conclusion: Colostrum feeding and housing&# 13; management were the key factors for causing a high RR for morbidity and mortality. Gross margin&# 13; loss was significantly influenced by morbidity and mortality RR of calves...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{calculate}} the cost-effectiveness of infant pneumococcal vaccination in the Netherlands, using the 13 -valent PCV 13 vs. the currently used 10 -valent PCV 10. We adapted a previously published model, using recent estimates of epidemiological and efficacy data. In 12 scenarios, we explored the impact of different assumptions on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICECER) of PCV 13 over PCV 10. Taking only direct effects on invasive pneumococcal disease into account, PCV 13 was {{not found to be}} cost-effective at a price difference of (sic) 11 per dose. If <b>herd</b> protection, <b>replacement</b> and non-invasive disease were also taken into account, the ICECER of PCV 13 compared with PCV 10 was below (sic) 30000 /QALY gained in 11 of 12 scenarios.

25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two {{months away from}} parturition then they will dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the <b>replacement</b> <b>herd.</b> There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the dry period that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|R
40|$|New genomic {{technologies}} {{can help}} farmers to (1) achieve higher annual rates of genetic gain through using genomically tested bulls in their herds, (2) select for 2 ̆ 7 difficult 2 ̆ 7 to measure traits, such as feed conversion efficiency, methane emissions and energy balance, (3) select the best heifers to become <b>herd</b> <b>replacements,</b> (4) sell pedigree heifers at a premium, (5) use mating plans to optimise rates of genetic gain while controlling inbreeding, (6) achieve certainty in parentage of individual cows and (7) avoid genetic defects that could arise from mating cows to bulls {{that are known}} carriers of genetic diseases that {{are the result of}} a single lethal mutation. The first use does not require genotyping females and could approximately double the net income per cow that arises due to genetic improvement, mainly through a reduction in generation interval. On the basis of current rates of genetic gain, the net profit from using genotyped bulls could be worth AU 20 /cow per year and is permanent and cumulative. One of the most powerful uses of genomic selection is to select for economically important, yet difficult-or expensive-to-measure traits, such as residual feed intake or energy balance. Provided the accuracy of genomic breeding values is high enough (i. e. correlation between the true and estimated breeding values), these traits lend themselves well to genomic selection. For selecting replacement heifers, if genotyping costs are AU 50 /cow, the net profit of genotyping 40 heifers to select the top 20 as replacements (per 100 cows) would be worth approximately AU 41 per cow. However, using parent average estimated breeding-value information is free and can already be used to select replacement heifers. So, genotyping costs would need to be very low to be more profitable than selecting on parent average estimated breeding value. However, extra value from genotyping can also be captured by using other strategies. For example, mating plans that use genomic relationships rather than pedigree relationships to capture inbreeding are superior in terms of reducing progeny inbreeding at a desired level of genetic gain, although pedigree does an adequate job. So, again, the benefits of genotyping are small (AU 10). Ascertainment of pedigree is an additional use of genotyping and is potentially worth ∼AU 30 per cow. Avoidance of genetic diseases and selling of pedigree heifers have a value that should be estimated case-by-case. Because genotyping costs continue to fall, it may become increasingly popular to capture the extra value from genotyping females...|$|R
