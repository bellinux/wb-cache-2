40|$|Little {{is known}} about {{variation}} in the efficacy of financial participation across countries. This article examines the relationship between two types of financial participation (profit sharing and <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership)</b> and labour productivity across 29 European countries using a representative workplace survey. Consistent with theoretical expectations, profit-sharing is associated with superior labour productivity when it {{is open to all}} employees, whilst the evidence for <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> is more mixed. Analysis reveals considerable variation in the efficacy of both schemes across Europe. Country-level collective bargaining coverage has the greatest explanatory power in accounting for cross-country variation in efficacy. In countries with higher levels of collective bargaining coverage, profit-sharing performs less well, whereas <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> performs better, relative to countries with lower collective bargaining coverage. These findings shed light on the comparative dimension of the of the financial participation-labour productivity link...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationships}} between three dimensions of contingent pay – performance-related pay, profit-related pay and <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> – and positive employee attitudes (job satisfaction, employee commitment, and trust in management). The paper also examines a conflicting argument that contingent pay may intensify work and this can detract from its positive impact on employee attitudes. Of the three contingent pay dimensions, only performance-related pay had direct positive relationships with all three employee attitudes. Profit-related pay and <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> had a mix of negative and no significant direct relationships with employee attitudes, but profit-related pay showed U-shaped curvilinear relationships with all three employee attitudes. The results also indicated that performance-related pay is associated with work intensification, and this offsets some of its positive impact on employee attitudes...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen {{the advent of a}} wide range of worker-focused {{holistic}} approaches by firm s in search of improved competitive performance in their product markets (Appelbaum and Batt, 1994; Paauwe, 2004; Whitfield and Poole, 1997). Amongst these practices, <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> (ESO) has been accorded...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} {{outcomes}} of a substantial broad-based <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> scheme for employee attitudes and behaviour in a privatised firm. Methodology: Results {{are based on a}} survey of 711 employees in Eircom, an Irish telecommunications firm, which is 35 percent employee-owned. Findings: The ESOP has created sizable financial returns and has had extensive influence in firm governance at the strategic level. However, findings show only a limited impact on employee attitudes and behaviour. This is attributed to a failure in creating a sense of employee participation and line of sight between employee performance and reward. Originality: Little research has examined the impact of a large employee shareholding on attitudes and behaviour within a public-quoted firm. The substantial and unparalleled size of the Eircom ESOP presented a unique opportunity to conduct such a study. Policy implications: The aim of <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> often includes aligning employee objectives with those of other shareholders, and thus improving labour performance. The findings in this study highlight a need to provide employees with a sense of ownership and control. Findings also question the assumption that where employees have a substantial shareholding, they will focus on securing the long-term prospects of the firm...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} privatization on the relative bargaining strength of management and trade unions. Findings {{are based on a}} study of Ireland’s largest telecoms provider, Eircom, which has been privatized since 1999. The privatization of Eircom adopted a stakeholder approach, under which <b>employee</b> <b>share-ownership</b> and management-union partnership {{played an important role in}} firm restructuring. Findings show that despite this approach privatization has resulted in a significant decrease in the perceived bargaining strength of unions and an increase in the perceived bargaining strength of management...|$|E
40|$|Based on {{a survey}} of {{employees}} in a large telecommunications company, we examine the means through which privatisation, accompanied by an <b>Employee</b> <b>Share-Ownership</b> Plan (ESOP), impact on employee commitment and organisational citizenship behaviour. Findings show that although the ESOP has in some way moderated outcomes, privatisation has had negative consequences for commitment. Despite this, 50 percent of respondents report an increased level of citizenship behaviour. In determining changes in employee commitment and behaviour, {{it was found that}} an important role is played by how employees perceive changes in conditions of employment, involvement in workplace decision-making and management-union collaboration...|$|E
