40|$|VUCA {{represents}} a constantly changing environment - {{a set of}} timeless circumstances that challenge a leader s ability to make decisions, develop plans and execute these plans flawlessly on a daily basis. This research focused {{on the influence of}} leadership, organisational values and organisational change on employee engagement within a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. The construct leadership was further examined using two hierarchical levels, <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line manager and <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders to deepen the understanding of the influence these levels of leadership have on employee engagement A quantitative research approach was followed wherein a non-random convenience sample (N = 969) of permanent staff operating within the Retail Operations Specialities function of South Africa s largest non-food retailer participated in the study. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the strength {{of the relationship between the}} dependent (employee engagement) and independent variables for each research question. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to analyse the differences among group means and their associated procedures. <b>Employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders were found to have a stronger influence on <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> engagement levels in comparison to <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line managers. In addition the study found that the application of organisational values have a positive influence on employee engagement whilst organisational change was found to have the strongest influence on employee engagement explaining 41. 2 % of the variance in employee engagement. The findings of the study challenges the current body of research by identifying that within a VUCA environment when <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> leave the organisation they leave their senior leaders not their line managers.

40|$|Although {{predictions}} that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) {{would lead to}} reductions in employer-sponsored health coverage have not been realized, some of the law's critics maintain the ACA is nevertheless driving higher premium and deductible costs for businesses and their workers. Goal: To compare cost growth in employer-sponsored health insurance before and after 2010, when the ACA was enacted, and to compare changes in these costs relative to changes in workers' incomes. Methods: The authors analyzed federal Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data to compare cost trends over the 10 -year period from 2006 to 2015. Key findings and conclusions: Compared to the five {{years leading up to}} the ACA, premium growth for single health insurance policies offered by employers slowed both in the nation overall and in 33 states and the District of Columbia. There has been a similar slowdown in growth in the amounts employees contribute to health plan costs. Yet many families feel pinched by their health care costs: despite a recent surge, income growth has not kept pace {{in many areas of the}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>Employee</b> <b>contributions</b> to premiums and deductibles amounted to 10. 1 percent of U.

The former process {{is of particular interest}} because of the slow convergence evident from the three known terms of its QCD series, which begins with an O(α 2 s) leading-order term. The O(α 5 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> to the H → gg rate is expressed as a degree- 3 polynomial in L ≡ ln(µ 2 /m 2 t(µ)). We find that asymptotic Padé-approximant predictions for the coefficients of L, L 2, and L 3 are respectively within 1 %, 2 %, and 7 % of true values extracted via renormalization-group methods. Upon including the full set of next-order coefficients, the H → gg rate is found to be virtually scale-independent over the 0. 3 MH < ∼ µ < ∼ Mt range of the renormalization scale-parameter µ. We conclude by discussing the small O(α 4 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> to the H → b ¯ b rate, which is obtained from a prior asymptotic Padé-approximant estimate of the O(α 4 <b>s)</b> <b>contribution</b> to the quark-antiquark scalar-current correlation function. 1...|$|R
