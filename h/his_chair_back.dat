60|$|PICKERING. I {{beg your}} pardon. [He draws <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> apologetically].|$|E
60|$|A low cry of astonishment {{broke from}} the squire. He pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Irish lord, sitting {{near the}} doctor, drew <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> in a hurry.|$|E
60|$|Blaisdell had <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> tilted <b>back</b> and <b>his</b> heavy boots {{against a}} post of the porch. Down he thumped. His neck corded {{with a sudden}} rush of blood and his eyes changed to blue fire.|$|R
60|$|He {{recovered}} from his surprise, or whatever emotion it was, very quickly, and {{broke into a}} short laugh. But I noticed that he pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> farther <b>back</b> into the box and drew the curtains a little more forward.|$|R
60|$|On {{entering}} he accosted {{the only}} occupant of the place, {{a man of}} some forty years of age, who was dressed entirely in white, and was sitting smoking a huge cigar, with <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> tilted <b>back</b> and <b>his</b> feet on the table.|$|R
60|$|They {{laid down}} their cards in turn and then Crestwick noisily thrust <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
60|$|Wisbech noisily thrust <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back,</b> and Acton laughed--a {{laugh that}} had a faint ring in it.|$|E
60|$|Lewisham, {{partially}} embraced, pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> {{with his}} disengaged arm, {{so that she}} might sit on his knee....|$|E
6000|$|I stood a-looking at him; he set there a-looking at me, with <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> tilted <b>back</b> a little. I set {{the candle}} down. I noticed {{the window was}} up; so he had clumb in by the shed. He kept a-looking me all over. By and by he says: ...|$|R
60|$|The provincial Excellency {{assumed a}} weary superiority, tilting <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> far <b>back</b> near {{an open window}} in the true Costaguana manner. The {{military}} band happened to be braying operatic selections on the plaza just then, and twice {{he raised his hand}} imperatively for silence in order to listen to a favourite passage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She did! she did!' sang Linton, {{sinking into}} the recess of <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and leaning <b>back</b> <b>his</b> head to enjoy the {{agitation}} of the other disputant, who stood behind.|$|R
60|$|Wingate rose {{slowly to}} his feet, pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and stood behind it. Flossie gripped {{him by the}} wrist.|$|E
60|$|Alton thrust <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and clenched one hand, {{while the}} girl noticed with relief {{that he had}} almost {{forgotten}} her.|$|E
60|$|Dominey pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> {{from the}} fire as though he felt the heat. His eyes seemed glued upon the doctor's.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm just as sick of {{all this}} as a man can be,' said Mr Ruggles, who was sitting low in <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> bent, and his head forward. 'I won't {{put up with it}} no more.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{one could}} tell strange {{stories of the}} old days," [...] they heard Ridley say, as he sank into <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> again. Glancing <b>back,</b> at the doorway, they saw Mr. Pepper {{as though he had}} {{suddenly}} loosened his clothes, and had become a vivacious and malicious old ape.|$|R
60|$|JULIA. Indeed! I {{never told}} you so. If you cannot behave like a gentleman, you had better {{go back to the}} society of the woman who has given you up--if such a cold-blooded, cowardly {{creature}} can be called a woman. (She rises majestically; he makes <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> fly <b>back</b> to the table.) I know you now, Leonard Charteris, through and through, in all your falseness, your petty spite, your cruelty and your vanity. The place you coveted has been won by a man more worthy of it.|$|R
60|$|His {{tone was}} deeper, almost hollow. He still kept <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> amongst the shadows. Mrs. de Vaux was only {{partially}} satisfied.|$|E
60|$|Caleb {{had pushed}} <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back,</b> and was leaning forward, {{shaking his head}} slowly, and fitting his finger-tips {{together}} with much nicety.|$|E
60|$|He pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and, rising {{slowly from}} the table, confronted him. Captain Brisket, red-faced and confident, {{stared up at}} him composedly.|$|E
25|$|Frees narrated many {{live action}} films and {{television}} series, including Naked City (1958–1963). Paul Frees also provided {{the voice of}} the eccentric billionaire John Beresford Tipton, always seated in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> with <b>his</b> <b>back</b> to the viewer while talking to his employee Michael Anthony (fellow voice-artist Marvin Miller), on the dramatic series The Millionaire.|$|R
60|$|Uncle John laughed. He doubled up in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> {{and rocked}} <b>back</b> and forth, shaking his little round body {{as if he}} had met with the most amusing thing that had ever {{happened}} in his life. Aunt Jane stared at him, while Louise and Beth looked their astonishment, but Patsy's clear laughter rang above Uncle John's gasping chuckles.|$|R
60|$|Involuntarily {{making a}} pass with his wooden leg to guard himself as Mr Venus springs {{up in the}} {{emphasis}} of this unsociable declaration, Mr Wegg tilts over on <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> <b>chair</b> and all, and is rescued by that harmless misanthrope, in a disjointed state and ruefully rubbing his head.|$|R
60|$|He pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and, {{throwing}} one {{leg over}} the other, {{looked down at his}} patent-leather boots. The benevolent expression had disappeared.|$|E
60|$|He {{watched the}} two old men down the road, and then, moving <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> into the room, silently {{regarded}} the busy Kate.|$|E
60|$|Luke Standifer {{rose to his}} feet, {{and pushed}} <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back.</b> He looked rather perplexedly around the big office, with its {{handsome}} furniture.|$|E
60|$|Sheldon {{attempted}} to rise, got half {{up out of}} <b>his</b> <b>chair,</b> and fell <b>back</b> helplessly. He {{was surprised at the}} size of the men, who loomed like giants behind her. Both were six-footers, and they were heavy in proportion. He had never seen islanders like them. They were not black like the Solomon Islanders, but light brown; and their features were larger, more regular, and even handsome.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it'd be {{me for the}} dishwater an' the jellyfish, I guess." [...] He {{straightened}} up in <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> and threw <b>back</b> <b>his</b> shoulders unconsciously as he ran {{a hand over his}} biceps and swelled it. Then he took another look at Saxon. [...] "But thank the Lord I still got a wallop in both my arms an' a wife to fill 'em with love." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{municipal}} dignitary of San Francisco, {{although an}} erect, soldier-like man of strong middle age, was seated with <b>his</b> official <b>chair</b> tilted <b>back</b> {{against the wall}} and kept in position by his feet on the rungs of another, which in turn acted as a support for a second man, who was seated a few feet from him in an easy-chair. Both were lazily smoking.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Chalk {{collapsed}} and sat {{staring at her}} in dismay. Mr. Stobell, placing {{both hands on the}} table, pushed <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> and eyed her disagreeably.|$|E
6000|$|... "Take that plate away," [...] {{at last he}} said, {{getting up}} with an oath--and with this pushing <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back,</b> he walked into his own room.|$|E
60|$|Paul {{looked up}} suddenly, and drew <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> {{out of the}} firelight. For the first time, his mother noticed how pale and ghastly his face was.|$|E
6000|$|The postman left a letter. Richards glanced listlessly at the superscription and the post-mark--unfamiliar, both--and {{tossed the}} letter {{on the table}} and resumed his might-have-beens and his hopeless dull miseries where he had left them off. Two or three hours later his wife got wearily up and was going away to bed without a good-night--custom now--but she stopped near the letter and eyed it awhile with a dead interest, then broke it open, and began to skim it over. Richards, sitting there with <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> tilted <b>back</b> against the wall and his chin between his knees, heard {{something}} fall. It was his wife. He sprang to her side, but she cried out: ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{determined}} {{in accordance with}} my brother’s telegram to go away in the afternoon; so that, having various duties to perform, I left M. Pigeonneau to his ethnic studies. Among other things I went {{in the course of}} the morning to the banker’s, to draw money for my journey, and there I found Mr. Ruck with a pile of crumpled letters in <b>his</b> lap, <b>his</b> <b>chair</b> tipped <b>back</b> and <b>his</b> eyes gloomily fixed on the fringe of the green plush table-cloth. I timidly expressed the hope that he had got better news from home; whereupon he gave me a look in which, considering his provocation, the habit of forlorn patience was conspicuous.|$|R
6000|$|Caleb rose slowly, put <b>his</b> rocking <b>chair</b> <b>back</b> {{into its}} place, {{and went to}} the door. He looked down towards the bank of the brook before the house, and saw Dwight and David there. They had a {{wheelbarrow}} close {{to the edge of the}} water, with a few stones in it, some as big as Caleb's head. Each of the boys had a stone in his hand, which he was just throwing into the brook. Caleb had a great desire to go down and see what they were doing; but he felt weak and tired, and so, after looking on a moment, he said to himself, [...] "I had rather sit down here." [...] So he sat down upon the step of the door, and looked on.|$|R
