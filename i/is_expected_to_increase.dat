Rainfall from tropical cyclones affect the Albuquerque International Sunport an average of 3.9days per year. Storms affect New Mexico less than Arizona, and are generally weaker.

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> in line with inflation. This situation is aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, and <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments {{in the downtown area}} adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the downtown area had eased.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 200 {{parasitic}} Plasmodium {{species have}} been identified that infect birds, reptiles, and other mammals, and about 30 species naturally infect non-human primates. Some malaria parasites that affect non-human primates (NHP) serve as model organisms for human malarial parasites, such as P.coatneyi (a model for P.falciparum) and P.cynomolgi (P.vivax). Diagnostic techniques used to detect parasites in NHP {{are similar to those}} employed for humans. Malaria parasites that infect rodents are widely used as models in research, such as P.berghei. Avian malaria primarily affects species of the order Passeriformes, and poses a substantial threat to birds of Hawaii, the Galapagos, and other archipelagoes. The parasite P.relictum is known {{to play a role in}} limiting the distribution and abundance of endemic Hawaiian birds. Global warming <b>is</b> <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the prevalence and global distribution of avian malaria, as elevated temperatures provide optimal conditions for parasite reproduction.|$|E
