Fisker noted that the Karma {{would be the only}} car able to drive 50 miles on electric-only, and then proceed to drive as a regular car.

40|$|Purpose. High {{chromium}} {{cast irons}} with austenitic matrix have low machinability. The aim {{of work is}} search of new <b>energy-saving</b> <b>modes</b> of preliminary softening heat treatment enhancing the machinability of castings by forming an optimum microstructure. Methodology. Metallographic analysis, hardness testing and machinability testing are applied. Findings. It was found out that high temperature annealing with continuous cooling yields to martensite-austenite matrix in cast iron 270 Х 15 Г 2 Н 1 MPhT, which abruptly affects the machinability of cast iron. Significant improvement of machinability is achieved by forming of structure "ferrite + granular carbides" and by decline of hardness to 37 - 39 HRC {{in the case of}} two-stage isothermal annealing in the subcritical temperature range or by the use of quenching and tempering (two-step or cyclic). Originality. It was found that the formation of the optimal structure of the matrix and achievement of desired hardness level needed for improving machinability of high chromium cast iron containing 3 % austenite-forming elements, can be obtained: 1) due to pearlite original austenite followed by spherodization eutectoid carbides, and 2) by getting predominantly martensite structure followed by the decay of martensite and carbides coagulation at high-temperature tempering.

40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrate}} {{the use of}} electrical methods for evaluating the thermomechanical fatigue properties of patterned aluminum and copper interconnects on silicon-based substrates. Through a careful selection of alternating current frequency and current density, we used controlled Joule heating to simulate in an accelerated manner the type of low frequency thermal stress cycles that an interconnect structure may undergo. Sources of such stressing may include power cycling, <b>energy-saving</b> <b>modes,</b> or application-specific fluctuations, as opposed to stressing at chip operating frequencies. The thermal stresses are caused by differences in thermal expansion properties between the metal and constraining substrate or passivation. Test conditions included a frequency of 100 Hz and current density of 11 – 16 MA/cm 2, {{which led to a}} cyclic temperature amplitude of approximately 100 K, and corresponding cyclic stress amplitude in excess of 100 MPa for Al- 1 Si and Cu lines on oxidized silicon. The failure mechanism differs from that observed in direct current electromigration studies, and involves formation of localized plasticity, which causes topography changes on the less-constrained surfaces of the interconnect. Open circuit eventually took place by melting at a region of severely reduced cross-sectional area. In these studies, both Al- 1 Si and Cu responded to power cycling by deforming in a manner that was highly dependent upon variations in grain size and orientation. Isolated patches of damage appeared early within the confines of individual grains or clusters of grains, as determined by automated electron backscatter diffraction. With increased cycling or with increased current density, the extent of damage became more severe and widespread.

40|$|Purpose. In modern {{conditions}} of rolling stock operation, the actual vital task {{is the increasing}} the efficiency of its use by reducing the cost of energy, including for the traction. It {{can be achieved by}} the way of locomotives power control systems creating, in particular the use of operating cards and on-board software and hardware. Methodo-logy. The article discusses ways of starting and acceleration of the train. Traction calculations with the definition of energy-efficient trajectories provide the search of a rational consumption of energy with time of running trains. When selecting energy saving train trajectories and the development of operating trains of reference cards, it is necessary to consider the variables such as: the profile area, weight of the stock, series of the locomotive and others. When the transmission power from the primary power equipment to the driving wheel pairs the inevitable losses that are described by the efficiency factor occur. For the most part of the locomotive elements the dependences of the efficiency factor are described by the nonlinear equations. Getting the energy-saving function of traction control at starting and acceleration to reduce the specific consumption of energy by improving the algorithm for calculating the trajectories of multiple trains was considered. The method of selection of energy-efficient trajectories at dispersal trains and power control electric and diesel locomotives with electric transmission which bases on the mathematical methods for evenly search and parametric optimization was offered. Findings. For the variables of the train situation and rolling stock was built two-parameter functional dependence of the power control locomotive and analytically determined the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Originality. In the work result the authors received the power saving function of traction control, which depends on the mass of the rolling stock and slant.
