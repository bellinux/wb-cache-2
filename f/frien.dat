40|$|In this paper, I {{study the}} {{connectivity}} in MANETs. First a one-dimensional model is studied, where two points {{are placed on}} the ends of a straight line. Then extra nodes are added randomly. Then I derive an expression for the probability that the two endnodes are connected to each other, depending on the number of added nodes and the range of the signal of all nodes. This range is assumed to be the same for all nodes. The expression found is a simple recursive expression. The second model studied is a two-dimensional model, where nodes are added randomly on the plane. The technique used in the first model turns out not to work, so I use another technique. For the model on the infinite plane I show that there is a critical radius for the range of the signal of the nodes; only if the radius is larger than this critical value, there is a possibility of an infinitely large group of connected nodes. For the model in a finite square, I give the requirements for a certain fraction of the nodes inside the square to be connected. Also I give the rate of growth of the radius of the signal necessary to have full connectivity of all the nodes inside the square as the size of the square goes ot infinity. I end the paper with a discussion of the results, and some suggestions for further research. i Preface The BMI paper {{is one of the last}} parts of the BMI course.

We observed in vitro that while the B lymphocytes responded normally to mitogen, an intrinsic hyporeactivity to mitogens characterizes the T lymphocytes.

Morphologically, they closely resembled the tumor cells grown in vivo and, when transplanted back into mice, produced reticulum cell sarcomas indistinguishable {{from those of the}} original tumor line. After 32 passages in tissue culture, Friend virus could no longer be detected in the cells, nor could it be isolated from serially transplanted tumors during 10 subsequent passages in mice. The average number of cells required to produce tumors was lower for the virus-free tumor cells than the original tumor which was rich in virus. It is concluded that the virus plays little part in determination of either transplantability or virulence of the tumor, once the original transformation has occurred. -J Nat Cancer Inst 36 : 71 - 80, 1966.

These corrections include photonic bremsstrahlung from and vertex corrections to the lepton current of the order O(α) with soft photon exponentiation. A common treatment of these radiative corrections in several variables – leptonic, hadronic, mixed, Jaquet-Blondel variables – has been developed and double differential cross sections are calculated. In all sets of variables we use some structure functions, which depend on the hadronic variables and which {{do not have to}} be defined in the quark parton model.

Some investigators (1) have suggested that H- 2 linked resistance to virus-induced leukemogenesis may result from genetically controlled variation in immune response to virus-induced antigens.

My topic is J. L. Schellenberg on propositional faith. 1 In what follows, I will state his account and, in that sacred tradition among friends, develop three complaints about it. Finally, I’ll sketch an alternative that avoids those complaints and coheres better with its primary aims. Before I get down to work, three preliminaries are in order. First, propositional faith is a propositional attitude expressed by typical uses of ‘faith that p’, where p takes declarative sentences as instances, e. g. ‘She has faith that they’ll work out their difficulties’. Whenever I speak of ‘the object of faith ’ I will mean either the proposition or the state of affairs reported by it. Second, we sometimes say things of the form ‘S has faith in x’, where x takes a name of a person or some other entity as instances, as in ‘She has faith in her husband’.
