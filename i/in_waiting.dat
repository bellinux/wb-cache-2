5|$|On the {{accession}} of Queen Victoria, {{he took up}} {{roles in}} the Royal Household, becoming a groom-in-waiting on 27 July 1837, and {{taking part in the}} coronation procession the following year. He still retained his army commission, and progressed steadily in rank through his retirement, becoming a major-general on 23 November 1841, lieutenant-general on 11 November 1851, and full general on 14 August 1859; on 1 September 1848, he took the colonelcy of the 83rd (County of Dublin) Regiment of Foot. In 1855, he accompanied the young Prince Alfred to Geneva to supervise his studies there. In 1858 he was appointed a member of the Royal Commission set up to look into the functioning of the militia. He resigned his role as groom <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> on 18 November 1859, because of ill-health; he was appointed an extra groom <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> on 28 March 1860, and promoted Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 18 May 1860.|$|E
5|$|During {{the month}} of {{separation}} from their parents and sister, Tatiana, Olga, Anastasia, and ladies <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> busied themselves sewing precious stones and jewelry into their clothing, hoping to hide them from their captors, since Alexandra had written she, Nicholas and Maria had been heavily searched upon arrival in Ekaterinburg, and items confiscated. A letter from Demidova to Tegleva gave the {{instructions on how to}} deal with the 'medicines', a predetermined code name for the jewels. The concealments were successful, as the Bolsheviks were never aware of the jewels in the clothes until after the executions.|$|E
5|$|On another {{occasion}} during the war, when the lady <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> who usually {{picked them up}} from the hospital was detained and sent a carriage without an attendant, Tatiana and her sister Olga decided to go shopping for the first time. They ordered the carriage to stop near a group of shops and went {{into one of the}} stores, where they were unrecognized because of their nurses' uniforms. They came back out without buying anything when they realized they did not have money with them and wouldn't have known how to use it even if they did. The next day they asked Chebotareva how to use money.|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Strategic {{customers}} {{take their}} waiting time into consideration upon making decisions. While satisfactorily completed service increases utility of a customer, {{waiting to be}} served decreases this utility in a queueing type service system. <b>In</b> this system, <b>waiting</b> can be classified into two: <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> and <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Unlike the literature, proposed model assumes <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> a queue, while other customers are being served, differs from <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> service where the former one decreases the utility of a customer more. This paper analyzes decision making of a customer under this assumption. Comparing decision of the customer under proposed assumption and literature assumption, this paper shows that <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting</b> differs <b>in</b> service <b>waiting.</b> Index Term [...] Strategic customer, M/M/ 1, <b>in</b> queue <b>waiting,</b> <b>in</b> service <b>waiting,</b> observable queues, unobservable queue...|$|R

In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to Odonata that signify the impossibility of immortality. Among the Aborigines of Australia of the Arrernte language groups, honey ants and witchety grubs served as personal clan totems.

5|$|Some viruses {{store their}} entire genomes {{in the form}} of RNA, and contain no DNA at all. Because they use RNA to store genes, their {{cellular}} hosts may synthesize their proteins as soon as they are infected and without the delay <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> for transcription. On the other hand, RNA retroviruses, such as HIV, require the reverse transcription of their genome from RNA into DNA before their proteins can be synthesized. RNA-mediated epigenetic inheritance has also been observed in plants and very rarely in animals.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{deployed}} his smaller army <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> near Bryennios's camp, {{and divided}} {{it in two}} commands. The left, which confronted Bryennios's strongest division, was commanded by himself and contained the Frankish knights {{to the right and}} the Immortals to the Franks' left. The right command was under Constantine Katakalon, and comprised the Chomatenoi and the Turks. The latter, according to the Alexiad, were given the role of flank guard (plagiophylakes) and tasked with observing and countering the Pechenegs. Conversely, on the extreme left Alexios formed his own flanking detachment (apparently drawn from among the Immortals), concealed from enemy view inside a hollow. Given his inferiority, Alexios was forced to remain on the defensive. His only chance at success was that his out-flankers, concealed by the broken terrain, would surprise and create enough confusion among Bryennios's men for him and his strong left wing to break through their lines.|$|E

5|$|Insects have {{appeared}} in mythology around the world from ancient times. Among the insect groups featuring in myths are the bee, butterfly, cicada, dragonfly, praying mantis and scarab beetle. Scarab beetles held religious and cultural symbolism in Old Egypt, Greece and some shamanistic Old World cultures. The ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth or immortality. In Mesopotamian literature, the epic poem of Gilgamesh has allusions to dragonflies, signifying the impossibility of immortality.

5|$|McKellen and {{his first}} partner, Brian Taylor, a history teacher from Bolton, began their {{relationship}} in 1964. Their relationship lasted for eight years, ending in 1972. They lived in London, where McKellen continued to pursue his career as an actor. For over a decade, he has lived in a five-storey Victorian conversion in Narrow Street, Limehouse. In 1978 he met his second partner, Sean Mathias, at the Edinburgh Festival. This relationship lasted until 1988, and acording to Mathias, was tempestuous, with conflicts over McKellen's success in acting versus Mathias's somewhat less-successful career. Mathias later directed McKellen <b>in</b> <b>Waiting</b> for Godot at the Theatre Royal Haymarket in 2009. The pair entered into a business partnership with Evgeny Lebedev, purchasing the lease on The Grapes public house in Narrow Street.|$|E
5|$|Tsarina Alexandra chose Maria to {{accompany}} Tsar Nicholas II and herself to Yekaterinburg {{when the family}} was briefly separated in April 1918. Maria had grown from a child to a woman {{during the years of}} captivity, according to the Baroness Sophie Buxhoevden, a lady <b>in</b> <b>waiting,</b> and the Tsarina felt she could depend upon her third daughter to help her as she could not rely upon the deeply depressed Olga or Anastasia, who was still a child. Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother. They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later.|$|E

5|$|While {{the guest}} of the Count Marshal Munnich at St. Petersburg, Winterfeldt fell in love with, and married, his cousin Julie von Maltzahn, who was also the marshal's {{stepdaughter}} and a lady <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> to the grand duchess Elizabeth of Russia. On returning to Prussia he became an intimate of the crown prince, afterwards Frederick the Great, whom he later accompanied in the Rhine campaign of 1734. This intimacy, in view of his personal relations with the king, made Winterfeldt's position very difficult, for Frederick William and his son were badly estranged over the Katte Affair; eventually the prince was brought before a court-martial by his father, on the charge of attempting to desert, and was condemned to death. Winterfeldt remained the prince's constant friend through all these troubles, and on Frederick II's accession, {{he was promoted to}} major and appointed aide-de-camp to the new sovereign.|$|E
5|$|For aristocrats {{to succeed}} in private and public life during the Heian period, it was {{essential}} to be fluent in the composition and appreciation of waka, as well as having thorough knowledge of and ability in music, and calligraphy. Poetry was used in witty conversations, in notes of invitation, thanks or condolence, and for correspondence between friends and lovers. Some of the finest poetry of the Heian period came from the middle-class court society such as ladies <b>in</b> <b>waiting</b> or middle-rank officials. Uta-awase poetry contests, in which poets composed poetry on a given theme to be judged by an individual, were held from 885 onwards, and became a regular activity for Heian courtiers from the 10th century onward. Contest judgments led to works about waka theory and critical studies. Poems from the contents were added to imperial anthologies. Critical theories, and the poems in the anthologies (particularly the Kokinshū), {{became the basis for}} judgments in the contests. Utaawase continued to be held through the late-11th century, as social rather than literary events. Held in opulence in a spirit of friendly rivalry, they included chanters, scribes, consultants, musicians, and an audience. During the Heian period, waka were often collected in large anthologies, such as the Man'yōshū or Kokinshū, or smaller private collections of the works of a single poet. Waka also featured highly in all kinds of literary prose works including monogatari, diaries and historical works. The Tale of Genji alone contains 800 waka.|$|E
5|$|One of the Sinhala legends tells {{that when}} Skanda-Kumara moved to Sri Lanka, {{he asked for}} refuge from Tamils. The Tamils refused, {{and he came to}} live with the Sinhalese in Kataragama. As a penance for their refusal, the deity forced Tamils to indulge in body {{piercing}} and fire walking in his annual festival. This legend tries to explain the location of the shrine as well as the traditional patterns of worship by Tamils. Another Sinhala legends attests that Kataragama deviyo was the deity worshiped by Dutugamunu in the 1st century BCE, before his war with Ellalan, and that Dutugamunu had the shrine erected to Skanda-Kumara at Kataragama after his victory. This legend has no corroboration in the Mahavamsa, the historic annals about Dutugamunu. Another Sinhala legend makes Kataragama deviyo a deification of a Tamil spy sent by Elara to live amongst the Sinhalese or a Tamil juggler who made the locals deify him after his death. Yet another legend says that Kataragama deviyo is a deification of the legendary king Mahasena, who is born as a bodhisattva or Buddha <b>in</b> <b>waiting.</b> Anthropologists Richard Gombrich and Gananath Obeyesekere were able to identify new strands of these legends and the originators of these legends since the 1970s, with the burgeoning popularity of the shrine and its deity amongst the Sinhala Buddhists.|$|E

5000|$|In {{criminal}} law, lying <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> {{refers to}} the act of hiding and waiting for an individual {{with the intent to}} kill that person or inflict serious bodily harm to that person. Because lying <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> involves premeditation, some jurisdictions have established that lying <b>in</b> <b>wait</b> is considered an aggravating circumstance that allows for the imposition of harsher criminal penalties. Scholars have traced the origins of this doctrine as far back as 1389, when the English Parliament passed a law that denied the right of pardon to individuals who killed while lying <b>in</b> <b>wait.</b> <b>In</b> 1794, Pennsylvania passed a law that defined first degree murder as [...] "all murder which shall be perpetrated ... by lying in wait". Many states modeled their penal codes after the Pennsylvania law, but {{by the beginning of the}} twenty first century, only four states identified [...] "lying in wait" [...] as a [...] "death qualifying act".|$|R
