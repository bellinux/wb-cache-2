40|$|The ways {{in which}} water {{molecules}} bind to DNA are studied {{with the aid of}} thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC) measurements of hydrated solid DNA samples and dilute aqueous solutions, in the temperature range of 80 - 300 K. The first two peaks of the recorded spectrum are interpreted on the basis of free water and loosely bound water dipole reorientation, respectively. It is shown that water sorbed up to at least 25 % w/w is irrotationally bound to the DNA molecule.

40|$|Carbon {{sputtering}} is {{a promising}} technology for making resistive electrodes for MPGDs (Micro Pattern Gaseous Detectors). The {{research on this}} technology started {{in the context of}} the devel-opment of MicroMEGAS detectors for the ATLAS muon system upgrade. By sputtering carbon layers of varying thickness (a few hundred to a few thousand angstrom) and doping the nitrogen, the surface resistivity can be controlled between 50 kΩ/sq. and 4 GΩ/sq. Several small (10 10 cm 2) and medium size foils (50 100 cm 2) have been produced and successfully tested. The car-bon layer is deposited on thin (25 to 50 µm) <b>insulating</b> <b>foils</b> (e. g., Kapton) by sputtering resulting in a good uniformity (< 30 %) of the resistivity. Extremely fine electrodes structures (< 50 µm) can be achieved using the liftoff process technique. The foils produced so far are extremely robust with respect to mechanical and chemical damage. We report on the fabrication technique and the performance in operating detectors. Given the positive experience with MicroMEGAS detectors we also address other possible applications that could be interesting for MPGD detectors, e. g. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{interaction}} of ion beams with insulators leads to charging-up phenomena, which at present are under investigation {{in connection with}} guiding phenomena in nanocapillaries with possible application in nanofocused beams. We studied the charging dynamics of <b>insulating</b> <b>foil</b> targets [Mylar, polypropylene (PP) ] irradiated with swift ion beams (C, O, Ag, and Xe at 40, 23, 40, and 30 MeV/u, respectively) via the measurement of the slowing down of fast binary-encounter electrons. Also, sandwich targets (Mylar covered with a thin Au layer on both surfaces) and Mylar with Au on only one surface were used. Fast-electron spectra were measured by the time-of-flight method at the superconducting cyclotron of Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) Catania. The charge buildup leads to target-material-dependent potentials {{of the order of}} 6. 0 kV for Mylar and 2. 8 kV for PP. The sandwich targets, surprisingly, show the same behavior as the insulating targets, whereas a single Au layer on the electron and ion exit side strongly suppresses the charging phenomenon. The accumulated number of projectiles needed for charging up is inversely proportional to electronic energy loss. Thus, the charging up is directly related to emission of secondary electrons...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFast {{electron}} transport in {{matter is}} a key issue for assessing the feasibility of fast ignition; however several important points are not clear yet. Therefore we realized an experiment with ultra-intense lasers (≤ 6 10 ^ 19 W cm^− 2) studying transport in metallic (Al) and <b>insulating</b> (CH) <b>foil</b> targets. The dynamics of fast electron propagation versus target thickness was investigated by optical self-emission from targets rear side. In Al targets we distinguished two-components in the fast electron population: moderately relativistic electrons and a highly collimated micro-bunched relativistic tail. A large ohmic heating {{at the rear of}} the thinner targets was observed due to the background return current. In CH, optical emission is mainly due to the Cherenkov effect and is much larger than in Al. We also observed that in insulators the fast-electron beam undergoes strong filamentation and the number of filaments increases with thickness. This behaviour was attributed to an ionization front instability...|$|R

A metal stylus driven by a screw thread traveled {{across the surface of the}} cylinder as it turned, tracing out a path over the foil. Each time the stylus crossed the insulating ink, the current through the foil to the stylus was interrupted. At the receiver, a similar pendulum-driven stylus marked chemically treated paper with an electric current as the receiving cylinder rotated.|$|R

All of the insulation materials tested (insulation board, fiberglass batt, rockwool, beadboard, and vermiculite) sustained significant levels of damage as measured by increased thermal conductance. Researchers have yet to discover an insulative material that is not susceptible to house mouse damage.

40|$|The Gas Electron Multiplier {{consist of}} a thin Kapton <b>insulating</b> (50 μm) <b>foil</b> {{copper-clad}} {{on both sides and}} perforated by a high density, regular matrix of holes (around 100 per square millimeter). Typically the distance between holes (pitch) is 140 μm and diameters of about 70 μm. The mesh is realised by conventional photolitographic methods as used for the fabrication of multi-layer board. Upon application of a potential difference between the GEM electrodes, a high dipole field develops in the holes focusing the field lines between the drift electrode and the readout element. Electron drift along the channel and the charge is amplified by a factor that depends on the field density and the length of the channel. Owing to their excellent position resolution and rate capability GEM-based detector are very suitable to be used in different applications: from the high energy physics to the medical field. The GEM temporal and rate gain stability was studied and it was discovered that the gain variations are not more than 20...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new and {{advanced}} methodology for finding the optimum electrical design of high voltage ac capacitive graded bushings using an improved genetic algorithm approach as an effective meta-heuristic method. A case study has been conducted on a 145 kV oil impregnated paper (OIP) bushing and the IEC 60137 tests have been performed to evaluate its performance. Condenser bushings contain concentric conductive foils which are isolated from each other. The partial capacitances between conducting cylinders can be modified by adjusting the number, diameter, place and length of these cylinders {{as well as the}} thickness of <b>insulating</b> material between <b>foils.</b> As a result, the voltage drop and also the electrical stress in the core and along the surface will change.

The proposed method of this research work has been applied to a 145 kV OIP bushing. The performance of optimal designed 145 kV OIP bushing under IEC 60137 tests is very promising...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{assessment}} {{of the potential for}} dew water to serve as a potable water source during a rainless season in a humid tropical climate was carried out in the Pacific islands of French Polynesia. The climate of these islands, in terms of diurnal and seasonal variations, wind and energy balance, is representative of the climate of the tropical Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Measurements were obtained at two characteristic sites of this region; a mountainous island (Punaauia, Tahiti Island) and an atoll (Tikehau, Tuamotu Archipelago). Dew was measured daily on a 30 ° tilted, 1 m 2 plane collector equipped with a thermally <b>insulated</b> radiative <b>foil.</b> In addition, an electronic balance placed at 1 m above the ground with a horizontal 0. 16 m 2 condensing plate made of PolyTetraFluoroEthylene (Teflon) was used in Tahiti. Dew volume data, taken during the dry season from 16 / 5 / 2005 to 14 / 10 / 2005, were correlated with air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, cloud cover and visible plus infrared radiometer measurements. The data were also fitted to a model. Dew formation in such a tropical climate is characterized by high absolute humidity, weak nocturnal temperature drop and strong Trade winds. These winds prevent dew from forming unless protected e. g. by natural vegetal windbreaks. In protected areas, dew can then form with winds as large as 7 m/s. Such strong winds also hamper at night the formation near the ground of a calm and cold air layer with high relative humidity. As the cooling power is lower than in the Mediterranean islands because of the high absolute humidity of the atmosphere, both effects combine to generate modest dew yields. However, dew events are frequent and provide accumulated amounts of water attractive for dew water harvesting. Slight modifications of existing rain collection devices on roofs can enhance dew formation and collection. Dew harvesting thus appears as an attractive possibility to provide the local population with a complementary - but on occasion, essential - water resourc...|$|R
