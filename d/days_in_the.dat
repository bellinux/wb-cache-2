5|$|A Television Infrared Observation Satellite (TIROS) {{revealed}} {{the presence of}} a tropical disturbance east of the Leeward Islands on September28.

Approaching the Lesser Antilles, the system curved northwestward between two high pressure areas on September30 and avoided landfall in the islands. By October2, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Daisy. The trough dissipated on the following day, causing Daisy to resume its initial west-northwest motion. The storm intensified into a Category1 hurricane later on October3. Further deepening occurred, and by October5, Daisy became a Category2 hurricane.|$|E
