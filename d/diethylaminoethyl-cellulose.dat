40|$|Purified prorennin {{appeared}} to be homogeneous when subjected to chromatography on a <b>Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> and to electrophoreses in starch-urea-gel. Crystalline rennin was heterogeneous, and was resolved into six components when analyzed electrophoretically. When crystalline rennin was chromatographed on a column of <b>Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> two distinguishable peaks were observed which corresponded to B- and C-rennin. Unlike crystalline rennin, rennin freshly activated at pH 2. 0 or 5. 0 was essentially homogeneous. Rennin resulting from activation at pH 2. 0 and 5. 0 {{appeared to}} be different. Rennin activated at pH 5. 0 was eluted faster from <b>Diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> column, and moved slightly faster in starch-urea-gel electrophoresis, than rennin activated at pH 2. 0. Amino acid analysis showed that rennin activated at pH 2. 0 had more arginine and less proline than that activated at pH 5. 0. This could be accounted for the differences in chromatographic and electrophoretic behavior of these rennins. Crystalline rennin exhibited more resistance to urea denaturation than prorennin. This suggested a fundamental difference in their secondary or (and) tertiary structures. It also showed the importance of intramolecular H-bonding for enzyme activity. An increase in crystalline rennin components was accompanied its prolonged exposure to 6 M urea. This {{was not the case}} with prorennin...|$|E
40|$|The {{nonionic}} detergent Triton X- 100 {{was used}} to extract antigens of rubella virus from infected tissue culture cells. Three virus-specific antigens were demonstrated by crossed immunoelectrophoresis by using a pool of human gamma globulin as antiserum. The most dominant of these antigens were purified by ion-exchange chromatography on <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose.</b> This antigen was of glucoprotein nature and had slow electrophoretic motility and low binding capacity to <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose.</b> Thus, {{it seems likely that}} the antigen is identical with the precipitating antigen of rubella virus designated b-antigen or tro-osmophoresis with precipiting antibody in sera obtained from patients recovering from acute postnatal rubella. The precipitin reaction that could be correlated to the hemaglutination-inhibition titers of the same sera appeared 12 days after onset of the disease and remained positive for several years...|$|E
40|$|Clostridium botulinum type F toxin of {{proteolytic}} Langeland strain was purified. Toxin {{in whole}} cultures was precipitated with (NH 4) 2 SO 4. Extract of the precipitate was successively chromatographed on <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> at pH 6. 0, O-(carboxymethyl) cellulose at pH 4. 9, Sephadex G- 200 at pH 8. 1, quaternary aminoethyl-Sephadex at pH 4. 9, and finally <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> at pH 8. 1. The procedure recovered 14 % of the toxin assayed {{in the starting}} culture. The toxin was homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, double gel diffusion serology, and isoelectric focusing. Purified toxin had a molecular weight of 150, 000 by gel filtration and 155, 000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Specific toxicity was 9. 6 × 106 mean lethal doses per absorbancy (278 nm) unit. Sub-units of 105, 000 and 56, 000 molecular weight are found when purified toxin is treated with a disulfide reducing agent and electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Reciprocal cross neutralizations were demonstrated when purified type F and E toxins were reacted with antitoxins which were obtained with immunizing toxoids prepared with purified toxins...|$|E
40|$|Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in lysates of both completent and noncompetent {{streptococcus}} pneumoniae cells {{was characterized}} by chromatography on benzoylated, naphthoylated <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> columns, by sensitivity to Aspergillus oryzae S 1 endonuclease, and by sucrose gradient analysis. The DNAs from both competent and noncompetent cells were found to contain similar extents of single-stranded regions. These single-stranded regions appeared to be intact, unpaired regions in double-stranded DNA rather than gaps, nicks, or unpaired ends in the DNA. Inhibition of cells with rifampin prior to lysis increased the amount of such single strandedness in the DNA. Lysates made at various times after [14 C]thymidine-labeled cells had bound [3 H]thymidine-labeled transforming DNA were also characterized by benzoylated, naphthoylated <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> chromatography. Changes in the elution profiles of DNA from cells exposed to homospecific (S. pneumoniae) donor DNA were indicative {{of the formation of}} complexes between donor DNA and the single-stranded regions of recipient DNA. In contrast, profiles of DNA from cells exposed to heterospecific (S. sanguis) DNA did not show significant changes, indicating that few such donor-recipient complexes were formed during heterospecific transformation...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of endoproteolytic activity with purified ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (RuBPCase) from barley (Hordeum vulgare var Numar) leaves was investigated. RuBPCase purified by chromatography on agarose gel and <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> {{was free of}} associated endoproteolytic activity. The addition of leupeptin and casein to the extraction buffer completely eliminated proteolysis during initial extraction of RuBPCase. Endoproteolytic activity previously found associated with RuBPCase was identified as being due to contamination of endoproteinases from broken vacuoles...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{purification}} and structural {{determination of the}} mannolipid shown previously (Ericson and Delmer 1977 Plant Physiol 59 : 341 - 347) {{to serve as an}} intermediate in glycoprotein synthesis in cotyledons of Phaseolus vulgaris. The mannolipid was purified by chromatography in organic solvents on <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose,</b> followed by repeated steps of deacylation and rechromatography on Sephadex LH- 20. Binding and elution behavior on <b>diethylaminoethyl-cellulose</b> was consistent with the presence of a monophosphate residue. Lability of the mannolipid to mild acid treatment as well as its resistance to hot phenol treatment or catalytic hydrogenation are consistent with the structure of a polyprenol having a saturated α-residue. After methanolysis, the chloroform-methanol-soluble portion of the mannolipid was analyzed by mass spectrometry. The fragmentation pattern obtained was nearly identical to that obtained from standard dolichol-phosphate. An intense ion at m/e 69 represented the ω-terminal isoprenoid residue, and repeating fragments separated by 68 mass units were observed up to m/e of > 1, 200. All evidence supports the conclusion that the mannolipid is dolichol-monophosphate-mannose and thus provides further support for the concept that the processes involved in the glycosylation of protein in higher plants are similar to those known to occur in the animal kingdom...|$|E

The inactivating factor was activated by heating at 50 to 60 C, but was itself thermolabile and lost activity on heating to 70 to 100 C. The mechanism of the Arrhenius effect, observed with crude hemolysin of V. parahaemolyticus, is as follows. At 50 to 60 C, the temperature-dependent inactivating factor associated with hemolysin inactivates the hemolysin, whereas at 80 to 100 C the crude hemolysin retains activity because at this temperature the factor is inactivated...|$|E
