5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. <b>Drug-resistant</b> TB is a serious public health issue in many developing countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively <b>drug-resistant</b> TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally <b>drug-resistant</b> TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple <b>drug-resistant</b> TB.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{synthetic}} peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) {{was found to}} inhibit the expression of New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase, an enzyme that many <b>drug-resistant</b> bacteria use to destroy carbapenems.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is usually}} treated with daily {{medication}} once a second seizure has occurred, while {{in those at}} high risk, medication may be started after the first seizure. Supporting people's self management of their condition may be useful. In <b>drug-resistant</b> cases different management options may be looked at including a special diet, the implantation of a neurostimulator, or neurosurgery.|$|E
5|$|If {{tuberculosis}} recurs, {{testing to}} determine which antibiotics it is sensitive to is important before determining treatment. If multiple <b>drug-resistant</b> TB (MDR-TB) is detected, treatment with at least four effective antibiotics for 18 to 24months is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory {{tests show}} that fruit bodies have {{antimicrobial}} activity against several strains of <b>drug-resistant</b> bacteria that are pathogenic in humans. Extracts inhibit {{the growth of}} the Gram-negative bacteria Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes, and kill the Gram-positive species Pasteurella multocida, Streptococcus agalactiae and S.pyogenes. A separate study demonstrated growth inhibition against Proteus vulgaris.|$|E
5|$|RSTs {{may also}} have a public health benefit. In {{addition}} to undesirable side-effects in the individual, inappropriate antibiotic use is thought {{to contribute to the}} development of <b>drug-resistant</b> strains of bacteria. By helping to identify bacterial infection, RSTs may help to limit the use of antibiotics in viral illnesses, where they are not beneficial.|$|E
5|$|With {{the onset}} of <b>drug-resistant</b> Plasmodium parasites, new {{strategies}} are being developed to combat the widespread disease. One such approach lies in the introduction of synthetic pyridoxal-amino acid adducts, which are {{taken up by the}} parasite and ultimately interfere with its ability to create several essential B vitamins. Antimalarial drugs using synthetic metal-based complexes are attracting research interest.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{emergence}} of MDR-TB, surgery has been re-introduced for certain cases of TB infections. It involves removal of infected chest cavities ("bullae") in the lungs {{to reduce the number of}} bacteria and to increase exposure of the remaining bacteria to antibiotics in the bloodstream. Hopes of completely eliminating TB were ended with the rise of <b>drug-resistant</b> strains in the 1980s. The subsequent resurgence of tuberculosis resulted in the declaration of a global health emergency by the World Health Organization in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics {{over a long period of}} time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple <b>drug-resistant</b> tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E
5|$|Artemisinin is a {{sesquiterpene}} lactone {{containing a}} peroxide group, which {{is believed to}} be essential for its anti-malarial activity. Its derivatives, artesunate and artemether, have been used in clinics since 1987 for the treatment of <b>drug-resistant</b> and drug-sensitive malaria, especially cerebral malaria. These drugs are characterized by fast action, high efficacy and good tolerance. They kill the asexual forms of P. berghei and P. cynomolgi and have transmission-blocking activity. In 1985, Zhou Yiqing and his team combined artemether and lumefantrine into a single tablet, which was registered as a medicine in China in 1992. Later it became known as “Coartem”. Artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs) are now widely used to treat uncomplicated falciparum malaria, but access to ACTs is still limited in most malaria-endemic countries and only a minority of the patients who need artemisinin-based combination treatments receive them.|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is indicated}} as an adjunctive (additional) treatment {{in children with}} <b>drug-resistant</b> epilepsy. It is approved by national clinical guidelines in Scotland, England and Wales and reimbursed by nearly all US insurance companies. Children with a focal lesion (a single point of brain abnormality causing the epilepsy) who would make suitable candidates for surgery {{are more likely to}} become seizure-free with surgery than with the ketogenic diet. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence advises that the diet should not be recommended for adults with epilepsy. About a third of epilepsy centres that offer the ketogenic diet also offer a dietary therapy to adults. Some clinicians consider the two less restrictive dietary variants—the low glycaemic index treatment and the modified Atkins diet—to be more appropriate for adolescents and adults. A liquid form of the ketogenic diet is particularly easy to prepare for, and well tolerated by, infants on formula and children who are tube-fed.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species of}} the genus Ramaria, R.botrytis was first {{described}} scientifically in 1797 by mycologist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. A widely distributed species, it is found in North America, North Africa, central and eastern Europe, Australia, and Asia. The fungus is mycorrhizal with broadleaf trees, and fruits {{on the ground in}} wooded areas. There are several species of coral fungi that are superficially similar in appearance to R.botrytis, and although comparison of habitat or characteristics like color or branching morphology is often sufficient for identification, sometimes microscopy is required to definitively distinguish between them. Fruit bodies of Ramaria botrytis are edible, and young specimens have a mild, fruity taste. Some authors warn of laxative effects in susceptible individuals. The fungus contains several chemical compounds with in vitro biological activity, and fruit bodies have antimicrobial activity against several species and strains of <b>drug-resistant</b> bacteria that cause disease in humans.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis is the second-most {{common cause}} of death from {{infectious}} disease (after those due to HIV/AIDS). The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while new cases have decreased since 2002. China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. The number of new cases has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014. Tuberculosis {{is more common in}} developing countries; about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the US population test positive. Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of <b>drug-resistant</b> cases in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In humans, {{cells with}} location-specific firing {{patterns}} {{have been reported}} during a study of patients with <b>drug-resistant</b> epilepsy. They were undergoing an invasive procedure to localize {{the source of their}} seizures, with a view to surgical resection. The patients had diagnostic electrodes implanted in their hippocampus and then used a computer to move around in a virtual reality town. Similar brain imaging studies in navigation have shown the hippocampus to be active. A study was carried out on taxi drivers. London’s black cab drivers need to learn the locations {{of a large number of}} places and the fastest routes between them in order to pass a strict test known as The Knowledge in order to gain a license to operate. A study showed that the posterior part of the hippocampus is larger in these drivers than in the general public, and that a positive correlation exists between the length of time served as a driver and the increase in the volume of this part. It was also found the total volume of the hippocampus was unchanged, as the increase seen in the posterior part was made at the expense of the anterior part, which showed a relative decrease in size. There have been no reported adverse effects from this disparity in hippocampal proportions.|$|E
25|$|Ketamine, an NMDA {{antagonist}} drug, {{can be used}} as a {{last resort}} for <b>drug-resistant</b> status epilepticus.|$|E
25|$|Twenty {{well-known}} diseases—including tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and cholera—have reemerged or spread geographically since 1973, {{often in}} more virulent and <b>drug-resistant</b> forms.|$|E
25|$|Epilepsia partialis {{continua}} is {{a variant}} involving hour-, day-, or even week-long jerking. It {{is a consequence}} of vascular disease, tumors, or encephalitis, and is <b>drug-resistant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Patients {{who take}} their TB {{treatment}} in an irregular and unreliable way are at greatly {{increased risk of}} treatment failure, relapse {{and the development of}} <b>drug-resistant</b> TB strains.|$|E
25|$|Various {{degrees of}} {{intensity}} and locations of epilepsy {{are associated with}} malformations of cortical development. Researchers suggest that approximately 40% of children diagnosed with <b>drug-resistant</b> epilepsy have some degree of cortical malformation.|$|E
25|$|The plague {{bacterium}} {{could develop}} drug-resistance and again {{become a major}} health threat. One case of a <b>drug-resistant</b> form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995. Further outbreaks in Madagascar were reported in November 2014 and October 2017.|$|E
25|$|It is {{essential}} that assessment to rule out active TB is carried out before treatment for LTBI is started. To give LTBI treatment to someone with active TB is a serious error: the TB will not be adequately treated {{and there is a}} risk of developing <b>drug-resistant</b> strains of TB.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{treatment}} methods include insecticides, {{the use of}} antibiotics, and a plague vaccine. The plague bacterium could develop drug resistance and again become a major health threat. One case of a <b>drug-resistant</b> form of the bacterium was found in Madagascar in 1995. A further outbreak in Madagascar was reported in November 2014.|$|E
25|$|The cost of {{antiretroviral}} drugs—which can {{prolong the}} lives of infected people—has plunged in recent years but still may be prohibitively high for low-income countries. More importantly, the drug costs are {{only a portion of}} HIV/AIDS treatment costs. <b>Drug-resistant</b> strains are likely to spread because of the inconsistent use of antiretroviral therapies and the manufacture overseas of unregulated, substandard drugs.|$|E
25|$|Multidrug-resistant and {{extremely}} <b>drug-resistant</b> Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) {{is responsible for}} the spread of tuberculosis in South African hospitals. Test strains of Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and MTB were isolated from South African patients at a hospital's intensive care unit in order to establish the minimum in-vitro copper concentrations to produce sterilization against these microbes and yeast. Acinetobacter baumannii was isolated from a patient in a burn unit and two clinical strains of MTB were collected and tested.|$|E
25|$|Aminoglycosides (STM, {{capreomycin}} and amikacin) {{should be}} avoided in patients with mild to severe kidney problems because of the increased risk of damage to the kidneys. If the use of aminoglycosides cannot be avoided (e.g., in treating <b>drug-resistant</b> TB) then serum levels must be closely monitored and the patient warned to report any side-effects (deafness in particular). If patient have end-stage renal failure and have no useful remaining kidney function, then aminoglycosides can be used, but only if drug levels can be easily measured (often only amikacin levels can be measured).|$|E
25|$|Most {{changes in}} {{cellular}} metabolism that allow cells {{to grow in}} a disorderly fashion lead to cell death. However once cancer begins, cancer cells undergo a process of natural selection: the few cells with new genetic changes that enhance their survival or reproduction continue to multiply, and soon come to dominate the growing tumor, as cells with less favorable genetic change are out-competed. This is exactly how pathogens such as MRSA can become antibiotic-resistant (or how HIV can become <b>drug-resistant),</b> and the same reason why crop blights and pests can become pesticide-resistant. This evolution is why cancer recurrences will have cells that have acquired cancer-drug resistance (or in some cases, resistance to radiation from radiotherapy).|$|E
25|$|Hundreds of ABC {{transporters}} {{have been}} characterized from both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. ABC genes {{are essential for}} many processes in the cell, and mutations in human genes cause or contribute to several human genetic diseases. Forty eight ABC genes {{have been reported in}} humans. Among these, many have been characterized and shown to be causally related to diseases present in humans such as cystic fibrosis, adrenoleukodystrophy, Stargardt disease, <b>drug-resistant</b> tumors, Dubin-Johnson syndrome, Byler’s disease, progressive familiar intrahepatic cholestasis, X-linked sideroblastic anemia, ataxia, and persistent and hyperinsulimenic hypoglycemia. ABC transporters are also involved in multiple drug resistance, and this is how some of them were first identified. When the ABC transport proteins are overexpressed in cancer cells, they can export anticancer drugs and render tumors resistant.|$|E
25|$|The {{inadequate}} {{control of}} tuberculosis {{can be linked}} to a malfunctioning health system. From 1978 to 2002, the government's share of total health expenditure fell from 32% to 16%. This reduction forced many Chinese health-care facilities and providers to focus on the generation of revenue, with little concern for public health. Hospitals and clinics essentially functioned (and continue to function) as for-profit entities. In 2000, nearly 90% of patients with tuberculosis initiated their diagnostic and treatment process in hospitals and non-public health-care facilities, where they were given tests and drugs as long as they could pay. Many patients who improved or ran out of money discontinued treatment. Thus, only 20% of patients with tuberculosis treated outside the public health system took their tuberculosis medications regularly in 2000. Such irregular treatment breeds <b>drug-resistant</b> tuberculosis.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} diagnostic tools {{will include}} the use of LED microscopes and DNA-based diagnosis. Using LEDs rather than standard phosphorescent lights in microscopes forms a clearer image and improves TB detection rates in patients' sputum from 50 to 65 per cent. And DNA testing, which can determine which strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are present in sputum has 98 per cent accuracy and can be used to detect <b>drug-resistant</b> strains in as little as a day. DNA-based diagnosis is also cost-effective. As well as diagnosis, new management methods such as mobile phone text messaging and medicine kits with built-in reminder alarms will be used to enhance patients' drug compliance. Drug combinations — where different drugs are combined in the same pill — will also be used {{to reduce the number of}} pills a patient has to take from around 13 to three or four a day.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, MSF {{missions}} {{were set up}} to treat tuberculosis and anaemia in residents of the Aral Sea area, and look after civilians affected by <b>drug-resistant</b> disease, famine, and epidemics of cholera and AIDS. They vaccinated 3 million Nigerians against meningitis during an epidemic in 1996 and denounced the Taliban’s neglect of health care for women in 1997. Arguably, the most significant country in which MSF set up field missions in the late 1990s was Sierra Leone, which {{was involved in a}} civil war at the time. In 1998, volunteers began assisting in surgeries in Freetown to help with an increasing number of amputees, and collecting statistics on civilians (men, women and children) being attacked by large groups of men claiming to represent ECOMOG. The groups of men were travelling between villages and systematically chopping off one or both of each resident’s arms, raping women, gunning down families, razing houses, and forcing survivors to leave the area. Long-term projects following {{the end of the civil}} war included psychological support and phantom limb pain management.|$|E
25|$|Cholera reemerged with {{a vengeance}} in the region in 1991 {{for the first time}} in a century with 400,000 new cases, and while {{dropping}} to 100,000 cases in 1997, it still comprises two-thirds of the global cholera burden. TB is a growing problem regionwide, especially in Brazil, Peru, Argentina, and the Dominican Republic where <b>drug-resistant</b> cases also are on the rise. Haiti does not provide data but probably also has a high infection rate. HIV/AIDS also is spreading rapidly, placing Latin America third behind Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in HIV prevalence. Prevalence is high in Brazil and especially in the Caribbean countries (except Cuba), where 2 percent of the population is infected. Malaria is prevalent in the Amazon basin. Dengue reemerged in the region in 1976, presenting both as the usual form and the more lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Hepatitis B and C prevalence is greatest in the Amazon basin, Bolivia, and Central America, while DHF is particularly prevalent in Brazil, Colombia, and Venezuela. Yellow fever has made a comeback over the last decade throughout the Amazon basin, and there have been several recent outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease attributed to E. coli infection in Chile, Argentina, Bolivia and Peru Hemorrhagic fevers are present in almost all South American countries, and most hantavirus pulmonary syndrome occurs in the southern cone.|$|E
500|$|Bacteria are {{the most}} common cause of community-acquired {{pneumonia}} (CAP), with Streptococcus pneumoniae isolated in nearly 50% of cases. [...] Other commonly isolated bacteria include Haemophilus influenzae in 20%, Chlamydophila pneumoniae in 13%, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in 3% of cases; Staphylococcus aureus; Moraxella catarrhalis; Legionella pneumophila and Gram-negative bacilli. A number of <b>drug-resistant</b> versions of the above infections are becoming more common, including <b>drug-resistant</b> Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).|$|E
500|$|A second {{purpose of}} mutational studies is to {{understand}} how drug resistance in cells is conferred from only changing one residue. These changes in the inhibitor-binding pocket are correlated with structural modification, or twist, of the central beta-sheet of the Kinesin-5 motor domain. [...] In this manner, the L5 loop {{may be able to}} directly control nucleotide binding and beta-sheet twist can manipulate the adjacent microtubule-binding site. This may explain how tumor cells rapidly can become <b>drug-resistant</b> to KIF11 inhibitors.|$|E
500|$|The World Health Organization {{declared}} TB a [...] "global health emergency" [...] in 1993, and in 2006, the Stop TB Partnership {{developed a}} Global Plan to Stop Tuberculosis that aimed to save 14 million lives between its launch and 2015. A number of targets they set were not achieved by 2015, mostly {{due to the}} increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis and the emergence of multiple <b>drug-resistant</b> tuberculosis. A tuberculosis classification system developed by the American Thoracic Society is used primarily in public health programs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Drug-resistant</b> MCF-AdrVp cells do not overexpress P-glycoprotein, a cell {{membrane}} efflux pump {{commonly found in}} multidrug resistant cells; instead, they overexpress a 95kD membrane glycoprotein p95.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{the use of}} broad-spectrum {{antibiotics}} {{encourages the}} spread of multidrug-resistant strains {{and the development of}} Clostridium difficile infections, treatment guidelines often recommend minimizing the use of fluoroquinolones and other broad-spectrum antibiotics in less severe infections and in those in which risk factors for multidrug resistance are not present. [...] It has been recommended that fluoroquinolones not be used as a first-line agent for community-acquired pneumonia, instead recommending macrolide or doxycycline as first-line agents. The <b>Drug-Resistant</b> Streptococcus pneumoniae Working Group recommends fluoroquinolones be used for the ambulatory treatment of community-acquired pneumonia only after other antibiotic classes have been tried and failed, or in cases with demonstrated <b>drug-resistant</b> Streptococcus pneumoniae.|$|E
