25|$|Williams almost {{ended his}} tenure with the Pops in 1984. Considered a {{customary}} practice of opinion, some players hissed while sight-reading a new Williams composition in rehearsal; Williams abruptly left the session {{and turned in}} his resignation. He initially cited mounting conflicts with his film composing schedule, but later admitted a perceived lack of discipline in, and respect from, the Pops' ranks, culminating <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>latest</b> instance. After entreaties by the management and personal apologies from the musicians, Williams withdrew his resignation and continued as principal conductor for nine more years. In 1995, he was succeeded by Keith Lockhart, the former associate conductor of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and Cincinnati Pops Orchestra.|$|E

Capcom's Taketoshi Sano said that [...] "Ibuki is suited to {{those who want to}} get the most out of a single character" [...] and [...] "beginners can use her too, but if I had to pick I'd say she's suited for intermediate." [...] Capcom Europe described Ibuki’s [...] "Raida" [...] ("Thunder Strike") command grab as having some unique properties and being one of the most powerful moves in the game. According to an MTV guide, Ibuki is [...] "one of the hardest characters to master <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>latest</b> iteration" [...] and players need to gain [...] "a strong understanding of each character's moves and abilities before truly coming to grips with what the weak, yet versatile Ibuki has to offer." ...|$|E

That’s not necessarily a bad thing: While the first hour hummed along at a decent but semi-predictable pace, the second hour featured a fascinating detour into a high school that was more chamber drama than alien invasion. “Prisoner of War” returns to {{the format of the}} first hour, with an established theme depicted in the show’s title and a singular mission played out on multiple fronts.

[...] For instance, Peng et al.
