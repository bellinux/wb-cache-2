[...] The farther the valve rises from its seat the more airflow can be provided, which is generally more beneficial. [...] Greater lift has some limitations. [...] Firstly, lift {{is limited by the}} increased proximity of the valve head to the piston crown and secondly, greater effort is required to move the valve springs to a higher state of compression. Increased lift can also be limited by lobe clearance in the cylinder <b>head</b> <b>casting.</b> Higher valve lift can have the same effect as increased duration where valve overlap is less desirable.|$|E

40|$|Drosophila larvae exhibit klinotaxis {{when placed}} in a {{gradient}} of temperature, chemicals, or light. The larva samples environmental stimuli by <b>casting</b> its <b>head</b> from side to side. By comparing the results of two consecutive samples, it decides the direction of movement, appearing as a turn proceeded {{by one or more}} <b>head</b> <b>casts.</b> Here by analyzing larval behavior in a light-spot-based phototaxis assay, we showed that, in addition to turns with a single cast (1 -cast), turns with multiple <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> (n-cast) helped to improve the success of light avoidance. Upon entering the light spot, the probability of escape from light after the first <b>head</b> <b>cast</b> was only ~ 30 %. As the number of <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> increased, the chance of successful light avoidance increased and the overall chance of escaping from light increased to > 70 %. The amplitudes of first <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> that failed in light avoidance were significantly smaller in n-cast turns than those in 1 -cast events, indicating that n-cast turns might be planned before completion of the first <b>head</b> <b>cast.</b> In n-casts, the amplitude of the second <b>head</b> <b>cast</b> was generally larger than that of the first <b>head</b> <b>cast,</b> suggesting that larvae tried harder in later attempts to improve the efficacy of light avoidance. We propose that both 1 -cast turns and n-cast turns contribute to successful larval light avoidance, and both can be initiated at the first <b>head</b> <b>cast...</b>|$|R

50|$|Another {{common problem}} with the 2001-2006 5.3L engines was {{cracking}} cylinder heads. This is commonly called the 'Castech Head' failure on the internet.

40|$|The {{ability to}} respond to {{chemical}} stimuli is fundamental to the survival of motile organisms, but the strategies underlying odour tracking remain poorly understood. Here we show that chemotaxis in Drosophila melanogaster larvae is an active sampling process analogous to sniffing in vertebrates. Combining computer-vision algorithms with reconstructed olfactory environments, we establish that larvae orient in odour gradients through a sequential organization of stereotypical behaviours, including runs, stops, lateral <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> and directed turns. Negative gradients, integrated during runs, control the timing of turns. Positive gradients detected through high-amplitude <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> determine the direction of individual turns. By genetically manipulating the peripheral olfactory circuit, we examine how orientation adapts to losses and gains of function in olfactory input. Our findings suggest that larval chemotaxis represents an intermediate navigation strategy between the biased random walks of Escherichia Coli and the stereo-olfaction observed in rats and humans...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{observations}} of larval Drosophila chemotaxis have characterised {{the relationship between}} the odour gradient and the runs, <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> and turns made by the animal. We use a computational model to test whether hypothesised sensorimotor control mechanisms are sufficient to account for larval behaviour. The model combines three mechanisms based on simple transformations of the recent history of odour intensity at the head location. The first is an increased probability of terminating runs in response to gradually decreasing concentration, the second an increased probability of terminating <b>head</b> <b>casts</b> in response to rapidly increasing concentration, and the third a biasing of run directions up concentration gradients through modulation of small <b>head</b> <b>casts.</b> We show that this model can be tuned to produce behavioural statistics comparable to those reported for the larva, and that this tun-ing results in similar chemotaxis performance to the larva. We demonstrate that each mech-anism can enable odour approach but the combination of mechanisms is most effective, and investigate how these low-level control mechanisms relate to behavioural measures such as the preference indices used to investigate larval learning behaviour in group assays. Author Summary The larvae of the fruitfly are attracted to many odours. We use a computational model in which simulated larvae stop, start and redirect their crawling behaviour in response to their experience of changes in odour. We show that three simple rules for switching between behaviours are sufficient to produce larva-like results in a simulated agent...|$|R
