In {{preparation for the}} storm, schools in Ningbo were forced to close, and ferry service was discontinued. Over 20,000people were evacuated by the Chinese government onto higher land.

5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} <b>for</b> <b>eight</b> <b>hours</b> for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to severe complications. Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E

In Tasmania the public holiday is called <b>Eight</b> <b>Hours</b> Day and in the Northern Territory it is called May Day.|$|R
