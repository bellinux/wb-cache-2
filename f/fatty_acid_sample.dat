40|$|Background: A {{decline of}} the {{consumption}} of meat can be reported. Growing concerns regarding health hazards linked with meat consumption like coronary {{heart disease and cancer}} are one reason. But meat, especially pork has a high nutritional value. The aim of the study is to prove the application of pork for dietary purpose. Objective: We investigated the impact of regular pork consumption on the total cholesterol level, on HDL –cholesterol, LDL- cholesterol, oxidized cholesterol, triglycerides and on the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sample.</b> Methods: A monocentrically, open, non randomized and one- armed design was utilized. Men and women (total cholesterol 80 %). 50 subjects were included (40 research group, 10 control group). Results: The diet containing regular consumption of pork lowered the total cholesterol and LDL in men and LDL in women. The diet also resulted in an increase in HDL in men and total cholesterol and HDL in women. Triglycerides were increased in men and women. Conclusions: The application of pork for dietary purpose could be proved. Regular consumption of pork had positive effects on blood lipids, mineral materials, trace elements, vitamins and fatty acids...|$|E

Total microbial biomass was determined as lipid phosphate (LP), and the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of the microbial lipids were used as indicators of community structure. Control samples were sieved to remove macroinvertebrates and plant materials and were extracted immediately in the field. Other samples were preserved {{both before and after}} sieving and stored for 5 days before analysis. Freezing resulted in a 50 % decline in LP and significant decreases in many <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Refrigeration resulted in a 19 % decrease in LP but no change in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Samples</b> preserved with Formalin before sieving exhibited no significant change in LP but substantial increases in many <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> which were probably derived from the macroinvertebrates. Sieved samples preserved with Formalin showed a 17 to 18 % decline in LP but no change in the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Ideally, <b>samples</b> should be sieved and extracted immediately in the field. However, short-term refrigeration and longer-term preservation of sieved samples with Formalin may be acceptable compromises...|$|R

40|$|Binary {{stable isotope}} {{labeling}} couple with LC-ESI-MS {{has been used}} as a powerful non-targeted approach for the relative quantification of lipids, amino acids, and many other important metabolite classes. A multiplexed approach using three or more isotopic labeling reagents greatly reduces analytical run-time while maintaining excellent sensitivity and reproducibility. Three isotopic cholamine labeling reagents have been developed to take advantage of the pre-ionized character of cholamine, for ESI, and the ease by which stable isotopes can be incorporated into the cholamine structure. These three cholamine labeling reagents have been used to relatively quantify three <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> <b>samples</b> simultaneously. The quantification resulted in the observation of 12 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> that had an average absolute error of 0. 9 % and an average coefficient of variation of 6. 1 %. Caged versus cage-free isotope labeling experiments showed that cage-free eggs have an increased level of omega- 3 <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> as compared to caged eggs.

40|$|Intense sheep odour and flavour in lamb {{is often}} {{associated}} with lower consumer acceptance. Branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (BCFAs) are suggested as possible reasons. Therefore, muscle and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples of 98 lamb chops were analysed for three BCFAs (4 -methyloctanoic, 4 -ethyloctanoic and 4 -methylnonanoic <b>fatty</b> <b>acid).</b> <b>Samples</b> were derived from a previous study, in which lambs were raised and fattened under intensive conditions and tested for sensory quality. BCFA contents of fat extracts from muscle tissue were very low and quantification was not possible. In subcutaneous adipose tissue different concentrations of BCFA and differences between crosses were detected. The sex of lambs had a significant influence. The BCFA correlations were significant, while correlations between BCFA of adipose tissue and sensory traits were not significant. Therefore, it seems likely that BCFA concentrations were too low and/or other substances are involved in causing the lamb flavour detected through sensory analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects of high pressure processing on the molecular structure of some unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Samples</b> of elaidic <b>acid,</b> linoleic acid, ZE and EE conjugated linoleic acid are treated at 293 or 333 K at pressures up to 700 MPa.

These relatively extreme conditions are of great interest for food sterilization, but they may induce undesirable change in <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> quality characteristics. To check for structural changes, Raman spectra of the samples are analysed after treatments.

The average depths of the outer and inner layers were quite consistent (~ 1. 5 and ~ 1 cm, respectively). Consequently, the middle layer varied greatly in thickness, from being virtually absent in the thinnest animals to 2. 5 cm thick in the fattest. The relative consistencies of the thickness and composition of the layers {{as well as the}} nature of the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> making up each layer support the generally assumed function of the various layers: (1) the outer layer is primarily structural and thermoregulatory, (2) the inner layer is metabolically active with a <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition that is strongly affected by recent/ongoing lipid mobilization/deposition, and (3) the middle layer is a storage site that contracts and expands with food availability/consumption.

40|$|The {{influence}} of readily degradable, naturally occurring carbon substrates on the biodegradation of several monosubstitued phenols (m-cresol, m-aminophenol, p-chlorophenol) was examined. The natural substrate classes used were amino <b>acids,</b> carbohydrates, and <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> <b>Samples</b> of the microbial community from Lake Michie, a mesotrophic reservoir, were adapted to {{different levels of}} representatives from each natural substrate class in chemostats.

Several microbiological characteristics of the communities were also measured. Adaptation to increasing concentrations of amino <b>acids,</b> carbohydrates, or <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> enhanced the ability of the microbial community to degrade all three phenols. The stimulation was largest for m-cresol and m-aminophenol. The mechanism responsible for the enhancement of monosubstituted phenol metabolism was not clearly identified, but the observation that adaptation to amino acids also increased the biodegradation of glucose and, to a lesser extent, naphthalene suggests a general stimulation of microbial metabolism.

40|$|AbstractRice bran oil (RBO) {{contains}} {{significant amounts}} of the natural antioxidants γ-oryzanol and tocopherols, which are lost {{to a large degree}} during oil refining. This results in a number of industrial residues with high contents of these phytochemicals. With the aim of supporting the development of profitable industrial procedures for γ-oryzanol and tocopherol recovery, the contents of these phytochemicals in all the residues produced during RBO refining were evaluated. The samples included residues from the degumming, soap precipitation, bleaching earth filtering, dewaxing and deodorisation distillation steps. The highest phytochemical concentrations were found in the precipitated soap for γ-oryzanol (14. 2 mgg− 1, representing 95. 3 % of total γ-oryzanol in crude RBO), and in the deodorisation distillate for tocopherols (576 mg 100 g− 1, representing 6. 7 % of total tocopherols in crude RBO). Therefore, among the residues of RBO processing, the deodorisation distillate was the best source of tocopherols. As the soap is further processed for the recovery of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> <b>samples</b> taken from every step of this secondary process, including hydrosoluble fraction, hydrolysed soap, distillation residue and purified <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> fraction, were also analyzed.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition of adipose tissue is explained by differences between <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in early storage in adipose tissue after a meal. DESIGN: Nine healthy men ate a meal containing several <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Blood <b>samples</b> were taken for 6 h after the meal from an arterialized hand vein and a vein draining the anterior abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue. RESULTS: Net storage of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in adipose tissue occurred between 1 and 4 h after the meal. In relation to the amount fed, storage of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> differed (P < 0. 01) between classes (n- 3 polyunsaturated < saturated < n- 6 polyunsaturated < monounsaturated); oleic acid was stored in the greatest amounts. These differences agreed closely with published data, except for n- 3 polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> The only individual metabolic step at which significant differences between <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> was shown was incorporation of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> into chylomicron triacylglycerol. Differences between <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in rate of extraction from chylomicron triacylglycerol and net uptake into adipose tissue in the postprandial period were significant (P < 0. 01), but not when expressed in relation to proportions in chylomicron triacylglycerol. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> pattern of adipose tissue may predominantly reflect the early metabolic handling of different <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Adipose tissue uptake of n- 3 polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> is slow in relation {{to that of other}} <b>fatty</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{content and}} {{physicochemical}} {{composition of the}} milk obtained from 3 cattle farms at summer and winter season for different milking time were studied. Physicochemical properties varied due to different feeding strategies used in the observed farms. The lowest values of total fat and protein were observed in winter time with the highest fat content of morning milking. The groups of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (FAs), namely saturated (SAFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated (PUFA) were examined together with the individual acids with short and long chains. The major <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of milk <b>samples</b> were myristic, palmitic, stearic and oleic acids. In the summer season the content of unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was quantitatively higher than the saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> It can be concluded that the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition and quality of milk was significantly depended on breeding, feeding strategies, milking and cattle management practices. ...|$|R

An experimental part is oriented to the temperature influence on the viscosity and consistency of seven samples of emulsion systems containing of unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (<b>samples</b> A to G). Depending on temperature, the consistency is practically invariable, the viscosity decreases with increasing of temperature. The samples are expressively different in their viscosity from 2, 2 mm 2 s- 1 for emulsion G to 19, 1 mm 2 s- 1 for emulsion D. The consistency of every tested samples is nearly the same, about ρ = 0, 985 g. cm- 3. The sample B was more expressively different {{in the size of}} its particles, it contained particles greater than 300 nm. The other tested samples had majority portion of particles with the size bellow 100 nm and they can be considered as suitable for next biopharmaceutic evaluation in light of the size of its particles. The DLS method was used for pilot assessment of temperature stability of samples, tentatively it wasn't necessary to eliminate any sample because of its unstability...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{determination}} of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of processed cheese analogues. The aim is to identify and quantify the <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in selected <b>samples</b> of cheese analogues. The introduction is {{a brief overview of}} the composition and properties of cheese analogues, technology and application options. The following describes the appropriate method for the determination of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in cheese and cheese analogues. Of these methods the largest part is devoted to gas chromatography, which is most frequently used method for detection of volatile <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Individual cheese analogues used for the analysis, contained various types of added fats. Specifically, the milk fat, coconut oil, sunflower oil, palm oil and butter. Samples of these fats were extracted and then converted to methylesters by methanol esterification with catalysis by potassium hydroxide. The most important <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were identified and quantified in samples of cheese analogues using gas chromatography and compared with <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of fats used for the preparation of these analogues are used...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the differences in the}} chemical composition, particularly <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> of the lipid extracted from the fibre of bucks, does and castrated goats. The study provides a more detailed understanding of the chemical composition of buck fibre lipid and how it varies throughout the year, and also details the effect of body region and nutrition on the production and chemical composition of lipid from buck fibre. Lipid was extracted with either petroleum ether (non-polar) or chloroform/methanol azeotrope (polar) and analysed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The more polar solvent system extracted larger amounts of lipid and more of each individual <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> The following buck specific ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were identified: 2 -ethylhexanoic, 4 -ethylhexanoic, 2 -ethyloctanoic, 4 -ethyloctanoic, 6 -ethyloctanoic, 2 -ethyldecanoic, 4 -ethyldecanoic, 2 -ethyldodecanoic, 6 -ethyldodecanoic, 4 -ethyldodecanoic, 2 -ethyltetradecanoic, 6 -ethyltetradecanoic, 4 -ethyltetradecanoic, 2 -ethylhexadecanoic and 4 -ethyloctadecanoic acids. Of these buck specific <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> only 4 -ethylhexanoic (T), 4 -ethyloctanoic, 4 -ethyldecanoic, 4 -ethyldodecanoic, 6 -ethyldodecanoic (T), 4 -ethyltetradecanoic, 2 -ethylhexadecanoic (T) and 4 -ethylhexadecanoic acids have been previously identified or tentatively identified (T) in buck fibre extracts. This shows that the chemical composition of buck fibre lipid is more complex than previously reported, and that it may be more difficult than previously thought to artificially duplicate the odour of the buck. Buck fibre samples had lower average concentrations of 2 -methylpropanoic, 2 -methylbutanoic, iso-pentadecanoic, anteiso-pentadecanoic, iso-hexadecanoic, anteiso-heptadecanoic, iso-octadecanoic and anteiso-nonadecanoic acids as compared with fibre samples from does, spayed does, or wethers that were castrated at one month of age. The reduced concentrations of these <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in buck fibre extracts were likely to be due to the synthesis of ethyl branched derivatives of iso and anteiso <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> Buck fibre <b>samples</b> had higher concentrations of benzoic acid as compared with fibre samples from does, spayed does, or wethers that were castrated at one month of age. The significance of these results is that non buck specific <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> may also make a contribution to the odour of bucks. When fibre samples were collected at various times throughout the year, {{it was found that the}} bucks had increased amounts of lipid and ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fibre <b>samples</b> shorn from March to September, as compared with fibre samples shorn in November and January. The increase in the amount of lipid and ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> corresponded with both the rutting period of the buck and the period when the buck odour was increased. This suggests that ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> could be pheromones. The variation in lipid content and <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> composition was also examined between fibre samples collected from different body regions of the buck during April, as alterations in sebaceous gland activity around the neck during rutting have been reported. It was found that the average amount of lipid in the neck region of the bucks was not statistically higher than the average amounts in the midside and hind regions. However, the ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations were statistically higher in the fibre from around the neck as compared with the fibre from the other body regions, which is consistent with the odour of the buck being most pronounced around the head and neck region. The lipid content and composition of fibre samples from bucks fed high and low quality diets (lucerne and pangola grass, respectively) was examined to determine the effect of nutrition on buck specific components. The high quality diet increased the amount of lipid and ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fibre <b>samples</b> collected in April from the neck, midside and hind regions, as compared with fibre samples from the corresponding body regions from bucks fed the low quality diet. Thus it may be possible for the pheromone levels of bucks to be increased by simply providing them with good nutrition. The lipid content and ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations of fibre samples increased earlier in the year for the lucerne fed bucks as compared with the pangola grass fed bucks. The lucerne fed bucks had increased concentrations of ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fibre <b>samples</b> shorn during December to June (6 months) whereas the pangola grass fed bucks had increased concentrations of ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in fibre <b>samples</b> shorn during April to August (4 months). These observations show that good nutrition can result in both the earlier production of ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> and an extended period when ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are produced. This suggests that nutrition can be used to manipulate pheromone levels in the buck. The period when the ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were increased corresponded with the period when the plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) and testosterone concentrations, odour and sebaceous gland volume of the bucks were increased, which supports the assumption that ethyl branched <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are involved in odour production and act as pheromones...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{composition}} of total <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in an apple beverage, cider. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{are present in the}} free or esterified form and contribute to both the flavor and foam properties of cider. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were separated and identified as methyl esters by GC-MS, and 12 of these were subsequently determined by GC-FID. The major <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> found in cider were caproic, caprylic, capric, and palmitic acid, the saturated acids predominating over the unsaturated ones. The proposed method was applied to 59 ciders from three consecutive harvests (1996, 1997, and 1998), which were made by 19 cider-makers from the region of Asturias (Spain). Linear discriminant analysis of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in these <b>samples</b> allowed selection of palmitoleic, pentadecanoic, linoleic, myristic, and linolenic acid as the most predictive variables to differentiate ciders made from apples grown in the Asturias region (1997 harvest) and ciders made from apples grown outside this region (1996 and 1998 harvests) ...|$|R
