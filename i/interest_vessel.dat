Differentiat-ing vulnerable from stable plaques and characterizing atherosclerotic plaques are vital parts of the early diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of stroke and the neurological adverse ef-fects of atherosclerosis. Various techniques for vessel wall imaging have been developed and introduced to differentiate and analyze atherosclerotic plaques in the cervical carotid artery. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) {{is the most important}} and popular vessel wall imaging technique for directly evaluating the vascular wall and intra-cranial artery disease. Intracranial artery atherosclerosis, dissection, moyamoya disease, vas-culitis, and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome can also be diagnosed and differ-entiated by using HR-MRI.

40|$|Abstract — Detection of unruptured aneurysms {{is a major}} task in {{magnetic}} resonance angiography (MRA). However, {{it is difficult for}} radiologists to detect small aneurysms on the maximum intensity projection (MIP) images because adjacent vessels may overlap with the aneurysms. Therefore, we proposed a method for making a new MIP image, the SelMIP image, with the <b>interested</b> <b>vessels</b> only, as opposed to all vessels, by manually selecting a cerebral artery from a list of cerebral arteries recognized automatically. By using our new SelMIP viewing technique, the selected vessel regions can also be observed from various directions and would further facilitate the radiologists in detecting small aneurysms. For automated classification of cerebral arteries, two 3 D images, a target image and a reference image, are compared. Image registration is performed using the global matching and feature correspondence techniques. Segmentation of vessels in the target image is performed using the thresholding and region growing techniques. The segmented vessel regions were classified into eight cerebral arteries by calculating the Euclidean distance between a voxel in the target image and each of the voxels in the labeled eight vessel regions in the reference image. In applying the automated cerebral arteries recognization algorithm to thirteen MRA studies, results of 10 MRA studies were evaluated as clinically acceptable. Our new viewing technique would be useful in assisting radiologists for detection of aneurysms and for reducing the interpretation time...|$|R

In regions of <b>interest</b> <b>vessels</b> were segmented by image analysis software and histograms were constructed to reveal the total summed vessel length {{as a function of}} diameter. A characteristic diameter of the ablated area was measured. The 20 -minute survival group histograms showed a significant shift of the peak to larger diameters (p < 0. 002), indicating that smaller vessels were destroyed. Microsphere density was decreased to 2 % in the ablated region but not in the nonablated border zone, depending on the remaining crater crossing larger vessels. After 2 weeks neither vessels nor microspheres were left in the ablated area, which had shrunk by about 40 % in diameter. Study limitations are the lack of histological confirmation and the use of normal rather than cancerous tissue. Larger vessels remain patent just after ablation and transport blood to the border of the ablation crater but perfusion within the crater is halted instantly. Characteristic crater diameter increases initially but decreases thereafter. Destruction of vessels and tissue is complete 2 weeks after cryoablatio...|$|R

40|$|Small {{satellite}} constellations {{could be}} utilized to tip-off or cue existing Electrical Optical (EO) satellite {{systems such as}} a GeoEye class satellite. This paper addresses a specific case of this capability for the current problem of maritime domain awareness. If a constellation of small Automated Identification System (AIS) satellites, a small Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite, and a large EO satellite is used for both routine and ad hoc global satellite coverage of high-interest areas, that constellation could monitor ship activities in support of Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA). This could be achieved over larger areas than Coast Guard or other vessels can currently cover. This would require an AIS satellite flying in tandem with a SAR to automatically detect and locate ships. The AIS data (ship ID/location/ speed/course/heading) identifies the broadcasting vessels and that data is spatially merged with the SAR data to identify all the vessels in the SAR scan. This allows detection and location of non-broadcasting vessels’ using the SAR and AIS fused data. Those non-broadcasting vessels target locations identified by the SAR image provides the tip-off target location to cue the high-res EO satellite ad hoc imagery collection to characterize these high <b>interest</b> <b>vessels.</b> This new EO imagery along with the fused AIS/SAR report could be delivered to a watch floor or an operations center to provide information on developing situations. This would enable shortened timelines for a tactical response related to the detected non-broadcasting vessels.
