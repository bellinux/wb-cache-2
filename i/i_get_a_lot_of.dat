[...] When Lasance and Tovey found out their characters would become involved together, both {{did not think it}} would work. They both separately approached producer Cameron Welsh and unbeknownst to each other, told him of their concerns about the pairing. However the pair discovered they shared a [...] "great" [...] dynamic while working together and Lasance said when their storylines intertwined it was [...] "fantastic". Lasance also said they found much of their early screen time comical because [...] "one minute they're in bed, the next they're fighting in the diner."

Dotchin received two nominations in the New Zealand Film and TV Awards, one in 1994 {{and another in}} 1997. Former Shortland Street producer, Tony Holden praised Dotchin, stating; [...] "The issue of stardom is one of publicity and hype and b***, but {{the issue of what}} actually makes an actor loved by an audience has got very {{much to do with the}} heart and that magic behind the eyes.

And all these sex stories! Don't believe in 'em! Sensational! Don't believe in cheap literature of no sort.... Oh, of course it's all right to read a coupla detective stories or a nice, bright, clean love-story just to pass the time away.

5000|$|Chris Robinson, {{a renowned}} music video director, was {{contacted}} {{with an offer}} to direct Austin and Watkins visualization, and took on his first feature with ATL.

They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors cant capture the story, so what wed do was turn on the directors tapes, turn down the music and just watch {{to see if we could}} find the story.

5000|$|On 7 October, Belgium {{national}} team manager Georges Leekens, citing Hazard's recent spell {{on the bench}} at Lille, said that the player needed to work harder, both physically and mentally, to regain his past year's form.

Hazard, himself, later reflected on Leekens and Garcia comments in February 2011 stating [...] "I learned <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> during those few weeks, mentally speaking.
