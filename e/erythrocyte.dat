5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century {{scientists}} had come to believe that cells are surrounded by a thin oil-like barrier, but the structural nature of this membrane was not known. Two experiments in 1925 laid the groundwork to fill in this gap. By measuring the capacitance of <b>erythrocyte</b> solutions, Hugo Fricke determined that the cell membrane was 3.3nm thick.|$|E
5|$|Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, {{computed}} tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis. Blood tests {{can also help}} identify the presence of infection: the <b>erythrocyte</b> sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but {{nearly half of the}} time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia is defined as a plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and <b>erythrocyte</b> sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. Plasmodium falciparum infecting a-thalassemic <b>erythrocytes</b> (Hb H or Hb H/Hb Constant Spring) is {{resistant}} to artemisinin derivatives. Similar resistance, albeit {{at a much}} lower level, is shown by the parasite infecting b-thalassemia/Hb E <b>erythrocytes.</b> The resistance is due to host-specific factors, one of which is the higher uptake of the drugs by thalassemic <b>erythrocytes</b> than normal <b>erythrocytes,</b> due to binding with Hb H. In addition to higher drug binding, incubation of artemisinin with a-thalassemic <b>erythrocytes</b> resulted in preferential inactivation of the drug. Both thalassemic and normal <b>erythrocytes</b> have the capability to inactivate the drug. Addition of serum can protect against inactivation by normal <b>erythrocytes,</b> but not by thalassemic <b>erythrocytes.</b> Incubation with either the hemolysate or the membrane fraction from these <b>erythrocytes</b> also resulted in preferential inactivation of the drug. The drug was also inactivated by purified Hb H. It is concluded that the ineffectiveness of artemisinin derivatives against P. falciparum infecting thalassemic <b>erythrocytes</b> is due partly to competition of the host cell components for binding with the drugs, and partly to inactivation of th...|$|R
5|$|Other diagnoses {{that are}} {{typically}} considered include fractures, tumors, or systemic disease if plantar fasciitis pain fails to respond appropriately to conservative medical treatments. Bilateral heel pain or heel {{pain in the}} context of a systemic illness may indicate a need for a more in-depth diagnostic investigation. Under these circumstances, diagnostic tests such as a CBC or serological markers of inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease such as C-reactive protein, <b>erythrocyte</b> sedimentation rate, anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, HLA-B27, uric acid, or Lyme disease antibodies may also be obtained. Neurological deficits may prompt an investigation with electromyography to evaluate for damage to the nerves or muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{is based on}} the combination of the symptoms, as very few other diseases cause the same symptoms together. Blood tests may show elevated creatinine and urea levels (in kidney involvement), raised IgA levels (in about 50%), and raised C-reactive protein (CRP) or <b>erythrocyte</b> sedimentation rate (ESR) results; none are specific for Henoch–Schönlein purpura. The platelet count may be raised, and distinguishes it from diseases where low platelets are the cause of the purpura, such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the results}} of this {{experiment}} were accurate, Fricke misinterpreted the data to mean that the cell membrane is a single molecular layer. Prof. Dr. Evert Gorter (1881–1954) and F. Grendel of Leiden University approached the problem from a different perspective, spreading the <b>erythrocyte</b> lipids as a monolayer on a Langmuir-Blodgett trough. When they compared the area of the monolayer to the surface area of the cells, they found a ratio of two to one. Later analyses showed several errors and incorrect assumptions with this experiment but, serendipitously, these errors canceled out and from this flawed data Gorter and Grendel drew the correct conclusion- that the cell membrane is a lipid bilayer.|$|E

5|$|Exposure to lead {{also can}} be {{evaluated}} by measuring <b>erythrocyte</b> protoporphyrin (EP) in blood samples. EP {{is a part of}} red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high, with a delay of a few weeks. Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal, this finding suggests exposure was recent. However, the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35μg/dL. Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency, use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased.|$|E

25|$|Merozoites use the apicomplexan {{invasion}} organelles (apical complex, pellicle {{and surface}} coat) {{to recognize and}} enter the host <b>erythrocyte</b> (red blood cell). The parasite first binds to the <b>erythrocyte</b> in a random orientation. It then reorients such that the apical complex is in proximity to the <b>erythrocyte</b> membrane. The parasite forms a parasitophorous vesicle, to allow for its development inside the <b>erythrocyte.</b> This infection cycle occurs in a highly synchronous fashion, with roughly all of the parasites throughout the blood in the same stage of development. This precise clocking mechanism {{has been shown to}} be dependent on the human host's own circadian rhythm.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of {{static magnetic field}} (SMF) with living organisms is a rapidly growing field of investigation. Recently, exposure to moderate intensity SMFs (1 mT – 1 T) has attracted much attention for its various medical applications.

In a comparative study we found that, of 816 samples tested by both methods, the titres of 807 (98. 9 %) sera were in close agreement within an acceptable twofold difference. Trypsin-treated human group O <b>erythrocytes</b> usually provided titres that were twofold higher than those obtained with chick <b>erythrocytes.</b> In general, a very good correlation between the two methods was obtained.

Furthermore, we found that trypsin-treated human group O <b>erythrocytes</b> can be stored for periods of up to 30 days and used in the HAI test without any appreciable loss of sensitivity or specificity. Moreover, we replaced chick <b>erythrocytes</b> with trypsin-treated human group O <b>erythrocytes</b> in the sucrose density gradient/HAI method used {{for the detection of}} rubella virus-specific IgM and found it to be a very satisfactory method. In view of these findings we recommend that trypsin-treated human group O <b>erythrocytes</b> should replace chick <b>erythrocytes</b> in the standard rubella HAI test since the former provided not only a more sensitive, more economic, and less time-consuming method but also a technique which is as specific as that using chick <b>erythrocytes...</b>|$|R
