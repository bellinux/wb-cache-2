5|$|Both the {{function}} {{and the appearance}} in life of the extremely elongated and bifurcated vertebral spines remain elusive. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested the spines represented defense weapons against predators, arguing that they tapered towards their tips. In a subsequent skeletal reconstruction drawing, Salgado (1999) depicted the neural spines supporting a keratinous sheath, which could have added significantly to the total length of the spines. The presence of a covering, either of keratin or skin, is shown by a striation pattern {{on the surface of}} the spines similar to the bony horn cores of today's bovids. American science writer Gregory Paul (2000) argued that the spines, if elongated by a keratinous sheath, could have been used as a weapon both against predators and members of the same species, as the animal might have been able to point its most anterior spines forward by bending its neck. He also hypothesized that the spines could have been clattered together to generate sound. In 2016, Mark Hallett and Mathew Wedel suggested that the backwards-directed spines might have been able to skewer predators when the neck was abruptly drawn backwards during an attack. A similar defense strategy is found in today's <b>giant</b> <b>sable</b> <b>antelope</b> and Arabian oryx, which can use their long, backwards directed horns to stab attacking lions. Apart from the possible function in defense, the spines may have been used for display, either for the intimidation of rivaling individuals or for courtship. Hallett and Wedel also hypothesized that rival males might have interlocked their spines for neck wrestling.|$|E

Years of civil unrest in Angola, a highly localized distribution and Interbreeding with its congener the roan antelope (H. equinus) has led to this subspecies being considered as critically endangered. <b>Sable</b> <b>antelope</b> occurring ∼ 600 km to the east in western Zambia superficially resemble <b>giant</b> <b>sable</b> in phenotype, prompting speculation in the popular media that the distribution of <b>giant</b> <b>sable</b> may be larger than currently documented. Our aim here was to Investigate the evolutionary placement of western Zambian sable using mitochondrial DNA control region data. Phylogenese analyses (maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses) supported the monophyly of H. n. variant (Bayesian posterior probability of > 0. 95, bootstrap support > 80 %) and nested the western Zambian sable within H. n. niger. This finding was supported by an analysis of molecular variance that discretely grouped western Zambian <b>sable</b> from <b>giant</b> <b>sable</b> (ΦST = 0. 645, P = 0. 001). Significant genetic structure was also found across the range of H. n. nigera as Indicated by our phylogenetic analyses and analysis of molecular variance (ΦST = 0. 418, P = 0. 001). We conclude that although the western Zambian <b>sable</b> <b>antelope</b> and those of H. n. variani resemble one another in morphology, {{particularly with respect to}} facial markings, significant genetic differences underpin these two evolutionary lineages.

50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>sable</b> <b>antelope</b> {{lives in}} forests near water, where leaves and tree sprouts are always juicy and abundant. It is an {{endangered}} species; it is protected in natural parks, and hunting it is forbidden. Typically, sable antelopes are specialized browsers feeding on foliage and herbs, especially those growing on termite mounds. One {{of the reasons}} for the decline in antelope numbers could be the animals' very specific feeding patterns. Typically, they will feed on tree leaves, which make up to 90% of their diets, at heights of 40 - 140 mm from the ground, taking only the leaf.|$|E

50|$|The {{province}} {{is predominantly}} agricultural. The most intensively used {{area in the}} province of Malanje is the area around the provincial capital, where cotton and sugarcane are the most important industries. The cotton industry was once of vital importance to the national economy, but the years of the Angola Civil War have badly stagnated it. Agriculture in Malanje Province is gradually taking off again, and numerous international investors have been involved, including US$30 million from Brazil to develop the maize and sugercane industry in the Pungo Andongo area. Malanje Province is also a producer of cassava, sweet potatoes, peanuts, rice, soybeans, sunflowers and various vegetables. The province also has significant reserves of diamonds, limestone, manganese (with 4,682 metric tons exported in 1973), uranium and phosphate.Tourism has become more important, largely due to its diverse natural attractions, including the Kalandula Falls, the black rock formation of Pungo Andongo, two nature reserves and the Cangandala National Park. Cangandala National Park, the smallest national park in the country, was originally established under Portuguese rule in 1963 to protect the <b>Giant</b> <b>Sable</b> <b>Antelope,</b> before being declared a national park on 25 June 1970.|$|E
40|$|Trophy {{hunting in}} {{ungulates}} may favour individuals with smaller horns. A decrease in horn/antler size may jeopardize the conservation potential of hunting areas, {{which would be}} a major concern in Africa where hunting zones represent over half of the total area of protected lands. We investigated horn length trends of harvested male impalas Aepyceros melampus, greater kudus Tragelaphus strepsiceros and <b>sable</b> <b>antelopes</b> Hippotragus niger, from 1974 to 2008 in Matetsi Safari Area, Zimbabwe. Horn length declined by 4 % in impalas, partly because male harvest age decreased. In greater kudus, surprisingly, horn length increased by 14 %, while mean age of harvested male greater kudus increased during the study period. Reduced hunting pressure on this species during the study may have allowed males to live longer and to grow longer horns before being harvested. Horn length declined by 6 % in <b>sable</b> <b>antelopes,</b> independent of age, suggesting that trophy hunting selected male <b>sable</b> <b>antelopes</b> with smaller horns through time, provided that horn length is heritable. Hunting pressure and trophy value were higher for <b>sable</b> <b>antelopes</b> than for impalas and greater kudus. Accordingly, the decline of horn length in this species was more pronounced. More valuable trophy species, such as <b>sable</b> <b>antelopes,</b> require special attention because they may be exposed to higher hunting pressure, and are therefore more likely to experience a decrease in horn size.
