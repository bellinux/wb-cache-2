In {{order to}} study the {{dispersion}} and performance of tartrazine aluminum lake, 7 kinds of water-based resins are used to form <b>disperse</b> <b>system.</b> These systems are enviroment friendly (low VOC) and use edible yellow lake as colorant.

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} review of the fundamental rheology of dilute <b>disperse</b> <b>systems</b> is presented. The exact rheological constitutive equations based on rigorous single-particle mechanics are discussed {{for a variety of}} <b>disperse</b> <b>systems.</b> The different types of inclusions (disperse phase) considered are: rigid-solid spherical particles with and without electric charge, rigid-porous spherical particles, non-rigid (soft) solid particles, liquid droplets with and without surfactant, bubbles with and without surfactant, capsules, core-shell particles, non-spherical solid particles, and ferromagnetic spherical and non-spherical particles. In general, {{the state of the art}} is good in terms of the theoretical development. However, more experimental work is needed to verify the theoretical models and to determine their range of validity. This is especially true for dispersions of porous particles, capsules, core-shell particles, and magnetic particles.
