5|$|Between 8 and 10 May 1926, regular {{elections}} to the Third Seimas were held. For {{the first time}} since 1920, the bloc led by the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party, which strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church and its clergy, did not obtain a majority. The Lithuanian people were disillusioned with this party, as its members had been involved in several financial scandals: Juozas Purickas had been using his <b>diplomatic</b> <b>privileges</b> in Moscow to deal in cocaine and saccharin; Eliziejus Draugelis and Petras Josiukas had purchased cheap low-quality smoked pig fat from Germany instead of buying from Lithuanian farmers; and the Minister of Finance, Vytautas Petrulis, had transferred a large sum of money from the state budget to his personal account. The party's strategies for coping with an economic crisis were perceived as ineffective. An additional tension arose when the Concordat of 1925 between Poland and the Holy See unilaterally recognized Vilnius as an ecclesiastical province of Poland, despite Lithuanian requests to govern Vilnius directly from Rome. Although it was not traditionally a Vatican policy to establish an arrangement of this type, the decision was objected to strongly by many Lithuanians. The decision implied that the Pope had recognized Polish claims to Vilnius, and this created a loss of prestige for the Christian Democrats. Diplomatic relations with the Holy See were severed, and they did not improve when Pope Pius XI unilaterally established and reorganized Lithuanian ecclesiastical provinces in April 1926 without regard to Lithuanian proposals and demands.|$|E

Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite strong US opposition: [...] "Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure the best price available from the major oil corporations." [...] The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland. On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend <b>diplomatic</b> <b>privileges.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The post-war era saw {{developments}} that further stimulated {{the growth of}} a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the 8mm and super-8 film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur cinematography. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In Britain, the productions of Harrison Marks were [...] "soft core", but considered risqué in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. Lasse Braun was as a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's <b>diplomatic</b> <b>privileges.</b> Pornography was first legalized in Denmark July 1969, soon followed by the Netherlands the same year and Sweden in 1971, and this led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography in those countries, with the Color Climax Corporation quickly becoming the leading pornographic producer {{for the next couple of}} decades. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold [...] "under the counter" [...] or (sometimes) shown in [...] "members only" [...] cinema clubs.|$|E

Although United States Army soldier Chelsea Manning {{had been arrested}} nearly three years previously for the leaks, the UK government felt unable to confirm to the court that the leaked documents were genuine. It was made clear to the court that the government's inability to confirm was for two reasons: firstly, to protect itself from the charge that it created the reserve to prevent the islanders from ever returning home and, secondly, out of a purported fear that the US government might get angry if the cables were acknowledged as genuine. Despite {{the contents of his}} cable being known—"a marine park would, in effect, put paid to resettlement claims of the archipelago's former residents"—Roberts denied, when questioned in court, that there was an [...] "ulterior motive" [...] behind the reserve's establishment. Lord Justice Richards and Mr Justice Mitting then refused to accept the documents as evidence, declaring that to do so would breach <b>diplomatic</b> <b>privilege.</b> The Guardian described their decision as having [...] "far-reaching consequences" [...] and [...] "a severe setback for the use of material obtained from leaks or whistleblowers." [...] In June 2013, the pair of judges turned down the appeal brought by the Chagossians, ruling that everything was fine because the reserve was compatible with EU law.|$|R

40|$|YOSHIDA SHOIN (1830 - 1859) AND THE SHOKA SONJUKU The {{life and}} {{writings}} of Yoshida Shoin, samurai of Choshu in western Japan, scholar, patriot and teacher, reflect the many diverse and turbulent {{aspects of the}} late Tokugawa period. In his personal relationships and activities Shoin anticipated the desperate nature of the crisis facing Japan {{in the mid-nineteenth century}} with the arrival of foreigners on Japanese soil seeking trade and <b>diplomatic</b> <b>privilege.</b> He was executed for crimes against the state during the Ansei Purge in 1859, ten years before the same ideas and a number of the men who were his students propelled Japan into the modern world. Shoin has been the object of fascination to both Japanese and Western historians since the publication of The Life of Yoshida ShOin (1893) by Tokutomi Iichiro and Robert Louis Stevenson's "Yoshida Torajiro" in Familiar Studies of Men and Books (1903). Interpretation of his life and work has been prey to a hundred years of changing historiographical fashion. Shoin has been cast in the role of archconservative, ultranationalist, messianic prophet of the Meiji Restoration, tragic failed hero, disaffected intellectual and "grassroots" radical insurrectionist. Within the encrustation of legend and interpretation the real Yoshida Shoin has been overlaid. This study re-examines Shoin's life and thought with particular emphasis on the Shoka Sonjuku. The students of this small community school at which he was principal instructor while under domiciliary confinement, included such later "Men of Meiji" as Ito Hirobumi, Yamagata Aritomo and Kido Koin. Ideas gathered during fieldwork helped to clarify Shoin's ideas and appear in the text where appropriate in the form of maps, charts andphotographic plates. Locations where he was active, including Hagi itself are pinpointed. His journeys are traced from Hirado and Nagasaki in Kyushu, through Kyoto and Nakasendo to IzuShimoda, Mito and Aizu-Wakamatsu, as far north as the Tsugaru Straits. The chronological listing of his major writings which is included, traces the evolution of his concepts of state and philosophy of education. This thesis sheds new light on Shoin's life, thought and activities, especially his relationship to the physical environment of Hagi, the domain castletown, to the Neo-Confucian and Yamaga philosophical traditions in which he was fostered and the intellectual movements to which he was exposed, notably, Mitogaku. Special attention is given to Shoka Sonjukuki, an essay written by Shin in 1856 in which he discusses the history and educational principles of the school which were transmitted to his deshi (disciples). The analysis of this vital text has not been carried out previously and challenges the existing inadequate but historiographically explicable interpretations of Shoin as a radical and extremist...|$|R

The Convention is established to govern the diplomatic relations. The study establishes the fact that diplomacy has been in existence before {{the adoption of the}} VCDR. The study notes the fact that the provisions in the VCDR has contributed to the abuse of <b>diplomatic</b> immunity and <b>privileges.</b> The hierarchy of norms is also brought into the lime light as to whether the immunity granted to diplomatic agent should be giving paramount interest to human rights of the citizens of the host state. The study notes that there have been challenges in implementing the VCDR due to the contradiction in the provisions in the Convention. The underlying theory which is the theory of functional necessity is stipulated in the preamble as the fundamental basis ofthe immunity granted to diplomats, it has been noted in this study that this theory has not been upheld in practice. In establishing the weaknesses attributed to the Convention as well as establishing the fact that an abuse has happened, the theory of functional necessity was used as a guide. Various case studies were used to highlight the abuse ofdiplomatic immunity as well as the challenges in implementing the Vienna convention. The paper further notes the fact that the persona non grata and the waver of immunity provided in the VCDR do not serve as a form of deterrence to other abuses, hence a need to include other stringent provisions to deter the abuse of diplomatic immunity...|$|R
