5|$|In 1995 the Council {{moved into}} the <b>Justus</b> <b>Lipsius</b> <b>building,</b> {{across the road from}} Charlemagne. However, its staff was still increasing, so it {{continued}} to rent the Frère Orban building to house the Finnish and Swedish language divisions. Staff continued to increase and the Council rented, in addition to owning Justus Lipsius, the Kortenberg, Froissart, Espace Rolin, and Woluwe Heights buildings. Since acquiring the Lex building in 2008, the three aforementioned buildings are no longer in use by the Council services.|$|E
25|$|Van Rompuy's first {{council meeting}} was an {{informal}} {{gathering in the}} Solvay Library in Leopold Park, rather than the more usual formal gathering in the <b>Justus</b> <b>Lipsius</b> <b>building</b> nearby.

25|$|The {{removal of}} the {{sculpture}} began on 11 May. Černý himself was not present, although he had earlier suggested the contrary. A crew he sent there dismantled the sculpture and on Thursday, 14 May loaded its parts into three trucks, which had to come one by one because of limitations of the <b>Justus</b> <b>Lipsius</b> <b>building.</b> Afterwards, the pieces were transported by road to Prague.|$|E

25|$|The Council of the European Union {{adheres to}} a {{rotational}} presidency system, whereby {{the governments of}} member countries exchange leadership every six months. It is customary for the presiding country to place an exhibit in the <b>Justus</b> <b>Lipsius</b> <b>building,</b> with past works avoiding controversy. For example, France, which had held the presidency before the Czech Republic, simply erected a large balloon in the French national colours {{in honor of the}} tradition.|$|E
25|$|The Council, {{which had}} been {{expanding}} into further buildings as it grew, consolidated once more in the <b>Justus</b> <b>Lipsius</b> <b>building,</b> and in 2002 {{it was agreed that}} the European Council should also be based in Brussels, having previously moved between different cities as the EU's Presidency rotated. From 2004 all Councils were meant to be held in Brussels; however, some extraordinary meetings are still held elsewhere. The reason for the move was in part due to the experience of the Belgian police in dealing with protesters and the fixed facilities in Brussels.|$|E
25|$|Brussels, {{along with}} Luxembourg and Strasbourg, began to host European {{institutions}} in 1957, soon becoming {{the centre of}} activities, as the Commission and Council based their activities {{in what has become}} the European Quarter, in the east of the city. Early building in Brussels was sporadic and uncontrolled, with little planning. The current major buildings are the Berlaymont building of the Commission, symbolic of the quarter as a whole, the <b>Justus</b> <b>Lipsius</b> <b>building</b> of the Council and the Espace Léopold of the Parliament. Today, the presence has increased considerably, with the Commission alone occupying 865,000m2 within the European Quarter (a quarter of the total office space in Brussels). The concentration and density has caused concern that the presence of the institutions has created a ghetto effect {{in that part of the}} city. However, the European presence has contributed significantly to the importance of Brussels as an international centre.|$|E

[...] In order to make room for additional meeting space a number of renovations were made, including the conversion of an underground carpark into additional press briefing rooms.However, in 2004 leaders decided the logistical problems created by the outdated facilities warranted {{the construction of a new}} purpose built seat able to cope with the nearly 6,000 meetings, working groups, and summits per year.This resulted in theEuropa building, which opened its doors in 2017, and is now home to both the Council of the European Union and the European Council.
