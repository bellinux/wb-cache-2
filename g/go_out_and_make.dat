500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had done wrong when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Nicholas Meyer {{was brought}} in to direct the sixth film in the series: [...] Roddenberry and he clashed creatively, as Roddenberry felt that having the Enterprise crew hold prejudices against the Klingons did not fit with his view of the universe. Meyer {{described}} a meeting with Roddenberry he later regretted, saying:His guys were lined up {{on one side of the}} room, and my guys were lined up on the other side of the room, and this was not a meeting in which I felt I'd behaved very well, very diplomatically, I came out of it feeling not very good, and I've not felt good about it ever since. He was not well, and maybe there were more tactful ways of dealing with it, because at the end of the day, I was going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> the movie. I didn't have to take him on. Not my finest hour. In Joel Engel's biography, Gene Roddenberry: The Myth and the Man Behind Star Trek, he states that Roddenberry watched The Undiscovered Country alongside the producers of the film at a private screening two days before his death, and told them they had done a [...] "good job". [...] In contrast, Nimoy and Shatner's memoirs report that after the screening he called his lawyer and demanded a quarter of the scenes be cut; the producers refused.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{initially}} {{worked well}} together, Simon and Groening's relationship became [...] "very contentious" [...] according to Groening. Simon never expected {{the show to}} be a success, often proclaiming to fellow staff members [...] "We're thirteen and out"—meaning that the show would be canceled after the thirteen episodes of the first season. Therefore, he also told the staff that they had creative freedom {{to do whatever they}} wanted to make The Simpsons as good a show as possible, regardless of network or public opinion, because he thought it inevitably would not be renewed; he elaborated in 2009 that [...] "really I was saying that to take the pressure off of everyone. I was just saying let's just <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> 13 episodes that are really good and really funny." [...] However, Groening interpreted it as meaning Simon was uncommitted and did not care whether the show was a success or not, as Simon's career would survive, whereas his own would not. In 2001, Groening described Simon as [...] "brilliantly funny and one of the smartest writers I've ever worked with, although unpleasant and mentally unbalanced." [...] According to John Ortved's book , when the show became successful Simon resented the media attention Groening received, particularly the praise for the show's writing; Simon felt that Groening's involvement was limited, and that he should have been the one receiving credit for the show. Simon later spoke well of Groening's influence, particularly on the show's positive tone.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the release}} of the film, Disney {{executive}} David Hoberman was quoted, [...] "I hope Nightmare <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> a fortune. If it does, great. If it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us." [...] The film earned $50 million in the United States on its first theatrical run.|$|R
5000|$|In August of {{the same}} year, Moreno became the first driver to test the new Panoz-built Champ Car. According to former series {{champion}} Paul Tracy, [...] "Moreno's a guy who's not going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>make</b> mistakes <b>and</b> go off the road. They need to put miles on the car and run it fairly quickly, and he's the perfect guy for the job." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andrew G. Kaufman (January 17, 1949 - May 16, 1984) was an American entertainer, actor, writer, {{performance}} artist and professional wrestler. While {{often referred to}} as a comedian, Kaufman described himself instead as a [...] "song and dance man." [...] He disdained telling jokes and engaging in comedy as it was traditionally understood, once saying in a rare introspective interview, [...] "I am not a comic, I have never told a joke. ... The comedian's promise is that he will <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>make</b> you laugh with him. ... My only promise is that I will try to entertain you as best I can." ...|$|R
500|$|While {{songs such as}} [...] "Overcome" [...] and [...] "Suffocated Love" [...] {{dealt with}} themes of [...] "sexual {{paranoia}} and male dread of intimacy", the rest of Maxinquaye explored the psychological tolls of the British recreational drug culture, which Reynolds said served as a [...] "temporary utopia" [...] for a generation of users who otherwise lacked a [...] "constructive outlet for its idealism". He felt the album's cover art, featuring rusting metal surfaces, represented the cultural decline explored in the music's themes. Tricky drew on Rastafarian ideas about end time for the record, although unlike adherents to that movement he did not disassociate himself from [...] "Babylon", or the degenerate qualities of Western society, writing lyrics such as [...] "my brain thinks bomb-like/beware of our appetite" [...] on [...] "Hell Is Round the Corner". He later told Reynolds, [...] "I'm part of this fuckin' psychic pollution... It's like, I can be as greedy as you. The conditioned part of me says 'yeah, I'm gonna <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> money, I'm going to rule my own little kingdom.'" [...] Christgau deemed the album's songs [...] "audioramas of someone who's signed on {{to work for the}} wages of sin and lived to cash the check", while O'Hagan said Tricky's [...] "impressionistic prose poems" [...] were written from the deviant perspective of the urban hedonist: [...] "Maxinquaye is the sound of blunted Britain, paranoid and obsessive... This was the inner-city blues, Bristol style".|$|E
2500|$|In Game 3, the Cubs {{tied the}} game {{in the bottom of the}} 9th, but the Tigers won it with an unearned run in the 11th inning. [...] In the 3rd inning, umpire George Moriarty (who had played for the Tigers from 1909 to 1915) called Phil Cavarretta out in a close play at second base. [...] When the Cubs protested, Moriarty {{verbally}} abused the Cubs, and ejected Cubs' manager Charlie Grimm and player Bill Jurges. [...] After the game, Grimm said: [...] "If a manager can't <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a decent kick, what the hell is the game coming to? I didn't swear at him but he swore at us." [...] Coach Roy Johnson accused Moriarty of making improper reflections on the Cubs' ancestry. Judge Landis later levied $200 fines on Moriarty‚ Grimm‚ and Jurges for their conduct in the World Series.|$|E

Always loyal without question, Gaga takes great pride in being a steward. He also {{has the ability to}} transform into a black, red-eyed cat with bat-like wings. He replaced Cube as Glenda's steward earlier when the former was banished by the Demon Queen. He also neither hates nor likes Cube for the latter's absence in the Demon World and sees him serving a lowly Human.|$|R

Ferdinand did not seem to think the {{separation}} possible. He said he would rather go to work in Peter Brown's office, where he had already a hold; and his familiarity with Spanish would secure him usefulness and promotion, and five or six years would bring them into a position to marry. He did not look fit for desk-work in London, but his mind was made up to any privation, so that he could be in reach of Alda, and hope to give her what he had once thought easily within his grasp.|$|R

But first of all, Sully, I'm going to have the biggest clam-bake down on the beach that was ever seen south of the tropic of Capricorn. I figured that out from the start.

60|$|Another tale Hawthorne {{might have}} told me, {{the tale of}} an {{excellent}} man, whose very virtues, by some baneful moral chemistry, corrupt and ruin {{the people with whom}} he comes in contact. I do not mean by goading them into the opposite extremes, but rather something like a moral jettatura. This needs a great deal of subtlety, and what is to become of the hero? Is he to plunge into vice till everybody is virtuous again? It wants working out. I have omitted, after all, a schoolboy historical romance, explaining why Queen Elizabeth was never married. A Scottish paper offered a prize for a story of Queen Mary Stuart's reign. I did not get the prize--perhaps did not deserve it, but my story ran thus: You must know that Queen Elizabeth was singularly like Darnley in personal appearance. What so natural as that, disguised as a page, her Majesty should come spying about the Court of Holyrood? Darnley sees her walking out of Queen Mary's room, he thinks her an hallucination, discovers that she is real, challenges her, and they fight at Faldonside, by the Tweed, Shakespeare holding Elizabeth's horse. Elizabeth is wounded, and is carried to the Kirk of Field, and laid in Darnley's chamber, while Darnley <b>goes</b> <b>out</b> <b>and</b> <b>makes</b> love to my rural heroine, the lady of Fernilee, a Kerr. That night Bothwell blows up the Kirk of Field, Elizabeth and all. Darnley has only one resource. Borrowing the riding habit of the rural heroine, the lady of Fernilee, he flees across the Border, and, {{for the rest of his}} life, personates Queen Elizabeth. That is why Elizabeth, who was Darnley, hated Mary so bitterly (on account of the Kirk of Field affair), and that is why Queen Elizabeth was never married. Side-lights on Shakespeare's Sonnets were obviously cast. The young man whom Shakespeare admired so, and urged to marry, was--Darnley. This romance did not get the prize (the anachronism about Shakespeare is worthy of Scott), but I am conceited enough to think it deserved an honourable mention.|$|R

500|$|Immediately {{after the}} Fiesta Bowl {{bypassed}} Virginia Tech {{in favor of}} lower-ranked Notre Dame, protests from Tech fans and opponents of the BCS system erupted.

In an interview immediately after the selection, Vick said the Gator Bowl bid provided motivation to win the Gator Bowl. [...] "We're going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> there <b>and</b> <b>make</b> a statement, play a great game and show the nation", he said. Clemson, on the other hand, was enthusiastic about the Gator Bowl bid.
