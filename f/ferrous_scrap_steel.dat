40|$|This {{research}} {{concerns the}} reverse logistics systems in ferrous scrap of 12 North American manufacturing plants. It examines {{the role of}} purchasing and other functions in the reverse logistics system, and assesses the contribution made by the various departments. Purchasing {{played a significant role}} in managing reverse logistics activities at the plants in the study. Volume was found to significantly influence strategies and processes used by plants in their reverse logistics systems. A total of six volume-based approaches for managing ferrous scrap reverse networks are identified. The implications of each are discussed using case studies to highlight differences among the strategies. reverse logistics disposal purchasing <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> <b>steel</b> industry. ...|$|E

40|$|Firms which {{generate}} <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> as {{a by-product}} of their manufacturing process (2 ̆ 2 generators 2 ̆ 2) need {{to decide how to}} dispose of their scrap; their options include selling to steel mills, foundries or <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> processing companies (2 ̆ 2 processors 2 ̆ 2). The primary focus of this thesis is an examination of the alternative strategies available to generators.;An analytical framework was tested at twelve sites, with data collection and analysis guided by three research questions and eleven propositions. A range of variables was identified as influencing <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal strategies which were classified as either drivers, moderators or outcomes; trade-offs among these variables defined the disposal strategies for each of the sites.;The volume driver highlighted the trade-offs in <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposition; three volume groups were observed, each having a distinctly different set of <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal options. Specifically, volume was found to influence the duration of generator-processor contracts, logistics, the frequency with which generators switched processors, the recovery value received and the level of resources employed in the disposition process.;Although striking differences exist between the three volume groups, the boundaries are indistinct. Characteristics of plants located on the margins demonstrate certain elements of the adjacent group. Contrasts between the volume groups are, therefore, most conspicuous when comparing plants at the midpoints of the three categories.;Cost recovery was found to be the dominant outcome variable. Most of the plants in this study, typically, did not effectively manage the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal process, although opportunities exist within each of the volume groups to provide competitive advantages to the firm through effective disposal strategies. Opportunities to develop capabilities in order to pursue additional outcomes, such as cost reduction, were noticeably absent in the medium and low volume groups.;The <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> disposal network represents an efficient residual management system, applications from which can be applied to other by-products. The research framework developed as part of this study represents a starting point for evaluating plant disposition strategies and an opportunity to apply aspects of a market driven disposal system to other materials...|$|R
40|$|The use of <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> in {{the world}} {{continues}} to increase due {{to a number of}} reasons including depletion of high quality iron ore, and requirement of reduction of CO 2 gas emission. However, tramp elements in <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> such as Cu hinder it from being used for source of wide range of steel grades, since they may cause harmful defects in the final products. Therefore, development of a new technology which is effective in removing the tramp elements or nullifying their harmful effects is essential to utilize <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> more widely. A number of technological attempts have been proposed for copper removal; namely, sulfide flux refining, vacuum distillation, low melting point bath, and chlorination. However, none of them has yet been fully successful for practical application because of various reasons including low efficiency, high cost and adverse effect on the environment...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the worldwide increase in consumption of galvanized steel for automobiles in the last fifteen years, {{and the cost of}} environmental compliance associated with remelting larger quantities of galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>scrap,</b> processes are being developed to separate and recover the steel and zinc from galvanized <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap.</b> In the process discussed here, zinc is dissolved from the scrap in hot caustic and is recovered electrolytically as dendritic powder. The dezinced <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> is rinsed and used directly. The process is effective for zinc, lead, and aluminum removal on loose and baled scrap and on all types of galvanized steel. Pilot testing has been conducted in Hamilton, Ontario for batch treatment of 900 tonnes of mostly baled scrap. A pilot plant in East Chicago, Indiana, now in its second generation, has dezinced in a continuous process mode about 1, 800 tonnes of loose clips and shredded stamping plant scrap; this scrap typically has residual zinc below 0. 05 % and sodium dragout below 0. 001 %.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to provide an overview of the market for <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> (or <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap)</b> for steelmaking. A simple theoretical discussion of scrap markets is outlined, and constitutes the basis for a discussion of consumption and supply behaviour, international trade patterns and the development of scrap prices over time and across world regions. The geographical scope is essentially worldwide, but we pay particular attention to market behaviour and outcomes in Europe and the USA. In pursuing the above the paper also reviews past research efforts on <b>steel</b> <b>scrap</b> markets, and identifies topics for future economic research in the field. We emphasize that improved knowledge about scrap markets ought to provide important lessons for public policy measures aimed at further increasing steel recycling rates as well as for environmental impact assessment studies.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the relevant problem of iron-and-steel companies saving on purchasing the scrap metal. The {{analysis of the}} current state of the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> market in the Russian Federation, trends of its development, led the authors to an opportunity to reduce the cost for purchasing scrap trough the optimal distribution of the regions between Russian iron-and-steel companies where they purchase <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap.</b> The optimization of the regional structure of the scrap procurement taking into account the regional volumes of its generation and consumption results from using the linear programming methods applying three variants of the problem statement: minimizing the total cost of the scrap delivery to the factory, minimizing the total cost of the scrap at the “export parity” price with delivery, minimizing the total cost of the scrap at the actual prices with delivery. The authors have developed software for performing the calculations. The source are the database of the JSC Russian Railways, which provides information about the transportation of the <b>ferrous</b> <b>scrap</b> between stations of the Russian Federation by railroad; railway rates guide between railway stations of the Russian Federation; statistical data on the prices for scrap metal of the type 3 A in “export windows”; actual purchasing prices for the scrap of the 3 A type for the range of separate companies of the Russian Federation for several years. As a result, the authors have obtained the optimal regional structure of scrap purchasing for customers in the Russian Federation. We have formulated the recommendations for individual companies regarding the optimal routes of the procurement with scrap. The study has confirmed the possibility to decrease expanses for purchasing the scrap metal for all iron-and-steel factories of the Russian Federation through the optimization of the regional structure of procurement. It is also has allowed to estimate the possibility to cut expenses by using the optimal strategies allowing to choose the region of procurement...|$|R
