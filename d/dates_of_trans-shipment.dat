40|$|The city of Dordrecht {{has always}} had a strong {{connection}} to the rivers surrounding it. In the early days the city was the centre <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> <b>of</b> goods on the north-south and east-west trade routes across Europe. In these days, the rivers formed the only entrance to the city. In the last two centuries the city was connected to land infrastructure (railway and roads), which led to a shift of the city centre. With the coming of the railway and its station south of Dordrecht in 1872 the main entrance to the city was shifted from the rivers to the land. This led to a shift of the location of the city centre, it used to be parallel to the river, now it shifted more to the south, leading to regression in the old city centre and to a diminished connection with the other cities on the river banks (Zwijndrecht and Papendrecht).

40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} simulation hemi-metrics between {{certain forms}} of turnbased 2 1 -player games played on infinite topological spaces. They have the desir- 2 able property of bounding the difference in payoffs obtained by starting from one state or another. All constructions are described as the special case of a unique one, which we call the Hutchinson hemi-metric on various spaces of continuous previsions. We show a directed form of the Kantorovich-Rubinstein theorem, stating that the Hutchinson hemi-metric on spaces of continuous probability valuations coincides with a notion <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> hemi-metric. We also identify the class of so-called sym-compact spaces as the right class of topological spaces, where the theory works out as nicely as possible. ...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the 1820s, Norwich {{was served}} by vessels using the River Yare, which flows through Breydon Water {{before joining the}} River Bure and then the North Sea near Great Yarmouth. Breydon Water is a wide expanse of shallow water, and {{therefore}} required cargo arriving at Yarmouth to be trans-shipped into smaller vessels which could then reach Norwich. There was discontent among the merchants of Norwich at the cost <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment,</b> and allegations <b>of</b> systematic theft of cargo, {{which resulted in a}} court case in 1820, when 18 men were convicted of taking the goods and another of receiving it. Against this background, William Cubitt was asked to investigate possible solutions in 1814.|$|R
50|$|Economy of MontrealIn the 17th century, Montreal {{acted as}} a point <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> and a {{stopover}} on the passage to the interior. Due to the rapids upriver from Montreal, free sailing through the Saint-Laurence ended in Montreal. Portages inland were then taken. This effectively made Montreal a major distribution centre rather than a mere trading post. Pelts and merchandise were stocked for distribution inland and out. Montreal lacked moorings in the 17th century, forcing trans-Atlantic vessels with larger capacity to unload at Quebec. Goods from Quebec had to be transported by river between the two towns until {{the construction of a}} road in 1735. Montreal remained subservient to Quebec due to its isolation. Trade between Montreal and France remained indirect.|$|R

40|$|This paper derives the {{mathematical}} expressions for the transit time of cargo through a liner shipping network. Main efforts {{are devoted to}} deriving the calculation expressions of the connection time <b>of</b> cargo during <b>trans-shipment.</b> For the forward and many-to-one trans-shipment policies, we conduct a minor correction towards the expressions in existing studies to improve the completeness. Meanwhile, we propose an alternative but more straightforward calculation method for connection time which bypasses the complicated inductive argument in existing studies. Then we introduce two new trans-shipment policies: backward trans-shipment and one-to-many trans-shipment, and mathematically calculate the corresponding connection times. Numerical experiments also deliver some managerial insights into the effectiveness <b>of</b> backward <b>trans-shipment</b> in transit time control. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R

500|$|The {{terminal}} {{was very}} successful {{for the first five}} years of operation, but then events began to move against it. The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCs began to appear less satisfactory than had originally been anticipated. Shipping goods in the form of infrequent but very large loads involves engaging more idle capital in the form of stock than the alternatives. Also, the process <b>of</b> <b>trans-shipment</b> is costly. The whole economic basis of the Whiddy terminal was incompatible with the [...] "just-in-time" [...] approach to industrial management which was being widely adopted at the time. That apart, the late 1970s had a levelling-off in demand for oil as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the use of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned. Thus, by the late 1970s, the local Gulf operating company (Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd) was struggling to maintain the viability of the terminal. The company was forced to undertake a number of cost-saving measures.|$|R
