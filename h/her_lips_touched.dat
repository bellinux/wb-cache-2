60|$|She {{came close}} to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soon after.|$|E
6000|$|Sue bent {{her head}} down upon her hands, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> her own fingers there where her friend's had rested in {{gratitude}} and love, and she cried, cried like a broken-hearted woman, cried for her lost illusions, {{and the end of}} her brief romance! ...|$|E
6000|$|His heart gave a great leap, but he {{controlled}} himself. Intuitively he {{knew how}} much was permitted to him; {{he seemed to have}} even some faint perception of the cause for her strange request. He bent over and took her face for a moment between his hands; <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> his--she had kissed him! ...|$|E
60|$|He {{heard her}} voice say something, felt <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touching</b> his nose, and, snuggling up beside her who lay awake and loved him with her thoughts, he fell into the dreamless sleep, which rounded off his past.|$|R
50|$|And when <b>her</b> loving <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> mine {{it carried}} me to heaven.|$|R
6000|$|Peter {{hesitated a}} little, {{guessing}} a plot, while she bent forward till <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> almost <b>touched</b> {{his ear and}} said in a still lower voice: ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time, the maid's impenetrable {{composure}} completely failed her. The smouldering fire in Fanny Mere flamed up. She impulsively kissed Mountjoy's hand. The moment <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> it she shrank back: the natural pallor {{of her face}} became whiter than ever. Startled by the sudden change, Hugh asked if she was ill.|$|E
60|$|But {{the moment}} of speech was for ever gone--the moment for asking pardon of her, {{if he wanted to}} ask it. Could he read the full {{forgiveness}} that was written in her eyes? She never knew; for, as she was bending to kiss him, the thick veil of death fell between them, and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> a corpse.|$|E
6000|$|Then she put {{her face}} very close to his, so that <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> his ear, and she laid her hand heavily upon his arm, {{and she was very}} confidential. Souchey listened to the whisper till his face grew longer and longer. [...] "'Tis for her soul," [...] said Lotta--"for her poor soul's sake. When you can save her by raising your hand, would you let her be damned for ever?" ...|$|E
60|$|He felt <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touch</b> his lightly, and {{the next}} moment she was gone. Her white dress gleamed in the distance, and then the opaque {{darkness}} of the house seemed to swallow it. Heyst waited a little before he went the same way, round the corner, up {{the steps of the}} veranda, and into his room, where he lay down at last--not to sleep, but to go over in his mind all that had been said at their meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Live, my angel, live!" [...] she murmured, tenderly, with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> just <b>touching</b> his. [...] "All {{your life}} is before you--a happy life, and an honored life, if you are freed from me!" ...|$|R
60|$|She bent towards him; <b>her</b> sweet <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> his brow; {{the perfume}} from {{her breath and}} hair beat upon him; the light of her wondrous eyes searched out his very soul, reading the answer that was written there.|$|R
60|$|She {{entered and}} drew near. I felt her come! Every pulse of my poor frame beat {{an answer to}} her footfall, and all my mighty love and hate rose from the {{darkness}} of my death-like sleep, and rent me in their struggle! She leaned over me; her ambrosial breath played upon my face: I could hear the beating of her heart! Lower she leaned, till at last <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> me softly on the brow.|$|E
60|$|Austrian affairs are not now {{in their}} nadir-point; a long while now since they passed that. Austria, to all {{appearance}} dead, started up, and began to strike for herself, with some success, the instant Walpole's SOUP-ROYAL (that first 200,000 pounds, followed since by abundance more) got to <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> <b>Touched</b> her poor pale lips; and went tingling through her, like life and fiery elasticity, out of death by inanition! Cardinal moment, which History knows, but can never date, except vaguely, some time in 1741; among the last acts of judicious Walpole.|$|E
60|$|And Paula pressed {{closer to}} her husband, and was pressed, as <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> his forehead, and as the pair of them, gazing at the empty road among the lilacs, saw it filled with the eruptive vision of Mountain Lad, majestic and mighty, the gnat-creature of a man upon his back absurdly small; his eyes wild and desirous, with the blue sheen that {{surfaces}} the eyes of stallions; his mouth, flecked with the froth and fret of high spirit, now brushed to burnished knees of impatience, now tossed skyward to utterance of that vast, compelling call that shook the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{forget your}} promise," [...] Jess whispered to him, bending {{down as he}} helped her into the cart, so low that <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> almost <b>touched</b> him, and her breath rested for a second on his cheek like {{the ghost of a}} kiss.|$|R
6000|$|... "Be a man," [...] {{she whispered}} again, {{so low that}} the sound {{scarcely}} reached his ears although <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were almost <b>touching</b> them, [...] "go, and mind you strike home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{belong to}} me, all of them," [...] he declared, bending over <b>her</b> till his <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> cheek. [...] "Some day I am very sure that I shall take them all into my charge." ...|$|R
6000|$|Each {{morning she}} rose early, dressed, and slipped {{away to the}} village to post her letter. From the woods across the river wild pigeons would be calling--as though Love itself pleaded with her afresh each day. She was back well before breakfast, {{to go up to}} her room and come down again as if for the first time. The Colonel, meeting her on the stairs, or in the hall, would say: [...] "Ah, my dear! just beaten you! Slept well?" [...] And, while <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> his cheek, slanted at the proper angle for uncles, he never dreamed that she had been three miles already through the dew.|$|E
60|$|But he did sleep, {{all through}} {{a night of}} many dreams, {{in the last of}} which he was lying on a {{mountain}} side, Anna looking down into his eyes, and bending her face to his. He woke just as <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> him. Still under the spell of that troubling dream, he became conscious of the sound of wheels and horses' hoofs on the gravel, and sprang out of bed. There was the waggonette moving from the door, old Godden driving, luggage piled up beside him, and the Stormers sitting opposite each other in the carriage. Going away like that--having never even said good-bye! For a moment he felt as people must when they have unwittingly killed someone--utterly stunned and miserable. Then he dashed into his clothes. He would not let her go thus! He would--he must--see her again! What had he done that she should go like this? He rushed downstairs. The hall was empty; nineteen minutes to eight! The train left at eight o'clock. Had he time to saddle Bolero? He rushed round to the stables; but the cob was out, being shoed. He would--he must get there in time. It would show her anyway that he was not quite a cad. He walked till the drive curved, then began running hard. A quarter of a mile, and already he felt better, not so miserable and guilty; it was something to feel you had a tough job in hand, all your work cut out--something to have to think of economizing strength, picking out the best going, keeping out of the sun, saving your wind uphill, flying down any slope. It was cool still, and the dew had laid the dust; there was no traffic and scarcely anyone to look back and gape as he ran by. What he would do, if he got there in time--how explain this mad three-mile run--he did not think. He passed a farm that he knew was just half-way. He had left his watch. Indeed, he had put on only his trousers, shirt, and Norfolk jacket; no tie, no hat, not even socks under his tennis shoes, and he was as hot as fire, with his hair flying back--a strange young creature indeed for anyone to meet. But he had lost now all feeling, save the will to get there. A flock of sheep came out of a field into the lane. He pushed through them somehow, but they lost him several seconds. More than a mile still; and he was blown, and his legs beginning to give! Downhill indeed they went of their own accord, but there was the long run-in, quite level; and he could hear the train, now slowly puffing its way along the valley. Then, in spite of exhaustion, his spirit rose. He would not go in looking like a scarecrow, utterly done, and make a scene. He must pull himself together at the end, and stroll in--as if he had come for fun. But how--seeing that at any moment he felt he might fall flat in the dust, and stay there for ever! And, as he ran, he made little desperate efforts to mop his face, and brush his clothes. There were the gates, at last--two hundred yards away. The train, he could hear no longer. It must be standing in the station. And a sob came from his overdriven lungs. He heard the guard's whistle as he reached the gates. Instead of making for the booking-office, he ran along the paling, where an entrance to the goods'-shed was open, and dashing through he fell back against the honeysuckle. The engine was just abreast of him; he snatched at his sleeve and passed it over his face, to wipe the sweat away. Everything was blurred. He must see--surely he had not come in time just not to see! He pushed his hands over his forehead and hair, and spied up dizzily at the slowly passing train. She was there, at a window! Standing, looking out! He dared not step forward, for fear of falling, but he put out his hand--She saw him. Yes, she saw him! Wasn't she going to make a sign? Not one? And suddenly he saw her tear at her dress, pluck something out, and throw it. It fell close to his feet. He did not pick it up--he wanted to see her face till she was gone. It looked wonderful--very proud, and pale. She put her hand up to her lips. Then everything went blurred again and when he could see once more, the train had vanished. But at his feet was what she had thrown. He picked it up! All dry and dark, it was the flower she had given him in the Tyrol, and stolen back from his buttonhole.|$|E
60|$|Aziel {{bent down}} over the swooning girl, looking into her pale face, till <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> almost <b>touched</b> his own, and his breath beating on her brow seemed to give her life again. Now she stirred, and now {{she opened her eyes}} and gazed back at him a while, deeply and with meaning, even as he gazed at her.|$|R
60|$|She {{shuddered and}} was silent, holding down {{her head on}} her husband's breast. When she raised it, his white nightrobe was stained with blood where <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> had <b>touched,</b> and where the thin open wound in the neck had sent forth drops. The instant she saw it she drew back, with a low wail, and whispered, amidst choking sobs.|$|R
50|$|Died, praising God for {{his gift}} and grace:For she bowed {{down to him}} weeping, and said“Live”; and her tears were shed on his faceOr ever the life in his face was shed.The sharp tears fell through her hair, and stungOnce, and <b>her</b> close <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> him and clungOnce, and grew one with his lips for a space;And so drew back, and the man was dead.|$|R
6000|$|Looking {{across at}} the girl, in whose cheeks the roses were {{beginning}} to bloom again, the youth resented the interposition of the supernatural. He was eager to approach her, to hint {{at the memory of}} her secret, sweet embrace. As he studied the exquisite curve of <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> their <b>touch</b> burned again upon his flesh, and he rose with sudden reassertion of himself. [...] "Come, Leo, let's return to Morselli." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the ringing}} of the chimes of Sloperton parish church met her ear. Alice knew that the sound {{signified}} that the marriage party had entered the church, {{and that she was}} secure from interruption. With a childish smile upon <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> Alice Sedilia <b>touched</b> off the slow-match.|$|R
60|$|The child's eyes flashed, and {{his brow}} grew {{as red as}} fire. It was but a {{momentary}} fierceness; the next instant he clasped {{his hands over his}} face, and wept in a violent convulsion of grief and shame. Little Elsie clasped her arms about him, kissing his brow and chin, which were all that <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> could <b>touch,</b> under his clasped hands; but Ned turned away uncomforted, and was blindly making his way towards the door.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] she said, in her rich, remembered voice, [...] "thou art no suitor; {{it shall}} not be. Of lovers and worshippers {{henceforth}} as before, I {{can find a}} plenty if I will, or even if I will it not. But where shall I find another friend like to thee, O Holly, whom thus I greet?" [...] and leaning towards me, with <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> she <b>touched</b> me also on the brow--just touched me, and no more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Give me a kiss, mamma." [...] Then the Countess bent {{her head}} and allowed <b>her</b> daughter's <b>lips</b> to <b>touch</b> <b>her</b> cheeks. In old days,--days that were not so very old,--she would kiss her child as though such embraces were the only food that nourished her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'The devil {{take his}} head!' mused Clennam, {{still looking at}} the fire; 'it's always on one side.' He roused himself to persuade her to put some wine to <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and to <b>touch</b> {{something}} to eat--it was very difficult, she was so timid and shy--and then said, musing again: 'Is my mother at all changed to you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Her</b> fresh young <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> my old {{withered}} cheek first, {{and then}} Owen's; a soft, momentary shadow of tenderness, {{that was very}} pretty and becoming, passing quickly over the sunshine and gayety of {{her face as she}} saluted us. The next moment she was on her feet again, inquiring [...] "who the wonderful man was who built The Glen Tower," [...] and wanting to go all over it immediately from top to bottom.|$|R
60|$|Then, remembering {{where she}} was, alarmed lest her mother {{might come in}} and find her there, she left the sofa, turned out the {{sputtering}} lamp, {{and ran into the}} bedroom. Rain was splashing on the bricks of the passage-way outside, the shadows of the night still lurked in the corners; by the grey light she gazed at Lise, who breathed loudly and stirred uneasily, her mouth open, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> parched. Janet <b>touched</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} three o'clock, and feeling her fingers quite stiff with cold, she {{determined}} to go quietly down to the drawing-room {{in the hope of}} finding a fire lighted there so as to warm her hands. Miss Starbrow had not returned, and the house was very still, and after standing a few moments on the landing, anxious not to rouse the maid and draw a fresh volley of abuse on herself, she went softly down the stairs, and opened the drawing-room door. For a moment or two she stood motionless, and then muttering some incoherent apology turned and fled back to her room. For there, very much at his ease, sat Captain Horton, with Rosie on his knees, her arms about his neck, and <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> either <b>touching</b> his or in very close proximity to them.|$|R
60|$|She {{fell asleep}} presently, and woke with a start. There, in {{a glimmer of}} pale light, stood the little model, as in the fatal picture Bianca had painted of her. Her face was powder white, with shadows beneath the eyes. Breath seemed coming through <b>her</b> parted <b>lips,</b> just <b>touched</b> with colour. In her hat lay the tiny peacock's feather beside the two purplish-pink roses. A scent came from her, too--but faint, as ever was the scent of chicory flower. How long had she been {{standing}} there? Bianca started to her feet, and as she rose the vision vanished.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time in her maiden's life, a man's <b>lips</b> <b>touched</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> All that had been perplexing and strange, all that had been innocently {{wonderful}} to herself in the feeling that bound Sydney to her first friend, was a mystery no more. Love lifted its veil, Nature revealed its secrets, in the one supreme moment of that kiss. She threw her arms around his neck with a low cry of delight--and returned his kiss.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{pronounced}} very similarly to the bilabial nasal , except {{instead of the}} <b>lips</b> <b>touching</b> each other, the lower <b>lip</b> <b>touches</b> the upper teeth. The position of the lips and teeth is generally {{the same as for}} the production of the other labiodental consonants, like [...] and , though closure is incomplete for the fricatives.|$|R
60|$|Yet, {{strange to}} say, she felt not one qualm of {{conscience}} for their stolen meeting. No feminine terror, no fluttering fear, disturbed her equanimity. It almost {{seemed to her}} as if Bertram's kiss had released her by magic, at once and for ever, from the taboos of her nation. She had slipped out from home unperceived, that night, in fear and trembling, with many sinkings of heart and dire misgivings, while Robert and Phil were downstairs in the smoking-room; she had slunk round, crouching low, to Miss Blake's lodgings: and she had terrified her soul on the way with a good woman's doubts and a good woman's fears as to the wrongfulness of her attempt {{to say good-bye to}} the friend she might now no longer mix with. But from the moment <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and Bertram's <b>touched,</b> all fear and doubt seemed utterly to have vanished; she lay there all night in a fierce ecstasy of love, hugging herself for strange delight, thinking only of Bertram, and wondering what manner of thing was this promised freedom whereof her lover had spoken to her so confidently. She trusted him now; she knew he would do right, and right alone: whatever he advised, she would be safe in following.|$|R
