In recent years, some studies tried successfully to introduce one ether group or more into biodiesel molecules to further reduce smoke emissions, and a novel biodiesel synthesized via the transesterification of fatty acids methyl esters with short chain glycol ethers, such as ethylene glycol monobutyl ether palm oil monoester (Jiang and Yun 2012), ethylene glycol n-propyl ether palm oil monoester (Gao et al. 2011), ethylene glycol monoethyl ether soybean oil monoester (Zhang et al. 2006), and ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> palm oil monoester (Jiang et al. 2011; Guo et al. 2015 a) et al. have been developed. Compared with the traditional biodiesel, novel biodiesel with higher oxygen content for introducing an ether group can effectively improve the combustion and emission performance (Guo et al. 2013; Guo et al. 2015 b; Chen et al. 2014 a). At present, novel biodiesel is mainly prepared by homogeneous base catalyst, such as sodium alcoholate (Zhang et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2015 c) and KOH (Li et al. 2012; Jiang 2012). The usage of homogeneous catalysts produced large amounts of caustic wastewater giving rise to serious environmental pollution and post-processing was complex (Deshmane and Adewuyi 2013). Recently, Na 2 SiO 3 (Fan et al. 2013), KF/HTL (Chen et al. 2014 b) and KF/CaO/Kaolinite (Guo et al. 2015 c) acting as solid base catalysts have been respectively used in the production of novel biodiesel of ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> soybean oil ester and ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> monolaurate. The results demonstrates the heterogeneous solid bases show good catalytic performance, and the catalytic processes have fewer unit operations. Moreover, the simple methods of filtration, centrifugation can be easily used to separate the solid catalyst from the reaction system. It has becoming a promising route for the production of novel biodiesel.|$|R

Polished silicon wafers (15 [*]×[*] 15  mm 2), which were cleaned successively in acetone and DI water for 10  min in anultrasonic bath, were used as substrates. ZnO seed layer was prepared by sol-gel process. Ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> [C 3 H 8 O 2] and monoethanol amine (MEA) were used as the solvent and stabilizing agent, respectively. Zinc acetate dihydrate [Zn(CH 3 COO) 2 2 H 2 O] was dissolved {{in a mixture of}} ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> and MEA at room temperature. The obtained solution was stirred using magnetic stirrer at 60 °C for 2  h to obtain clear and homogeneous solution. The ZnO seed layer was prepared by spin-coating technology with a rate of 3, 000  rpm for 30  s. After each spin coating, the seed layer was kept at 150 °C for 10  min and this procedure was repeated two times. The seed layer was annealed at 600 °C for 1  h and then cooled down to RT. Subsequently, ZnO thin films were synthesized by hydrothermal method on the ZnO seed layer. Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO 3) 2 [*]·[*] 6 H 2 O) and equimolar hexamethylenetetramine (C 6 H 12 N 4, HMT) dissolved in 40  mL-mixed solvents of DI water and ethylene <b>glycol</b> <b>monomethyl</b> <b>ether</b> (EGME). The concentration of zinc nitrate hexahydrate was 0.06  mol/L. The DI water content x in the mixed solvents was 0 %, 40 %, 80 %, and 100 %, respectively. The solution was transferred to a 50 -mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave (Machinery Factory of USTC, Hefei, China) and the ZnO seed layer was placed {{in the bottom of the}} autoclave. Growth of ZnO thin film was carried out at 115 °C for 2  h in an oven. After growth, the as-prepared ZnO thin film was removed from the solution, rinsed with DI water, and dried at 60 °C.|$|R
