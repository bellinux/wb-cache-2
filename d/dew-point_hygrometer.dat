50|$|Daniell {{was born}} in London. In 1831 {{he became the first}} {{professor}} of chemistry at the newly founded King's College London; and in 1835 he was appointed to the equivalent post at the East India Company's Military Seminary at Addiscombe, Surrey. His name {{is best known for his}} invention of the Daniell cell, an element of an electric battery much better than voltaic cells. He also invented the <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> known by his name (Quar. Journ. Sci., 1820), and a register pyrometer (Phil. Trans., 1830); and in 1830 he erected in the hall of the Royal Society a water-barometer, with which he carried out a large number of observations. A process devised by him for the manufacture of illuminating gas from turpentine and resin was in use in New York City for a time.|$|E
40|$|Two Bowen ratio-energy balance (BREB) {{systems for}} {{measuring}} evapotranspiration (ET) under {{wet and dry}} conditions were compared. The study sites were an irrigated grass sod near Kimberly, Idaho and a sagebrush-grass range site on the Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed near Boise, Idaho. One Bowen ratio system used positive-head, ceramic-wick, aspirated psychrometers. The other system measured the vapor gradients with a cooled-mirror, <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> Differences in the amounts of ET measured by the two systems were very small and of little practical consequence. The system using a single-mirror, <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> was the most reliable, required the least maintenance, and was the easiest to use. jntroduction The importance of evapotranspiration (ET) measurements is well recognized. In both rainfed and irrigated agriculture, knowledge of ET is used to evaluate management systems. In irrigated agriculture, ET is the primary input into irrigation scheduling algorithms. On arid and semiarid rangelands, ET is {{a major component of}} the water-balance equation, and accurate measurements or calculations of ET are essential to the development and application of hydrologic models. Micrometeorological methods and lysimeters have been used extensively to measure ET in rainfed and irrigated cropping systems. On rangelands, articularly in arid and semiarid regions, water balance and, to some extent, imetry have been the primary method of determining ET. Only recently have micrometerlogical methods such as the BREB been used in the drier rangeland environments...|$|E
40|$|The vapour {{sorption}} isotherms of five typical baked foods {{were determined}} at 20 °C. In particular, the methodology proposed by Cost Projects 90 and 90 bis have been used. The latter procedure implies using a proper {{number of pieces}} of each product. The products have been closed in desiccators, in which nine different equilibrium relative (ERH) humidity have been created. The relative humidity inside desiccators have been checked daily until equilibrium, before piacing sampies. Moisture content of samples has been measured by a gravimetrie method, while water activity has been determined by a <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> AlI obtained data have been interpoiated to fit the GAB equation or other equations and the mean relative percentage deviation modulus (E...|$|E
40|$|An {{airborne}} {{differential absorption}} lidar (DIAL) system has been developed at the NASA Langley Research Center for remote measurements of atmospheric water vapor (H 2 O) and aerosols. A solid-state alexandrite laser with a 1 -pm linewidth and greater than 99. 85 % spectral purity {{was used as the}} on-line transmitter. Solid-state avalanche photodiode detector technology has replaced photomultiplier tubes in the receiver system, providing an average increase by a factor of 1. 5 - 2. 5 in the signal-to-noise ratio of the H 2 O measurement. By incorporating advanced diagnostic and data-acquisition instrumentation into other subsystems, we achieved additional improvements in system operational reliability and measurement accuracy. Laboratory spectroscopic measurements of H 2 O absorption-line parameters were performed to reduce the uncertainties in our knowledge of the absorption cross sections. Line-center H 2 O absorption cross sections were determined, with errors of 3 - 6 %, for more than 120 lines in the 720 -nm region. Flight tests of the system were conducted during 1989 - 1991 on the NASA Wallops Flight Facility Electra aircraft, and extensive intercomparison measurements were performed with <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometers</b> and H 2 O radiosondes. The H 2 O distributions measured with the DIAL system differed by less than 10 % from the profiles determined with the in situ probes in a variety of atmospheric conditions...|$|R
40|$|Determination of {{air density}} and the {{quantitative}} estimates of water vapour adsorbed or desorbed by {{the surface of}} mass standard, remain the principals sources of uncertainties when weighing mass standard made from stainless steel or super alloy. The classical method, for air density determination, use the so called CIPM- 1981 / 91 formula and the measured air parameters. An other approach is based only {{on the results of}} comparisons, realized successively in air and in vacuum, between special artefacts. The distribution and the state of water molecules inside the chamber of mass comparator influence the results of weighing. Also, the instruments used for air moisture measurement are either, not very sensitive (capacitive hygrometer) or disturbing for environment (<b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer).</b> To control that, a proposal method is given and observations of water vapour behaviour inside the enclosure for different conditions are reported.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{measurements}} of a quasi-spherical microwave resonator {{used as a}} <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> In conventional dew-point hygrometers, the condensation of water from humid gas flowing over a mirror is detected optically, and the mirror surface is then temperature-controlled to yield a stable condensed layer. In our experiments we flowed moist air from a humidity generator through a quasi-spherical resonator and detected the onset of condensation by measuring the frequency ratio of selected microwave modes. We verified the basic operation of the device over the dew-point range 9. 5 – 13. 5 ◦C by comparison with calibrated chilled-mirror hygrometers. These tests indicate that the microwave method may allow a quantitative estimation of the volume and thickness of the water layer which is condensed on the inner surface of the resonator. The experiments reported here are preliminary due to the limited time available for the work, but show {{the potential of the}} method for detecting not only water but a variety of other liquid or solid condensates. The robust all-metal construction should make the device appropriate for use in industrial applications over a wide range of temperatures and pressures...|$|E
40|$|A photo tube <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> is {{used for}} {{measuring}} humidity of respiratory gases, which are in varying conditions. It {{makes it possible to}} make an accurate, precise, continuous and automatic recording of the dew point of gas flows. The most notable features of this device are: (1) Simplicity of calculating absolute humidity, since the humidity is indicated with dew point. (2) Calibration is easy and reliable. (3) Performance is stable, and its operation and maintenance are simple. (4) Indication is correct and unaffected by temperature. (5) There is good response to any quick changes in humidity. (6) There is continuous and automatic recording of humidity, especially with simultaneous temperature measurements on the same paper. (7) Impurities such as the vapors of organic substances or volatile agents do not affect the performance. Simple wiping can eliminate the disturbance from mirror contamination. (8) The entire apparatus is on a cart and easily movable. This device provides a new method of studying the functional relationship between humidity and various respiratory states, and it is hoped it will contribute much to physiological and clinical investigations.

40|$|Partial {{submergence}} induces rapid internodal elongation in deepwater rice (Oryza sativa L., cv Habiganj Aman II). We {{measured in}} vivo extensibility, tissue tension, hydraulic conductance and osmotic {{potential in the}} region of cell elongation in the uppermost internode. The in vivo extensibility of the internode, measured by stretching of living tissue with a custom-made constant stress extensiometer, rose rapidly following submergence of the plant. Both the elastic (Eel) and plastic (Epl) extensibility increased when growth of the internode was induced. The submerged internode displayed tissue tension (elastic outward bending of longitudinally split internode sections); in air-grown control internodes, no such bending occurred. The hydraulic conductance, estimated from the kinetics of tissue shrinkage in 0. 5 molar mannitol and subsequent swelling in distilled water, was not changed by submergence. The osmotic potential, measured with a <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> using frozen-thawed tissue, was only 18 % less negative in the submerged internode than in the air-grown control. This indicates that osmoregulation takes place in rapidly elongating rice internodes. We suggest that the rapid expansion of the newly formed internodal cells of submerged plants is controlled by the yielding properties (Epl) of the cell walls. Experiments with excised stem sections indicate that gibberellin is involved in increasing the Epl of the elongating cell walls...|$|E
40|$|The main drying {{paths of}} the water {{retention}} curves of lime-treated soils were measured. Aggregate size effect on the water retention property was emphasised. Four soil powders with different maximum aggregate sizes (Dmax = 5, 2, 1 and 0. 4 mm) were prepared and mixed with 2 % quicklime (by weight of dry soil). Samples were prepared by static compaction at dry side of optimum water content (w = 17 %) with a dry density of 1. 65 Mg/m 3. Suction measurement was performed by a <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> at different curing periods (t = 7, 28 and 90 days). The results obtained show that: i) aggregate size effect is insignificant on the water retention curve of untreated soil in the studied suction range (ca 500 kPa ~ 55 MPa); ii) lime treatment gradually improves the soil water retention capacity with the increasing of curing time; iii) aggregate size effect on water retention property of lime-treated soil becomes significant in the suction range from ca 860 kPa to 9 MPa on the long curing term: treated soils prepared with smaller aggregate size (S 0. 4 and S 1) have a higher water retention capacity rather than soils prepared with larger aggregate size (S 5) ...|$|E
40|$|Wildfires {{increased}} hillslopes {{erosion and}} surface runoff. The effect increased by several magnitudes when subjected to high intensity of precipitation during prolonged rainy seasons. The changes in geotechnical properties of soils affected by wildfire may jeopardize {{the stability of}} the slopes. In this study, soil specimens containing thermal sensitive nesosilicate polymorphs undergone wildfire and non-exposed to fire were collected and tested {{in order to understand the}} changes to the geotechnical properties and water retention behavior. Similarly, the changes to the slope were monitored up to a period of 270 days. The suction-water content soil water characteristic curves (SWCCs) were established for the soils using a chilled mirror <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> In addition, the changes in the mineral compositions were also evaluated using X-ray diffraction analysis. Test results indicated that, the plasticity characteristics of the soils decreased after being burned. Concurrent to the decreased in the plasticity, the suction-water content established for soil exposed to wildfire was found to be slightly lower than that of unburned soils for suction lower than 1. 5 MPa. Nesosilicates was found to be completely altered and affected by fire, whereas quartz minerals were found to be unaffected. Erosion occurred on-site was found to be attributed to reduction in the plasticity characteristics and changes to the overall mineral structure of the soil. Furthermore, the removal of vegetation as affected by fire reduced the slope surface cover and caused erosion of the slope to occur...|$|E
40|$|The work {{examines}} {{the basis of}} a <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> which senses the incipience of dew by the change in surface resistance of a cooled insulator. The study is primarily concerned with soda-lime glass surfaces although silica and polymers were briefly examined in the experimental work. The water vapour adsorption process ion glass is reviewed and the ensuing chemical and physical modification of the surface structure is noted. The water vapour to liquid water phase transition was shown to be basically a droplet nucleation process in surface features such as cracks and scratches. A condensation rate equation was developed, and extended to a model which simulates the nucleation process in surface pits and the growth rates of droplets. An experimental apparatus is described which enabled small insulator specimens to be cooled over a carefully controlled temperature range in a gas stream of constant humidity. The surface resistivity and a microscopic examination of the growing dew deposit were simultaneously monitored during the cooling process. The measured resistivity characteristics were in good agreement with earlier work, but have been more accurately compared with the thermodynamic dew-point temperature. Soluble surface materials in the soda-lime glass were shown to have a considerable influence on the temperature at which the dew deposit formed. A computer-based model of the surface film and coalescing droplets has predicted some of the observed resistivity inflection characteristics at the dew-point. The measured droplet growth rates were in good agreement with the predicted rates; and the rate process of condensation has been satisfactorily related to the time dependent surface resistivity characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Through {{the use of}} an {{automatic}} photo tube <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer,</b> the author succeeded in measuring dew point of gas flows continuously in anesthetic circuits. Simultaneous thermometries were done on the nasal or oral mucosa, on the respiratory gas flows in the anesthetic mask or the endotracheal tube, and on the gas in the inhaling conduit. Experiments were performed on ten adults patients undergoing various types of surgery under general inhalation anesthesia. Anesthetic technics were varied intentionally during the measurements. Thus, both absolute and relative humidities of exhaled and inhaled gases, and respiratory water and heat losses were calculated under various anesthetic conditions, and physiological and clinical considerations were discussed. The conclusions obtained from this research are as follows: (1) When a non-rebreathing system is applied, moisture content of exhaled gas is minimal, and respiratory losses of both water and heat are maximum. With a semi-closed circle method, according to decreasing fresh gas flows, the humidity of the inspiratory and expiratory gases becomes higher, and both heat and water losses through respiration are lessened. When a closed circle method, with carbon dioxide absorption, is employed, temperature and humidity of gas in the inhaling conduit are highest, and the expired gas offers the maximum temperature and moisture contenL Both water and heat losses from anesthesia become minimal when administered in a closed system. (2) While the water and heat that a patient loses through respiration increase with increasing breathing capacity, they are still small parts of the total water and heat losses of the patient. Water and heat losses via anesthesia systems are not so predominant in maintaining water balance and heat regulation of patients during anesthesia and surgery. </p...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the third}} semiannual status report {{describing}} the University of Wyoming participation in project FIFE, under NASA Grant NAG 5 - 913. The reader is referred to {{the first and second}} semiannual status reports for this grant for descriptions of University of Wyoming participation in the field operations of 1987. This report is concerned with continuing analysis of field data. Most of the instrument calibration effort has concentrated on interpretation and use of the high-rate water vapor measurements with the University of Wyoming Lyman-alpha device. In addition, fluxes of water vapor have been corrected for sensible heat flux, and all the high-rate (10 Hz for the Wyoming King Air) data have been filtered before the flux calculations. For each flight the Lyman-alpha data (10 Hz) are calibrated against the Cambridge <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> (1 Hz), by using data from the take-off sounding. The reasoning here is that the takeoff sounding (held to 500 fpm rate-of-climb specifically for the calibration) covers the widest range of humidity conditions of any sequence of the flight. For each takeoff sounding, then, the Lyman-alpha data, averaged to 1 Hz, are matched to the dewpoint data with a second-order least-squares fit. The resulting quadratic equation is then used in all subsequent analyses to convert the Lyman-alpha voltages to vapor desities for that specific flight. An alternative method is to use the range of fluctuation for the same two devices from horizontal passes to establish the calibration function. However, since the Lyman-alpha data are used only in the flux calculations, i. e., only the fluctuation and not the absolute values are used, this method is thought unnecessary...|$|E
40|$|Adequate {{humidification}} of inhaling gases {{is important}} for the normal functioning of the respiratory tract. Humidification facilitates expectoration, inhibits the onset of respiratory complications. and prevents them from getting worse. It is especially important in the care of postoperative patients or patients who are under oxygen therapy. There are many types of humidifiers currently being used, but no reports have appeared in the literature on their efficiency. An improved photo tube <b>dew-point</b> <b>hygrometer</b> was used for measuring humidity, which was shown on an electronic recorder automatically and continuously. The temperatures of gases before and after humidification, of water in humidifiers, and of the environment air were measured with thermocouples simultaneusly. A number of experiments were done under varying conditions to evaluate how the efficiency of a bubble-type humidifier is influenced by factors such as: (1) the environment temperature, (2) temperature of gas before it enters the humidifier, (3) temperature of water in it, (4) depth of water for bubbling, (5) number, size and directions of holes from which oxygen-bubbles emanate, (6) flow of oxygen, (7) viscosity of water, etc. The following factors were found to increase the efficiency of humidifiers, experimentally and also theoretically, and were discussed from the standpoint of practical application. (1) Maintaining temperatures of the inlet flow of oxygen, which was the gas used in most cases, and of the water in the humidifier as high as possible. This is the most obvious factor seen from a clinical standpoint. Copper water containers are recommended instead of glass containers, making it possible to maintain the water temperature very close to the environment temperature. The environment should also be kept sufficiently warm. (2) Smaller size and increased number of holes (over ten holes with a diameter of less than 1 mm.) can make good humidification, even with high flow. (3) Bubbling through increased water depth (over 10 cm. of depth) is recommended. (4) Downward direction of holes is recommended. But, if there are many holes, they should be directed somewhat diverted to lateral so that bubbles radiate in all directions. (5) Increased viscosity of water is not useful for better humidification. Also, the effect of foaming and spraying over the water surface was obserbed...|$|E
