50|$|When the {{actuator}} is moved, {{mechanical energy}} {{is stored in}} the compression spring until the actuator passes its mid-position. At that time, the common contact bar is forced {{in the opposite direction}} by the compression spring, acting via the actuator bar, thus breaking the connection with the existing contact and making connection with the other contact. The common contact bar is made of copper, with an inlay of <b>harder</b> <b>contact</b> metal on the underside. While it is free to move the required distance lengthwise, it is constrained from moving sideways by the construction of the molded plastic body.|$|R

2500|$|At the 1983 Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway on February 20, 1983, Waltrip, a pre-race {{favorite}} to win the race, drove the Junior Johnson prepared 1983 Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS Pepsi Challenger. He was involved in an accident when his car spun on lap 64, at exit of turn 4, at nearly , as he was making an evasive maneuver to avoid rear-ending a much slower car ahead of him. Waltrip locked his brakes but the car slid for several hundred feet, then struck an earthen embankment {{near the entrance to}} pit road. The force of the impact was so violent that Waltrip's car was thrown back onto the track, in front of oncoming traffic. Waltrip then made <b>hard</b> <b>contact</b> with the outside concrete retaining wall once again into oncoming traffic. Cale Yarborough, the eventual winner of the race, barely avoided hitting the demolished Pepsi Challenger. Waltrip suffered a concussion and was taken by ambulance to the Halifax Medical Center for observation and medical treatment. The crash was a wake-up call and a life-changing event for Waltrip. When he heard drivers and fans joking that the crash would [...] "knock him sane" [...] or [...] "finally shut him up", he realized for the first time how unpopular he was and resolved to clean up his image. The years following that crash would see a different Darrell Waltrip, one who worked hard to repair and rebuild his relationship with fans and fellow drivers. Years later, Waltrip would be voted (by NASCAR fans) [...] "Most Popular Driver", two years in a row, (1989, 1990).|$|E

50|$|Corneal {{sensitivity}} {{has been}} found to be significantly diminished following long-term contact lens wear. However, this difference in sensitivity is not correlated with a change in the number of nerve fiber bundles in the subbasal plexus of the cornea, suggesting that diminished corneal sensitivity following extended periods of contact lens wear is not caused by a reduction in nerve fiber bundles but possibly a change in functionality. One or two years of <b>hard</b> <b>contact</b> lens wear has not been shown to affect corneal sensitivity, but real changes are observed following five years of <b>hard</b> <b>contact</b> lens wear. However, this significant decrease in corneal sensitivity appears to be reversible. Following cessation of <b>hard</b> <b>contact</b> lens usage, corneal sensitivity has been shown to be fully regained after several months: patients who had worn <b>hard</b> <b>contact</b> lenses for a decade or longer were able to regain normal corneal sensitivity after four months of not wearing contact lenses at all.|$|E

It is well known that the presence of delays deteriorates the overall system performance.

40|$|This article {{presents}} new algorithms for massively parallel granular dynamics simulations on distributed memory architectures using a domain partitioning approach. Collisions are modelled with <b>hard</b> <b>contacts</b> {{in order to}} hide their micro-dynamics and thus to extend the time and length scales that can be simulated. The multi-contact problem is solved using a non-linear block Gauss-Seidel method that is conforming to the subdomain structure. The parallel algorithms employ a sophisticated protocol between processors that delegate algorithmic tasks such as contact treatment and position integration uniquely and robustly to the processors. Communication overhead is minimized through aggressive message aggregation, leading to excellent strong and weak scaling. The robustness and scalability is assessed on three clusters including two peta-scale supercomputers with up to 458752 processor cores. The simulations can reach unprecedented resolution of up to ten billion non-spherical particles and contacts...|$|R

50|$|With {{both types}} of mount, springs are {{needed to keep the}} frame pressed against the ball bearings, unless the mount is {{designed}} to be used only in an orientation where gravity will keep the frame in place. Following the cantilever principle, a large mount allows finer control than a smaller one. The frames are ideally made of a light material, to make the resonant frequency of the structure high. This reduces vibration, since many common sources of vibration are relatively low frequency. For stability, the fixed frame is supported by a rigid mount that is securely bolted to a supporting surface. In a laboratory environment, this is typically an optical table. A shock can cause the mount {{to move away from the}} ball bearings, but because there are only 6, <b>hard</b> <b>contacts,</b> the mirror will return to the original position, preserving the alignment.|$|R
40|$|This paper evaluates {{state-of-the-art}} contact models at {{predicting the}} motions and forces involved in simple in-hand robotic manipulations. In particular {{it focuses on}} three primitive actions [...] linear sliding, pivoting, and rolling [...] that involve contacts between a gripper, a rigid object, and their environment. The evaluation is done through thousands of controlled experiments designed to capture the motion of object and gripper, and all contact forces and torques at 250 Hz. We demonstrate that a contact modeling approach based on Coulomb's friction law and maximum energy principle is effective at reasoning about interaction to first order, but limited for making accurate predictions. We attribute the major limitations to 1) the non-uniqueness of force resolution inherent to grasps with multiple <b>hard</b> <b>contacts</b> of complex geometries, 2) unmodeled dynamics due to contact compliance, and 3) unmodeled geometries dueto manufacturing defects.
