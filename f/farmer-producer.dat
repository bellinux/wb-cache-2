40|$|Trade, {{especially}} the international variety, rarely {{brings out the}} best in people. Competition can be savage and when economic survival is at stake, slashing prices will work better than even the most creative advertising. It s an ugly rough-and-tumble and one of the not-pretty sights is the loss of solidarity between nations. The European Union recently announced the removal of all import quotas and duties on products from the world s 48 Least-Developed Countries (most LDCs are ACP States). The measure went into effect on 9 March 2001, in an orgy of praise in Europe at least, but it seems to be far from world-shattering. Most LDCs already benefited from duty-free access on most goods, and preferential quotas on key produce such as bananas. In 1998, the total value of EU duties on goods from all LDCs amounted to a mere 7 million most of it on a handful of temperate agricultural products. These are principally maize, some cheese, beef, bananas, rice and sugar and sugar derivatives, and the current suppliers, mainly in ACP States, are none happy about competition from other LDCs, in the ACP Group or elsewhere. Whether those 7 million savings will lead to lower shop prices, more demand and eventually get back to the <b>farmer-producer</b> will depend on who runs the supply chain. Without a doubt, some products from some countries are now more competitive for the European market. But the not so simple minds will ask, as the World Trade Organisation is abolishing all import duties anyway, why all the fuss? Whatever. The real value of the decision is in its knock-on effects, the so-called dynamic impact. It is hoped that some LDC exports will be so energised by the new opportunities to sell on the EU market that they will produce and sell more, and spill over into the North American market which also recently lowered its tariffs for LDCs. Not, though, without some serious investment in some LDCs capacity to deliver: Madagascar s beef exporters, for example, now stand before an open door, with no herds available to sell. And not, though, before a cacophony of grumbles from pre-March 9 preferred suppliers, whether they be the ubiquitous banana growers, the sugar growers in small ACP island States or Europe, or ACP rice growers. The liberalisation of these three product groups is being taken more gently, aiming at free access by 2006, 2009 and 2009 respectively. But beyond the growls and the vicious back-biting even between ACP States, the real lesson is that in trade, you have to think ahead to get ahead. Now that was worth t 7 million of European taxpayers money; thanks, EU.

Since 1993, a series of four major night markets, organized by <b>farmer-producers</b> associated among Farmers of Aveyron, currently take place in the evening from July to August on Mandarous Square, the main square of the city center. Since that time, in November, the autumn fair of farm products is organized by the same association of farmers and runs for two days at Victory Park in Millau.|$|R
40|$|Like {{in other}} species, spread of disease in {{backyard}} poultry population could be potentially affected by movements. Therefore {{this study was}} conducted to understand the poultry markets contact structure in market chains from Shashmene to Addis Ababa in Ethiopia during two seasons representing the high (season_ 1) and low peak (season_ 2) in poultry movements. During each period data on weekly poultry trade was gathered via structured questionnaires administered to 215 and 109 traders, respectively, on the day of visit. Study revealed networks with weak connectivity. Nevertheless, few markets emerged as more central in the networks and could be focused for targeted surveillance. Equally important is the need for observation at some rural markets, used by <b>farmer-producers</b> for re-stocking, that could also plays role in maintaining disease spread cycle.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. Detailed case studies developed in three country context research sites, namely Weenen district KwaZulu Natal (South Africa), Mchinji District central Malawi, and Mvurwi and Masvingo Districts (Zimbabwe) {{during the course}} of research between 2013 and 2014. These consist of semi-structured interviews, augmented with basic descriptive quantitative data collected via a brief household and enterprise survey, along with data gleaned from local key informant interviews. The case studies trace the 'linkages' from focal <b>farmer-producers</b> (described in the research as tier 1) both upwards along the value chain (inputs) and downwards (into output markets, and also their consumption expenditure), the case studies also follow and trace the impacts of these activities on the local rural non farm economy. The dataset also includes geospatial data, which maps these linkages and nodes in space Project description: Agricultural development can only lead to inclusive, sustainable growth if, in addition to productivity gains on the land, it supports non-farm employment. Yet the links between agricultural productivity and non-farm employment are poorly understood. Recent debates indicate that the multipliers that can support non-farm rural employment depend not only on growth in local aggregate demand, but also on the spatial and institutional configuration of the links between farm and non-farm employment, and between near and distant markets. This project accordingly explores the spatial and institutional articulation of markets, human settlements and farm and non-farm livelihoods in marginalised and impoverished rual regions of Malawi, South Africa and Zimbabwe. It does this by building a careful qualitative picture of the flow and distribution of money, resources, risk and opportunities in socio-economic networks, value chains and markets in rural districts. This qualitative picture is combined with a quantitative analysis of production, flows and livelihood generation activities by actors and role players in the networks. The research was undertaken by a consortium of researchers led by the Institute for Poverty, Land and Agrarian Studies at the University of the Western Cape in South Africa...|$|R
40|$|After {{the broad}} {{industrialization}} of the U. S. swine/pork industry, {{there have been}} numerous niche markets for export and domestic pork developing. With the Midwest’s tradition of a corn-hog family-based agricultural system, the stage was set for the pork niche market phenomena to take root. There are approximately 35 to 40 pork niche marketing efforts currently active in Iowa. A multistate Pork Niche Market Working Group (PNMWG) was started in 2002 in Iowa to “support the development of niche markets for pork, to foster the success of highly differentiated pork value chains that are profitable to all participants that incorporate farmer ownership and control, and contribute to environmental stewardship and rural vitality. ” Pork niche markets embrace a variety of approaches including direct marketing, internet sales, small locker plants, farmer groups, and organized marketing groups. One of the larger and more successful niche marketers of “natural pork” is Niman Ranch Pork, Thornton, Iowa. Niman Ranch pork has more than 200 <b>farmer-producers</b> and processes about 2, 000 pigs weekly. There are indications that U. S. consumers are interested in the environmental, pig welfare, and pig farm ownership and structure characteristics of the pork they buy. Many consumers may be willing to pay more for pork with positive attributes in these areas. Niche markets are attractive to small- and medium-based farmers who have swine experience and facilities. Noted agricultural economist Glenn Grimes of the University of Missouri stated at the 2003 World Pork Expo, Des Moines, Iowa, that “Unless small pork producers have captured a niche market within the pork chain, they will disappear. ” Niche markets seek product differentiation via quality and social or credence attributes. Quality attributes that are claimed by the niche market include certain breeds or genetics, taste or flavor, high quality, freshness, and tenderness. Social or credence attributes often are claimed and include antibiotic and growth promotant-free, family farm raised, “natural,” organic, outdoor or bedded rearing, locally raised, humane rearing, known origin, environment-friendly, and no animal by-products in feed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the goals}} of the project called "The milky river", which deals with the {{integral}} development of the dairy production, is to initiate the development of the sustainable and profitable production of milk and dairy products through grouping producers and supporting their position in the society they live in. Women are more than men engaged in the dairy production chain and they have a direct view of the whole dairy production process. So it was necessary to adapt the grouping to their needs, as well as to make some practical mechanisms of their involvement in the project activities. In this way, the strategy of the project helped with offering equal chances to women and men, and by reducing the gender inequality, it also helped with making a chance for a new life perspective for women. Through interviews and by focus-grouping the data were collected which represented the first picture of the dairy production in the region of Niš, including its gender characteristics, among other things. Two years later, the qualitative analysis of the indicators of the rural women’s social status in this region {{in the context of the}} realization of the project activities, has shown that there has been an important movement forward towards the gender equality which can be attributed to the successful project implementation. Women, as an important factor in the dairy production chain, seem to be joined and encouraged. They seem to be empowered at the level of their knowledge decision making and autonomous activity taking through various forms of education, joint farmer group work, as well as through various forms of cooperation with supporting institutions and other partners within the project activity framework. The overwhelming impression seems to be that joint work and cooperation are necessary conditions for the development of any individual farmers’ production, as well as for the referent rural development which requires the support of all the available human resources. The project titled "The milky river" is a possibility for and an initiation of women to change the regional, historical experience of being marginalized. It is also a chance for women to define their needs and to promote themselves as equal economic and social factors in their society - instead of being assistants on their housing or family estate, now they become <b>farmer-producers...</b>|$|R
