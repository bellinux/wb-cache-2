25|$|Carleton is {{the only}} Trillium Line station with {{separate}} platforms for both directions; at Carling and Confederation one can tell where a train is headed by the direction from which it enters the station and by its electronic <b>destination</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
25|$|The flap-board <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> was {{replaced}} with high-resolution mosaic LCD modules also manufactured by Solari Udine. Similar modules are now also used on the trains, both on the sides to display the destination, and on the interior to display the time, next station, calling points, and other passenger information.|$|E
50|$|All buses feature TwinVision LED <b>destination</b> <b>signs.</b> The front <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> on the New Flyer buses {{are able}} to display route numbers in {{different}} colors (as the Rapid Ride buses do for the three Rapid Ride routes, the Red Line, Blue Line, and Green Line). All other signs, including the front <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> on all 300 and 400 series buses, display in orange only. The 300 series buses formerly featured flip-dot <b>destination</b> <b>signs,</b> however, they were retrofitted with the orange TwinVision LED signs in 2004 alongside the automated voice annunciatior system. ABQ RIDE did not order the color LED <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> for the 600 series buses, citing ongoing reliability issues, opting instead to go with orange LED signs.|$|R
50|$|A {{refurbishment}} {{program was}} carried out on all six 2000 series sets between 2015 and 2017. The three-color <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> were replaced with full-color LED <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> and the interior seating arrangement was changed.|$|R
50|$|Another {{technology}} {{that has been}} employed for <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> is the split-flap display, or Solari display, but outside Italy, this technology was never common for use in transit vehicles. Such displays were more often used at transit hubs to display arrival and departure information, rather than as <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> on transit vehicles.|$|R
25|$|Some {{services}} {{follow a}} truncated route. Until 2004 {{they had their}} own numbers. For example, 11 and 12 were shortened versions of routes 1 and 2; the shortened routes along the way of route 4 were known as 41, 42 while route 4 was numbered 40. Nowadays, when a route is shortened, it retains the same number and just shows a different destination on its <b>destination</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|E
25|$|The H1 series {{cars are}} {{distinguishable}} by their streamlined cab ends and rectangular headlamps, with the electronic <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> (which have been modified {{to indicate the}} line with a colored square) mounted {{directly in front of}} the cab rather than above it. They are normally used only on the Red Line and can be operated as single cars or in trains of two cars coupled together, though two-car trains have become the norm due to increasing ridership and the arrival of the H2 series.|$|E
25|$|Select Bus Service buses are {{wrapped in}} a unique blue paint scheme that {{identifies}} them as operating in this particular service. All SBS buses display +Select Bus in the <b>destination</b> <b>sign.</b> Bus stops where SBS buses stop are also identifiable with the SBS branding on the glass shelters, and machines for MetroCard and coin payment {{in or near the}} shelters (except for the S79 SBS, which does not employ off-board fare collection). In addition, all buses on the SBS services employ all-door boarding operation, in which each set of doors open simultaneously for easier boarding and alighting, {{with the exception of the}} S79 which does not employ all-door boarding.|$|E
50|$|The Rapid Ride fleet {{currently}} {{consists of}} 18 New Flyer DE60LF and 6 New Flyer DE60LFR articulated 60-foot low floor buses, which are painted in ABQ RIDE's {{red and gold}} color scheme. All Rapid Ride buses have free wireless internet access and are also equipped with Digital Recorders automated stop announcement systems and TwinVision LED <b>destination</b> <b>signs.</b> The front <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> feature a multicolor route number display and orange route name display. The route number is displayed in red for the Rapid Ride Route 766, blue for Route 790, and in green for Route 777. The side and rear <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> are orange-only.|$|R

25|$|To {{replace the}} lights, in July 2015 the MTA began {{overhauling}} the front destination signs of buses {{to display the}} route in a blue background, {{as well as a}} completely blue background that flashes twice when it says +Select Bus (formerly it read +Select Bus Service). At night on some routes, the front <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> is blue text on an unlit black background. Starting with the Q44 in November 2015, the blue background is kept when the front signage transitions to show the terminal of the route and the main streets traveled. As of July 2017, the SBS fleet on all routes have had their front destination signs overhauled, and new routes that launched after that date came with the new destination signs.|$|E
25|$|The {{second and}} {{final stage of}} the Ring Line opened on 20 August 2006. Oslo Sporveier was in dire need for more rolling stock and had {{insufficient}} to operate along the new line. Because the Ring required that the <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> be changed mid-way, and this feature was only possible on the T1300 units and were therefore attractive. Oslo Sporveier officially announced the move through deeming the Kols√•s Line unsafe for use. A new, temporary station was built at Husebybakken, which became the terminus and opened {{the same day as}} the Ring. Services ran a loop around the Ring Line as Line 6 and 4 and continued to Bergkrystallen, using nine T1300 trains. Within a year a few of the departures were being carried out using the new MX3000 trains.|$|E
2500|$|The Board's last livery change, {{red with}} a white, central {{horizontal}} stripe, first made {{an appearance on}} the [...] "Hess" [...] buses. This livery was also applied to some other buses when they received major overhauls. These buses also featured triple-digit route number displays beside the <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> at the front, {{as well as a}} <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> at the side next to the front door.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{different}} <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> {{used for}} Westbound 96 buses. They include: ...|$|R

2500|$|Seymour & Davie - Served {{the upscale}} Yaletown neighbourhood. (Note: The bus's <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> changes to [...] "98 B-Line: Richmond Centre" [...] at this point.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Routes overlap {{each other}} in some places. There are three routes in Gent: Numbers 1, 2 and 4. Every route has its own color; this color is {{depicted}} in a vehicle's <b>destination</b> <b>sign,</b> {{as well as on}} maps and schematics.|$|E
2500|$|Most Limited-Stop buses flash [...] "LIMITED" [...] or [...] "LIMITED STOPS" [...] on the <b>destination</b> <b>sign.</b> Occasionally, a paper {{orange and}} purple [...] "Limited" [...] sign {{will also be}} placed {{at the bottom of}} the {{windshield}} by the bus operator. Dark navy blue [...] "LOCAL" [...] and red [...] "Express" [...] signs also exist.|$|E

2500|$|The H2 series {{cars are}} {{shorter than the}} H1 series, at [...] in length, and are {{distinguishable}} by their flatter cab ends and circular headlamps, with the electronic <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> (which use colored dots to indicate the line) conventionally mounted above the cab. Like the H1 series, they are normally used only on the Red Line and can be operated as single cars or in two-car trains. The H1 and H2 series are electrically compatible and can operate {{together in the same}} train.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{the debut}} of Select Bus Service, blue {{flashing}} lights {{on both sides of}} the <b>destination</b> <b>sign</b> were used to help designate SBS buses from local buses (which have orange lights). While some, including bus operators, claimed the flashing blue lights helped improve travel times for buses, they were controversial due to some drivers mistaking them for emergency vehicles. The use of the lights also violated the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law (Article 9, Section 375 (41)). [...] NYS Law states [...] "The use of blue lights on vehicles shall be restricted for use only by a volunteer firefighter" [...] and [...] "may be affixed to a police vehicle and fire vehicle, provided that such blue light or lights shall be displayed on a police vehicle and fire vehicle for rear projection only." [...] The lights were removed from service on January 18, 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Apart from Big Three products, {{the company}} also made a few promotionals for {{independent}} companies, like the 1952‚Äì1953 bathtub Nash Ambassador. One interesting aspect of these Nashes was that the 'windows' were a molded {{part of the body}} and not clear - the windows came covered with a self-adhesive silver foil that didn't hold up well through time (Doty 1996, pp. 88-89). PMC also made a couple of Trailways buses, including a GMC model 4102 or 4103 marketed by Ideal and issued in about 1952. It had an opening passenger door and changeable <b>destination</b> <b>sign.</b> Later, a larger Trailways Thru-Liner bus with opening side panels and removable luggage was also produced (Timm 2010 'Miscellaneous' page and PC Literature page 5). In addition were Oscar Mayer Weinermobiles in 1954, 1992, and 1996 variations. The 1990s versions were far beyond the time that PMC usually made wheeled promotionals, and were the last vehicles PMC made (Timm 2010, Photo Gallery Weinermobiles).|$|E

2500|$|For {{their first}} 30 years, until 2016, the Type 1 cars had roll-type, printed <b>destination</b> <b>signs.</b> [...] The Type 1 {{were the only}} MAX cars whose rollsigns were hand-cranked. Because of the {{time-consuming}} process to change the signs, only {{the sign on the}} exposed end of the car was changed to the correct <b>destination.</b> The side <b>signs</b> only listed the designated route color (such as [...] "Blue Line") rather than a <b>destination,</b> and the <b>sign</b> on the coupled end of each car in a two-car train was left blank. [...] A two-year program that began in October 2014 and was completed in September 2016 gradually replaced all of the rollsigns in the Type 1 cars (as well as those in the Types 2 and 3) with digital, LED-type <b>destination</b> <b>signs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The R68s are {{scheduled}} to remain in service until at least 2025‚Äì2030. In 2010, the MTA proposed mid-life technological upgrades for the R68s, including LED <b>destination</b> <b>signs</b> and automated announcements.|$|R
