5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>autumn</b> and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E

40|$|Journal homepage: [URL] capelin feed on zooplankton, the {{availability}} of the latter may be a limiting factor for capelin growth in at least some areas and at certain times. It was therefore hypothesized that a relationship exists between capelin growth and zooplankton biomass either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same year or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>autumn.</b> Capelin growth in a given year was more closely correlated with the estimate of zooplankton abundance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous <b>autumn</b> than with that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> present <b>autumn.</b> Growth of <b>the</b> youngest capelin was well correlated with abundance of the smallest zooplankton, whereas growth of older capelin was more closely correlated with abundance of the larger zooplankton forms. Various water masses were defined on the basis of hydrographic conditions, and significant differences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> zooplankton content among the water masses were detected. An inverse relationship between zooplankton abundance and capelin biomass was found, indicating that grazing by capelin has a negative effect on zooplankton abundance...|$|R
