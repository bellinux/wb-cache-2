50|$|The Q Society {{invited the}} Dutch {{politician}} Geert Wilders to tour Australia. Wilders opposes further Islamic {{immigration to the}} Netherlands. During August and September 2012, the Australian Government delayed the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>visa.</b> One day after Wilders and Q Society eventually postponed the tour due to the ongoing uncertainty, the then Minister Chris Bowen MP (Labor) granted the visa to Wilders. The tour eventually took place in February 2013 with speaking events by Geert Wilders and Sam Solomon scheduled for 19 February in Melbourne, 20 February in Perth and 22 February in Sydney. The tour was overshadowed by <b>a</b> total <b>of</b> 30 venues refusing or cancelling bookings.|$|R

50|$|In {{exceptional}} cases, single-entry Schengen visas {{valid for}} up to 15 days may be issued on arrival at the border. These visas are reserved for individuals who can prove that {{they were unable to}} apply for <b>a</b> <b>visa</b> in advance due to time constraints arising out of 'unforeseeable' and 'imperative' reasons as long as they fulfil the regular criteria for the <b>issuing</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Schengen <b>visa.</b> However, if the individual requesting <b>a</b> Schengen <b>visa</b> at the border falls within <b>a</b> category <b>of</b> people for which it is necessary to consult {{one or more of the}} central authorities of other Schengen States, they may only be issued <b>a</b> <b>visa</b> at the border in exceptional cases on humanitarian grounds, on grounds of national interest or on account of international obligations (such as the death or sudden serious illness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> close relative or of another close person). In 2014, over 122,000 Schengen visas were issued to travellers on arrival at the border. People trying this way to travel to the Schengen Area, can get into problems with the airline because of the carrier's responsibility, which penalises airlines if they carry passengers who do not have the correct documentation.|$|R
5000|$|Rožman {{began to}} appear in American and British {{intelligence}} reports as being involved in ratlines that spirited wanted Axis and collaborationist fugitives out of Europe. To get <b>an</b> American <b>visa,</b> Rožman did not visit the consulate in Berne, he communicated with the United States Consulate General at Zürich on 25 May for the purpose <b>of</b> obtaining <b>a</b> visitor's <b>visa</b> to the United States. On 28 May, he appeared at the Consulate General where he was informed of U.S. regulations regarding the <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> non-quota immigration <b>visa</b> as <b>a</b> minister <b>of</b> religion. Rožman and Šarić were not together in Switzerland. Rožman was residing at the Institut Menzingen, near Zug, and Šarić was residing at Haute Rive near Friborg.“In Berne, Rožman's Ustashi friends were engaged in wholesale fraud, using the black market to convert the gold into dollars, and later, into Austrian schillings. 'Aid to the refugees is accounted for at the official rate of exchange for dollars', the American officers noted, adding that 'malpractices have been carried on (officially, the dollar is worth 10 schillings; on the black market, 100 to 150). According to reliable information: 'Rožman is going to Berne to take care of these finances. The money is in a Swiss bank, and he plans to have most of it sent through to Italy and from there to the Ustaše in the Argentine.'”“A short time later Rožman duly arrived in Berne, accompanied by Bishop Ivan Šarić, the 'hangman' of Sarajevo. By the end of May 1948, Rožman had apparently carried out this money laundering operation for the Ustashi, for he visited the U.S. Consulate in Zürich and was given <b>a</b> 'non-quota immigration <b>visa</b> as <b>a</b> minister <b>of</b> religion'. He then traveled to the United States and settled in Cleveland, Ohio. The circle was now almost complete. Pavelić's stolen 'treasure' had been tracked down through close monitoring of the movements and activities of the quisling Bishop of Ljubljana....” ...|$|R
