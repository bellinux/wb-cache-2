Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side-by-side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. He depicted her in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but learned not to <b>expect</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> from his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise they at his soirées.|$|E

Disappointed with the lack of new additions to Brain Age 2, GamePro asked readers [...] " [...] <b>expect</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> more content than new tests and more Sudoku grids". Nintendo World Report was also unhappy with the game, telling players who were [...] "hoping for an overhaul [...] to wait for the inevitable Brain Age 3".

Following the film's US release in 1934, The New York Times commented that it [...] "carr most of the comedy of the original" [...] but was [...] "rather weak on the musical side", {{despite the presence of}} stars such as Novotná. Opera-lovers, the review suggested, should not <b>expect</b> <b>too</b> <b>much,</b> but the work nevertheless gave an attractive portrait of Bohemian village life in the mid-19th century. The reviewer found most of the acting first-rate, but commented that [...] "the photography and sound reproduction are none too clear at times." [...] Other film adaptations of the opera were made in 1922 directed by Oldrich Kminek (Atropos), in 1933, directed by Jaroslav Kvapil, Svatopluk Innemann and Emil Pollert (Espofilm), and in 1976, directed by Václav Kašlík (Barrandov).

The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted [...] "real bodies and real women." [...] In interviews, she warned fans not to <b>expect</b> <b>too</b> <b>much.</b> However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor.|$|E

[...] First hopes for the Empire Service were low. The Director General, Sir John Reith (later Lord Reith) said in the opening programme: [...] "Don't <b>expect</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> in the early days; for some time we shall transmit comparatively simple programmes, to give the best chance of intelligible reception and provide evidence as to the type of material most suitable for the service in each zone.

After the French mauled his right wing in battles at Montenotte and Dego, Beaulieu watched in stunned {{inactivity}} as the French knocked Sardinia {{out of the}} war at the battles of Millesimo, Ceva, and Mondovì. Beaulieu withdrew his army behind the Po, hoping the river would stop the French advance. But Bonaparte marched west to cross the river near Piacenza, behind the Austrian left flank. The French defeated Anton Lipthay de Kisfalud at the Battle of Fombio on 7 to 9 May 1796. Hastily, Beaulieu withdrew his army to the east, dropping off a force under Karl Philipp Sebottendorf to hold the bridge over the Adda River at Lodi. Bonaparte seized the bridge in the Battle of Lodi on 10 May, driving back Sebottendorf with losses of 2,000 casualties and 14 guns. The Austrians abandoned Duchy of Milan and pulled back to the Mincio River. A minor defeat at the Battle of Borghetto on 30 May forced Beaulieu to abandon the Mincio line and retreat north to the Tyrol. Before leaving the Po valley, he left a strong garrison in the fortress of Mantua. The Siege of Mantua would become the focus of many battles during the remainder of 1796. During the retreat, Beaulieu relieved Lipthay from command of the rearguard for retreating too quickly. Thomas Graham, an English observer with the Austrian army, noted that Beaulieu seemed to <b>expect</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> from his soldiers, was irritated, and tended to blame the failure of his plans on others for not properly executing his orders. Graham also deplored the [...] "petty intrigue" [...] among the Austrian officers.|$|E
