25|$|A hybrid ballast has a {{magnetic}} core-and-coil transformer and an <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> for the electrode-heating circuit. Like {{a magnetic}} ballast, a hybrid unit operates at line power frequency—50Hz in Europe, for example. These types of ballasts, {{which are also}} referred to as cathode-disconnect ballasts, disconnect the electrode-heating circuit after they start the lamps.|$|E
50|$|The {{attempts}} {{to replace the}} electromechanical switching matrices by semiconductor cross point switches were not immediately successful, particularly in large exchanges. As a result, many space division switching systems used electromechanical switching networks with SPC. Nonetheless, private automatic branch exchanges (PABX) and smaller exchanges do use <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> devices. The two types of space division <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> systems are using electromechanical switching network and the other using <b>electronic</b> <b>switching</b> network. The second type is fully electronic.|$|R

25|$|An insulated-gate bipolar {{transistor}} (IGBT) is a three-terminal {{power semiconductor device}} primarily used as an <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> which, as it was developed, came to combine high efficiency and fast switching. It switches electric power in many applications: variable-frequency drives (VFDs), electric cars, trains, variable speed refrigerators, lamp ballasts, air-conditioners and even stereo systems with switching amplifiers. The IGBT is a semiconductor device with four alternating layers (P-N-P-N) that are controlled by a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) gate structure without regenerative action.|$|E
25|$|As piezo energy {{harvesting}} {{has been investigated}} only since the late 1990s, it remains an emerging technology. Nevertheless, some interesting improvements were made with the self-powered <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> at INSA school of engineering, implemented by the spin-off Arveni. In 2006, the proof of concept of a battery-less wireless doorbell push button was created, and recently, a product showed that classical wireless wallswitch can be powered by a piezo harvester. Other industrial applications appeared between 2000 and 2005, to harvest energy from vibration and supply sensors for example, or to harvest energy from shock.|$|E
25|$|To {{complete}} the system, an <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> was added that was timed to the 50Hz signal of the National Grid. The signal {{was used to}} switch the input to the receivers from the range antenna, to output {{of the other two}} antennas mixed through the radiogoniometer. The same signal also adjusted the Y-axis bias of the CRT slightly, so that alternate traces appeared above or below the center of a new CRT dedicated for elevation measurements. The result was that the upper trace contained the original range signal as before, while the lower trace contained the radiogoniometer output; by looking along the lower trace under the range blip, the operator could turn the radiogoniometer until the signal reached a null, revealing the angle. The operator would periodically adjust the setting as the lower blip re-appeared while the target moved.|$|E

500|$|For example, {{given the}} {{equatorial}} circumference of the Earth is about [...] and c about , the theoretical shortest {{time for a}} piece of information to travel half the globe along the surface is about 67 milliseconds. When light is travelling around the globe in an optical fibre, the actual transit time is longer, in part because the speed of light is slower by about 35% in an optical fibre, depending on its refractive index n. Furthermore, straight lines rarely occur in global communications situations, and delays are created when the signal passes through an <b>electronic</b> <b>switch</b> or signal regenerator.|$|E

2500|$|This {{technique}} uses {{a combination}} filament–cathode {{at each end}} of the lamp in conjunction with a mechanical or automatic (bi-metallic or <b>electronic)</b> <b>switch</b> that initially connect the filaments in series with the ballast to preheat them.

This system is described as [...] "Preheat" [...] in North America and [...] "Switch Start" [...] in the UK, and have no specific name in the rest part of the world. This systems is common in 200–240 V countries (and for 100–120 V lamps up to about 30 watts).|$|E
