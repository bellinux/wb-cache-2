40|$|The aims of {{this thesis}} are to {{investigate}} the factors influencing treatment fidelity of health behaviour change (HBC) interventions. The thesis will focus on HBC interventions delivered by practice nurses (PNs) and health care assistants (HCAs) to patients within general practice, although the findings will be explored {{within the context of}} the wider treatment fidelity literature. The thesis comprises five studies, focussed on exploring, enhancing and assessing fidelity of <b>delivery</b> and <b>receipt</b> of HBC interventions. Through developing an enhanced understanding of these areas of treatment fidelity, the thesis will also make recommendations for strategies to enhance and assess fidelity of <b>delivery</b> and <b>receipt</b> of future HBC interventions. Study one is a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies that explored the views and experiences of nurses who had delivered HBC interventions with a focus on how this can inform future delivery of HBC interventions. Study two is an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of PNs’/HCAs’ experiences of helping patients to change their health behaviours {{within the context of the}}ir routine care, and before and after delivery of an intervention to facilitate increased walking. Study three reports a quantitative assessment of delivery of intervention techniques to facilitate increased walking, as specified in an intervention protocol, by PNs/HCAs. Study four explores PNs’/HCAs’ views and experiences of the factors that influenced their delivery of the walking intervention. Study five investigates treatment receipt, by exploring patients’ understanding of, and experiences of receiving the walking intervention. The key findings from this research are that <b>delivery</b> and <b>receipt</b> of HBC interventions within general practice are influenced by a range of factors that include the providers’ confidence and skills, the patients’ expectations and/or engagement with the intervention and the general practice within which the intervention is delivered. A number of these factors are difficult to influence and so research teams need to develop a range of strategies to enhance <b>delivery</b> and <b>receipt</b> of HBC interventions. These may include appropriate preparation for providers to deliver the intervention, the provision of a simple intervention resource to support delivery of the intervention and the development of strategies to enhance patients’ understanding of intervention technique...|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the global population is obese, foreshadowing an epidemic of chronic disease. Self-monitoring (of diet, exercise, and body weight), decreasing energy intake, and increasing energy expenditure are robust predictors of successful weight loss. However, few individuals consistently practice these behaviors, making long-term weight loss and maintenance unlikely. Technologies afford unique opportunities to overcome barriers and increase the reach of traditional obesity interventions. In this article, we introduce ENGAGED, a technology-enhanced modification of the Diabetes Prevention Program designed to improve adherence to weight loss behaviors. Using a treatment implementation framework, we suggest how virtual reality technologies might further improve the <b>delivery,</b> <b>receipt,</b> and enactment of ENGAGED to maximize patient impact...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Clinical {{trials of}} {{rehabilitation}} interventions pose unique challenges to researchers.

We describe the intervention along with the influence of three TI categories (<b>delivery,</b> <b>receipt,</b> and enactment) on the design {{and implementation of the}} team-training intervention. Positive findings from the use of TI methods include (1) consistent and accurate presentation of intervention components and (2) evi-dence of study participants ’ receipt and enactment of interven-tion strategies...|$|E
