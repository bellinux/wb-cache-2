500|$|Rani Mukerji {{was born}} [...] in Mumbai on 21 March 1978. Her father, Ram Mukherjee (born to the Mukherjee-Samarth family), {{is a former}} film {{director}} {{and one of the}} founders of Filmalaya Studios. Her mother, Krishna Mukherjee, is a former playback singer. Her elder brother, Raja Mukherjee, is a film producer and director. Her maternal aunt, Debashree Roy, is a Bengali film actress and her paternal cousin, Kajol, is a Hindi film actress and her contemporary. Another paternal cousin, Ayan Mukerji, is a scriptwriter and film director. Despite her parents and most of her relatives being members of the Indian film industry, Mukerji was uninterested in pursuing a career in film. She said, [...] "There were already too many actresses at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wanted to be someone different".|$|E
500|$|During {{production}} of the fourth season, Beaver joined the limited series Harper's Island. Although he initially feared that it would prevent future appearances of Bobby, {{he was able to}} maintain his Supernatural [...] "quota" [...] with seven episodes. The character's role increased for the fifth season, which made sense for the actor due to the apocalyptic storyline. The season also introduced a new story arc for Bobby: his use of a wheelchair. Series creator Eric Kripke explained that it [...] " [...] the Apocalypse matter"; the writers wanted [...] "real stakes and real loss and real obstacles thrown in our heroes' way" [...] to differentiate it from prior seasons. Though he found it to be a challenge, Beaver enjoyed the experience because he could perform tricks on set that his wheelchair-using college roommate had taught him. However, the actor did [...] " [...] very seriously", and commented, [...] "I can get out of the chair {{at the end of the}} day and go <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> recognize that, so many people can't and I have to be considerate to them and respect that." ...|$|E

500|$|On March 28, 2012, Jessica Sanchez, a {{contestant}} of {{the eleventh}} season of American Idol, covered [...] "Sweet Dreams" [...] performing a slow-tempo ballad {{version of the}} song accompanied at the beginning by harps. Her performance received favorable comments and a standing ovation from the judges of the show. Jennifer Lopez commented, [...] "You did a beautiful job on it...If I was Beyoncé and I was <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> heard that, I'd be like 'I got {{to do that in}} my next concert, slow that one down.'" [...] Steven Tyler described Sanchez's performance as [...] "great" [...] while Randy Jackson noted that it was [...] "unbelievable, sensational". James Montgomery of MTV News graded her performance with a B, and called the cover [...] "a bit of an odd choice, and yet also a supremely confident one". He added, [...] "For once, she pulled things back, and maybe suffered a bit for doing so, but there were still plenty of subtly great moments, particularly in the verses. Might not have been her best—it definitely lacked in vocal fireworks...And really, it was good enough".|$|E
500|$|A {{letter to}} Hagenauer dated 16 August {{indicated}} that Leopold wished {{to proceed to}} Turin, then across northern Italy to Venice, and home via the Tyrol. [...] "Our own interest and love of travel should have induced us to follow our noses", he wrote, but added: [...] "...I have said I shall go [...] <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> shall keep my word". The family took a shorter route through Switzerland, arriving in Geneva on 20 August, where the children gave two concerts, and were received by the distinguished composer André-Ernest-Modeste Grétry. Many years later Grétry wrote of this encounter: [...] "I wrote for him [...] an Allegro in E flat, difficult but without pretension; he played it, and everyone, except myself, {{thought it was a}} miracle. The child had never broken off, but following the modulations, he had substituted a number of passages for those I had written". This claim, that Wolfgang improvised when faced with passages he could not play, appears to be the only adverse comment from all those called upon to test him.|$|E

Why couldn't you have asked me while we were in Paris? We'd all be in the same band together and Steve wouldn't have left." [...] – Peter Frampton.|$|E

2500|$|Hamilton praised {{his team}} {{for all their}} work during the season, stating that [...] "we pushed very hard {{throughout}} the year, so a big thank to all the guys back home at the factory for not giving up. Next year {{will be a better}} year." [...] Button echoed Hamilton's comments about the work of his McLaren team, and summed up his first season with the team: [...] "I would like to say a big thank you to the team. This is my first year with the team and I have had a great season. I really feel at <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think the experiences we have gained this year, Lewis and myself, with working closely with the engineers and everyone in the Vodafone McLaren Mercedes team means we can really build on this season for next year." ...|$|E
2500|$|Melkman, Mor-Salwo, Mangold, Zeller, & Benbenishty (2015) used a {{grounded}} theory approach to understand 1) the motivations and experiences which led young adult [...] "careleavers" [...] (N = 28, aged 18–26) in Israel and Germany {{to assume a}} helper role and 2) the benefits they report enjoying {{as a result of}} helping others through volunteerism and/or human-service focused careers. Participants reported that observing role models involved in helping roles, being exposed to prosocial values, and having opportunities to volunteer within the system in which they were simultaneously receiving care all contributed to later assumption of more stable and regular helping roles. These participants felt obliged to provide assistance to others, desired to provide this assistance to others, and felt sufficiently competent to carry out the tasks required of them in their helping role. These participants reported that helping others provided them with a sense of purpose in their lives, and also increased self-efficacy, social connectedness, and ability to cope with personal issues. Additionally, participants reported that assuming a helping role provided a sense of normalcy to their lives, as well as providing a sense of perspective on their own journey and outcomes. As one participant (a volunteer with a police department who was assigned to work with at-risk youth) shared with the researchers:"The fact that I could bring a runaway girl back to her <b>home</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> made her trust me, the fact that I located a missing girl, the fact that I escorted a rape victim to hospital and I managed to give her strength and support her, {{these are the things that}} give me meaning, tell me that I'm in a much better situation than others" [...] (p. 45).|$|E
