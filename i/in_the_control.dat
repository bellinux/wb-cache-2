40|$|Purpose. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess retinal and optic nerve bioelectrical function in patients with unilateral asymptomatic but hemodynamically significant internal carotid artery stenosis (ICAS). Methods. Forty-two subjects with a diagnosis of unilateral ICAS and 34 controls were analyzed. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG), pattern electroretinogram (PERG), and pattern visual-evoked potentials, as well as optical coherence tomography and ophthalmological examination, were performed. Data analysis included eyes ipsilateral to ICAS (EIS) and eyes contralateral to ICAS (ECS). Results. Intraocular pressure was significantly decreased in EIS and ECS compared to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> macula, both the cube average thickness and cube volume values were significantly reduced both in EIS and ECS compared to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> Similarly, PERG P 50 and N 95 wave amplitudes were significantly smaller in EIS and ECS compared to those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>The</b> ERG rod b-wave and rod-cone a-wave amplitudes were decreased, and implicit times were significantly prolonged, whereas the OP wave index was reduced in EIS compared to that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> No differences <b>in</b> IOP, OCT, or ERG and PERG parameters were identified between EIS and ECS. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that retinal bioelectrical function is negatively affected by ICAS despite the absence of objective clinical signs and symptoms of ocular ischemia...|$|R

DESIGN [...] Open, randomised follow up study of normotensive insulin dependent diabetics with nephropathy either treated or not with captopril for one year. SETTING [...] Outpatient diabetic clinic in a tertiary referral centre. PATIENTS [...] 32 Normotensive patients with insulin dependent diabetes complicated by nephropathy who were randomised either to the treatment group (n = 15) or to <b>the</b> <b>control</b> group (n = 17). INTERVENTIONS [...] The treatment group was given captopril (25 - 100 mg/day) for 12 months, the average dose during the second {{six months of the}} study being 40 mg daily. Controls were not treated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Albuminuria, arterial blood pressure, and the glomerular filtration rate. RESULTS [...] Mean arterial blood pressure fell by 3 (SE 2) mm Hg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> captopril treated group and rose by 6 (1) mm Hg <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> <b>In</b> addition, albuminuria declined by 11 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> captopril treated group and rose by 55 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls,</b> fractional albumin clearance fell by 17 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> captopril treated group and increased by 66 % <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls,</b> and <b>the</b> glomerular filtration rate declined by 3. 1 (2. 8) ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 with captopril and by 6. 4 (3. 1) ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>controls.</b> CONCLUSION [...] Inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme arrests <b>the</b> progressive rise <b>in</b> albuminuria in normotensive insulin dependent diabetics with nephropathy...|$|R
