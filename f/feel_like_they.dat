5|$|The street {{kept its}} '½' until 1906, when petitioners asked the Minneapolis City Council {{to change the}} street's name to Woodland Avenue because they said the '½' made them <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> lived in an alley. For an unknown reason, the street's name was not changed to Woodland Avenue, but to Milwaukee Avenue. The Avenue's {{proximity}} to the Milwaukee Short Line Railroad has been suggested as a cause.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro {{had come up with}} the idea of a new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed to be different from previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E

5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. When writing the episodes, Takumi ranked each after its importance: the first episode was the most important, to make sure that the player likes the game; the second episode was the second most important, to solidify the player's interest; and the finale was the third most important. In general, each scenario was finished before anything else was done; after this, characters were designed based on the scenarios, and then Takumi adjusted dialogue as needed to make sure that it fit the designs. At this point, it was also decided what scenes were going to have specific cut-in illustrations made for them; Takumi drew rough sketches of them, and also drew the storyboards for the episodes' openings, which consist of series of detailed drawings that show what is happening.|$|E
25|$|Until {{their first}} act of sexual intercourse, {{adolescents}} generally see virginity {{in one of}} the following ways: as a gift, a stigma, or a normal step in development. Girls typically think of virginity as a gift, while boys think of virginity as a stigma. In interviews, girls said that they viewed giving someone their virginity as like giving them a very special gift. Because of this, they often expected something in return such as increased emotional intimacy with their partners or the virginity of their partner. However, they often felt disempowered because of this; they often did not <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> actually received what they expected in return and this made them <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> had less power in their relationship. They felt that they had given something up and did not feel like this action was recognized.|$|E

Operating a profitable business allows growers to think about their future, rather than worrying about how they are going to survive in poverty.|$|E
25|$|When viewing {{pieces of}} art in an experiment, {{participants}} in a solo context rated art in an improving sequence significantly higher than when the targets are presented in a declining sequence. When viewing the art in a joint context, participants evaluated {{the first and last}} pieces similarly in both kinds of sequence. Simply priming viewers to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> were in solo or joint contexts or to process analytically or holistically was enough to produce the same viewing effects.|$|E

Having other family members who are supportive can help the ACOA <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are not alone. Counselors can also provide some psycho-education on alcoholism {{and its effects on}} family members of alcoholics. Research shows that ACOAs feel less like blaming their parents for their alcoholism after learning that alcoholism is a disease, rather than a behavior.|$|E

25|$|Restless leg {{syndrome}} is a disorder in which patients feel uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. These sensations usually {{occur in the}} evening, while the patient is sitting or lying down and relaxing. Patients <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> have to move their legs to relieve the sensations, and walking generally makes the symptoms disappear. In many patients, {{this can lead to}} insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. This is a very common problem and can occur at any age.|$|E

25|$|However, some Japanese fans {{of hip-hop}} find it {{embarrassing}} and ridiculous that these blackface fans {{do this because}} they <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> shouldn't change their appearance to embrace the culture. In some instances {{it can be seen}} as a racist act, but for many of the young the Japanese fans it is a way of immersing in the hip hop culture the way they see fit. For example, the Japanese hip hop group Soul'd Out is extremely imitative of African American culture. Looking at Soul'd Out, their appearance stands out. Their wardrobe undoubtedly reminds one of African American fashion.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones who tend to not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E
25|$|Harmonix was {{approached}} by RedOctane to help develop the software for the first Guitar Hero game, itself based on Japanese games like Guitar Freaks. Harmonix used their previous experience in note-matching techniques from Frequency and Amplitude, {{as well as the}} lessons learned in developed Karaoke Revolution to create the Guitar Hero software. Harmonix was less concerned on developing gameplay, and instead more on connecting the player to the music, working to track the notes of the songs appropriately on the five-button controller as to make the player <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> are playing the real instrument. Guitar Hero would go on to be a major success and found the basis of the Guitar Hero series.|$|E
25|$|Since Charles Darwin, the {{willingness}} of some humans to sacrifice themselves for genetically unrelated {{members of the same}} large, diffuse group (such as a religion or a nation) has raised a theoretical challenge. Social psychological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are motivated by commitment to the larger collective whereas anthropological perspectives have contended that such sacrifices are triggered by commitment to other members of the group. The distinction between local and extended fusion provides an explanation for these apparently competing explanations. Local fusion is proposed to occur in relatively small, homogeneous groups whose members attach to each other through direct personal contact (e.g., families or work teams). In contrast, extended fusion occurs in relatively large groups whose members do not all have personal relationships (e.g., political parties or nation states). In extended fusion, even though fused individuals may not actually know all of their fellow group members, they still <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>they</b> know them and even think of them as like family.|$|E
