5000|$|Synchronization of {{multiple}} interacting dynamical systems can {{occur when the}} systems are autonomous oscillators. For instance, integrate-and-fire oscillators with either two-way (symmetric) or one-way coupling can synchronize when {{the strength of the}} coupling (in frequency units) is greater than the differences among the free-running natural oscillator frequencies. Poincare phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks. [...] In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to <b>full</b> <b>synchronization</b> takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold. This is known as the Kuramoto model phase transition.

However, Gospel is finally successful and uses these programs, in combination with computer bugs, to construct a SuperNavi of immense power. This Navi is a duplication of Bass, who appeared in the original game as a hidden boss and who plays a larger role in later games. However, after fighting Megaman the Bass copy destabilized and transformed into a gigantic, wolf-shaped super Multi-bug Organism (Also referred as Gospel) that heavily resembles the sixth game's Gregar.

After, Ezio and Sofia go to Masyaf and open the library to find Altaïr's corpse holding a Piece of Eden. Ezio leaves it and his assassin tools, and tells Desmond, understanding now of his role as a messenger to him. A holographic being calling himself Jupiter explains to Desmond (through Ezio) how his society perished as a result of a massive solar flare apocalypse, and that the key to stop the 2012 solar flare lies in the fist civilization's technology commanded by vaults linked to a central vault in New York.

40|$|A novel {{approach}} is brought forward for synchronization of a clustered network in this paper, {{the objective of}} which is twofold. The first one is to study cluster synchronization by analyzing the inner coupling matrices of the individual clusters instead of {{the one of the}} whole network. The other is to show that <b>full</b> <b>synchronization</b> can be ensured by several types of cluster synchronization, the partitions of which are connected together. Compared with the classical method for <b>full</b> <b>synchronization,</b> our approach reduces the network size to the cluster size and additionally obtains the thresholds for different types of cluster synchronization.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{networks}} that optimize a combined measure {{of local and}} global synchronizability are evolved. It is shown that for low coupling improvements in the local synchronizability dominate network evolution. This leads to an expressed grouping of elements with similar native frequency into cliques, allowing for an early onset of synchronization, but rendering <b>full</b> <b>synchronization</b> hard to achieve. In contrast, for large coupling the network evolution is governed by improvements towards <b>full</b> <b>synchronization,</b> preventing any expressed community structure. Such networks exhibit strong coupling between dissimilar oscillators. Albeit a rapid transition to <b>full</b> <b>synchronization</b> is achieved, the onset of synchronization is delayed {{in comparison to the}} first type of networks. The paper illustrates that an early onset of synchronization (which relates to clustering) and global synchronization are conflicting demands on network topology.

40|$|Peer-to-peer {{networks}} rely on gossip algorithms {{to spread}} {{information about the}} peer activity and the network status. State-of-the-art gossip algorithms are not sufficient to spread the information widely, as the size and {{the complexity of the}} unmanaged networks grow. They suffer from high bandwidth utilization and lack mechanisms to verify the validity of the transferred information. We set the following questions for research: How can we achieve high coverage ratio for all the peers in the network while using as little bandwidth as possible? How can such a mechanism scale to millions of nodes? How can we reduce the effects of high churn rates? And finally, how we secure that the data transmitted are genuine? We develop Splash, a data synchronization algorithm with emphasis on high data coverage and efficient bandwidth usage. Our solution is based on Bloom filters and allows both partial and <b>full</b> <b>synchronizations</b> while avoiding the transmission of duplicate information. We propose two schemes to synchronize current and historical data between peers, over unmanaged and untrusted peer-to-peer networks. We use a SyncLog to keep the state of the synchronization algorithm to a minimum. For scalability we categorize data based on their origin, as local or global, and we investigate the use of different synchronization policies. Finally we discuss mechanisms that validate data to prevent the spread to invalid information. Through a series of experiments we present the effectiveness of this solution in networks with different sizes and churn effects. In simulation Splash achieves 95 % data coverage for all the peers in the network, which is 5 times more compared to BarterCast. Additionally Splash uses 107 times less bandwidth compared to BarterCast to achieve the same data coverage. gComputer EngineeringParallel and Distributed SystemsElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|R
