5|$|Lynton Keith Caldwell (November 21, 1913 – August 15, 2006) was an American {{political}} scientist and a principal {{architect of the}} 1969 National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Policy</b> Act, the first act {{of its kind in}} the world. He was educated at the University of Chicago and spent most of his career at Indiana University Bloomington, where he received tenure in 1956 and retired as Arthur F. Bentley Professor Emeritus of Political Science in 1984. Caldwell was the internationally acclaimed author or coauthor of fifteen books and more than 250 scholarly articles, which may be found in at least 19 different languages. He served on many boards and advisory committees, as a consultant on <b>environmental</b> <b>policy</b> issues worldwide, and received numerous honors and awards.|$|E
5|$|Expansion of US 113 to {{a divided}} highway slowed in the 1970s.

This new barrier slowed {{the completion of the}} divided highway between Milford to Dover. Maryland was subject to the same environmental assessment, but it was local activism that overcame state inaction in continuing divided highway construction along US 113 in that state.|$|E
40|$|A {{debate over}} <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> and trade competitiveness, “Do <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> really matter to impact trade competitiveness?” still exists {{during the past}} decade. The thesis aims at {{investigating}} the impact of WTO-EU <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> for the international olive oil market on production and export competitiveness of developing countries. In particular, we focus our analysis on the agro-industrial sector in the Arab countries, and we take specific reference {{to the case of}} the olive oil agro-industrial sector in Syria. In the frame of a partial equilibrium trade model, we incorporate the “end-of-the-pipe” <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> which in turn enhance the productivity of the polluting input. Moreover, a part of the burden of environmental compliance may be shifted onto foreign consumers. The most novel part of our model consists of the augmented effect of compliance with <b>environmental</b> <b>policies,</b> which includes not only the standard impact on the effective product price, but also on the input shadow price. The empirical findings, based on Syrian data, provide strong support to the Porter Hypothesis and its application to international markets for agro-industrial products. Accordingly, the study disproves the legitimacy of concerns that stricter <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> in developing economies may have negative impacts on their production and export competitiveness. In contrast, our results show that compliance with <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> under the large country assumption has positive effects on their international competitiveness of environmentally sensitive sectors, in particular. Therefore, the policy implications suggest the implementation of strict <b>environmental</b> regulatory <b>policies</b> supporting environmentally sound technologies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{literature}} on the interface of trade liberalisation, the environment and <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> {{in the context of the}} agricultural sector. The theoretical literature has been ambiguous concerning the sign of the net welfare effect of trade liberalisation if externalities are present, and empirical studies have not been able to resolve this ambiguity. Analyses of <b>environmental</b> <b>policies,</b> on the other hand, have focused on identifying optimal environmental measures to maximise domestic welfare, but have neglected the impact of <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> on global welfare. The paucity of a theoretical framework for the global welfare analysis of agricultural trade and <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> constrains the ability to classify agri-environmental or agricultural trade policies as trade-neutral, trade-distorting or trade-correcting. ...|$|R

5|$|Nixon was a late {{convert to}} the {{conservation}} movement. <b>Environmental</b> <b>policy</b> {{had not been}} a significant issue in the 1968 election; the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. He saw that the first Earth Day in April 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in June he announced the formation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Nixon broke new ground by discussing environment policy in his State of the Union speech; other initiatives supported by Nixon included the Clean Air Act of 1970 and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); the National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Policy</b> Act required environmental impact statements for many Federal projects. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act of 1972—objecting not to the policy goals of the legislation but to the amount of money to be spent on them, which he deemed excessive. After Congress overrode his veto, Nixon impounded the funds he deemed unjustifiable.|$|E

Another high-profile victory for the Republican minority was the State and Local Fiscal Assistance act. Passed in 1972, the act established a Revenue Sharing program {{for state and local}} governments. Ford's leadership was instrumental in shepherding revenue sharing through Congress, and resulted in a bipartisan coalition that supported the bill with 223 votes in favor (compared with 185 against).|$|E

5|$|Although {{conservation}} groups and environmental organizations had voiced {{opposition to the}} pipeline project before 1970, {{the introduction of the}} National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Policy</b> Act allowed them legal grounds to halt the project. Arctic engineers had raised concerns about the way plans for a subterranean pipeline showed ignorance of Arctic engineering and permafrost in particular. A clause in NEPA requiring a study of alternatives and another clause requiring an environmental impact statement turned those concerns into tools used by the Wilderness Society, Friends of the Earth, and the Environmental Defense Fund in their Spring 1970 lawsuit to stop the project.|$|E

5|$|Caldwell {{is perhaps}} best {{known as one of}} the {{principal}} architects of the National <b>Environmental</b> <b>Policy</b> Act (NEPA), the first act of its kind in the world, signed into law on January 1, 1970. In drafting A National Policy on the Environment in 1968 as consultant to Senator Henry Jackson, the head of the powerful Senate Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, Caldwell realized that more was needed than a mere a policy statement: an “action-forcing mechanism” would be necessary to secure federal agency compliance with the Act’s requirements. The origin of the requirement for preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) has been attributed to Caldwell, whose testimony at the Senate hearing in April 1969 laid the groundwork for inclusion of provisions requiring an evaluation of the effects of all major federal projects significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. In these “detailed statements,” as they were termed in the Act, all reasonably foreseeable social, economic, and environmental effects of a proposed action and any possible alternatives to it must be identified and assessed before any federal action takes place.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of institutional, economic and legal aspects of the relationship between national <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> and the multilateral trading system. In particular, it analyses some of the difficulties the WTO Dispute Settlement System faces when having to evaluate disputes on national <b>environmental</b> <b>policies</b> that have an impact on trade. From an economist's point of view it would be desirable that optimal <b>environmental</b> <b>policies,</b> i. e. policies that correct existing market failures, be ruled consistent with multilateral trade law. This paper argues that WTO law in theory provides appropriate tools to ensure rulings that are consistent with economic thinking. Yet, the paper also argues that economists have a rather imperfect knowledge of the precise welfare effects of different types of <b>environmental</b> <b>policies.</b> In practice, therefore, it is questionable whether economists are able to give adequate guidance to legal experts {{when it comes to the}} evaluation of national <b>environmental</b> <b>policies.</b> This is one of the reasons why there continues to be some degree of uncertainty as to the possible interpretations of certain WTO rules in the context of environmental disputes...|$|R

The procedure used also depends upon which type of institutional act is being used. The strongest act is a regulation, an act or law which is directly applicable in its entirety. Then there are directives which bind members to certain goals which they must achieve, but they do this through their own laws and hence have room to manoeuvre in deciding upon them. A decision is an instrument which is focused at a particular person or group and is directly applicable.
