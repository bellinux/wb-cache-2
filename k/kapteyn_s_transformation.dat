40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The thesis studies the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) {{transformation in the}} context of the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation.</b> The thesis argues that the uniqueness of the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation</b> does not prevent other militaries from applying the relevant concepts and considers the IDF as a good candidate for such a demonstration. Therefore, the thesis explores the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation</b> as a model to be benefited in the IDF's continuing transformation. The thesis also studies IDF from many perspectives to identify the transformational imperatives and the relevance of the current IDF transformational efforts. Main areas of interest are the Israeli security environment, societal transformation, and the features of the IDF's transformational efforts. During the analysis, the thesis discovers weak points concerning, both, the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation</b> and the IDF's current organization. The examination of the IDF's transformation in relation to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>transformation</b> reveals similarities between the two transformations and comes up with recommendations, primarily for the IDF, but to a lesser extent for the U.

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} image {{watermarking}} method with S-Hough transformation is proposed which is robust against geometric distortion. This watermarking is detected by a linear frequency change. The chirp signals {{are used as}} watermarks and this type of signals is resistant to all stationary filtering methods and exhibits geometrical symmetry. In the two-dimensional Radon-Wigner transformation domain, the chirp signals used as watermarks change only its position in space/spatial-frequency distribution, after applying linear geometrical attack. But the two-dimensional Radon-Wigner transformation needs too much difficult computing. We propose a modified Hough transformation to provide improved energy concentration of the S-transform. The proposed scheme can resolve the time-frequency localization {{in a better way}} than the standard <b>S</b> <b>transformation.</b> The watermark is embedded in the 1 D improved <b>S</b> <b>transformation</b> domains.

In doing so, particular attention is paid to the relatively uninvestigated behaviour of the outer measures of sets invariant under ergodic transformations. The investigation of sets invariant under ergodic transformations also considers the ergodic tool of tower extensions of transformations and their effect on transformation invariant sets, the transformation properties of invariance, mixing (in the ergodic sense) and the generation of Caratheodory 2 ̆ 7 s definition.

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} of interconnect structures {{is an important}} issue in modern high frequency circuit and chip design; such as the accurate computation of the frequency dependent internal impedance of interconnect structures, like wires and conducting strips, and the accurate and efficient electromagnetic (EM) modeling for shielded microstrip structures, especially in multilayered medium. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, a rigorous volume integral equation (VIE) is developed for the current distributions over two-dimensional conducting cylinders. For very low frequencies, it can be reduced to the widely-used quasi-static approximation. The different VIEs, surface integral equation (SIE), and partial differential equation (PDE) with Dirichlet boundary condition method are used to calculate the current distributions. The VIE with quasi-static approximation for good conductor is not accurate enough for the current distributions as there is a constant ratio between the results calculated from the quasi-static VIE and SIE. Two more leading terms from the Hankel function have been added into the integral kernel to solve this problem. We also calculate the internal impedance by using the different VIEs and the PDE with Dirichlet boundary condition method. The different results between VIE and PDE methods are due to the different boundary conditions. In the second part of this dissertation, the novel acceleration approaches for spectral domain approach (SDA) over single layer substrate and for spectral domain immitance approach (SDIA) over multilayered substrates have been developed using one of the most promising extrapolation method [...] the Levin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>transformation.</b> It avoids the leading term extraction of the Green 2 ̆ 7 s functions and the Bessel 2 ̆ 7 s functions (basis functions) by recasting the summation kernel to a suitable form which can be applied in the Levin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>transformation.</b> The extrapolation delay has been introduced to successfully apply the Levin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>transformation.</b> Accurate results have been obtained for the propagation constant by only using twenty to thirty terms. The final accuracy could be further improved if only the first leading term added with the Levin 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>transformation.</b> The new techniques match with or are even better than other acceleration techniques with high order leading term extraction. The two-dimensional PMCHWT formulation was developed from internal and external equivalent problems, along with the spatial and spectral domain dyadic Green 2 ̆ 7 s functions to deal with the arbitrary cross section and finite conductivity of multiple metal lines over multilayered substrates. The pulse and triangular basis were chosen to be applied in the Galerkin method.

It contained a high acid-volatile sulfide content (1031 micromol g(- 1)), reflecting an abundance of iron-monosulfide. The iron-monosulfide speciation in the initial sediment sample was dominated by nanocrystalline mackinawite (tetragonal FeS). At near-neutral pH and an 02 partial pressure of approximately 0. 2 atm, the mackinawite was found to oxidize rapidly, with a half-time of 29 +/- 2 min. This oxidation rate did not differ significantly (P < 0. 05) between abiotic versus biotic conditions, demonstrating that oxidation of nanocrystalline mackinawite was not microbially mediated. The extraction results suggested that elemental S (S 8 (0)) was a key intermediate S oxidation product Transmission electron microscopy showed the S 8 (0) to be amorphous nanoglobules, 100 - 200 nm in diameter. The quantitative importance of S 8 (0) was confirmed by linear combination XANES spectroscopy, after accounting for the inherent effect of the nanoscale S 8 (0) particle-size on the corresponding XANES spectrum. Both the selective extraction and XANES data showed that oxidation of S 8 (0) to SO 4 (2 -) was mediated by microbial activity. In addition to directly revealing important <b>S</b> <b>transformations,</b> the XANES results support the accuracy of the selective extraction scheme employed here. E. D. Burton, R. T. Bush, L. A.
