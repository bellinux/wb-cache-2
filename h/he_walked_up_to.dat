5|$|Kahn {{was sent}} off in an {{incident}} against Hansa Rostock on 3 March 2001. With his Bayern Munich team losing 2–3 {{in the final}} minutes, he sneaked into the area during a corner kick, jumped up, and punched {{the ball into the}} opponent’s net. He immediately received a red card, which dismissed him from the game. He was named man of the match when {{he was part of the}} squad which played the 2001 Champions League title against Valencia. He played an important role in the penalty shoot-out held after the teams remained tied 1–1 after extra time, making three saves. He also received the UEFA Fair Play Award for this match, after <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a disappointed Santiago Cañizares, the opposition goalkeeper, after the penalty shoot-out and attempted to comfort him. The same year, Bayern Munich won the International Cup at Tokyo's National Stadium against the Argentine team Boca Juniors. But the team failed to win the UEFA Super Cup a couple of months earlier.|$|E

2500|$|After {{four years}} Wingate left Charterhouse and in 1921 he was {{accepted}} at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, the Royal Artillery's officers' training school. For committing a minor offence against the rules, a first-year student would {{be subjected to}} a ragging ritual named [...] "running". [...] This ritual consisted of the first-year being stripped and forced to run a gauntlet of senior students, all of whom wielded a knotted towel which was used to hit the accused on his journey along the line. On reaching the end, the first-year would then be thrown into an icy-cold cistern of water. When {{it came time for}} Wingate to run the gauntlet, for allegedly having returned a horse to the stables too late, <b>he</b> <b>walked</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the senior student {{at the head of the}} gauntlet, stared at him and dared him to strike. [...] The senior refused. Wingate moved to the next senior and did the same; he too refused. In turn, each senior declined to strike; coming to the end of the line, Wingate walked to the cistern and dived straight into the icy-cold water.|$|E
