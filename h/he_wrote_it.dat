5|$|Fleming {{was better}} known as the author of a series of books about his super-spy creation, James Bond; The Diamond Smugglers is one of two non-fiction books <b>he</b> <b>wrote.</b> <b>It</b> was broadly well-received, {{although}} some reviewers commented on the stories not being new.|$|E
5|$|Truman {{was criticized}} by many for the letter. However, {{he pointed out}} that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> as a loving father and not as the president.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided {{to make it an}} outright drama. The storyline eventually became too serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he changed it to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E

5|$|Brubaker {{received}} {{calls from}} interested parties in Hollywood about adapting The Fade Out {{very early in}} its publication. However, {{he did not want}} to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|His work at Hartekamp led {{to another}} book, , a {{catalogue}} of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in nine months (completed in July 1737), {{but it was not}} published until 1738. It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.|$|E
5|$|Zombiepowder. began {{serialization}} in Shueisha's Weekly Shōnen Jump in 1999, {{and ran a}} brief 27 chapters {{before being}} canceled in 2000. According to the author's commentary in the cover leaf of the third volume, Tite Kubo {{was in a state}} of severe emotional trauma when <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it,</b> and only began to be happy with the quality of the series as it neared its ending. Speaking retrospectively 12 years later, Kubo stated that he was not yet used to the scheduling pressures of weekly serialization when he wrote Zombiepowder., and that at the time he paid too much attention to his editor's comments rather than trusting his own ideas. Other than Tite Kubo, Zombiepowder. had five credited staff, though their specific roles in its production were never specified.|$|E

60|$|Lying back in {{her deep}} arm-chair, Barbara was {{thinking}} of Clara d'Ellébeuse. What did it mean and who was Clara d'Ellébeuse? And why had <b>he</b> <b>written</b> <b>it</b> there for her to see? He--for {{there could be no}} doubt who had <b>written</b> <b>it.</b> The flash of teeth and eyes, the military salute; she knew she oughtn't to have waved to him. <b>He</b> had <b>written</b> <b>it</b> there while she was swimming out. <b>Written</b> <b>it</b> and then run away. She rather liked that--just an extraordinary word on the sand, like the footprint in Robinson Crusoe.|$|R

However, when he jots down Donovan's name, <b>he</b> <b>writes</b> <b>it</b> {{on the list of}} candidates for the Academy for Scholastic Distinction, a school for extremely gifted students.|$|R
5|$|Varno later filed {{a second}} {{arbitration}} upon learning that Gene Corman was to receive writing {{credit for the}} original story. Varno claimed Corman {{had nothing to do}} with the story, and produced large amounts of dated notes he claimed proved <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> himself. Varno won both arbitration matters. However, Roger Corman refused to pay Varno, and as a result he was not allowed to use Writers Guild of America members on his films. Corman used non-union writers for several years, but he finally agreed to pay Varno when he wanted to use a union writer on one of his films. Varno said he would have sought more money for the delay, but he was out of the country when Corman paid the money and missed his opportunity. Additionally, despite winning arbitration in the writing credit matter, Gene Corman was given on-screen original story credit in Night of the Blood Beast. When contacted by the distributor, American International Pictures, he was told removing Corman's credit would mean recalling all of the prints and changing them, which would have cost thousands of dollars, and Varno agreed to allow it to remain unchanged.|$|E
25|$|Second Thoughts Are Best: or, a Further Improvement of a Late Scheme to Prevent Street Robberies is a 1729 {{pamphlet}} by Daniel Defoe. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> {{under the}} name of Andrew Moreton Esq., presented as a dissatisfied middle-class old man extremely concerned about the increase in criminality around the 1720s.|$|E
25|$|She is a {{possible}} inspiration for the harlot, Moll Hackabout, in Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress: her lover Charteris features in the series and, like Moll, Salisbury had spent time in Bridewell.

5000|$|The form {{described}} in this section is used with third person singular subjects as the simple present tense (in the indicative mood): <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> novels all the time.

25|$|His writer's {{block on}} Boys and Girls Together continued, but Goldman then {{had an idea}} for another novel, No Way to Treat a Lady (1964). <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> in two weeks, and it was {{published}} under a pseudonym, Harry Longbaugh (a variant spelling of the Sundance Kid's real name). It was later made into a movie. Goldman then finished Boys and Girls Together, which became a best seller.|$|E
25|$|The US v. Al-Hussayen {{case has}} been {{considered}} a landmark test by civil libertarians. It {{was the first time}} that the government tried to use the material support statutes to prosecute activities that were mostly operating and maintaining websites. Supporters of Al-Hussayen said that he was not responsible for what linked websites published, nor for the material on the websites that he created, unless <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> himself. He is one of the few individuals until then to have been prosecuted under this provision of the law.|$|E
25|$|Pergolesi's L'Olimpiade {{represents}} one of the happy moments in the history of opera. The literary masterpiece of a Metastasio {{at the peak of his}} art (he was barely 35 when <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it)</b> found its first musical flowering at the hands of the young composer from Jesi. Many of those who praised the libretto did so thinking unconsciously of Pergolesi's melodies. In his score, L'Olimpiade is a homage to youth and love of the kind which perhaps can only be completely successful in musical drama.|$|E
5000|$|Critic Jack Sullivan had kinder {{words for}} Tiomkin's score for Strangers than did biographer Spoto: [...] "So {{seamlessly}} and inevitably does it fit the picture's design {{that it seems}} like an element of Hitchcock's storyboards", <b>he</b> <b>writes.</b> <b>It</b> is a score that [...] "goes largely uncelebrated." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{just the}} odd thing," [...] replied Flambeau. [...] "It's exactly like Hirsch's writing, {{and nobody can}} point out any mistake in it. But <b>it</b> wasn't <b>written</b> by Hirsch. If he's a French patriot <b>he</b> didn't <b>write</b> <b>it,</b> because it gives {{information}} to Germany. And if he's a German spy <b>he</b> didn't <b>write</b> <b>it,</b> well--because it doesn't give information to Germany." ...|$|R
50|$|Regarding the landmass of Eurasia as {{the center}} of global power, Brzezinski sets out to {{formulate}} a Eurasian geostrategy for the United States. In particular, <b>he</b> <b>writes,</b> <b>it</b> is imperative that no Eurasian challenger should emerge capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America's global pre-eminence.|$|R
25|$|The basic plot, characters, {{and much}} of the {{dialogue}} of the film is drawn from Petievich's novel, but Friedkin added the opening terrorist sequence, the car chase, and clearer, earlier focus on the showdown between Chance and Masters. Petievich said that Friedkin wrote a number of scenes but when there was a new scene or a story needed to be changed, <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> The director admits that Petievich created the characters and situations and that he used a lot of dialogue but that he wrote the screenplay, not Petievich.|$|E
25|$|The diary {{was written}} {{in one of the}} many {{standard}} forms of shorthand used in Pepys's time, in this case called Tachygraphy and devised by Thomas Shelton. It is clear from its content that it was written as a purely personal record of his life and not for publication, yet there are indications that Pepys took steps to preserve the bound manuscripts of his diary. <b>He</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> out in fair copy from rough notes, and he also had the loose pages bound into six volumes, catalogued them in his library with all his other books, and is likely to have suspected that eventually someone would find them interesting.|$|E
25|$|Leibniz {{also wrote}} a short paper, Primae veritates, first {{published}} by Louis Couturat in 1903 (pp.518–523) summarizing {{his views on}} metaphysics. The paper is undated; that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the jury is still out.|$|E

25|$|It is attested {{no later}} than Tertullian, De baptismo 17:5 (c 190), who says that a presbyter from Asia wrote the History of Paul and Thecla, and was deposed by John the Apostle after confessing that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it.</b> Tertullian inveighed against its use in the {{advocacy}} of a woman's right to preach and to baptize. Eugenia of Rome in the reign of Commodus (180-192) is reported in the Acts of her martyrdom to have taken Thecla as her model after reading the text, prior to its disapproval by Tertullian. Jerome recounts the information from Tertullian, and {{on account of his}} great care to chronology, some scholars regard the text a 1st-century creation.|$|E
25|$|His {{first book}} was In the Ranks of the C.I.V., {{an account of}} his {{experiences}} in the Boer War, but <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> without any thought of publication: while serving with the Honourable Artillery Company in South Africa he composed many long, descriptive letters about his experiences to his two sisters, Dulcibella and Constance. They and a family friend, Elizabeth Thompson, daughter of George Smith of the publishing house Smith, Elder, edited the letters into book form. The print proofs were waiting for Childers to approve on his return {{from the war in}} October 1900 and Smith, Elder published the work in November. It was well-timed to catch the public's interest in the war, which continued until May 1902, and it sold in substantial numbers.|$|E
25|$|During the journey, a phone begins ringing, but {{the group}} cannot work out whose it is. Ed {{believes}} the ringing {{is coming from the}} boot, so Chris pulls {{over to the side of}} the road. The group discover Sophie in the boot and try and work out what to do with her. Summer suggests that Chris takes her home, while Ed offers to call a taxi and go back with her. Andrew, desperate not to miss the concert, asks Chris to take her in the car, despite knowing that there is not a spare seatbelt. Chris reluctantly agrees and Sophie sits on Summer's lap. Summer asks what time The Jezabels are on stage and Andrew mentions that <b>he</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>it</b> down on his ticket, which is in his wallet inside Summer's bag. As Summer searches for the ticket, she finds the two cheques inside and asks Andrew about them. He tries to get his wallet back, but Summer discovers the cheques are worth $25,000 and Natasha realises he has sold the app.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{some other}} {{witnesses}} support Volkov's version. In particular, the composer's friend Flora Litvinova recalls Shostakovich saying, {{in reference to}} an unnamed Leningrad musicologist (Volkov was from Leningrad): [...] "We now meet constantly, and I tell him everything I remember about my works and myself. <b>He</b> <b>writes</b> <b>it</b> down, and at a subsequent meeting I look it over." ...|$|R
