50|$|The {{institute}} conducts {{research into}} genetic improvement of economically important root and tuber {{crops such as}} cassava, yam, cocoyam, sweet potato, Irish potato, ginger, rizga, <b>Hausa</b> <b>potato,</b> sugar beets and Turmeric. It also researches subjects such as crop cultivation techniques, storage, processing and utilization of the crops, concentrating on requirements of farmers in the south-east zone of Nigeria. The institute provides training of middle level agricultural workers, awarding National Diplomas and Higher National Diplomas and providing specialized vocational training to farmers.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to evaluate the replacement value of Rizga and <b>Hausa</b> <b>potato</b> for maize in broiler chicken. In experiment 1, three treatment diets with 2 replications each were fed to broiler chickens in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) using a deep litter management system. The dietary maize of the diets was substituted with <b>Hausa</b> <b>potato</b> at 0 %, 50 % and 100 % respectively. The results showed that all the parameters measured were significantly (P g (D 1) to 1053. 00 g (D 2) and 889. 00 g (D 3). The feed intake numerically increased from 1665. 0 g (D 1) to 2474. 90 g (D 2) and 2297. 52 g (D 3). The mean total revenue (N) realizable significantly decreased for birds fed diet 3 while diets 1 and 2 are comparable. In conclusion, substituting dietary maize with <b>Hausa</b> <b>potato</b> or rizga in broiler ration as shown in these trials seemed productively and economically inefficient, nevertheless, more research effort is still required so as to improve on the utilization of these neglected and under exploited root crops for efficient poultry production...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to compare the quality of bread produced from <b>Hausa</b> <b>potato</b> (HP) flour and sweetpotato (SP) flour at different substitution levels with wheat flour. The proximate analysis and sensory evaluation of the bread samples were determined. The proximate composition analysis revealed that the parameters such as crude fiber, ether extract and ash of the samples increased with an increase in the proportion. Higher fiber content was observed in <b>Hausa</b> <b>potato</b> bread samples, with the 30 % substitution level of HPB recording the highest fiber content of 3. 5 %. The protein content of all the samples from HP, SP and WH ranges from 2. 6 to 6. 8 %, highest protein was observed in WH bread sample. There was no significant differences (p< 0. 05) among WH and HP samples at 10 % substitution levels in all the sensory attributes evaluated (colour, taste, texture and general acceptability). However, it was observed that sweetpotato flour could act as a colouring agent in bread production in bread production. All the same, wheat bread sample had highest mean scores in all the sensory attributes evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{into the}} fungi {{associated}} with <b>Hausa</b> <b>Potato</b> {{was carried out}} in the teaching and research laboratory of the Department of Biological sciences of the University. Completely Randomized Design (CRD) was used and the data of Variance (ANOVA) and the means that were significant were separated using the Least Significant Difference (LSD). Four fungi Aspergillus niger, Fusarium oxysporum, Penicillum expansum consistently isolated identified in pure cultures from the diseased tubers collected from the two markets in Yola. Mean percentage incidence showed that 16. 47 %, R. stolonifer 14. 38 % and P. control material against fungal rot development was used. The three plant materials reduced the rot caused by the three organisms...|$|E
