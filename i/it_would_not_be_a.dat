5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E

However, if this idea is correct, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> new fundamental law of nature. It would simply be living systems and ecosystems maximizing their exergy efficiency by utilizing laws of thermodynamics developed in the 19th century.|$|E

It is to be noted that Nielsen had never been this light in his career. Nielsen had said that although it would be mighty {{difficult for him to}} beat Holyfield, he promised <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> one sided affair. Holyfield said that if he won he would move to next level and challenge for major titles.|$|E

25|$|When {{this use}} of tapping powers was {{revealed}} in June 1957 (by which time Rab Butler had succeeded Lloyd George), {{there was a major}} row with the Leader of the Opposition Hugh Gaitskell demanding a full explanation. Butler pledged that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> precedent and that he would consider withdrawing the evidence and asking the Bar council to disregard it. Marrinan was subsequently disbarred and expelled by Lincoln's Inn, but Butler was forced to appoint a committee of Privy Counsellors under Sir Norman Birkett to look into the prerogative power of intercepting telephone communications.|$|E
25|$|Indigenous Filipinos have harbored {{their own}} {{religions}} {{long before the}} Spanish had arrived at their shores. Along with these religions, are corresponding burial practices to accompany such religions. Given that the Spanish occupancy in the Philippines had lasted almost four-hundred years, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> rash assumption that Catholicism should have become widespread or have become the primary religion for the entire nation. This inference, however would be highly problematic as {{it is quite a}} ways from the actual truth. Persisting through the Spanish occupation, indigenous Filipino tribes continued with their respective religions and hence, with their customary burial practices. The Spanish influence however, highly affected the religious traditions and customs in the areas surrounding large trade cities and the capital. These influences include the location of the burials, position of the body and decoration of burial goods to name a few.|$|E
25|$|For 2012, Hughes {{signed for}} Murphy Prototypes, driving their Oreca 03-Nissan {{alongside}} Firth and Brendon Hartley in the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and Firth in the European Le Mans Series. His ELMS debut {{came at the}} 6 Hours of Castellet, but <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successful one, with the car catching fire during the event. Once more in the Le Mans event, however, mechanical maladies struck, with suspension failure after 196 laps forcing the team to retire from a strong position. A podium at the 6 Hours of Donington, however, {{would prove to be}} the team's only point-scoring finish of the season, as the team once more failed to finish at the Petit Le Mans, following an electronics failure after 330 laps. In addition to his ELMS and 24 Hours of Le Mans entries, Hughes returned to the British GT Championship with Team WFR in the Ginetta G50 GT4, being partnered by Jody Fannin. The pairing dominated the GT4 category, winning eight of their ten races {{on the way to the}} title, and finishing 84.25 points ahead of nearest rival Zoë Wenham.|$|E

25|$|In February 1380, Jogaila, without Kęstutis, made a five-month truce {{with the}} Livonian Order {{to protect his}} Lithuanian domains and cease Livonian support to Andrei of Polotsk. On May 31, 1380, Jogaila and Grand Master Winrich von Kniprode signed the secret Treaty of Dovydiškės. The clauses of the treaty were, overall, {{convoluted}} and not entirely clear. Based on {{the terms of the}} accord, Jogaila agreed not to intervene during attacks by the Teutonic Knights against Kęstutis or his children. However, if providing aid to Kęstutis were necessary to avoid any suspicions, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> violation of the treaty. The treaty remains controversial as the motives behind it are not entirely clear. Some historians blame Uliana, mother of Jogaila, or his adviser Vaidila, others point out generational differences: Kęstutis was about 80 years old and determined not to accept Christianity, while Jogaila was about 30 and was looking for ways to convert and modernize the country. Still others have suggested that the treaty was primarily directed against Andrei and his allies – his brother Dmitry of Bryansk and Grand Duke of Moscow Dmitri Donskoi. Jogaila, having secured his western front, allied himself with the Golden Horde against the Grand Duchy of Moscow for the upcoming Battle of Kulikovo.|$|E
25|$|The ADA {{provides}} explicit {{coverage for}} service animals. Guidelines {{have been developed}} not only to protect persons with disabilities, but also to indemnify businesses from damages related to granting access to service animals on their premises. Businesses are allowed to ask if the animal is a service animal and ask what tasks it is trained to perform, {{but they are not}} allowed to ask the service animal to perform the task nor ask for a special ID of the animal. They can not ask what the person's disabilities are. A person with a disability can not be removed from the premises unless either of two things happen: the animal is out of control and its owner can not get it under control (e.g. a dog barking uncontrollably in a restaurant), or the animal is a direct threat to people's health and safety. Allergies and fear of animal would not be considered a threat to people's health and safety so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> valid reason to deny access to people with service animals. Businesses that prepare or serve food must allow service animals and their owners on the premises even if state or local health laws otherwise prohibit animals on the premise. In this case, businesses that prepare or serve food are not required to provide care or food for service animals nor do they have to provide a designated area for the service animal to use the bathroom. Lastly, people that require service dogs can not be charged an extra fee for their service dog or be treated unfairly. For example, being isolated from people at a restaurant. People with disabilities can not be treated less than other customers. However, if a business normally charges for damages caused by the person to property, the customer with a disability will be charged for his/her service animal's damages to the property.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, Courage Compétition {{began running}} the C41 in the IMSA GT Championship, doing {{so for the}} first time at the 24 Hours of Daytona. <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{successful}} event, as the C41, driven by Policand, Didier Cottaz and Fredrik Ekblom, succumbed to engine trouble after 12 laps, restricting them to 80th place. At the Grand Prix of Atlanta, Schubot was the sole C41 entrant, running Policand, Martin Guimont and Jacek Mucha in his C41, but the team could only manage 51 laps, and finished 18th, and last, overall. Schubot partnered Mucha in the next round, which was the Lime Rock Grand Prix, and the pair competed 91 laps before gearbox problems struck, and were classified 11th. At the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen, Schubot drove alongside Mucha and Guimont, but mechanical issues forced them to retire after 28 laps, and restricted them to 41st. Courage Compétition then entered a C41 in the 24 Hours of Le Mans; the car, driven by Cottaz, Policand and Marc Goossens, finished fourth overall, having completed 336 laps, and second in the LMP category. The team then entered the C41 in the International Sports Racing Series, and at the 1 Hour 15 Minutes of Zolder, Policand and Cottaz took second overall, ahead of a pair of Courage C36s. At the Mosport Festival (part of the IMSA GT Championship), Mucha and Guimont finished the race in tenth, before Mucha and Field took eighth in the Grand Prix of Las Vegas. In the non-championship 4 Hours of Le Mans, Cottaz and Policand won both races, and thus took the overall victory by three laps. Courage then returned to the IMSA GT Championship, and the pairing of Mucha and Guimont saw mechanical issues restrict them to 102 laps and 14th place at the Festival of Road Racing, before Field and Mucha took ninth at the 2 Hours of Sebring. Field and Mucha finished the IMSA GT Championship season with a 14th finish at the Monterey Sports Car Championships, before Cottaz and Policand finished the International Sports Racing Series season with a victory at the 2 Hours of Jarama.|$|E
