Based upon thermal stratification and frequency of turnover, holomictic lakes are divided into amictic lakes, cold monomictic lakes, <b>dimictic</b> lakes, warm monomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, and oligomictic lakes. The classification of lakes by thermal stratification presupposes lakes with sufficient depth to form a hypolimnion. As a results, very shallow lakes are excluded this classification system.|$|E

50|$|Most lakes are holomictic; {{meromictic}} lakes are rare, {{although they}} may be less rare than commonly thought. There are four types of holomictic lakes: oligomictic lakes, polymictic lakes, monomictic lakes, and <b>dimictic</b> lakes.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dimictic</b> lakes mix {{from the}} surface to bottom twice each year. <b>Dimictic</b> lakes are holomictic, a {{category}} which includes all lakes which mix one or more times per year. During winter, they are covered by ice. During summer, they are thermally stratified, with temperature-derived density differences separating the warm surface waters (the epilimnion), from the colder bottom waters (the hypolimnion). Mixing (overturning) typically occurs during the spring and autumn, when the lake is [...] "isothermal" [...] (i.e. at the same temperature from the top to the bottom). At this time, the water throughout the lake is about 4 °C, and, {{in the absence of}} any temperature or density differences, the lake readily mixes from top to bottom.

5000|$|The thermal {{stratification}} of lakes {{refers to a}} change in the temperature at different depths in the lake, and is due to the change in water's density with temperature. [...] Cold water is denser than warm water and the epilimnion generally consists of water that is not as dense as the water in the hypolimnion. [...] However, the temperature of maximum density for freshwater is 4 °C. In temperate regions where lake water warms up and cools through the seasons, a cyclical pattern of overturn occurs that is repeated from year to year as the cold dense water {{at the top of the}} lake sinks. For example, in <b>dimictic</b> lakes the lake water turns over during the spring and the fall. This process occurs more slowly in deeper water and as a result, a thermal bar may form. [...] If the stratification of water lasts for extended periods, the lake is meromictic. Conversely, for most of the time, the relatively shallower meres are unstratified; that is, the mere is considered all epilimnion.|$|E

40|$|A unique {{data set}} of 50 years of monthly {{temperature}} profiles from Lake Zurich, a normally ice-free lake {{located on the}} Swiss Plateau, allowed the one-dimensional numerical k- « lake model ’’SIMSTRAT’ ’ to be calibrated (1948 – 1957) and validated (1958 – 1997). Hindcasts of temperature profiles agree excellently with the measured data. Both interannual and intraannual variations in thermal structure are reproduced well during the entire 50 -yr simulation, thus demonstrating the stability and good prognostic qualities of the model. Simulations conducted with raised and lowered air temperatures (Tair) suggest that an increase in Tair will {{lead to an increase}} in lake water temperature at all depths. In comparison to the continuous modeling approach taken in this study, the commonly employed dis-continuous modeling approach (with no heat carryover during winter) substantially underestimated the degree of long-term hypolimnetic warming that can be expected to result from an increase in Tair. Thus, whereas the discon-tinuous approach yields valid predictions for strictly <b>dimictic</b> lakes that are ice-covered each winter, heat carryover during winter makes a continuous approach necessary in lakes like Lake Zurich that are only facultatively <b>dimictic.</b> The significant degree of hypolimnetic warming found in this study suggests that the response of facultatively <b>dimictic</b> lakes to increases in Tair is likely to differ from that of the strictly <b>dimictic</b> lakes modeled in other inves-tigations.

40|$|Methane-derived carbon {{has been}} shown to be an {{important}} carbon source for macroinvertebrates in several studies of lake ecosystems using stable isotopes. Furthermore, season and lake morphology appear to influence the importance of methane as a carbon source. However, rarely have the dynamics of the methane cycle been measured concurrently with the isotope signatures of chironomid larvae. We examined the methane dynamics in 2 lakes with contrasting mixing regimes (polymictic and <b>dimictic),</b> while monitoring corresponding changes in chironomid larval δ 13 C throughout an annual cycle. Both methane turnover rates and abundance of methane-oxidising bacteria were higher in the <b>dimictic</b> lake, where correspondingly lower mean larval δ 13 C values of – 44. 2 to – 61. 7 ‰ were recorded. In contrast, potential methane production and oxidation rates, as well as cell numbers of methane-oxidising bacteria were always lower in the polymictic lake; corresponding larval δ 13 C values ranged from – 32. 3 to – 29. 6 ‰. Furthermore, seasonal variation in larval δ 13 C was more pronounced in the <b>dimictic</b> lake (– 50. 1 ± 5. 9 ‰) compared to the polymictic lake (– 31. 1 ± 1. 2 ‰), reflecting the amplitude of turnover rates. This suggests strongly that lake characteristics have an influence on methane turnover rates and, in conjunction with season, affect the subsequent incorporation of methane-derived carbon into freshwater food webs via macroinvertebrates...|$|E

40|$|Thermal {{dynamics}} of lakes has {{a key role}} in chemical and biological processes in lakes including nutrient distributions and phytoplankton growth. Applications of hydrodynamic models to lakes can provide insights into possible future alterations in thermal dynamics induced by climate change. In this study, we present the calibration and validation of the newest version of the open-source hydrodynamic model GLM (General Lake Model) to the <b>dimictic</b> Lake Ammersee, located in south-east Germany. The simulation of lake water temperatures for the calibration period revealed an overall root mean square error of 0. 65 °C and a mean error of 0. 08 °C. The seasonal stratification pattern and the annual thermal structure of this <b>dimictic</b> lake were reproduced by the model. The model simulated the presence of winter ice cover for the only year out of 8 years simulated, when ice cover was observed. Elevated lake water temperatures were also reproduced in model simulations during a period in 2003 of unusually high air temperatures. Statistical analysis of the model calibration results for Lake Ammersee indicates a fit comparable to or better than most other well-established hydrodynamic models and provides an opportunity for continuous simulations through periods of ice cover. Our results indicate a major improvement in GLM compared with earlier model versions and demonstrate the applicability of GLM for limnophysical studies, particularly for altered forcing conditions such as climate change.
