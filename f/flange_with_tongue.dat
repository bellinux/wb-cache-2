40|$|The {{present study}} {{involved}} the parametric analysis of bolted flange connections of eighteen different circular monopoles. The parameters considered were {{the number of}} bolts (8, 6, and 4) and thickness of flange plate [25. 4 mm (1. 0 in.), 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) ]. These were analyzed under stiffened and unstiffened conditions. Four, two and four stiffeners, 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick, were used with 8 -, 6 - and 4 -bolt arrangements. Each finite element model {{is made up of}} a small diameter (171. 5 mm) circular pipe and a large diameter (327 mm) circular pipe both welded to circular flanges. The outer and inner diameters of the flange plates were 327 mm and 171. 5 mm respectively. Each bolt was 25. 4 mm (1 in.) diameter and was pretensioned to 227 kN (51 kips); and an external load of 45 kN (10 kips) was applied at the free end of the monopole, 1804 mm (71 in.) from the bolted joint, in the Riks analysis load step of ABAQUS (version 6. 3) computer program. From the finite element analysis, it was found that monopoles (8 bolts, 6 bolts and 4 bolts) with unstiffened 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick flange plates experienced a large deformation because of the thin flange plate. Optimum solutions to stiffened and unstiffened connections were found to be among those monopoles with minimal gap, deflection and deformation, i. e., 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for unstiffened case; and 12. 7 mm (0. 50 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 8 bolts, 25. 4 mm (1 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 4 bolts or 19. 05 mm (0. 75 in.) thick <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> 6 bolts for stiffened case. In addition to the parametric study, T-Stub and yield line analytical procedures were also presented with examples; and {{it was found that the}} analytical methods provide good preliminary guidance regarding connection parameters when designing bolted flange connections for circular monopoles.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new metal forming process for producing two-step external flanges on hollow parts. With this method, the flange is extruded by a movable sleeve, which {{moves in the}} opposite direction to the punch. This reduces the phenomenon of buckling of the tube wall, which allows extruding <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> relatively large volumes. The new method was applied to produce a two-step flange {{on the end of a}} tubular billet made of 6060 aluminum alloy. This cold metal forming process was designed based on numerical simulations and experimental tests. The effect of the basic technological parameters on metal flow was investigated and limitations of the process were identified. The experimental results confirmed the possibility of forming a two-step <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> a diameter that is approximately twice as big as the external diameter of the tubular billet...|$|R

30|$|The entire {{setup is}} housed in a four-fold {{differentially}} pumped vacuum chamber. The four chambers, {{described in more detail}} in the next sections, are a source chamber, a chamber housing the guides, a chamber where the collisions are detected, and a chamber to characterise the two molecular beams. Source and guide chamber are constructed using ISO-F and ISO-K type <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> Viton or other rubber gaskets. The last two use CF <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> copper gaskets. The adapter tube to make the transition between these standards is also the one that provides the kink, which is necessary because of the bend in the guides. A commercial half-nipple <b>with</b> an ISO-F <b>flange</b> was welded to a CF <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> a 10 -degree tilt between the flange faces. This separation in two standards was chosen for simplicity (and cost), and because other than continuity {{there is no reason to}} use the CF standard on a source chamber where the pressure during operation usually lies above 10 − 5 mbar. Our target pressure for the guide and collision chambers was in the range of 10 − 8 mbar. Even in that range no significant losses are to be expected from collisions of guided molecules with background gas. Bake-out of the apparatus is not only not required, it also is not possible because the permanent magnets must be expected to start demagnetising at temperatures above ≈ 60 °C.|$|R

However, there may be various situations (caused by operating, technological reasons etc.), in which the bar flange strengthening can’t be implemented, or it is insufficient.

40|$|Abstract: The injecting online {{leak sealing}} {{technology}} {{is an emergency}} repair technique widely applied in process industry, which can remove the leakages of the devices, flanges, pipes and valves, with safe, reliable, economic and efficient. In a variety of online leak sealing operations, the work to handle flange leakages accounts for about 90 % of the entire workload. This is because most of flanges in actual production have the installing and machining defects, such as uneven clearance, eccentric, reducing, etc. Aimed at those <b>flanges</b> <b>with</b> defects, to ensure the seal effect, the online leak sealing clamp must be machined and installed precisely, which will increase the difficulty of operation. Thus, {{on the basis of}} comparing advantages and disadvantages of the existing enhanced seal clamps, a new design has proposed {{to solve the problem of}} flange leakage, especially for the <b>flange</b> <b>with</b> defects, which can reduce the difficulties of operation while ensuring the sealing effect...|$|R
