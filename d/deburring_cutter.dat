The <b>deburring</b> <b>cutter</b> {{is mounted on}} a slender bar assembled into a cylindrical holder via a pin and a spring. The cutter {{has been designed to}} cover wide ranges of exit angle and diameter ratio between intersecting holes. The design is an improvement over the previous ones by the authors. Experiments have been performed on Al 6061. With the new design, mild exit burrs with exit angles greater than 458 are successfully removed. For large burrs with smaller exit angles, however, the deburring is likely to be incomplete...|$|E
