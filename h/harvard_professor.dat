5|$|As Yelp {{became more}} influential, the {{practice}} of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent. A study from <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor</b> Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014. Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. Recent studies, {{such as the one}} conducted by <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor</b> Elizabeth Warren, have shown that the average American household needs two incomes in order to live what is commonly perceived as a middle-class lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Many Massachusetts {{residents}} of the time perceived the quake as punishment from God for immoral behavior. In {{the days after the}} earthquake, special prayer services were held and civic authorities declared fast days. A number of sermons and other writings were published as a consequence, including Jeremiah Newland's Verses Occasioned by the Earthquakes in the Month of November, 1755 and Thomas Prince's Earthquakes the Works of God and Tokens of his Just Displeasure. Not all explanations of the event were theological; John Winthrop, a <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor,</b> proposed an alternate explanation having to do with heat and chemical vapors inside the surface of the earth.|$|E

5|$|There {{are various}} {{accounts}} of the introduction of polar coordinates {{as part of a}} formal coordinate system. The full history of the subject is described in <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor</b> Julian Lowell Coolidge's Origin of Polar Coordinates. Grégoire de Saint-Vincent and Bonaventura Cavalieri independently introduced the concepts in the mid-seventeenth century. Saint-Vincent wrote about them privately in 1625 and published his work in 1647, while Cavalieri published his in 1635 with a corrected version appearing in 1653. Cavalieri first used polar coordinates to solve a problem relating to the area within an Archimedean spiral. Blaise Pascal subsequently used polar coordinates to calculate the length of parabolic arcs.|$|E
5|$|Prescott {{first became}} {{interested}} in the history of Spain after his friend, the <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor</b> George Ticknor, sent him copies of his lectures on the subject. Prescott's studies initially remained broad, but he started preparing material on Ferdinand and Isabella in January 1826. His acquaintance Pascual de Gayangos y Arce helped him construct a sizable personal library of historical books and manuscripts concerning the subject. Alexander Hill Everett, an American diplomat in Spain, also provided him with material which was unavailable to Prescott in Boston. However, progress was stalled almost immediately, due to a sudden deterioration in Prescott's eyesight. Unable to find a reader fluent in Spanish, Prescott was forced to work through Spanish texts with an assistant who did not understand the language. When Alexander Everett heard of this situation, he provided Prescott with the services of George Lunt, who had adequate knowledge of Spanish for the task. However, this could only be a temporary arrangement, and he was replaced by a man named Hamilton Parker, who held the position for a year. Eventually George Ticknor, who was by then in charge of the department of modern literature at Harvard University, found James L. English, who worked with Prescott until 1831. Among the books studied by Prescott in this period, Ticknor lists Juan Antonio Llorente's Historia crítica de la Inquisición de España, Andrés Bernadez's Historia de los Reyes Católicos don Fernando y doña Isabel, Voltaire's Charles XII and William Roscoe's Life of Lorenzo de Medici, which were to be the sources on which the History of Ferdinand and Isabella was to be based. In spring 1828, Prescott visited Washington, where he and Ticknor dined with John Quincy Adams at the White House, and saw Congress in session.|$|E

Many more women are being added to the list of women who made very significant contributions in the early history of Christianity.

25|$|In the 19th century, one of {{the major}} focal points of antifeminism was {{opposition}} to women's suffrage, which began as a grassroots movement in 1848 and spanned for 72 years. Opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. In Sex in Education: or, a Fair Chance for the Girls (1873), <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor</b> Edward Clarke predicted that if women went to college, their brains would grow bigger and heavier, and their wombs would atrophy. Other antifeminists opposed women's entry into the labor force, their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} Max Ascoli, Carlo Sforza and Alberto Tarchiani in the Mazzini Society consequently {{led to the}} progressive distancing of Gaetano Salvemini from active decision making. Salvemini's fear was that Roosevelt would give Churchill and his conservative agenda a free hand in post-war Italy that would benefit the monarchy and those that had collaborated with Mussolini. After Mussolini's fall in July 1943, Salvemini became increasingly concerned that the Allies and Italian moderates favoured a conservative restoration in Italy. In order to provide an alternative, together with <b>Harvard</b> <b>professor</b> Giorgio La Piana, Salvemini authored What to do with Italy?, in which they sketched {{a plan for the}} reconstruction of Italy after the war along a republican and social-democratic programme.|$|E
