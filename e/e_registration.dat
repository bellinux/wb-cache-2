40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} novel Bayesian {{registration}} formulation in which image location is {{represented as a}} latent random variable. Location is marginalized to determine the maximum a priori (MAP) transform be-tween images, which results in registration that is more robust than the alternatives of omitting locality (i. <b>e.</b> global <b>registration)</b> or jointly max-imizing locality and transform (i. <b>e.</b> iconic <b>registration).</b> A mathematical link is established between the Bayesian registration formulation and the mutual information (MI) similarity measure. This leads to a novel technique for selecting informative image regions for registration, based on the MI of image intensity and spatial location. Experimental results demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} marginalization formulation and the MI-based region selection technique for ultrasound (US) to magnetic res-onance (MR) registration in an image-guided neurosurgical application. ...|$|R

If an ultrasound probe {{is equipped with}} a 3 D position sensor, the acquired images can be obtained in their spatial context, a technique commonly denoted “ 3 D freehand ultrasound”. Combining ultrasound and a pre-operative Computed Tomography (CT) scan of the same patient can be beneficial for a number of clinical applications. The core of this thesis is the development of novel methods for fully automatic alignment (i. <b>e.</b> <b>registration)</b> of 3 D freehand ultrasound and CT data, based on the image content and the physical properties of both modalities. In particular, a new method is proposed which simultaneously optimizes the linear combination of different ultrasonic effects simulated from CT, and the parameters for spatial alignment.

40|$|Abstract. Accurate {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), especially {{mild cognitive impairment}} (MCI), is critical for treatment of the disease. Many algorithms have been proposed to improve classification performance. While most existing methods focus on exploring different feature extraction and selection techniques, in this paper, we show that the pre-processing steps for MRI scans, i. <b>e.,</b> <b>registration</b> and segmentation, significantly affect the classification performance. Specifically, we evaluate the classification performance given by a multi-atlas based multi-image segmentation (MABMIS) method, with respect to more conventional segmentation methods. By incorporating tree-based groupwise registration and iterative groupwise segmentation strategies, MABMIS attains more accurate and consistent segmentation results compared with the conventional methods that do {{not take into account}} the inherent distribution of images under segmentation. This increased segmentation accuracy will benefit classification by minimizing errors that are propagated to the subsequent analysis steps. Experimental results indicate that MABMIS achieves better performance when compared with the conventional methods in the following classification tasks using the ADNI dataset: AD vs. MCI (accuracy: 71. 8 %), AD vs. healthy control (HC) (89. 1 %), progressive MCI vs. HC (84. 4 %), and progressive MCI vs. stable MCI (70. 0 %). These results show that pre-processing the images accurately is critical for neuroimaging classification. ...|$|E

After exclusion of artefact regions from the matching process, 90 % of the error was within+/- 1. 5 mm.

France has introduced a system of CO 2 -based purchase taxes and subsidies, whereas Germany and Sweden impose annual circulation (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>registration)</b> taxes that are linear functions of CO 2 emissions rates. This paper (a) compares the effects of vehicle taxes on registrations and average emissions rates across countries and (b) estimates the effect of reducing CO 2 emissions rates on manufacturers' profits. The taxes have had a significant negative short-run effect on new vehicle registrations in all three countries, although the effect is somewhat stronger in France than in Germany and Sweden. We find little evidence that the French tax caused manufacturers to change the emissions rates of individual vehicles, however. The {{second part of the}} paper takes advantage of the theoretical equivalence between an emissions rate standard and a CO 2 -based emissions rate tax. We use the results from the first part to estimate the effect on manufacturers' profits of reducing emissions rates. Focusing on France, a decrease of 5 grams of CO 2 per kilometer (about 3 percent) reduces short-run profits by 10 - 50 euros per vehicle, depending on the manufacturer.

The assessment of dermal penetration and bioavailability (including penetration, metabolism, and entry into the systemic circulation) is therefore an important consideration in the risk assessment of chemicals. The skin is a heterogeneous organ with a multilayer structure. Based on its architecture and physiology, substances can penetrate through three major ways but can also be blocked in the different skin layers and in the skin appendages, which act as reservoir. In addition to that, as the skin is a metabolically competent organ, substances can undergo metabolism.

The data on thresholds of the BAERs registered to acoustic stimuli in the event of air and bone conduction obtained in this study are comparable; hearing thresholds in the event of acoustic stimulation by means of a bone vibrator correlates with the results of the BAERs registered to the stimuli transmitted by means of air conduction earphones (r = 0. 9).

40|$|The European Union is {{changing}} its general approach to chemical regulation by introducing the new programme REACh, i. <b>e.</b> <b>Registration,</b> Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals. In this paper {{we argue that}} REACh {{is nothing less than}} a paradigm shift in the regulatory approach of the EU. Generally speaking, REACh places all major responsibilities with firms rather than on administrative bodies. At the same time, this policy is far from undemanding: companies marketing substances falling under REACh must ensure that along the production chain dangers to health and environment will be mastered throughout all intermediate and final users of the substance or the product containing the substance. In other words, producers of REACh chemicals must start downstream information and communication processes along the entire production chain to meet the requirements of the directive, which is stipulating both gathering the risk-related information and implementing appropriate risk-reduction measures. This paper aims to identify the major changes in the policy approach induced by REACh, and the type of behavioural model necessary to give a well-founded prognosis. In this paper we describe briefly responsive regulation as the new underlying paradigm of regulation as opposed to hierarchical regulation. From there we proceed to analyse the concept of self-responsibility in this context, and suggest adopting an agent-specific approach. In order to form expectations about the possible outcome of such regulation, behavioural models need to be well-defined for a systematic analysis of in-centives imposed by REACh. We propose a behavioural model of homo oeconomicus institutionalis in order to allow cognitive limits and rule-following behaviour of individuals in complex situations.
