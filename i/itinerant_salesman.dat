[...] In several passages of his work, Mayhew categorises, hawkers, hucksters and peddlers as a single group of <b>itinerant</b> <b>salesman</b> and claims that he is unable to say what distinction was drawn between a hawker and a huckster.

40|$|The {{integration}} of {{performance in the}} sale of medicaments dates back to ancient shamanic practices. The shift from total reliance on healers from the 1960 s to new products and models of healthcare delivery saw <b>itinerant</b> <b>salesmen</b> in Nigeria turn the sales of healthcare products into sophisticated participatory performative acts. Historically shamans contextualised healing as performed enactments in which trance, possession, and choreographed actions were important in convincing clients of their pedigree. The performance quotients deployed by shamans were significant in how results were viewed: a strategy that Nigeria’s post-civil war (1967 – 1970) <b>itinerant</b> medicine <b>salesmen</b> later honed into theatricalised displays. From the early 1970 s to 1990 s modern <b>itinerant</b> medicine <b>salesmen</b> invaded public transports using a combination of spontaneous dramatisation, role-play, costuming, devised narratives and audience participation to ensure sales. The Nigerian government banned this activity from public transports in the late 1990 s, but it persists in other settings. This paper explores the marketing of healthcare as a form of ‘direct theatre’ (Schechner 1992) and how the deployment of performance to functional intentions results in a unique form of theatricality in which medical products are significant ‘actants’ (Hilton 1987...|$|R
5000|$|Its {{vocabulary}} arose amongst {{those involved}} in the industry of manufacturing farm implements in the village (yokes, wagons, footstools; and the threshing-board, a wooden tool resembling a sledge, with his bottom-side holding many lithic flakes that cuts the pile of cereal crop, in order to separate the grain {{of the rest of the}} plant: threshing). The argot was thus used by the <b>itinerant</b> <b>salesmen</b> of these products, in opposition to settled villagers. In the face of mechanized agriculture, Gacería has survived amongst those who still sell such ancient farm implements as collectors' items.|$|R
40|$|Here {{we have a}} {{practical}} guide to healthy publishing, for organisations where publishing is not the core function. Often driven by a noble mission, such organisations fail at publishing {{because they do not}} know how to meet and satisfy the needs of the market. As a result, they print piles of books for which there is no demand or they miss golden opportunities to get their message out and their sales up. The book s eight chapters go through the steps of understanding marketing and the market, making a marketing plan (including getting a mention in Spore!), estimating print-runs, sales, finance and strategic planning. Particularly useful sections cover the new skills of selling on the Internet, plus the ins-and-outs of doing business with distributors, rights and co-publications. There are common-or-garden guidelines on understanding a profit and loss account (why nothing on balance sheets?) and even a detailed table for calculating the right cover price, and settling discounts for dealers. This is a collection of textbook wisdom mixed with homilies from the author s two decades of bookselling together with some focused remarks about possible donors and co-publishers. All of it is sound advice of use anywhere, but it tilts heavily towards the economic and cultural mindsets of eastern and southern Africa with those regions relatively well developed book industry and Internet access. There are similar examples from the Caribbean. Would-be publishers outside those regions may feel that their specific needs, strengths and weaknesses have not been done proper justice. The absence of any mention of the colporteur (<b>itinerant</b> <b>salesman)</b> in West Africa is one example of omissions that a second edition could correct. It is not quite ten years since this reviewer, in a report to CTA on technical publishing in Africa, likened the supply and demand of publications to 'ships passing each other unseen in the night', and this book alludes to similar cases today. Much good has happened in ACP publishing since then though, most notably in the growth of lively, independent publishers and booksellers, and their associations. The African Publishers Network now has a Caribbean sister and one on the way in the Pacific, whilst the Pan-African Booksellers Association has emerged as an energising partner. Few of these publishing professionals, however, focus on agricultural and rural development since they do not regard it as a viable market. Bridget Impey s contribution is to help communicators and publishers within the sector to be business-like in developing that market.

On the other hand, they are a necessity in the city, and a convenient and cheap way to get around.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In 1981, illegal {{processing}} of rapeseed oil by a Spanish oil refinery {{resulted in the}} mass foodborne illness epidemic known as Toxic Oil Syndrome (TOS). The toxic oil associated with this epidemic was sold in neighborhood markets and by <b>itinerant</b> <b>salesmen</b> as inexpensive olive oil. Ingestion of the toxic oil resulted in more than 20, 000 illnesses and over 1, 500 deaths in Spain. The etiologic agent of TOS remains unknown. In addition, animal studies have provided little insight into the mechanisms of toxicity because no animal model exhibits the symptoms of TOS. Researchers of Eosinophilia- Myalgia Syndrome (EMS) are in a similar quandary. EMS occurred in the United States in 1989, and the symptoms of this illness parallel TOS quite closely.

Keys was installed as president with an office in the Kearns Building in Salt Lake City. Within eight years the company, which had been incorporated as Telemation, had 420 employees, producing and marketing 156 products for the television industry with annual sales of $10 million. It became the nation's largest supplier of closed circuit TV systems and developed scores of proprietary items for cable television, industrial, educational and commercial TV.

50|$|Second, a controversy, {{composed}} of two separate but related components, engulfed SIL between approximately 1971 and 1981. Firstly, according to Stoll, critics in the U.S., particularly {{in the halls of}} academia, left few facets of the Institute's work unscathed. Some even criticized the bringing of literacy to preliterate societies as harmful. However, the biggest negative reaction to SIL was probably triggered by opposition to its translation of the Bible. How could an academic organization justify translating a religious book for often preliterate people groups who had their own traditional religions? SIL's response was that it was just making the Bible accessible to anyone who might want to read it. Secondly, during the same period many foreign governments were criticized by politically motivated factions for cooperating so closely with SIL. Their criticisms of SIL ranged from the unfair and the unsubstantiated (like the claim that SIL was seeking raw materials for U.S. corporations) to the ridiculous (that it had killed indigenous babies to render their fat, so that it could be used as an ingredient in rocket fuel, explaining how the Americans had been able to land on the moon). The campaign was part of the Cold War struggle between the U.S. and the former Soviet Union with SIL viewed {{as a symbol of the}} U.S. but the charges caused governments to argue internally over whether to continue supporting SIL with state contracts and, in at least one case, whether to allow the SIL presence to continue within its borders. Ecuador, for example, chose to end its official ties with SIL. In Peru, the government, after an in-depth investigation of SIL, not only rescinded an order it had given for SIL to leave the country, but actually renewed and expanded its original contract for 10 additional years. In 1981, Peru's president, Fernando Belaunde Terry, gave William Cameron Townsend the highest award that a foreigner can receive from Peru, the most advanced level of the Order of the Sun (El Orden del Sol), in honor of his and SIL's service on behalf of Peru's minority language groups. It was an affirming conclusion that came near the end of the life of an <b>itinerant</b> Bible <b>salesman</b> who lived to become the friend of presidents, and the main catalyst for the largest Bible translation movement in history. He continued to be an elder statesman and a respected advisor to SIL leaders and others until his death one year later, at age 85.|$|R

Sincerely yours, WILLIAM H. BROWN WHB/mp McElroy for Governor Headquarters 74 South Third Street Columbus, Ohio FOR RELEASE: Tuesday, April 17, 1962 at 9 a. m. Statement of Attorney General Mark McElroy at news conference in his office. Attorney General Mark McElroy, Democratic Candidate for Governor, said today that experience will indicate that it may prove wise to reinstate the sales tax stamp. McElroy stated that Governor DiSalle, who championed {{the elimination of the}} sales tax stamp, may find that he made a sad mistake which will cost the treasury of Ohio many millions of dollars. This, in turn, will mean an increase in taxes to already overburdened Ohio taxpayers in making up the loss of revenue caused by eliminating the sales tax stamp. McElroy reviewed the arguments in favor of the law abolishing the stamp. He recited the figure of $ 5 million dollars as the savings in elimination of the sales tax stamp in the cost of printing the stamps and the payment to clubs and organizations on redemption of the stamps. "However," McElroy said, "This will be more than offset by the loss of sales tax income resulting from bankruptcies of existing firms who have not had to purchase prepaid sales tax stamps. In addition," McElroy went on, "the new businesses that stagger along for six months or a year, and who never made a success from their opening business day, will not have had to purchase the tax stamps. " McElroy for Governor Headquarters April 17, 1962 [...] Page - 2 - McElroy also pointed out that some merchants operating as <b>itinerants,</b> or door-to-door <b>salesmen</b> from outside the state also fall into this bracket. "In addition," McElroy added, "we must remember with such organizations as PTA groups, Girl Scouts, Retarded Children, K of C, Masonic, Kiwanis, Exchange, Rotary, Lions, Churches, Hospitals and Convents, and so forth, we had about four million individuals who were policing issuance of sales tax stamps when making purchases. There are always some few merchants who will chisel 'just a little', but the aggregate amount of chiselling with the elimination of the stamp could total many millions of dollars. " McElroy also stated that the new law will increase the cost of government, since the Department of Taxation now has a staff of 400 examiners who are able to audit the accounts of only two or three percent of vendors. With the new law, this staff may have to be doubled in order to inspect the books of merchants. ### 4 / 16 /iii...|$|R
