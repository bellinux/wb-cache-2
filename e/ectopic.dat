5|$|Acute pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum pregnancy test is typically obtained to rule out <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. Culdocentesis will differentiate hemoperitoneum (ruptured <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy or hemorrhagic cyst) from pelvic sepsis (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other causes may produce similar {{symptoms}} including appendicitis, <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, hemorrhagic or ruptured ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, and endometriosis and gastroenteritis, peritonitis, and bacterial vaginosis among others.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ectopic</b> enamel is enamel {{found in}} an unusual location, such as the root of a tooth.|$|E
5|$|Fordyce spots, or Fordyce granules, are <b>ectopic</b> sebaceous glands {{found on}} the {{genitals}} and oral mucosa. They show themselves as yellowish-white milia (milk spots).|$|E
5|$|In 2014, she {{revealed}} her {{struggles with}} endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome, {{which led to}} infertility. King suffered five miscarriages and an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy prior to her first successful pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Silkies {{are also}} known for their polydactyly, usually manifesting as an {{additional}} 1-2 digits in the foot. The genetic cause of this extra digit formation {{has been shown to}} be a SNP in a regulator of the SHH gene, called the ZPA Regulatory Sequence (ZRS). This causes <b>ectopic</b> SHH expression in the anterior of the developing limb bud, leading to increased tissue growth and digits. Interestingly, while the feet of the Silkie display polydactyly, the wings have the standard tridactyly (three digit) arrangement. The Japanese Silkie initially develops additional digits in the wing as an embryo, but these are lost prior to hatching. The genetic cause behind Silkie polydactyly differs from those that cause polydactyly in the Dorking chicken breed, which is due to <b>ectopic</b> FGF4 expression in the AER, with <b>ectopic</b> SHH a secondary effect.|$|E
5|$|Official Church {{teaching}} {{allows for}} medical procedures and treatments {{intended to protect}} or restore the mother's health if {{she would be in}} mortal danger without them, even when such procedures carry some risk of death to the fetus. Examples include the removal of a fallopian tube {{in the case of an}} <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, removal of a pregnant cancerous uterus, or an appendectomy.|$|E
5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. Occasionally, the infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E
5|$|Depending on {{the type}} of tumor, paraneoplastic phenomena—symptoms not due to the local {{presence}} of cancer—may initially attract attention to the disease. In lung cancer, these phenomena may include hypercalcemia, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH, abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood), <b>ectopic</b> ACTH production, or Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome (muscle weakness due to autoantibodies). Tumors {{in the top of the}} lung, known as Pancoast tumors, may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to Horner's syndrome (dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side), as well as damage to the brachial plexus.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to death occurring in pregnancy and childbirth, pregnancy {{can result in}} many non-fatal health problems including obstetrical fistulae, <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, preterm labor, gestational diabetes, hyperemesis gravidarum, hypertensive states including preeclampsia, and anemia. Globally, complications of pregnancy vastly outway maternal deaths, with an estimated 9.5 million cases of pregnancy-related illness and 1.4 million near-misses (survival from severe life-threatening complications). Complications of pregnancy may be physical, mental, economic and social. It is estimated that 10–20 million women will develop physical or mental disability every year, resulting from complications of pregnancy or inadequate care. Consequently, international agencies have developed standards for obstetric care.|$|E
5|$|Pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease or pelvic inflammatory disorder (PID) is an {{infection of the}} upper part of the female reproductive system namely the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries, and inside of the pelvis. Often there may be no symptoms. Signs and symptoms, when present may include lower abdominal pain, vaginal discharge, fever, burning with urination, pain with sex, or irregular menstruation. Untreated PID can result in long term complications including infertility, <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, chronic pelvic pain, and cancer.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; they spent the summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was <b>ectopic</b> {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sterilization}} {{is considered}} a permanent procedure, {{it is possible to}} attempt a tubal reversal to reconnect the fallopian tubes or a vasectomy reversal to reconnect the vasa deferentia. In women the desire for a reversal is often associated with a change in spouse. Pregnancy success rates after tubal reversal are between 31 and 88 percent, with complications including an increased risk of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. The number of males who request reversal is between 2 and 6 percent. Rates of success in fathering another child after reversal are between 38 and 84 percent; with success being lower the longer the time period between the original procedure and the reversal. Sperm extraction followed by in vitro fertilization may also be an option in men.|$|E
25|$|In addition, damaged oviducts {{increase}} the risk of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. Thus, if one has had salpingitis, the risk of a pregnancy to become <b>ectopic</b> is 7 to 10-fold as large. Half of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies are due to a salpingitis infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{rare cases}} of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, {{there may be}} two fertilized eggs, one outside the uterus and the other inside. This is called a {{heterotopic}} pregnancy. Often the intrauterine pregnancy is discovered later than the <b>ectopic,</b> {{mainly because of the}} painful emergency nature of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies. Since <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies are normally discovered and removed very early in the pregnancy, an ultrasound may not find the additional pregnancy inside the uterus. When hCG levels continue to rise after the removal of the <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, there is the chance that a pregnancy inside the uterus is still viable. This is normally discovered through an ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|When <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies are treated, the {{prognosis}} {{for the mother}} is very good in Western countries; maternal death is rare, but most fetuses die or are aborted. For instance, in the UK, between 2003 and 2005 there were 32,100 <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies resulting in 10 maternal deaths (meaning that 1 in 3,210 women with an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy died).|$|E
25|$|A {{persistent}} <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy {{refers to}} the continuation of trophoblastic growth after a surgical intervention to remove an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. After a conservative procedure that attempts to preserve the affected fallopian tube such as a salpingotomy, in about 15-20% the major portion of the <b>ectopic</b> growth may have been removed, but some trophoblastic tissue, perhaps deeply embedded, has escaped removal and continues to grow, generating a new rise in hCG levels. After weeks this may lead to new clinical symptoms including bleeding. For this reason hCG levels {{may have to be}} monitored after removal of an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy to assure their decline, also methotrexate can be given at the time of surgery prophylactically.|$|E
25|$|An <b>ectopic</b> {{pregnancy}} {{should be}} considered as the cause of abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding in every woman who has a positive pregnancy test. The primary goal of diagnostic procedures in possible <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy is to triage according to risk rather than establishing pregnancy location.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors are}} similar to tubal {{pregnancy}} with sexually transmitted disease playing a major role; however {{about half of those}} with <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy have no known risk factors (which include damage to the Fallopian tubes from previous surgery or from previous <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, and tobacco smoking).|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} <b>ectopic</b> {{pregnancy}} include: pelvic inflammatory disease, often due to Chlamydia infection, tobacco smoking, prior tubal surgery, {{a history of}} infertility, {{and the use of}} assisted reproductive technology. Those who have previously had an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy are at much higher risk of having another one. Most <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies (90%) occur in the Fallopian tube which are known as tubal pregnancies. Implantation can also occur on the cervix, ovaries, or within the abdomen. Detection of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy is typically by blood tests for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and ultrasound. This may require testing on more than one occasion. Ultrasound works best when performed from within the vagina. Other causes of similar symptoms include: miscarriage, ovarian torsion, and acute appendicitis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ectopic</b> pregnancy, {{implantation}} of {{the embryo}} outside the uterus.|$|E
25|$|Rupture of an <b>ectopic</b> {{pregnancy}} {{can lead}} to symptoms such as abdominal distension, tenderness, peritonism and hypovolemic shock. A woman with <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy may be excessively mobile with upright posturing, in order to decrease intrapelvic blood flow, which {{can lead to}} swelling of the abdominal cavity and cause additional pain.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{cause for}} the accumulation of <b>ectopic</b> fat is unknown. The cause is likely a combination of genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors {{that are involved in}} excess energy intake and decreased physical activity. Substantial weight loss can reduce <b>ectopic</b> fat stores in all organs and this is associated with an improvement of the function of that organ.|$|E
25|$|Heterotopic {{pregnancy}} is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning {{in which one}} twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. <b>Ectopic</b> pregnancies must be resolved {{because they can be}} life-threatening to the mother. However, in most cases, the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged.|$|E
25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy include increased hCG, vaginal bleeding (in varying amounts), sudden lower abdominal pain, pelvic pain, a tender cervix, an adnexal mass, or adnexal tenderness. In the absence of ultrasound or hCG assessment, heavy vaginal bleeding {{may lead to a}} misdiagnosis of miscarriage. Nausea, vomiting and diarrhea are more rare symptoms of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy.|$|E

25|$|A {{laparoscopy}} or laparotomy {{can also}} be performed to visually confirm an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. This is generally reserved for women presenting with signs of an acute abdomen and/or hypovolemic shock. Often if a tubal abortion or tubal rupture has occurred, {{it is difficult to}} find the pregnancy tissue. A laparoscopy in very early <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy rarely shows a normal looking fallopian tube.|$|E
25|$|If hypotension, tachycardia, and anemia are discovered, {{exclusion}} of an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy is important.|$|E
25|$|Currently, Doppler {{ultrasonography}} is {{not considered}} to significantly contribute to the diagnosis of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies implant in the Fallopian tube. Pregnancies can grow in the fimabrial end (5% of all <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies), the ampullary section (80%), the isthmus (12%), and the cornual and interstitial part of the tube (2%). Mortality of a tubal pregnancy at the isthmus or within the uterus (interstitial pregnancy) is higher as there is increased vascularity that may result more likely in sudden major internal bleeding. A review published in 2010 supports the hypothesis that tubal <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy {{is caused by a}} combination of retention of the embryo within the fallopian tube due to impaired embryo-tubal transport and alterations in the tubal environment allowing early implantation to occur.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of risk factors for <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies. However, in as many as one third to one half no risk factors can be identified. Risk factors include: pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease, infertility, use of an intrauterine device (IUD), previous exposure to DES, tubal surgery, intrauterine surgery (e.g. D), smoking, previous <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, endometriosis, and tubal ligation. A previous induced abortion does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} cases where <b>ectopic</b> {{pregnancy}} lasted many months {{and ended in}} a live baby delivered by laparotomy.|$|E
25|$|Progestogen-only {{emergency}} contraceptive {{does not appear}} to affect the function of the Fallopian tubes or increase the rate of <b>ectopic</b> pregnancies.|$|E
25|$|When Cushing's {{syndrome}} {{is due to}} extra ACTH it is known as <b>ectopic</b> Cushing syndrome. This {{may be seen in}} a paraneoplastic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Tubal {{pregnancy}} {{is when the}} egg is implanted in the Fallopian tubes. Hair-like cilia located on the internal surface of the Fallopian tubes carry the fertilized egg to the uterus. Fallopian cilia are sometimes seen in reduced numbers subsequent to an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy, leading to a hypothesis that cilia damage in the Fallopian tubes is {{likely to lead to}} an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy. Women who smoke have a higher chance of an <b>ectopic</b> pregnancy in the fallopian tubes. Smoking leads to risk factors of damaging and or killing cilia. As cilia degenerate the amount of time it takes for the fertilized egg to reach the uterus will increase. The fertilized egg, if it doesn't reach the uterus in time, will hatch from the non-adhesive zona pellucida and implant itself inside the fallopian tube, thus causing the pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ectopic</b> {{pregnancy}} {{may also}} occur if a fertilised egg develops outside the uterus, {{usually in the}} fallopian tubes and requires immediate destruction of the fetus.|$|E
