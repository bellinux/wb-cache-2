40|$|N-type back-contact back-junction {{solar cells}} were {{processed}} {{with the use}} of industrially relevant structuring technologies such as screen-printing and laser processing. Application of the low-cost structuring technologies in the processing of the high-efficiency back-contact back-junction silicon solar cells results in a drastic increase of the pitch on the rear cell side. The pitch in the range of millimetres leads to a significant increase of the lateral base resistance. The application of a phosphorus doped front surface field (FSF) significantly reduces the lateral base resistance losses.
