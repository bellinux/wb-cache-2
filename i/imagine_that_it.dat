25|$|One {{response}} is {{that humans are}} not necessarily confined to Earth, and could use it and move on. A counter-argument is that {{only a tiny fraction}} of humans could do this—and they would be self-selected by ability to do technological escalation on others (for instance, the ability to create large spacecraft to flee the planet in, and simultaneously fend off others who seek to prevent them). Another counter-argument is that extraterrestrial life would encounter the fleeing humans and destroy them as a locust species. A third is that if there are no other worlds fit to support life (and no extraterrestrials who compete with humans to occupy them) it is both futile to flee, and foolish to <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would take less energy and skill to protect the Earth as a habitat than it would take to construct some new habitat.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the {{highlights}} from the concert shown on television, Paul Byrne of Dublin's Evening Herald called the concert [...] "a delightfully silly idea" [...] with an [...] "irresistible charm". Anna Lowman of TV Scoop {{noted that some}} {{of the power of the}} featured Doctor Who music came from the audience associating the themes with powerful scenes from the television series. [...] She added, [...] "It was a joy to watch it on the TV, so I can only <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was magical to be there on the night itself." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{film was}} an example of the use of the {{character}} names Jack and May, which were to be repeatedly used by Lonergan in various productions. Bowers writes, [...] "It developed that Lloyd F. Lonergan, ... liked these names, and during the years to come used them again and again. One can <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> must have become a studio joke to decide who was to play Jack and who was to play May. In actuality, names such as Jack and May were used in printed synopses to keep track of who was who, but such names were usually not mentioned in the film's subtitles. Patrons watching the picture in a theatre had not the foggiest idea whether the hero was named Jack, Bertram, or Ezekiel." [...] The first usage of the two leading character roles was in Dots and Dashes.|$|E

500|$|The Stone Tape was a {{significant}} influence on John Carpenter's 1987 film Prince of Darkness in which {{a group of scientists}} investigate a mysterious cylinder discovered {{in the basement of a}} church. Besides directing the film, Carpenter wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym [...] "Martin Quatermass", and included a reference to [...] "Kneale University". This homage did little to impress Kneale, who wrote in The Observer, [...] "For the record I have had nothing to do with the film and I have not seen it. It sounds pretty bad. With an homage like this, one might say, who needs insults? I can only <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is a whimsical riposte for my having my name removed from a film I wrote a few years ago [...] and which Mr Carpenter carpentered into sawdust". The play also influenced the 1982 Steven Spielberg and Tobe Hooper film Poltergeist. In the 2004 BBC7 Radio Serial [...] "Ghost Zone", a character refers explicitly to the [...] "Stone Tape theory" [...] as an explanation for the way an invading alien intelligence is [...] "replaying" [...] scenes and figures from the past of the remote Scottish village in which the story is set. Author Marty Ross has explicitly acknowledged the influence of Kneale's work, and the Quatermass serials in particular, on his own BBC SF drama.|$|E

The aforementioned figure is {{as compared to the}} first runner-up Stephen Chow's (HKD 1,317,452,311) and second runner-up Jackie Chan's (HKD 894,090,962). [...] "I've never <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be as much as 1.7billion!" [...] he told the reporters. [...] For his contributions, a wax figure of Lau was unveiled on 1 June 2005 at the Madame Tussauds Hong Kong. In 2007, Lau was also awarded the [...] "Nielsen Box Office Star of Asia" [...] by the Nielsen Company (ACNielsen).|$|E
2500|$|Shuho Sato, {{who wrote}} Umizaru and Say Hello to Black Jack, has created some {{controversy}} on Twitter. Sato says, [...] "Manga school is meaningless because those schools have very low success rates. Then, I could teach novices required skills {{on the job}} in three months. Meanwhile, those school students spend several million yen, and four years, yet they are good for nothing." [...] and that, [...] "For instance, Keiko Takemiya, the then professor of Seika Univ., remarked in the Government Council that 'A complete novice {{will be able to}} understand where is [...] "Tachikiri" [...] (i.e., margin section) during four years.' On the other hand, I would <b>imagine</b> <b>that,</b> <b>It</b> takes about thirty minutes to completely understand that at work." ...|$|E

2500|$|On German Heroes' Day (12 March) of 1944, Dönitz {{declared}} that without Adolf Hitler, Germany would be beset by [...] "the poison of Jewry", {{and the country}} destroyed for lack of National Socialism, which, as Dönitz declared, met an uncompromising ideology with defiance. At the Nuremberg trials, Dönitz claimed the statement about the [...] "poison of Jewry" [...] was regarding [...] "the endurance, the power to endure, of the people, as it was composed, could be better preserved than if there were Jewish elements in the nation". Initially he claimed, [...] "I could <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{would be very difficult}} for the population in the towns to hold out under the strain of heavy bombing attacks if such an influence were allowed to work." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The law has now {{done its}} part, and the Queen of England, her crown and Government in Ireland, are now secure {{pursuant}} to Act of Parliament. I have done my part also. Three months ago I promised Lord Clarendon, and his government, in this country, that I would provoke {{him into his}} courts of justice, as places of this kind are called, and that I would force him publicly and notoriously to pack a Jury against me to convict me, or else that if I would walk out a free man from this dock, to meet him in another field. My lord, I knew I was setting my life on that cast; but I warned him that in either event the victory would be with me, and the victory is with me.

2500|$|On 5 May 2017, Wikileaks posted {{links to}} e-mails {{purported to be}} from Emmanuel Macron's {{campaign}} in the French 2017 presidential election. The documents were first relayed on the 4chan forum (used by far-right American groups) and by pro-Trump Twitter accounts, and then by Wikileaks, who indicated they did not author the leaks. Experts have asserted that the Wikileaks Twitter account {{played a key role}} in publicising the leaks through the hashtag #MacronLeaks just some three-and-a-half hours after the first tweet with hashtag appeared. The campaign stated that false documents were mixed in with real ones, and that [...] "the ambition of the authors of this leak is obviously to harm the movement En Marche! in the final hours before the second round of the French presidential election". France's Electoral Commission described the action as a [...] "massive and coordinated piracy action". France's Electoral Commission urged journalists not to report on the contents of the leaks, but to heed [...] "the sense of responsibility they must demonstrate, as at stake are the free expression of voters and the sincerity of the election". Cybersecurity experts initially believed that groups linked to Russia were involved in this attack. The Kremlin denied any involvement. The head of the French cyber-security agency, ANSSI, later said that they did not have evidence connecting the hack with Russia, saying that the attack was so simple, that [...] "we can <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a person who did this alone. They could be in any country." ...|$|E

60|$|But certain {{lengths in}} self-privation Mr Oriel did go; at any rate, for some time. He eschewed matrimony, <b>imagining</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> became {{him as a}} priest to do so. He fasted rigorously on Fridays; and the {{neighbours}} declared that he scourged himself.|$|R
60|$|Frank was a {{good deal}} {{surprised}} at first to see how much more difficult it was to hit a mark, even at the distance of twelve paces, than he <b>imagined</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be. Woodall would not allow him to take aim.|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked how}} the {{elephant}} {{responded to the}} track Albarn said: [...] "To be honest to you, when I sang it to the elephant, it shat itself.
