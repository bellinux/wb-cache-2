5000|$|The [...] "convergence" [...] part {{structures}} how the <b>entitlements</b> to emit carbon {{are shared}} between the countries or {{regions of the}} world. Initially <b>entitlements</b> would reflect current emissions, however subject to a negotiation of 'the rate of convergence' these initial <b>entitlements</b> will converge towards equal per capita <b>entitlements</b> across the planet. An early date of convergence will mean that countries with currently low per capita emissions (which as a rule are poorer countries) will see their <b>entitlements</b> rise while a late date for full convergence would risk curtailing poorer countries' chances of development.|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{explore the}} effect of performance information and production uncertainties on (i) subjective <b>entitlements</b> derived from the production process and (ii) bargaining over the jointly produced surplus. We hypothesize that performance information and details of the production process affect <b>entitlements,</b> which in turn influence bargaining behavior. We find that, without performance information, subjective <b>entitlements</b> are mostly mutually consistent, and bargaining mainly ends with an equal split. In stark contrast, negotiators derive strong, mutually inconsistent, subjective <b>entitlements</b> when there is performance information. These subjective <b>entitlements</b> affect opening proposals, concessions, and bargaining duration and lead to asymmetric agreements. Moreover, given performance information, endogenous variations in <b>entitlements</b> influence bargaining, suggesting an independent role of subjective <b>entitlements.</b> Production uncertainties influence bargaining, especially when performance information is present, but do not substantially mitigate {{the effect of}} <b>entitlements.</b> Theoretical bargaining models allowing for reference points or fairness principles can partly account for the empirical results. Yet, important aspects are left unexplained and our results suggest ways for extending these models. © 2015 INFORMS...|$|R

40|$|Market {{interactions}} are {{brought about by}} the interplay of <b>entitlements</b> and obligations. <b>Entitlements</b> are rights, as perceived by the individuals. They are subjectively perceived rights that go along with a motivational disposition to defend them. Obligations are the counterparts of <b>entitlements.</b> They refer to claims of others that are subjectively accepted, and go along with a motivational disposition to respect these claims. Very simple transactions must rely on a system of <b>entitlements</b> and obligations. Simple selfishness would not be sufficient to bring them about or sustain them. This is especially true for nonenforceable contracts. The relationship of <b>entitlements</b> and obligations to norms is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Employees {{who have}} {{rendered}} faithful service, often trading off immediate pay increases for {{the promise of}} improved leave and redundancy benefits, do so trusting that the employer will honour those <b>entitlements.</b> As many recent corporate collapses have shown, that trust is often misplaced. This paper reviews the legal position of employee claims to <b>entitlements.</b> Although it offers a useful safety net, the General Employee <b>Entitlements</b> Redundancy Scheme (GEERS) does not provide full security. The author argues that employee associations could work to improve recovery of lost <b>entitlements</b> by using the legal tools employed by commercial lenders. In this way, employees could ensure that their <b>entitlements</b> are held ‘in trust’, in a legal sense. ...|$|R

Though sometimes shifting abruptly in time, Vanaja is an arresting story of modern-day hardship and class exploitation, recalling Charles Dickens as well as Western fairy-tale lore. Domalpalli's settings are ultra-real in detail and color, from the crude, almost feudal deprivations of Vanaja's dirt-floor background to the stately rituals and autocratic <b>entitlement</b> of the well-to-do.|$|E

5|$|Underwood {{announces that}} he will not run for reelection, and advocates for America Works, which he intends to pay for by {{stripping}} <b>entitlement</b> programs. He fails to get the bill through Congress and uses that as a reason to renege on his promise to not run in 2016. Solicitor General Heather Dunbar (Elizabeth Marvel) announces that she will seek the presidential nomination, and actually gives Underwood a battle. Underwood convinces Sharp to get married so she can announce her candidacy, for the sole reason of sapping women’s votes from Dunbar, at which point she will withdraw and accept the nomination for VP. After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E

Following the resignation of Sir Patrick Hastings in June 1926, Bondfield was adopted as the Labour candidate at Wallsend, and won the subsequent by-election with a majority of over 9,000. Meanwhile, she had accepted appointment to the Blanesburgh Committee, which the Conservative government had set up to consider reforms to the system of unemployment benefit. Her private view, that <b>entitlement</b> to benefits should be related to contributions, was not widely shared in the Labour Party or the TUC. When the committee made recommendations along these lines she signed the report, which became {{the basis of the}} Unemployment Insurance Act 1927.
