She wrote all of the songs on the album, and received a credit as producer with Gibson listed as executive producer. Grigorieva explained the choice of title for the album, in an interview with IndieLondon, [...] "Well, one of the tracks on the album is called Beautiful Heartache ... everybody has a heartbreak {{at some point in their}} lives. It’s how you deal with it that’s important. So, I guess <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> that notion for the album title." ...|$|E

Upon Horne's death, she stated [...] " [...] brought much joy into everyone's lives—even the younger generations, younger than myself. She {{was such a great}} talent. She opened up such doors for artists like myself." [...] Similarly, she considers Dorothy Dandridge to be one of her idols. Jackson has declared herself [...] "a very big Joni Mitchell fan", explaining [...] "As a kid <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> Joni Mitchell records [...] Joni's songs spoke to me in an intimate, personal way." [...] She holds reverence for Tina Turner, stating [...] "Tina has become a heroic figure for many people, especially women, because of her tremendous strength. Personally, Tina doesn't seem to have a beginning or an end in my life. I felt her music was always there, and I feel like it always will be." [...] She has also named other socially conscious acts, such as Tracy Chapman, Sly and the Family Stone, U2, and Bob Dylan as sources of inspiration. In her early career, Jackson credited her brothers Michael and Jermaine as musical influences. According to Rolling Stone and MTV, other artists attributed as influences are The Ronettes, Dionne Warwick, Tammi Terrell, Diana Ross, Chaka Khan, Stevie Wonder, Teena Marie, Michael Jackson, Prince, and Tina Turner ...|$|E

60|$|I became {{anxious to}} know this stranger. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> him by that Romantic sympathy that {{sometimes}} draws young men towards each other. His melancholy threw a charm about him in my eyes, which was no doubt heightened by the touching expression of his countenance, and the manly graces of his person; for manly beauty has its effect even upon man. I had an Englishman's habitual diffidence and awkwardness of address to contend with; but I subdued it, and from frequently meeting him in the Cassino, gradually edged myself into his acquaintance. I had no reserve on his part to contend with. He seemed on the contrary to court society; and in fact to seek anything rather than be alone.|$|E

I and my sister worked at tambour work. Our father and our brother had a builder's business. We all lived together. Ve-ry respectably, my dear! First, our father was drawn--slowly. Home was drawn with him. In a few years he was a fierce, sour, angry {{bankrupt}} without a kind word or a kind look for any one. He had been so different, Fitz Jarndyce. He was drawn to a debtors' prison. There he died. Then our brother was drawn--swiftly--to drunkenness. And rags. And death. Then my sister was drawn. Hush! Never ask to what! Then I was ill and in misery, and heard, as I had often heard before, that this was all the work of Chancery. When I got better, I went {{to look at the}} monster. And then I found out how it was, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> stay there." ...|$|E

40|$|Fences, {{doors and}} windows {{indicate}} a point of intersection between inside and outside, public and private. These porous boundaries provide enclosure while also allowing access to an outside world. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> these divisions in space both as aesthetic and metaphorical objects. They are the {{point of departure for}} an exploration of the intersection between real and imagined worlds. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fascinated by the ways that my brain filters and interprets the outside world, which then takes root in dreams and the imagination. Certain structures and landscapes hold a specific symbolic power; while completely inanimate, they seem to mirror a part of my inner self. The two dimensional imagery in this exhibition is inspired by objects which spark this resonance. By combining this imagery with tangible, three dimensional objects, I intend to juxtapose imagined and actual space. While many of the pieces in this exhibition have a functional nature, utility is not my primary concern. Rather, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the formal and symbolic qualities of these objects. The forms are derived from shapes in architecture and furniture, and altered to imply movement and instability. It is my intention to communicate an impression of both containment and spaciousness...|$|R

The truth is, I am not sure that there was any merit with me in the part I took in your difficulty; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> it by a fate. If I would I could not have done less than I did. I always was superstitious; I believe God made me one of the instruments of bringing your Fanny and you together, which union I have no doubt He had fore-ordained. Whatever He designs He will do for me yet. [...] "Stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord" [...] is my text just now. If, as you say, you have told Fanny all, I should have no objection to her seeing this letter, but for its reference to our friend here: let her seeing it depend upon whether she has ever known anything of my affairs; and if she has not, do not let her.|$|E
6000|$|Let me {{acknowledge}} with boundless pleasure the singularly {{generous and}} beautiful letter, signed by your great and dazzling array and reinforced by a correspondingly bright material gage, which reached {{me on my}} recent birthday, April 15th. It has moved me as brave gifts and benedictions can only do when they come as signal surprises. I seem {{to wake up to}} an air of breathing good will the full sweetness of which I had never yet tasted; though I ask myself now, as a second thought, how the large kindness and hospitality in which I have so long and so consciously lived among you could fail to act itself out according to its genial nature and by some inspired application. The perfect grace with which it has embraced the just-past occasion for its happy thought affects me, I ask you to believe, with an emotion too deep for stammering words. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> London long years ago as by the sense, felt from still earlier, of all the interest and association I should find here, and I now see how my faith was to sink deeper foundations than I could presume ever to measure--how my justification was both stoutly to grow and wisely to wait. It is so wonderful indeed to me as I count up your numerous and various, your dear and distinguished friendly names, taking in all they recall and represent, that I permit myself to feel at once highly successful and extremely proud. I had never in the least understood that I was the one or signified that I was the other, but you have made a great difference. You tell me together, making one rich tone of your many voices, almost the whole story of my social experience, which I have reached the right point for living over again, with all manner of old times and places renewed, old wonderments and pleasures reappeased and recaptured--so that there is scarce one of your ranged company but makes good the particular connection, quickens the excellent relation, lights some happy train and flushes with some individual colour. I pay you my very best respects while I receive from your two hundred and fifty pair of hands, and more, the admirable, the inestimable bowl, and while I engage to sit, with every accommodation to the so markedly indicated [...] "one of you," [...] my illustrious friend Sargent. With every accommodation, I say, but with this one condition that you yourselves, in your strength and goodness, remain guardians of the result of his labour--even as I remain all faithfully and gratefully yours, ...|$|E
60|$|This is the short, plain, and intelligible {{truth as}} to what now happened. There can be no reason to-day for not stating what {{was for a long}} time matter of common surmise, if not of common knowledge, that Mr. Gladstone did not regard the naval estimates, opened but not settled in December 1893, as {{justified}} by the circumstances of the time. He made a speech that month in parliament in reply to a motion from the front bench opposite, and there he took a position undoubtedly antagonistic to the new scheme that found favour with his cabinet, though not with all its members. The present writer is of course not free to go into details, beyond those that anybody else {{not a member of the}} cabinet would discover from Mr. Gladstone’s papers. Nor does the public lose anything of real interest by this necessary reserve. Mr. Gladstone said he wished to make me “his depositary” as things gradually moved on, and he wrote me a series of short letters from day to day. If they could be read aloud in Westminster Hall, no harm would be done either to surviving colleagues or to others; they would furnish no new reason for thinking either better or worse of anybody; and no one with a decent sense of the value of time would concern himself in all the minor detail of an ineffectual controversy. The central facts were simple. Two things weighed with him, first his infirmities, and second his disapproval of the policy. How, he asked himself, could he turn his back on his former self by becoming a party to swollen expenditure? True he had changed from conservative to liberal in general politics, but when he was conservative, that party was the economic party, “Peel its leader being a Cobdenite.” To assent to this new outlay in time of peace was to revolutionise policy. Then he would go on—“Owing to the part which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> take, first in Italy, then as to Greece, then on the eastern question, I have come to be considered not only an English but a European statesman. My name stands in Europe as a symbol of the policy of peace, moderation, and non-aggression. What would be said of my active participation in a policy that will be taken as plunging England into the whirlpool of militarism? Third, I have been in active public life for a period nearly as long as the time between the beginning of Mr. Pitt’s first ministry and the close of Sir Robert Peel’s; between 1783 and 1846—sixty-two years and a half. During that time I have uniformly opposed militarism.” Thus he would put his case.|$|E
