5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Leon's superior officer, Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons, had been bribed by Umbrella to hide {{evidence of the}} company's experiments in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department.</b> Thereupon, Claire and Sherry escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon Sherry and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing Sherry. Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later– taken over by her emotions– returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in the 1870s, {{politics}} and corruption of Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish immigrants infiltrated the NYPD, {{which was used}} as political tool, with positions awarded by politicians to loyalists.

Police also served political purposes such as manning polling places, where they would {{turn a blind eye}} to ballot box stuffing and other acts of fraud.|$|E

25|$|Although Baltimore {{had a large}} free black {{population}} established before the American Civil War, it was a southern city that maintained de facto racial segregation. The police department was dominated by ethnic whites, {{many of whom were}} descendants of 19th and 20th century immigrants, well into the mid-20th century. During the Civil Rights era of the late 1950s and 1960s, blacks argued to gain more positions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> {{in order to have a}} force that better reflected the demographics of the city, where they were a large minority.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{reported}} homicides in Camden {{dropped to}} 34, 15 fewer murders than in 2004. Though Camden's murder rate was still {{much higher than}} the national average, the reduction in 2005 was a drop of over 30%. In 2006, the number of murders climbed to 40. While murders fell by 10% across New Jersey in 2009, Camden's murder rate declined from 55 in 2008 down to 33, a drop of 40% that was credited to anti-gang efforts and more firearms seizures. Despite significant cuts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> due to the city's fiscal difficulties, murders in 2009 and 2010 were both under 40, staying below the peak that had occurred in 2008, and continued to decline into early 2011. However, in 2012, the city's murder rate spiked and reached 62.|$|E
25|$|Max Tackett {{was born}} August 13, 1912 in Glenwood, Arkansas. Max started living in Texarkana in 1941.

Tackett was the Texarkana Arkansas Police Chief from 1948 until his retirement in 1968. In 1951 he became the president of the Arkansas Peace Officers Association. He was a World War II combat veteran who had served in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Germany. Max {{was a member of}} the Beech Street Baptist Church and a member of the Optimists Club. Max was said to be colorful, outspoken and even a controversial figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department.</b> Max became the arresting officer of the lead suspect, Youell Swinney, when he realized that on each night of the murders a car was stolen and then later abandoned.|$|E

500|$|Beckham's ardent {{support of}} {{prohibition}} likely cost him the election. His position {{put him at}} odds with Henry Watterson, editor of the powerful Louisville Courier-Journal. As governor Beckham had crossed the liquor interests and the political machinery in Louisville. When the Kentucky Court of Appeals invalidated the results of Louisville's municipal elections due to interference by the city's [...] "whiskey ring" [...] in May 1907, Beckham appointed Robert Worth Bingham, a young lawyer and fellow prohibitionist, as interim mayor until elections could be held in November. Bingham eliminated grafting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department,</b> closed gambling houses and enforced blue laws closing saloons on Sunday. Following this, the whiskey ring announced Beckham had forfeited the support of Louisville's legislators. In the senatorial election in 1908, {{three of the four}} Democrats who voted against Beckham were from Louisville. Following his defeat, Beckham returned to his law practice.|$|E

Colvin commanded the Western district where the Barksdale organization operated, and nearing retirement, {{he came up}} with a radical new method of dealing with the drug problem. Proposition Joe, the East Side's cautious drug kingpin, became more cooperative with the Barksdale Organization. Sydnor, a rising young star <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Police</b> <b>Department</b> in season 1, returned to the cast as part of the major crimes unit. Bodie had been seen gradually rising in the Barksdale organization since the first episode; he was born to their trade and showed a fierce aptitude for it.

2500|$|In November 1973, {{the city}} elected Coleman Young {{as its first}} black mayor. After taking office, Young {{emphasized}} increasing racial diversity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department.</b> Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term. In 1976, the federal government offered $600 million for building a regional rapid transit system, under a single regional authority. [...] But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit.

2500|$|However, {{unemployment}} rose dramatically during Barry's first administration, as did crime rates, in {{part because}} many of his layoffs were centered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>police</b> <b>department</b> (1,500 terminations by 1981). His campaign promise to [...] "take the boards off" [...] public housing– i.e., to rehabilitate dilapidated and condemned public housing units– was slow in fulfillment. The city's debt was a constant problem as well: Barry had recalculated the Washington Administration's claim of a $41 million surplus {{and found that the}} city was $285 million in debt, a long-term accrual that his annual surpluses were unable to surmount {{by the end of his}} term. Graft and embezzlement among Barry appointees, such as Employment Services director Ivanhoe Donaldson, began late in Barry's first term, although it would not be discovered for several years.
