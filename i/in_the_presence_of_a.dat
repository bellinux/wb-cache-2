40|$|The {{accumulation}} {{and reduction}} <b>of</b> nitrate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nitrogen metabolites asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln) and the carbon metabolite sucrose (Suc) {{were examined in}} maize (Zea mays L.) seedlings {{in an attempt to}} separate their effects on the nitrate uptake system and the nitrate reduction system. After 8 h of exposure to nitrate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 1 mM Asn, tissue nitrate accumulation was reduced at 250 [mu]M external nitrate, but not at 5 mM Asn. The induction of nitrate reductase (NR) activity was reduced at both external nitrate concentrations. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> 1 mM Gln or 1 % Suc, tissue nitrate concentration was not significantly altered, but the induction of root NR activity was reduced or enhanced, respectively. The induction of root nitrite reductase (NiR) activity was also reduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Asn or Gln and enhanced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Suc. Transcript levels of NR and NiR in roots were reduced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> amides and enhanced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Suc. When Suc was present in combination with either amide, there was complete relief from the inhibition of NiR transcription observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> amide alone. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of NR, however, this relief from inhibition was negligible. The inhibition of the induction of NR and NiR activities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Gln and Asn is a direct effect and is not the result of altered nitrate uptake <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> these metabolites...|$|R

5|$|Heavy atom methods (multiple {{isomorphous}} replacement)– If electron-dense metal atoms can {{be introduced}} into the crystal, direct methods or Patterson-space methods {{can be used to}} determine their location and to obtain initial phases. Such heavy atoms can be introduced either by soaking the crystal in a heavy atom-containing solution, or by co-crystallization (growing the crystals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> heavy atom). As in MAD phasing, the changes in the scattering amplitudes can be interpreted to yield the phases. Although this is the original method by which protein crystal structures were solved, it has largely been superseded by MAD phasing with selenomethionine.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{adenosine}} and inosine on Rana ridibundaerythrocyte metabolism were studied. Adenosine can be metabolized by Rana ridibundaerythrocytes as a carbon source for glycolysis to maintain ATP levels, whereas neither inosine nor glucose could maintain ATP levels. The rate of lactate production was maximal (2. 89 mmolml 21 redcellh 21) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> adenosine together with glucose {{compared with that}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> glucose or adenosine alone.

5|$|Squall lines, or solid {{bands of}} strong thunderstorms, can form ahead of cold fronts and lee troughs {{due to the}} {{presence}} of significant atmospheric moisture and strong upper level divergence, leading to hail and high winds.

5|$|The gate {{formed by}} the α {{subunits}} prevents peptides longer than about four residues from entering {{the interior of the}} 20S particle.
