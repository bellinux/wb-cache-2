40|$|Rapid sand filters, {{pressure}} filters, {{and even}} membrane filters must be backwashed regularly—a process that uses potable water. During times of shortage, system operators worry that backwashing filters takes too much {{clean water and}} {{may be tempted to}} cut back. Limiting the filter wash rate or duration is usually not a good idea, because it can compromise water quality and shorten filter media life. To overcome any anxiety about backwashing, systems can find ways to make filter backwashing as efficient as possible.

50|$|The sweeper is a low-to-the-ground {{machine that}} makes two passes in each tree row. It has a 2 m belt {{attached}} to the front that rotates to sweep leaves, nuts, and small twigs from left to right, depositing the material {{in the center of}} the row as it drives forward. On the rear of the sweeper is a powerful blower to blow material left into the adjacent row with air speeds up to 90 m/s. Careful grooming during the year and patient blowing at harvest may eliminate the need for <b>hand</b> <b>raking</b> around the trunk of the tree, where nuts may accumulate. The sweeper prepares a single center row of nuts narrow enough for the harvesting tractor to drive over without driving on the center row. It is best to sweep only a few rows ahead of the harvesters at any given time, to prevent the tractor that drives the harvester from crushing the nuts that may still be falling from the trees. Hazelnut orchards may be harvested up to three times during the harvest season, depending on the quantity of nuts in the trees and the rate of nut drop as a result of weather.|$|R
40|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the {{perception}} of one's own hand size is distorted in proprioceptive localization tasks. It has been suggested that those distortions mirror somatosensory anisotropies. Recent research suggests that non-corporeal items also show some spatial distortions. In order to investigate the psychological processes underlying the localization task, we investigated the influences of visual similarity and memory on distortions observed on corporeal and non-corporeal items. In experiment 1, participants indicated the location of landmarks on: their own hand, a rubber hand (rated as most similar to the real <b>hand),</b> and a <b>rake</b> (rated as least similar to the real hand). Results show no significant differences between <b>rake</b> and rubber <b>hand</b> distortions but both items were significantly less distorted than the hand. Experiment 2 and 3 explored the role of memory in spatial distance judgments of the <b>hand,</b> the <b>rake</b> and the rubber hand. Spatial representations of items measured in experiment 2 and 3 were also distorted but showed the tendency to be smaller than in localization tasks. While memory and visual similarity seem to contribute to explain qualitative similarities in distortions between the hand and non-corporeal items, those factors cannot explain the larger magnitude observed in hand distortions...|$|R

The powerful fighting organization known as the Pacific Slope Seaman's Union refused to work vessels the cargoes of which were to be handled by scab longshoremen and freight-handlers. The union presented its ultimatum, and then called a strike. This had been Daylight's objective all the time. Every incoming coastwise vessel was boarded by the union officials and its crew sent ashore. And with the Seamen went the firemen, the engineers, and the sea cooks and waiters.

The days and weeks dragged out, and the strike held. The Coastwise Steam Navigation Company, and the Hawaiian, Nicaraguan, and Pacific-Mexican Steamship Company were tied up completely.

50|$|Integrative {{management}} strategies that combine herbicide with landscape cloth, bark mulch, and hand weeding to control goutweed {{in a garden}} are largely unsuccessful because sprouting occurs from either rhizomes or root fragments left in the soil. <b>Hand</b> pulling, <b>raking,</b> and digging followed by monitoring to control goutweed may be effective; however, caution {{must be taken to}} remove the entire rhizome and root system. Removing flowers before seed set may help control the spread of goutweed.

5000|$|North Gower {{is famous}} for cockles. Families from the villages of Crofty and Penclawdd have been working the cockle beds of the Burry Inlet for generations. The cooked cockles are then sold in Swansea and {{are one of the}} specialities of Swansea Market Cockles are removed from the sand when the beds are exposed at low tide. The cockle gatherers follow the {{receding}} tide and, while the mud is covered by a very shallow layer of water, they gather the cockles by <b>hand,</b> <b>raking</b> them out of the sand assisted by a [...] "scrape". This is a curved metal blade with a handle. This is used for breaking the surface of the sand. The work is done in all weathers, with starts as early as 3am in the summer. Originally, the cockles were collected by a donkey pulling a flat cart, this was replaced by pony and flat cart, and nowadays a Land Rover is used. Gathering cockles is regulated by [...] "The Burry Inlet Cockle Fishery Order, 1965". Two grades of cockles are gathered: [...] "boiling" [...] cockles are smaller and cooked locally before being taken to market; [...] "shell" [...] cockles are larger and obtained by more intensive sieving, using larger-meshed sieves on the cockle beds. Cockles need to be thoroughly washed clean, and cooked, so it is best to buy them from a cockle producer. Fresh cockles should be soaked in a bowl of lightly salted water for 24 hours so that they clean themselves naturally. A spoonful of wholemeal flour or oatmeal in the water assists the purging process. Traditionally, cockles formed part of a breakfast with Welsh bacon and eggs. However, as the cockle is a small clam, it can be adapted {{to a wide range of}} cooking styles from Mediterranean to American, and they make a particularly good chowder. Every year Swansea holds a Cockle Festival at the end of September, and local chefs demonstrate a wide range of dishes, using fresh Penclawdd cockles.|$|R

This is the fertilized eggs or roe (qaarsat, meluk, imlauk) of the Pacific herring {{attached}} to eelgrass, seaweed or other submerged vegetation. Herring spawn-on-kelp is a favored food among {{the majority of}} households in Togiak, Manokotak, and Aleknagik. Additional households in Twin Hills, Dillingham, and other communities in Bristol Bay and elsewhere also eat spawn-on-kelp. Harvests of spawn-on-kelp took place between late April and early June. Spawn-on-kelp for subsistence use is generally picked by <b>hand,</b> though <b>rakes</b> are occasionally used. Today, freezing and salting {{are the most common}} methods of preservation. In the past, spawn-on-kelp was preserved by drying and storage in open-weave grass baskets (kuusqun, kuusqulluk). As in the past, people today prefer to eat spawn-on-kelp dipped in seal oil. The product of the harvest is commonly shared with relatives and friends in the harvesters' home community during feats celebrating birthdays or holidays. In all four Nelson Island communities (Tununak, Newtok, Toksook Bay, and Nightmute), much of the roe-on-kelp is consumed soon after it is harvested, but a portion of the harvest is preserved in seal-skin pokes filled with seal oil.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY An {{increase}} in the commercial and recreational harvest of clams in Tillamook Bay, Oregon, coupled with {{a general lack of}} knowledge about the bay's ecology, served as the impetus for a shellfish survey undertaken in the summer of 1995. Commercial clam harvest has increased twelve fold since 1978 (Carter et al 1994). Recreational harvest has nearly tripled since 1993, although it is still far below the recreational harvest from the early 1970 s (Johnson pers corn 1995). The 1995 survey served as a precursor to a more extensive survey to be completed in 1996, and was designed to provide a qualitative assessment of clam distribution in the bay. By identifying those areas of the bay that support relatively dense populations of commercially and recreationally important species of clams, this report will assist {{in the design of the}} 1996 survey. It encompassed the northern half of the bay, and provided additional information about substrate type, flora, and fauna in the surveyed areas. Methods were modeled after Hancock et al (1979) and consisted of identifying 92 sampling stations throughout the northern half of the bay. The 92 stations were selected to provide a variety of substrate type and depth. Two SCUBA divers used a two square foot sampling ring placed randomly at each station to identify an area that was then excavated to a depth of two feet using <b>hand</b> <b>rakes.</b> Clams found within the sampling volume were identified, measured, and in some cases, sent to Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) for size measurement and age class analysis. Data collected from this study and from previous studies suggests that the overall abundance of clams in Tillamook Bay has remained relatively stable or increased over the past 20 years. The exception to this observation is with the population and biomass of gaper clams (Tresus capax), which has declined substantially since the late 1970 s. Densities of the other three commercially and recreationally important clam species appear to have generally increased, and it is appears that biomass has increased nominally. The average size of individual clams has decreased. The density of clams appears to be linked to the type of substrate, and substrate preference differs between species of clams. A wide variety of flora and fauna, and a prevalence of juvenile finfish and shellfish appear to indicate an ecologically productive estuary. However, natural and human-caused impacts such as sedimentation and agricultural runoff pose a threat to the bay's ability to continue providing food, recreation, and economic benefit to the communities dependent upon the bay. The paper concludes by briefly discussing the current and the future management of the clam resource in Tillamook Bay...|$|R

40|$|We use a {{triangular}} {{representation of the}} plunges of P, B, and Taxes to compare the different ways tectonic regime is inferred from earthquake focal mechanisms in recent works. We argue that P, B, and Taxes provide a reasonable estimate of principal stress directions when faulting is close to Andersonian conditions, and {{that this can be}} estimated from the location on {{a triangular}} diagram. We analyze the geometrical relationship between the plunges of P, B, and Taxes on one <b>hand,</b> and the <b>rake</b> of slip and dip of nodal planes on the other hand. We show that the rake and dip level curves correspond to trajectories of the vertical direction along great and small circles with respect to the frame of the P, B. and Taxes. This shows that dip-slip faulting is compatible with vertical P or Taxes, but does not require it, and instead requires horizontal B axes. It also shows that strike-slip faulting does not require vertical B axes, but P and Taxes with equal plunges. This also reveals that focal mechanisms where P, B, and Taxes all have moderate plunge correspond to two very different types of nodal planes: a steeply dipping one with oblique slip and a moderately dipping one with strike-slip. Seismically active and moderately dipping strike-slip faults are to be found among these events...|$|R

The present study reports {{the distribution of}} SDBs in a 14 -year-old male chimpanzee in relation to performance on a matching-to-sample task of varying difficulty. The rate of rubbing behaviors (self-touching with the <b>hand</b> without any <b>raking</b> motion of the fingernails) {{was positively correlated with}} performance, whereas scratching rates were negatively correlated with performance. SDBs were displayed predominantly with the left hand during sessions of high performance (low task difficulty), with a shift toward the right hand during sessions of low performance (high task difficulty). SDBs were exhibited relatively more with the right hand after incorrect responses (and secondary negative reinforcer) than after correct responses (and secondary positive reinforcer). Rubs directed to the face were displayed relatively more often to the right side after incorrect responses, compared to rubs displayed after correct responses, whereas scratching was directed relatively more often to {{the left side of the}} body after incorrect responses, compared to scratching displayed after correct responses. Rough scratching was displayed more quickly after auditory feedback on performance than were rubs or gentle scratches. Rubs were directed more to the face (trigeminal) and scratches more to the body (spinothalamic). Taken together, these results suggest that there may be asymmetrical central nervous system processing of negative emotion by chimpanzees during cognitive tasks...|$|R
