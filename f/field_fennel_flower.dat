40|$|The {{essential}} oil of plants {{is used as}} an alternative to pesticides for the control of aphids. We study the effect of the {{essential oil}}s of citronella and alfazema on aphid populations in the laboratory and in the field. We also investigate the effect of these oils on the behavior of the aphids principal predator the ladybug. The results show that alfazema is highly effective, more so than citronella. A 1 % concentration of alfazema oil is more effective in killing aphids than the same concentration of citronella. Alfazema oil has the further advantage that it is attractive to ladybugs and is less lethal to <b>fennel</b> <b>flowers...</b>|$|R
50|$|A variant in {{some parts}} of Marche is called ciauscolo di fegato, mazzafegato or fegatino, in which pork liver is {{substituted}} for a certain portion of the fat. This naturally causes the color of the sausage to become darker, and contributes an intense flavor. In this case, orange zest and <b>fennel</b> fronds or <b>flowers</b> are included in the spices.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{concentrations}} of essential elements (Mg, Ca, Na, K, Fe, Zn, Se, Al, Ni, and Cu) and toxic heavy metals (Pb, As, Cr, Cd, and Cr) from Saudi Arabian {{fruits and vegetables}} were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP/OES). Two types of butters, Caralluma munbayana and Caralluma hesperidum, Vigna (Vigna unguiculata), common fig (Ficus carica), Annona seeds (Annonaceae seeds), Annona fruits (Annonaceae fruits), Fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and <b>Fennel</b> <b>flowers</b> (Nigella sativa) were investigated, because they are used by indigenous groups as traditional medicines with Soxhlet-extraction and dry-ashing protocol. The estimated daily dietary element intake in food samples was further calculated in order to evaluate the element dietary intake and fruit and vegetable consumption pattern of the indigenes of Saudi Arabia. The crude oil and ash compositions varied widely, but suggested {{that most of the}} foods were good sources of oils and minerals. The figures-of-merit of the ICP-OES calibration curves were excellent with good linearity (R 2 > 0. 9921). The use of ICP-OES in this study allowed the accurate analysis and the detection of the elements at low levels. Essential elements (K, Ca, Na, and Mg) had the highest concentrations while toxic heavy metals (As, Pb, and Cd) had the lowest in the foods. Essential element pairs (Mg-Na, Mg-Ca, Fe-Al) were highly correlated, suggesting that these foods are sources of multiple nutrients. Toxic element pairs (Pb-Cd, Pb-As, and Cd-As), however, were poorly correlated in the foods, suggesting that these elements do not have a common source in these foods. Average consumption of these foods should provide the recommended daily allowances of essential elements, but will not expose consumers to toxic heavy metals. The ICP-OES method was validated by determining method detection limits and percent recoveries of laboratory-fortified blanks, which were generally 90 – 100 %...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the sensory assessments of identical cosmetic formulations with and without fragrance to investigate not only the acceptance but also how different fragrances affected their attributes, such as skin feel, tackiness and spreadability. Three gel and three cream formulations with and without two types of fragrance, <b>fennel</b> and sweet <b>flowers,</b> were assessed for various attributes. The presence and type of fragrance used affected the testers' perception of some attributes, showing that the influence of this component should not be disregarded. Apparently, a consumer's reaction to a cosmetic product is not only based on its efficacy but also on how its attributes are perceived, such as appearance, skin feel and smell...|$|R
40|$|In organic plant {{production}} {{it is necessary}} to establish isolation buffer between organic and conventional production areas. Organic demo-field was established towards the end of 2008 in a part of Institute 'Tamiš' Pančevo experimental <b>field.</b> The perennial <b>fennel</b> (Foeniculum vulgare P. Mill.) was planted as isolation buffer. Phenological observations were performed and variable costs monitored in the foundation year of 2009 and in the following 2010. The production costs, otherwise high in organic production, were not increased. The fennel production achieved visibly better financial results as compared to sunflower and maize production, which are the plant species most often used as isolation buffers. The product can be processed to manufacture bio-preparation that can also be used in organic production. Also, fennel is an entomophilic plant species, has a long blooming phase, attracts useful insects, pollinators and predators, aiding biodiversity and bio-control maintenance and improvement in agroecosystems...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the rose}} {{had a long}} {{tradition}} in funerary art, the earliest record of a Roman rose festival named as such dates to the reign of Domitian (81-96 AD), and places the observance on June 20. The inscription was made by a priestly association (collegium) in Lucania devoted to the woodland god Silvanus. It records vows for the wellbeing of the emperor and prescribes a sacrifice to Silvanus on five occasions in the year, among them the Rosalia. Although Silvanus is typically regarded as a deity {{of the woods and}} the wild, Vergil describes him as bearing <b>flowering</b> <b>fennel</b> and lilies. In other inscriptions, three donors to Silvanus had adopted the cultic name Anthus (Greek anthos, [...] "flower") and a fourth, of less certain reading, may have the Latin name Florus, the masculine form of Flora. Since trees are the form of plant life most often emblematic of Silvanus, his connection with flowers is obscure. His female counterparts the Silvanae, primarily found in the Danubian provinces, are sometimes depicted carrying flower pots or wreaths. Through his epithet Dendrophorus, [...] "Tree-bearer," [...] he was linked to the Romanized cult of Attis and Cybele in which celebrants called dendrophori participated.|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{competition between}} lambsquarters (Chenopodium album) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) on some traits effective on growth and yield a factorial experiment was conducted during 2010 - 2011 in Agricultural Research Station of Islamic Azad University, Tabriz Branch, Iran, based on randomized complete blocks design with 3 replications. Treatments were weed density (0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 plants per meter row) and its relative emergence times (simultaneously, 10, 20 and 30 days after crop emergence). Dormancy in lambsquarters seeds was broken using gibberlic acid. Essential oil of seeds was extracted by celevenger type apparatus. Results indicated that emergence of 4 weed plants per meter row had no {{significant effect on}} fennel growth period. When weed density increased more than 4 plants per meter row, leaf chlorophyle content index increased 26 %. Effect of higher weed densities {{on the time of}} leaf senescence appearance and plant height was more than lower weed densities. Reduction of weed density and delaying its time of relative emergence decreased weed biomass. While, seed and essence yield increased, significantly. In those weed densities higher than 4 plants per meter row essence yield reduced 25 mL ha- 1 per weed. It seems that the weed control in <b>fennel</b> <b>field</b> is necessary...|$|R
40|$|In the {{properties}} where fennel is grown, {{in the states}} of Bahia, Sergipe, Pernambuco and Paraiba, at the Northeast of Brazil, {{a high rate of}} usage of pesticides in the crop, aiming to control the aphid Hyadaphis foeniculi. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of orange oil Prev-Am (sodium tetraborohydrate decahydrate), in the control of H. foeniculi aphid of the fennel crop. The trial was conducted in a <b>fennel</b> <b>field</b> located in Lagoa Seca Experimental Station, belonging to the EMEPA-PB. Forty-eight hours after the product has been sprayed, one flower of the umbel was collected and removed her aphids, which were placed in a "petri" plate from 9 cm in diameter. As a following step, the insects were counted as part of two groups, considering the number of insects dead and alive, being tabulated for later analysis. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, using the experimental design of randomized blocks composed of six treatments (doses of 0. 3, 0. 4, 0. 5, 0. 6, 0. 7 % of orange oil (Prev-am) and pure water as check, with five repetitions. The data were submitted to the regression analysis. The orange oil (Prev-am) controls effectively H. foeniculi at the concentration of 0. 3 %, increasing the control up to concentrations of 0. 6 and 0. 7 %. The product does not kill ladybugs (Cycloneda sanguinea) and can be used in programs for integrated pest management. Keywords: Foeniculum vulgare, aphid, vegetable oil, ladybug, umbel...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluation}} of seed production index in lambsquarters (Chenopodium album), leaf appearance and yield of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) under inter-specific competition a factorial experiment {{was conducted in}} Islamic Azad University, Tabriz Branch, Iran, during 2011 - 2012. Treatments were weed densities of 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 plants per meter row and its relative emergence times of simultaneously, 10, 20 and 30 days after crop based on randomized complete blocks design in 3 replications. Dormancy in lambsquarters seeds was broken using gibberlic acid. Results indicated that 8 th leaf in fennel appeared after 35. 4 days. Time to appearance of 12 th leaf in 0 - 4 weed plants per meter row was 50 days, while, in higher weed densities delayed averaged 11. 5 days. With decreasing weed density and delaying it,s emergence time fennel seed yield increased. Essential oil yield of fennel reduced 25 mL ha- 2, per weed plant. When lambsquarters density decreased and emerged after fennel, it,s seed production index reduced under competition with fennel. In those treatments which lambsquarters plants emerged along with the crop, seeds production weight was 9. 8 % of total plant weight, while, in other levels of lambsquarters emergence time were 5. 8 %, 3. 6 % and 3. 8 %, respectively. In this study, treatments with higher biomass production in lambsquarters had greater weed seed production per square meter and lower seed yield in fennel, {{that it could be}} used for lambsquarters management in <b>fennel</b> <b>fields...</b>|$|R
