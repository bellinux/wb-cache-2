40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} further {{contribute}} to the existing body of literature on social practice theory, by discussing the designed divestment practices of charitable donation of clothing and <b>durable</b> <b>household</b> <b>goods</b> into charity bins. It also proposes a supplementary theoretical framework for social practice theory describing the characteristics of elements of practice as topography, intensity, trajectory and form. The role of design in underlying everyday practices is recognised, both {{at the level of}} evolved precedent, as well as potential deliberate intervention. This includes the material design of the bins as enclosed containers that conceal their contents, as well as their embeddedness into the local geography and adjacent institutions. Opportunities for intervention in donation practices are discussed, as a means to reduce the impact of waste items through the charity sector, which undermine their capability to redistribute usable goods to those in need...|$|E
40|$|Communities owning {{and living}} on ancestral land {{tend to have}} a strong sense of {{stewardship}} over the land and its resources, which may translate into an economic value to present generations of being able to pass on ancestral lands to future generations (i. e. bequest value). This study estimates bequest values to local users of a traditional fishing ground on the Coral Coast of Fiji, using a contingent valuation approach. Using monetary as well as time-based contributions, bequest values are estimated at between FJ 1. 25 – 1. 41 (US 0. 64 – 0. 73) per individual per week, or FJ 183. 90 (US 106. 91) per household per year. This represents a significant proportion of stated average household expenditure, comparable to spending on <b>durable</b> <b>household</b> <b>goods,</b> and clothes and footwear. These results suggest that low-income groups may have significant bequest values, which should be accounted for in developing-economy valuation studies...|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study is to examine the {{long-term}} changes in household production caused by technical and other changes in the United States. The household production model was employed to development of conceptual framework for viewing household decisions on inputs into household production and labor supply;In the empirical analyses, two methodologies were used. First, a VAR (vector autoregression) model was employed to examine the long-term relationships among six aggregate U. S. variables, 1900 - 1985 : the number of immigrants, price of <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods,</b> the unemployment rate, average household income, the number of domestic service workers, and the wage rate of domestic servants. The results revealed significant interactions and causal relations between variables in the specified VAR system;Second, a set of household input demand functions were fitted to the aggregate data for 1948 - 1985 using the almost-ideal-demand system (AIDS).

40|$|In Fiji, {{economic}} valuation has not {{yet been}} adopted as an aid to coastal resource management. Given increasing pressures on its coastal resources, particularly near urban centres, valuation of these resources may be crucial to assist decision-making at all levels. This paper presents estimates of the economic value of the main goods and services provided by the coastal ecosystems in a traditional Fijian fishing ground near the capital, Suva. Using catch surveys, a CV survey and secondary data sources, the value of fisheries, bequest value and coastal protection function provided by the coral reefs and mangroves within this area are estimated to provide net benefits of just over FJ$ 3 m (US$ 1, 795, 000) per year. The coastal protection provided by the coral reefs and mangroves makes up the largest component of the total economic value (55 %) followed by fisheries (44 %). Bequest values only make up 1 % of the TEV. However, if compared to household income, bequest values are significant, representing 6. 8 % of stated income. This is comparable to average expenditures on <b>durable</b> <b>household</b> <b>goods</b> and heating and lighting...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{model for}} duopoly {{competition}} in the <b>durable</b> <b>household</b> <b>goods</b> market is presented. The aim is to investigate the various scenarios and policies on a representative dynamic model. System dynamics is used as the methodology, since it is an adaptive tool that allows for feedback mechanisms. The proposed model consists of six modules: (1) diffusion module, (2) price module, (3) advertising module, (4) word of mouth (WOM) module, (5) cost module, and (6) delivery delay module. Diffusion module consists of innovative demand and imitative demand based on standard Bass model. Advertising effect constitutes the innovative demand whereas WOM constitutes the imitative demand. Price module consists of two sub modules. In the first one, the demand is treated {{as a function of}} price, and in the second one price setting process is modeled so a to allow for different pricing strategies. Diminishing returns and accumulated effects build up the advertising module. Conventional WOM effect is modeled in a separate module. The economies of scale and learning curve effects, which may lead to cost decreases during the time horizon, are included in the cost module. Finally, the negative effect of longer delivery times is modeled in the delivery delay module. These modules are replicated for the competitor since a duopoly market structure is investigated. The market consists of four segments and each segment has an associated product. If the product is not available in a segment, then the customers of that segment purchase the product from the first lower segment with product available. The customers of each segment have price levels for the products and a linear demand curve is used for the demand - price relationship. The model allows for different market entry times and new product launchings. The necessary module replications are also performed for the entry of the second products (for both of the firms). In the scenario analysis, various pricing strategies and different product launching times and new product launching decisions both in monopoly and duopoly are tested. The developed model produced valid and consistent results in all scenarios...|$|E

40|$|I use an {{electronic}} transfer mandate in the UK Child Benefit program, a transfer received by virtually all families with children, {{to estimate the}} effect of bank account ownership on the financial behavior of less educated families with children. With the mandate increasing account ownership {{by as much as}} 29 percent for less educated families with children, it provides an exogenous increase in account ownership to examine the causal effect of bank account ownership on access to credit, purchase of <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods,</b> vehicle ownership, vehicle purchase, and accumulation of financial assets. When a less educated family becomes an owner of a bank account, I find a 71 percentage point increase in the probability of owning a credit card, an increase of 1. 4 <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods,</b> and no change in vehicle ownership or purchase. Although I find that bank account ownership does not affect the mean level of financial assets, I do find evidence suggestive of an increase in {{the top half of the}} financial asset distribution which indicates that there may be heterogeneity in the savings response to owning a bank account. Overall, my findings suggest that the most important benefit of owning a bank account is access to credit and requiring lower income families to own a bank account will not reverse their low average savings levels in the short run...|$|R
40|$|The {{decline in}} {{industrial}} activity, which set in last summer, has slackened this year. Output of passenger automobiles and major <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> has increased moderately from the reduced rates of late 1953. Automobile markets {{have become more}} active in recent months and auto sales have been only moderately below last year's high rate. Consumer takings of <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> have approximated the large volume of a year ago. With production generally below final takings since last autumn, business inventories of consumer durable goods, except new cars, have been reduced. The further decline in over-all industrial activity this year has reflected mainly continued curtailment in ordnance output and declines in production of iron and steel and various semifabricated metal products. Nondurable goods production generally has held steady and output of building materials has been maintained as construction activity has continued at very high levels. In April industrial production was 123 per cent of the 1947 - 49 average, about 10 per cent below the mid- 1953 peak but somewhat above the level prevailing {{for two years before}} the upsurge that began in 1952. Personal income has declined 2 per cent since mid- 1953, reflecting mainly reductions in employment and hours of work in manufacturing, mining, and transportation.

This paper examines the contribution of this development to the macroeconomic stabilization that occurred shortly thereafter. The model combines collateral constraints on households with heterogeneity of thrift in a calibrated general equilibrium setup. We use this tool to characterize the business cycle implications of realistically lowering required down payments and rates of amortization for durable goods purchases. The model predicts that this relaxation of collateral constraints can explain a large fraction of the actual volatility decline in hours worked, output, household debt, and <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> purchases...|$|R

The results also indicate a strong case for imparting education and public awareness, especially, among the female cohort. We find the odds of having toilets in a household with an educated woman (18 years of schooling) is 3. 1 times more than a household with illiterate or preschool educated women. Among other factors households living in urban areas are 19 {{times more likely to have}} toilets in comparison with their rural counterparts...|$|R
40|$|The present System of National Accounts (SNA 93) treats durable {{consumption}} goods as consumption goods {{rather than}} investment although rentals for owner occupied households is imputed into GDP. We argue that households de facto treat {{the purchase of}} durable goods as investments and thus, the treatment of durables as capital assets conceptually does not differ from the present treatment of owner occupied dwellings. This is not captured by the economic analysis based on current statistical conventions. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to estimate the effect of durable goods and ICT on euro area economic growth and productivity change; when expenditure on consumer durables is recorded as capital investment. The capitalization of consumer durables impacts both the levels and growth rates of the capital stock, productivity and GDP. Our growth accounting computations demonstrated that the capital services of durables contributed one-tenth of economic growth and one-eight of labour productivity growth in 1995 - 2004. ICT's impacts were larger, i. e., one-fifth of GVA growth and one-sixth of labour productivity growth.

40|$|I {{propose a}} new {{valuation}} ratio: durables price over the rental cost of capital, {{which is a}} direct analogue of the price-dividend ratio. I show {{that it is a}} rational forecast of future discount rates and future growth rates of the rental cost. In order to impute the unobservable rental cost, I develop a dynamic rational expectations economy with Beckerian household production. Investors' preferences are defined over the nondurables and the services flow from the household capital, the stock of durables. I assume investors "produce" services flow in the household sector. I carefully model the sector's returns to scale and find decreasing returns to scale in the household capital, ceteris paribus. The result is crucial as specifications used in the previous literature lead to a misspecified rental cost of capital, and thus errors-in-variables problems in predictive regressions. In contrast to price-dividend ratio, I construct the durables price-rental cost valuation ratio as an affine function of a co-integrating residual. I evaluate its predictive power and discover that it strongly forecasts excess returns on 25 Fama-French portfolios, especially small and value stocks. In particular, I can predict small-minus-big portfolio (SMB) with R^ 2 around 30 % at 4 year horizonPredictability, <b>Durable</b> <b>Goods,</b> <b>Household</b> Production, Price Dividend Ratio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Work Attitudes and Spending surveys (WAS) are intended to give insight into household spending. In particular, they focus on whether the husband/head of household has complete control over household decisions, or whether the wife has significant control. They also attempt to explain the causes of women's control, or lack of it, including factors such as earnings, education, attitudes, religion, ethnic group and birthplace. For the third edition (April 2008), the existing study materials were replaced, and further data from India (gathered in 2007), Nigeria (2003 and 2005), Kenya (2004) and Egypt (2005 - 2006), and accompanying documentation, {{were added to the}} dataset. The data are available as combined files, which include data from all surveys, and also as raw data files for individual countries. See READ file for full details, and for a complete edition history. Main Topics : The following types of information are covered by each WAS survey: household composition (for example, number of adults); <b>household</b> spending; <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> ownership; employment and earnings; attitudes, mainly the measurement of 'feminist' or 'machismo' views; demographic information, such as age; household financial management (i. e. who organises money).

40|$|U. S. Macroeconomic Outlook The U. S. economy {{continues}} to grow at a steady, moderate pace. But, important changes underlie this growth. Federal discretionary spending is contracting while the private economy is growing and continuing its transformation and recovery. A transformation is occurring towards an economy with larger energy and technology sectors and growing manufacturing and agricultural exports. There is also a recovery in the housing sector. This recovery is driving growth in construction employment, <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods</b> sales, the home improvement market, the real estate sector and the financial services sector. Steady employment growth and recent improvements in hourly wages also are supporting modest expansion in overall consumer spending. Further, nascent recovery in the European economy will encourage renewed growth in business investment {{over the next few}} years. Yet, a variety of public policy issues are holding back even faster private sector growth. Bond purchases by the Federal Reserve Bank will be curtailed late this year as the federal government completes fiscal contraction via its Sequester budget cuts. Declining bond purchases will replace the current fiscal drag with a monetary drag on growth. Both efforts are required for long-term macroeconomic stability and investor confidence but will provide a modest drag on current growth.

40|$|Between {{the latter}} {{nineteenth century and}} the 1930 s there was a {{dramatic}} revolution in American families. Family size continued its long-term decline, the schooling of older children expanded dramatically {{and the proportion of}} married females' adulthood devoted to market-oriented activities increased. Over this same period there were significant reductions in mortality, especially among the young, and impressive reductions in morbidity. This paper considers all these trends jointly, modeling the changes in fertility, child schooling and lifetime married female labor supply as a consequence of exogenous changes in health. These interactions are then quantified using calibration techniques. The simulations suggest that reductions in child mortality alone cannot explain the transformation of the American family. Indeed, in our preferred calibration, reductions in child mortality lead to a modest decline in human capital and increase in fertility, with little effect on married female labor force involvement. In sharp contrast, reductions in morbidity are found to lower fertility and increase education. The time savings from lower fertility more than offset the increased time mothers invest in their childrens' quality, freeing some time for market work. However, lower fertility alone cannot account for the increase in market work of married women. In our framework, the majority of the increase is a consequence of a narrowing of the gender wage gap. More generally, viewing the implications of health improvements deepens our understanding of the American family transformation, complementing explanations based on skill biased technical change and improvements in <b>household</b> <b>durable</b> <b>goods.</b> Schooling, Fertility, Health, Human Capital Accumulation, Labor Supply. ...|$|R
