Three more second-tier clubs, Hapoel Haifa, Maccabi Herzliya and Hapoel Ashkelon, reached the final in 2004, 2005 and 2007 respectively, but none of these won the deciding match. Following Bnei Sakhnin's victory teams from Jerusalem and Tel Aviv reclaimed dominance—Maccabi Tel Aviv lifted the cup in 2005, Beitar Jerusalem won two titles <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>in</b> 2008 and 2009 and Hapoel Tel Aviv twice <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>row</b> <b>in</b> 2006 and 2007, and then three times consecutively from 2010 to 2012.

5|$|Cancellara's {{first victory}} of the 2009 season came in the prologue of the Tour of California.

Cancellara did not finish the sixth stage of the race; he left the event without winning a single stage. Poor performance marred the early portion of the season for Cancellara as he achieved no success in the early season classics; he did not finish the Tour of Flanders after suffering problem with his bike chain early in the race, on the Koppenberg, and he finished 49th overall in the Paris–Roubaix.|$|E
