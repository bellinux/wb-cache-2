5|$|Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species, {{among them}} cutthroat, bull, and rainbow trout, {{several species of}} salmon, sucker, minnow, sculpin, and lamprey, as well as sturgeon, stickleback, and others. Among the 29 {{non-native}} species <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basin,</b> there are brook, brown, and lake trout, largemouth and smallmouth bass, walleye, carp, bluegill, and others. In addition to fish, the basin supports 18 species of amphibians, such as the Pacific giant salamander. Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed, also frequented by 154 bird species, such as the American dipper, osprey, and harlequin duck.

40|$|Abstract – Largemouth bass, Micropterus salmoides, have {{inhabited}} Lake Biwa {{in central}} Japan {{for over three}} decades as top predators. Lake Biwa consists of two basins – a large, deep north basin and a small, shallow south <b>basin.</b> Since <b>the</b> mid 1990 s, vegetation and bluegill sunfish, Lepomis macrochirus, have thrived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lake – especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south <b>basin.</b> Because dense vegetation can mediate the predator-prey relation-ship between largemouth bass and bluegill, <b>the</b> largemouth bass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south <b>basin</b> {{are assumed to be}} under less favorable conditions than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north <b>basin.</b> <b>The</b> length-weight relationship of <b>the</b> largemouth bass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>basins</b> differed; <b>the</b> body weights of largemouth bass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north <b>basin</b> significantly exceeded those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south <b>basin.</b> Moreover, largemouth bass <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south <b>basin</b> appeared to have significantly larger gapes than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north <b>basin.</b> Such fish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> south <b>basin</b> were likely selected during and after the ontogenetic diet shift stage, probably because they are capable of handling bluegill more efficiently than those with normal-sized gapes...|$|R

40|$|The stratigraphic {{framework}} of the Lima and Yaquina forearc basins offshore Peru, determined from multichannel seismic (MCS) data, reveals significantly different Neogene histories <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two <b>basins.</b> Miocene deposition <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lima <b>Basin</b> was controlled mainly by variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relative subsidence rates. Depositional processes, particularly contour currents, {{may have had a}} major influence during <b>the</b> Pliocene-Pleistocene. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> Yaquina <b>Basin</b> shows no evi-dence of assumed contourites. Severe disruption of the reflectors indicates active tectonism throughout <b>the</b> Neogene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yaquina <b>Basin,</b> while reflectors representing late Miocene and younger strata <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lima <b>Basin</b> are largely unde-formed, which indicates relative quiescence. Most sequences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lima <b>Basin</b> demonstrate <b>the</b> presence of a hinge line that separates the relatively thin, wedge-shaped landward part from a much thicker, lens-shaped seaward part. Generally, this hinge appears to represent a pa-leoslope break. Such hinge lines are not evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yaquina <b>Basin.</b> Both basins exhibit migration of the depocenters of the various sequences through time. The movement is to the south and landward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lima <b>Basin,</b> while migration is northward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yaquina <b>Basin.</b> These migrations appear {{to be the result of}} variations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relative subsidence rates within <b>the</b> <b>basins.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Lima <b>Basin</b> these movements are closely related to structural features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> basement. <b>In</b> addition to a structural trend that is oriented parallel to the margin, we observed a secondary structural trend that is oriented east-west. Development of structural features along this trend led to the development of two distinct depo-centers <b>in</b> most of <b>the</b> stratigraphic sequences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lima <b>Basin...</b>|$|R
5|$|As of 2010, {{approximately}} 12.7million {{people lived}} in the Colorado River basin. Phoenix in Arizona and Las Vegas in Nevada are the largest metropolitan areas in the watershed.

5|$|Eight {{moderate}} tropical {{storms in}} total developed or existed {{within the bounds}} of the basin, slightly below the average of ten. Most systems during the season remained weak, with only three storms (Uriah, Emeraude, and Fantala) reaching at least tropical cyclone strength with winds of 120km/h (75mph), compared to the average of five. However, the season featured Cyclone Fantala, which became the strongest tropical cyclone on record <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basin</b> in terms of 10-minute sustained winds at 250km/h (155mph).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Ginger {{formed on}} September6 and lasted until October3, {{for a total}} of 27.25days.

In 2003, it was discovered that the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane lasted as a tropical cyclone longer than Ginger, although its duration as a tropical cyclone was not continuous. This made Ginger the second longest-lived of any Atlantic hurricane, but it remains the storm that lasted the most consecutive days as a tropical cyclone <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>basin.</b>|$|E
