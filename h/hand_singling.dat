40|$|Social {{networking}} sites (SNS) {{are only}} as good as the content their users share. Therefore, designers of SNS seek to improve the overall user experience by encouraging members to contribute more content. However, user motivations for contribution in SNS are not well understood. This is particularly true for newcomers, who may not recognize the value of contribution. Using server log data from approximately 140, 000 newcomers in Facebook, we predict long-term sharing based on the experiences the newcomers have in their first two weeks. We test four mechanisms: social learning, singling out, feedback, and distribution. In particular, we find support for social learning: newcomers who see their friends contributing go on to share more content themselves. For newcomers who are initially inclined to contribute, receiving feedback and having a wide audience are also predictors of increased sharing. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>singling</b> out appears to affect only those newcomers who are not initially inclined to share. The paper concludes with design implications for motivating newcomer sharing in online communities. Author Keywords Social network sites, SNS, online communities, motivatin...|$|E

40|$|Conjuncts {{of natural}} {{coordination}} are semantically related, {{in contrast to}} those of accidental coordination. It is generally assumed that no single con-junct may be moved and no element may be extracted from a single con-junct. Focusing on Chinese he/gen constructions, this paper first argues that not only post-verbal, but also preverbal he and gen in comitative construc-tions are coordinators, and thus form constructions of natural coordination, and then presents the following correlation: on the one <b>hand,</b> <b>single</b> con-juncts may move in natural coordination and elements may also be ex-tracted from single conjuncts of natural coordination; {{and on the other}} <b>hand,</b> <b>single</b> conjuncts may not move in accidental coordination, nor may ele-ments be extracted from single conjuncts of accidental coordination. This correlation reveals a relativized parallelism in coordinate constructions: syn-tactic operations applied to single conjuncts are possible only when the con-juncts of a coordinate complex are semantically related to each other. The paper then tries to account for this relativized parallelism from an economy perspective of language processing...|$|R

50|$|Instead of panniers, some riders {{prefer a}} bicycle trailer. Trailers {{are easy to}} use and allow touring with bikes on which it is {{impossible}} to attach racks. However, double wheeled trailers decrease maneuverability and are not particularly suited for touring in mountainous regions or on rugged terrain. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>single</b> wheel trailers are extremely maneuverable, with the trailer wheel tracking very closely with the rear wheel. These can easily be ridden on single track trails (about 40 cm width), over some very technical terrain.|$|R

40|$|A right-brain damaged {{patient with}} pure tactile {{extinction}} {{was asked to}} report series of single or double light, brief touches delivered to both hands, the thumb or the pinkie of a <b>single</b> <b>hand,</b> the sides of a single index. The stimulated hand was positioned palm up or palm down, in front of or behind the patient, in anatomic or crossed position. In double touch conditions, stimuli coded as left-sided were extinguished not only when delivered to both hands, but also when delivered on a <b>single</b> <b>hand</b> or a <b>single</b> finger. The findings suggest that tactile stimuli may be coded as left or right according to multiple body anchors that are dynamically scaled from the corporeal midline, to axes centered on a <b>single</b> <b>hand</b> or finger.

6000|$|And {{thus it is}} in the antitype: [...] "Unto thee shall all flesh come," [...] saith {{the prophet}} (Psa 65:2). And again, [...] "To him shall the {{gathering}} of the people be" [...] (Gen 49:10). But how? Why, by an instinct from heaven, the fruit of a divine election: [...] "All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; but no man can come to me [saith Christ] except the Father which hath sent me draw him" [...] (John 6:37,44). The beasts therefore which came into the ark, were neither chosen by men, neither came they in by any instinct of nature which was common to them all, but as being by a divine <b>hand</b> <b>singled</b> out and guided thither, so they entered in: the rest were left to the fury of the flood. Like to this also is the antitype, sinners come not to Jesus by any work or choice of flesh and blood, nor yet by any instinct of nature that is common to all the world; but they come, as being by a divine <b>hand</b> <b>singled</b> out from others; and as guided of the Father, so they come to Christ into the ark: The rest are left to the fury of the wrath of God, which, in the day of judgment, shall swallow them up for ever.|$|R

30|$|The {{proposed}} DPD mitigation scheme {{reduces the}} complexity (measured {{as the number}} of FLOPS) of multicarrier memory polynomial models by a factor of 10 while achieving nearly the same TD performance. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>single</b> carrier signal DPD achieves better TD performance than the proposed mitigation at an expense of 90 times more FLOPS. Extensive simulations showed that the use of the proposed mitigation techniques is favorable to the overall link performance. Moreover, for a specific TD, the use of these techniques allow to operate the HPA at lower OBO which improves the power efficiency.|$|R
