5|$|Damage to the {{oculomotor nerve}} (III) can cause double vision (diplopia) and {{inability}} {{to coordinate the}} movements of both eyes (strabismus), also eyelid <b>drooping</b> (ptosis) and pupil dilation (mydriasis). Lesions may also lead to inability to open the eye due to paralysis of the levator palpebrae muscle. Individuals suffering from a lesion to the oculomotor nerve may compensate by tilting their heads to alleviate symptoms due to paralysis {{of one or more}} of the eye muscles it controls.|$|E
30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{conventional}} linear <b>droop</b> control, {{different types of}} <b>droop</b> characteristic (including inversed <b>droop,</b> non-linear <b>droop,</b> and adaptive <b>droop)</b> have been investigated in order {{to cope with the}} trade-off and improve the system performance.|$|R
30|$|In [26], a {{nonlinear}} <b>droop</b> {{control is}} proposed {{in which the}} <b>droop</b> gain {{is a function of}} the output current of the DC/DC converter. The proposed non-linear <b>droop</b> method can increase <b>droop</b> resistance when load increases. Thus, it solves the trade-off in conventional <b>droop</b> methods, i.e., it achieves better load sharing at heavy load and tighter voltage regulation at light load. Reference [27] proposes three novel non-linear <b>droop</b> control algorithms: high <b>droop</b> gain methods (HDG), polynomial <b>droop</b> curve (PDG), polynomial <b>droop</b> curve with voltage compensation (PDCVC). Among all three proposed non-linear <b>droop</b> control methods, HDG offers the best voltage regulation but suffers poor power sharing at light load conditions whilst PDCVC provides the best performance at heavy load conditions. PDC method offers good load sharing and considerable voltage regulation under all loading conditions.|$|R
30|$|As {{the basic}} level, primary control {{integrates}} inner control loops aiming at voltage/current regulation with the preliminary power sharing (<b>droop</b> control). Conventional <b>droop</b> control has the poor voltage regulation at heavy load and poor power sharing performance at light load condition. To overcome this, different <b>droop</b> characteristics including adaptive, inversed, non-linear <b>droop,</b> dead-band <b>droop</b> are presented and elaborated.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} <b>drooping</b> foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a <b>drooping</b> branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the lip of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|The central figure's {{mouth is}} {{positioned}} directly on its neck, {{rather than on}} a distinct face. It bares its teeth {{as if in a}} snarl, and is blindfolded by a <b>drooping</b> cloth bandage—a device likely drawn from Matthias Grünewald's Mocking of Christ. This creature faces the viewer directly and is centralised by a series of converging lines radiating {{from the base of the}} pedestal.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater, {{the striped}} honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} <b>drooping</b> branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{under the}} {{condition}} of load IL, the main bus voltage will reduce to VLA if a small <b>droop</b> gain kA is applied whilst reduce to VLB if a large <b>droop</b> gain kB is applied. It implies that voltage regulation performance of the system with small <b>droop</b> gains is superior to the one with large <b>droop</b> gains.|$|R
3000|$|In the <b>droop</b> control scheme, the WTG {{stator flux}} speed command (ω e [...]) is {{introduced}} from {{the output of}} the active power <b>droop</b> control, i.e., the active power <b>droop</b> control plays a role of setting the reference value for the stator flux speed. The output of the reactive power <b>droop</b> control gives the command of voltage reference.|$|R
5|$|Brolgas are monogamous {{and usually}} bond for life, though new pairings may follow a {{fatality}} of one individual. A feature of a bonded couple is the synchronous calling which the female usually initiates. She stands with her wings folded and beak {{pointed to the}} sky and emits a series of trumpeting calls. The male stands alongside in a similar posture but with his wings flared and primaries <b>drooping.</b> He emits one longer call for every two emitted by the female.|$|E
5|$|Concorde's <b>drooping</b> nose, {{developed}} by Marshall's of Cambridge at Cambridge Airport, enabled the aircraft to switch between being streamlined to reduce drag and achieve optimal aerodynamic efficiency without obstructing the pilot's view during taxi, take-off, and landing operations. Due {{to the high}} angle of attack, the long pointed nose obstructed the view and necessitated the capability to droop. The droop nose {{was accompanied by a}} moving visor that retracted into the nose prior to being lowered. When the nose was raised to horizontal, the visor would rise in front of the cockpit windscreen for aerodynamic streamlining.|$|E
5|$|Lambeosaurus {{was like}} other hadrosaurids, and could move on both two legs and all fours, {{as shown by}} {{footprints}} of related animals. It had a long tail stiffened by ossified tendons that prevented it from <b>drooping.</b> The hands had four fingers, lacking the innermost finger of the generalized five-fingered tetrapod hand, while the second, third, and fourth fingers were bunched together and bore hooves, suggesting the animal could have used the hands for support. The fifth finger was free and {{could be used to}} manipulate objects. Each foot had only the three central toes.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of angle and frequency <b>droops</b> in an autonomous microgrid that only contains voltage source converter (VSC) interfaced distributed generators (DGs). As a VSC can instantaneously change output voltage waveform, power sharing in a microgrid is possible by controlling the output voltage angle of the DGs through <b>droop.</b> The angle <b>droop</b> is able to provide proper load sharing among the DGs without a significant steady state frequency drop in the system. It is shown that the frequency variation with the frequency <b>droop</b> controller is significantly higher than that with the angle <b>droop</b> controller. The angle <b>droop</b> controller is derived from DC load flow. Both the angle and frequency <b>droop</b> controllers are designed through eigenvalue analysis. The performance of these two controllers is then performed through PSCAD simulations. M I...|$|R

When a female comes near a male at his nest the male begins to display by raising his head, <b>drooping</b> his wings, pushing his chest forward, and lowering his tail. He then bows {{up and down in}} front of the female, who will lunge and then fly away if unreceptive. Both sexes take part in building the nest, which consists of a loose, untidy bunch of dry grass which fills the nesting cavity, lined with fur and feathers for warmth.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 study {{suggested}} that the correlation of tail length and body size in males, wing length in females, and lifespan for both sexes were signs of individual quality, and the wrens of high quality tend to mate with like individuals. The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing <b>drooping</b> was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a {{possible explanation for the}} sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|From the {{apartment}} {{he shares with}} his hypochondriac mother Winifred, Seymour fetches his odd-looking, potted plant, but Mushnick is unimpressed by its sickly, <b>drooping</b> look. However, when Fouch suggests that Audrey Jr.'s uniqueness might attract {{people from all over the}} world to see it, Mushnick gives Seymour one week to revive it. Seymour has already discovered that the usual kinds of plant food do not nourish his strange hybrid and that every night at sunset the plant's leaves open up. When Seymour accidentally pricks his finger on another thorny plant, Audrey Jr. opens wider, eventually causing Seymour to discover that the plant craves blood. After that, each night Seymour nurses his creation with blood from his fingers. Although he feels increasingly listless, Audrey Jr. begins to grow and the shop's revenues increase due to the curious customers who are lured in to see the plant.|$|E
30|$|In [30], a novel <b>droop</b> that {{controls}} the nominal voltage is proposed to achieve good load sharing. However, this method only considers the load sharing among sources with same ratings which does not take different capacity of sources into account. In [31], a gain-scheduling technique is proposed which can achieve relative good voltage regulation and power sharing simultaneously by adjusting <b>droop</b> constant rather than simply selecting a large <b>droop</b> {{at the cost of}} voltage regulation or selecting a small <b>droop</b> at the cost of load sharing. This method needs to examine the voltage error for different <b>droop</b> gain under various load condition and then derives a certain relationship between load condition and <b>droop</b> constant. Reference [32] proposes State of Charge (SoC) based adaptive <b>droop</b> control to achieve dynamic SoC balancing and appropriate power sharing. In [33], analogue circuit is employed to improve the current sharing performance which actually is scaling up the <b>droop</b> gain, and the larger voltage drop owing to the enhancement of <b>droop</b> gain is compensated by increasing the voltage at a certain interval. In [34], a decentralized power sharing approach is proposed taking the line impedance into account in a low voltage DC MG including a PV, battery ESS. Grid-connected and islanded modes are considered and corresponding <b>droop</b> gains are discussed.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of two <b>droop</b> control schemes in a hybrid microgrid. With presence of both converter interfaced and inertial sources, the <b>droop</b> controller share power in a decentralized fashion. Both the <b>droop</b> controllers facilitate reactive power sharing based on voltage <b>droop.</b> However in frequency <b>droop</b> control, the real power sharing depends on the frequency, while in angle <b>droop</b> control, it depends on output voltage angle. For converter interfaced sources this reference voltage is tracked while for inertial DG, reference power for the prime mover is calculated from the reference angle with the proposed angle control scheme. This coordinated control scheme shows significant improvement in system performance. The comparison with the conventional frequency <b>droop</b> shows that the angle control scheme shares power with much lower frequency deviation.

5|$|It is {{the palms}} {{that are the}} {{signature}} plants of the island as the kentia and curly palms especially dominate the landscape in many places, the kentia being of special economic importance. All four species are endemic to the island, often occurring in dense pure stands, {{the one that has}} proved such a worldwide success as an indoor plant being the kentia or thatch palm (Howea forsteriana). This is a lowland palm with <b>drooping</b> leaflets and seed branches in 'hands' of 3–5 while the curly palm (Howea belmoreana), which occurs on slightly higher ground, has upwardly directed leaflets and solitary 'hands'. Natural hybrids between these species occur on the island and there is a mature specimen of one growing in the island nursery. On the mountain sides higher than about 350 m there is the big mountain palm (Hedyscepe canterburyana); it has large golf-ball-sized fruits while the little mountain palm (Lepidorrhachis mooreana) has marble-sized fruits and is only found on the mountain summits.|$|E

In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male.

40|$|A strong dl/dt {{event in}} a VLSI circuit can induce a {{temporary}} voltage drop and consequent malfunctioning of logic as for instance failing speed paths. This event, called power <b>droop,</b> usually {{manifests itself in}} at-speed scan test where a surge in switching activity (capture phase) follows a period of quiescent circuit state (shift phase).

40|$|<b>Droop</b> {{control has}} been widely applied in DC microgrids (MGs) due to its {{inherent}} modularity and ease of implementation. Among the different <b>droop</b> control methods that can be adopted in DC MGs, two options have been considered in this paper; I-V and V-I <b>droop.</b> I-V <b>droop</b> controls the DC current depending on the DC voltage whilst V-I <b>droop</b> regulates the DC voltage based on the output current. The paper proposes a comparative study of V-I/I-V <b>droop</b> control approaches in DC MGs focusing on steady-state power sharing performance and stability. The paper presents the control scheme for current-mode (I-V <b>droop)</b> and voltage-mode (V-I <b>droop)</b> systems, derives the corresponding output impedance of the source subsystem including converters dynamics and analyzes {{the stability of the}} power system when supplying constant power loads. The paper investigates first the impact on stability of the key parameters including <b>droop</b> gains, local control loop dynamics and number of sources and then performs a comparison between current-mode and voltage-mode systems in terms of stability. In addition, a generalized analytical impedance model of a multi-source, multi-load power system is presented to investigate stability in a more realistic scenario. For this purpose, the paper proposes the concept of “global <b>droop</b> gain” as an important factor to determine the stability behaviour of a parallel sources based DC system.

Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs, a <b>drooping</b> star in the western sky (Venus), and the hermit thrush, and employs the traditional progression of the pastoral elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, <b>drooping</b> of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
