The ministry is altogether filled up with a fighting spirit. I do not control any church. All the saints who have left the denominations, the divisive sects, and stand on the proper ground are a local church in their locality. They can express their opinions, but they may {{have nothing to do with}} this ministry... This does not mean that I ask you to stay away <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>local</b> church or that your local church is no longer a local church... I am not talking about the churches, I am talking about the ministry. The ministry is one thing, and the churches are another thing. These two things can be differentiated in the Epistles written by Paul. Paul’s ministry is one category, and the churches are another category. Paul never tried to force all the churches to follow him in his ministry, but Paul surely had a ministry for the churches.” ...|$|E

50|$|In the United Kingdom, local {{authorities}} will first need to approve any application {{for an event}} to which the public is admitted. No approval, no event. The first priority must be to arrange insurance cover and details can be obtained <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>local</b> authority. An added complication {{is a whole new}} raft of legislation concerning Health & Safety in particular Corporate Manslaughter, which can involve the event organiser being charged with a criminal offence if any of the insurances and risk assessments are not fully completed well in advance of the event. If this very basic step isn't completed then any further activity should be halted until it is.|$|E
50|$|A fractured, ditched or {{dislodged}} filling that {{is broken}} or lost may cause discomfort or sharp pain due to jagged edges. There can be aesthetical concerns if the filling is in a visible area. Patients {{need to be}} aware of the sharp edges and ensure their tongue does not constantly apply pressure around that area, as it can cause cuts to the tongue. However, in some cases the result of the loss of a filling can cause irritation to the side of the cheek and potentially lead to an ulcer. Sharp edges can easily be dealt with by levelling the filling or tooth edges <b>from</b> <b>your</b> <b>local</b> dentist during the emergency appointment. Hypersensitivity issues may also arise, short sharp pain caused by exposed underlying dentine, after the deterioration of the filling material.|$|E
