This examination was conducted using Finite Element (FE) analysis procedures. At that time, it was not practical to accurately model {{the interaction between the}} flanges and gaskets as a function of time and the resultant temperature. In the ensuing time period, the available FE technology has improved dramatically. Faster computers and new parallel solver technology allow modeling of the flange components that was not practical 10 years ago. In this paper, the authors will re-examine the exchanger system using current technology and discuss the improved insight that this new technology provides to the problem solution...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{formability}} {{of aluminum}} sheet {{depends on the}} temperature of the material and the strain rate. E. g. the limiting drawing ratio can be improved by increasing the temperature uniformly, but even more by <b>heating</b> the <b>flange</b> and cooling the punch. To accurately simulate the deep drawing or stretching of aluminum sheet at elevated temperatures, a material model is required that incorporates the temperature and strain-rate de-pendency. In this paper simulations are presented of the deep drawing of a cylindrical cup, using axi-symmetric elements. Two material models are compared. First a phenomenological material model is used, in which the parameters of a Ludwik–Nadai hardening curve are made temperature and strain-rate dependent. Then a physically-based model, according to Bergström is used. The model incorporates the influence of the tempera-ture on the flow stress and on the hardening rate and includes dynamic recovery aspects. ...|$|R

To improve the drawing ratio, only the <b>heating</b> of the <b>flange</b> region in the warm temperature range up to 300 °C was studied on DP 600 sheet steel by numerical simulation. Thermo-elastic-plastic FEM analysis of deep drawing at several drawing ratios was performed and compared with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|Wake fields excited {{in a small}} gap of {{a vacuum}} chamber by ampere beams can have enough {{amplitude}} to heat the chamber. The electric component of these fields can be above the arcing limit. Usually flange connections in a vacuum chamber contain a vacuum gasket and an inner RF gasket. If a small gap occurs between the RF gasket and flange surface, wake fields can <b>heat</b> the <b>flanges.</b> The flanges are usually made of stainless steel, which efficiently absorbs RF power. Some flanges consist of two parts (like a vacuum valve flange) and are mechanically connected but have poor thermal contact. A temperature rise can lengthen the inner part of the flange and make firmer the thermal contact to the outer part of the <b>flange.</b> The <b>heat</b> will then flow to the outer part of the flange, which is air and water-cooled. This cooling lowers the flange temperature and the thermal contact becomes poor again. This “quasi ” periodic mechanism can explain the nature of temperature oscillations observed at several locations in PEP-II, the SLAC B-factory...|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} of an exothermic process plant carried aboard an Earth orbiting spacecraft is regulated using {{a number of}} curved radiator panels accurately positioned in a circular arrangement to form an open receptacle. A module containing the process is insertable into the receptacle. Heat exchangers having broad exterior surfaces extending axially above the circumference of the module fit within arcuate spacings between adjacent radiator panels. Banks of variable conductance heat pipes partially embedded within and thermally coupled to the radiator panels extend across the spacings and are thermally coupled to broad exterior surfaces of the <b>heat</b> exchangers by <b>flanges.</b> Temperature sensors monitor the {{temperature of}} process fluid flowing from the module through the heat exchanges.

40|$|During the bending of {{flange plate}} used for dapped girders some highway bridge fabricators are {{experiencing}} cracking of the flange plate particularly when heat {{is used in}} assisting the bending process. Due to the extreme strains experienced during the fabrication process, investigating this problem {{requires the use of}} a finite element analysis. The fabrication process was broken down into two parts, first the heating of the plate through the use of either a furnace or an acetylene torch (thermal), and the second was the bending process (structural). The five different temperatures collected during the thermal analysis were a uniform temperature of 75 oF, a 1100 oF uniform temperature as a result of furnace heating, both five and ten minutes of air-cooling after the plate had reached a uniform temperature of 1100 oF, and the temperature gradient after <b>heating</b> the <b>flange</b> plate to a surface temperature of 1200 oF though the use of an acetylene torch. After the thermal analysis was completed, the resulting temperatures were imported into the structural model. The plate thicknesses analyzed were one, one and a half, and two inches, assuming both 50 and 70 ksi yield strengths. To achieve a 90 degree six-inch radius bend the plate was bent in five separate locations. The result of this analysis showed that with the introduction of temperature gradients into thefabrication process, the strains along the plate??s extreme fibers increased. The model further showed that for both a one and a half and two-inch thick plate the extreme fiber strains exceeded ten percent, which further adds to the increased risk of the flange plate cracking during fabrication. The highest residual stresses through the plate??s thickness occurred during cold bending. The residual stresses through the plate??s thickness decreased when the fabrication process was carried out at elevated temperatures. When steel exceeds a strain of 10 to 16 percent during the fabrication process, the plate becomes susceptible to cracking. This strain limit was exceeded for plate thicknesses of one and a half and two inches...|$|R
40|$|The {{background}} for the project is the 320 MVA generator step-up transformer for Jostedal Power Plant. The transformer experiences excess heating in a limited part of the steel tank and lid from eddy current loss caused by the low voltage busbar configuration. This is unfavorable for the gasket and the transformer oil. In the project a test rig has been constructed which features a mild steel plate, being subjected to a magnetic field. The temperature in the plate is recorded and compared versus a numerical model created in Comsol Multiphysics {{and the use of}} the New Thermometric Method. The non-linear magnetic permeability in mild steel has also been investigated. The heat transfer analysis from the numerical model showed an acceptable temperature deviation compared with the actual temperature in the steel plate. The knowledge from this has been used to create numerical model of a selected part of the transformer utilizing symmetry conditions. The Heat Transfer analysis of this coincides well with thermography images of the overheating area. Poor electromagnetic contact between tank and lid may be an important part of the excess <b>heating</b> in the <b>flange.</b> It is recommended to mount braided copper links over the flange to see if this will reduce some of the excess temperature. If this is not adequate, the evaluation of the different measures that could be done to reduce stray loss concluded that mounting an aluminum shield would be the preferable choice. Mounting such a shield would repel the flux from entering the tank steel, and thereby reduce the temperature. However, the shield itself may experience heating, but not to an extent that the steel experience today. </p...|$|R
40|$|This work is {{primarily}} concerned with the structural response of steel I-section beams and columns <b>heated</b> along one <b>flange</b> to the elevated temperatures likely to be reached in real fires in buildings or ISO 834 fire resistance tests. Experiments have employed nominally full size models, heated using high powered, ceramic insulated, electrical heating elements at temperatures up to 1000 °C. The experiments have been conducted on: a non-loaded, simply supported beam; a design-loaded, simply supported beam; a non-loaded 2 -span beam on simple supports; and design-loaded, pin-ended columns free to bow about both axes. Load, displacement and temperature data have been recorded and analysed {{for a number of}} heating, imposed loading and restraint conditions likely to be met in practice. One of the experiments simulates the loading and restraint conditions used in the BS 1476 : Part 8 : 1972 standard fire resistance test on beams. The data may be used as benchmarks for the validation of analytical studies. Simple theories f or the bowing displacements of non-loaded members having temperature gradients across the section have been derived and validated not only with the model experiments but also with data from full scale compartment fires in a collaborative programme of research undertaken by the British Steel Corporation Swinden Laboratories and Fire Research Station. The practical application of the theory has been demonstrated in other ways. A finite element method, using the PP. FEC program, has also been used which takes account of phase transformation - the sudden temporary shrinkage in steel as it is raised above a temperature of 720 °C - but it has not proved possible to use PAFEC for plasticity analyses of beams or columns at elevated temperatures.

40|$|LectureHigh {{temperatures}} inside coupling guards {{can cause}} machinery down time {{and loss of}} revenue. As a result, many industries invest significant time and effort trying to reduce <b>heat</b> generation. Windage <b>flanges</b> are a standard feature on high performance couplings {{with the purpose of}} reducing heat generation within guards. However, previous testing and Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation carried out by Pennington and Meck (2012) have cast doubt on the effectiveness of this feature. The forthcoming fifth edition of API 671 is expected to reduce the maximum allowable guard temperature from 160 ?F (70 ?C) to 140 ?F (60 ?C), {{to reduce the risk of}} irreversible surface contact burns. In order to comply with the API requirement, it is important to understand how features such as windage flanges and radial guard clearance affect heat generation. CFD analysis and physical testing are presented in this paper. Improvements to the test configuration setup have been made to achieve increased coupling surface speeds of 175 m/s (compared to 123 m/s in previous testing by Pennington and Meck (2012)), and simplified to isolate the effects of the windage flange. This paper investigates the effectiveness of windage flanges, as well as the effect of guard radial clearance on heat generation inside coupling guards, and resultant coupling guard temperature, at much higher speeds than in previous studies. In total, six test configurations were simulated, consisting of two test couplings (with and without windage features) tested with three different sized coupling guards, creating variable radial clearances. CFD analysis results conclude that the windage flange features are ineffective in reducing heat generation inside the guard, and coupling guards with a larger radial clearance result in lower temperatures inside the guard. However, this approach is less effective above a guard radial clearance of 40 mm, after which the windage flange has little effect on the temperature within the coupling guard. In addition, temperature results from the validated CFD model were found to be within 4 percent of the physical experimental data...|$|R
40|$|A thermal tip {{clearance}} control system provides a robust and flexible means of manipulating the closure between the casing and the rotating blade tips in a jet engine, reducing undesirable tip leakage flows. This may be achieved using an impingement cooling scheme on the external casing of the engine in conjunction with careful thermal management of internal over-tip seal segment cavity. For a reduction in thrust specific fuel consumption, the mass flow rate of air used for cooling must be minimised, be at as low a pressure as possible and delivered through a light weight structure surrounding the rotating components in the turbine. This thesis first characterises {{the effectiveness of a}} range of external impingement cooling arrangements in typical engine casing closure system. The effects of jet-to-jet pitch, number of jets, inline and staggered alignment of jets, arrays of jets on flange, on an engine representative casing geometry are assessed through comparison of the convective heat transfer coefficient distributions in a series of numerical studies. A baseline case is validated experimentally. The validation data allowed the suitability of different turbulence closure models to be assessed using a commercial RANS solver. Importantly for each configuration the thermal contraction of an idealised engine casing is predicted using thermo-mechanical finite element models, at a series of operating conditions representing engine idle to maximum take-off conditions. Cooling is provided by manifolds attached to the outside of the engine. The assembly tolerance of these components leads to variation in the standoff distance between the manifold and the casing. For cooling arrangements with promising performance, the study is extended to characterise the variation in closure with standoff distance. It is shown that where a sparse array of non-interacting jets is used the system can be made tolerant of large build misalignments. The casing geometry itself contributes to the thermal response of the system, and, in an additional study, the effect of casing thickness and circumferential thermal control flanges are investigated. Restriction of the passage of <b>heat</b> into the <b>flanges</b> was seen to be dramatically change their effectiveness and slight necking of the flanges at their root was shown to improve the performance disproportionally. High temperature secondary air flowing past the internal face of the engine casing tends to heat the casing, causing it to grow. Experimental and numerical characterisation of a heat transfer within a typical over-tip segment cavity heat transfer is presented in this thesis for the first time. A simplified modelling strategy is proposed for casing and a means to reduce the casing heat pickup by up to 25 % was identified. The overall validity of the modelling approach used is difficult to validate in the engine environment, however limited data from a test engine temperature survey became available {{during the course of the}} research. By modelling this engine {{tip clearance}} control system it was shown that good agreement to the temperature distribution in the engine casing could be achieved where full surface external heat transfer coefficient boundary conditions were available. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tailoring}} of hot stamped components is investigated, specifically {{the introduction of}} a tailored (locally softened) flange within an otherwise martensitic hot formed side impact beam. The effect of tailoring on the resulting micro-hardness distribution and crash response during three-point bending is examined. The “in-die heating” tailoring method is considered, using a cooled die with local <b>heating</b> in the <b>flange</b> region. The <b>heated</b> regions cool the flange at a lower cooling rate to produce a softer region with higher ductility. In the current work, three different die temperatures are chosen for the forming conditions in the tailored flange region. A fully hardened beam is hot formed and quenched with the dies set at room temperature as a benchmark case. Die temperatures in the flange region of 400 and 600 °C are considered to produce the tailored side impact beams with reduced hardness in the flange. The material considered is Usibor® 1500 -AS boron steel in thicknesses of 1. 2 and 1. 8 mm. Two quenching periods of 4 and 10 s are also studied. After forming, the 1. 2 mm thick beams exhibit very little difference in hardness distribution between the two quenching periods. The 1. 8 mm thick beams have a larger difference in hardness distribution in the sidewall region caused by the difference in quenching (hold) time, with the shorter quench resulting in a softer sidewall condition. The measured micro hardness in the flange area of the 1. 2 mm thick beams was 480, 360, and 225 HV (compared to 480 HV in the fully quenched region away from the flange) when the flange region of the dies are set to room temperature, 400 °C, and 600 °C respectively. For the 1. 8 mm thick beams, the measured hardness was 475, 270, and 205 HV for the corresponding die temperatures and a 10 s quench period. The tailored hot formed side impact beams are tested under three-point bend loading using two back plate configurations, referred to as the full back plate and split back plate configurations. The split back plate configuration was intended to focus deformation {{at the center of the}} beam thereby inducing fracture in the flange region. The beams exhibited two deformation modes, referred to as a “wrapping mode” versus a “collapse mode”. In the wrapping mode, the friction between the punch and beam surface sufficient to cause the deforming beam to wrap around the indentor resulting in a higher overall load level and energy absorption. In the collapse mode, the cross-section collapses or folds under the indentor leading to a lower bending resistance. The mode selection was spurious with nominally identical beams exhibiting both responses. In general, the fully hardened beams have the highest peak load while the tailored beams formed with a 600 °C dies have the lowest peak load in the 3 -point bend experiments. None of the beams tested exhibited global fractures for all conditions considered. Numerical models of the tailored hot forming process and subsequent three-point bend experiments were developed. The material model developed by Akerstrom (2006, PhD Thesis, Lulea University of Technology), as implemented in LS-DYNA with modifications proposed by Schill et al. (2013, 4 th Int. CHS 2 Conf., pp. 31 - 38) for tailoring simulations with a temperature hold period, is used to predict the hardness after tailored hot forming, while the TCM II constitutive model developed by Bardelcik et al. (2014, Mat. and Des., pp. 509 - 525) is used to predict the crash performance of the tailored hot formed beams. The forming simulations were able to accurately predict the hardness of the non-tailored, fully hardened beams with a predicted hardness of greater than 480 HV for both thicknesses and quenching periods. The hardness of the tailored (softened) flanges was predicted within 27 HV (12 %) for the 600 °C die temperature and 63 HV (18 %) for the 400 °C die temperature. A parametric study using the three-point bending model, demonstrated that the deformation mode (wrapping versus collapsing) was controlled by the friction between the punch and beam surface. High friction levels promoted a wrapping deformation mode that produces higher load levels. For high friction cases, the simulations were able to predict the force versus displacement response of the wrapping mode beams with a full back plate configuration very closely up to an impactor displacement of 30 mm. At this point, the beams in the experiments begin to soften due to fracture in fold regions which was not accounted for in the models. The predicted loads for the beams with a split back plate configuration at peak load displacement of the experiment were lower than measured by 4. 8 kN (or 22 %), possibly due to an additional gap that formed between the flange and the back plate caused by a thermal distortion. Tailoring the flange of the side impact beams lowered the peak force value when compared to the peak force of a fully hardened beam. Most of the fractures seen during the three-point bend experiments were located at the fully hardened region of a tailored beam. There was no spot weld failure in any of the three-point bend experiments regardless of the forming temperature or the spot weld configuration. Future work should include a bend experiment for which the specimens are more prone to fracture in the reduced hardness area, to further examine the role of tailoring in controlling the onset of fracture...|$|R
