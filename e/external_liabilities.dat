50|$|The idea of {{dark matter}} has not gone without criticism. First, Willem Buiter has argued that dark matter should result in {{a higher rate of}} return on U.S. {{external}} assets than on U.S. <b>external</b> <b>liabilities.</b> However, he claims, there is no convincing evidence that this is the case. Second, the U.S. income from dark matter seems to vary enormously from year to year, even though it stems from permanent characteristics of the U.S. economy like the export of know-how. Lastly, Mathew Higgins, Thomas Klitgaard,and Cedric Tille agree with the assertion that U.S. foreign assets are currently undervalued. However, they argue that more important, U.S. foreign liabilities are overvalued. Thus, The U.S. has fewer foreign liabilities than is currently assumed; this fact (rather than dark matter) explains the unexpectedly high net income. In a 2007 article, Hausmann and Sturzenegger respond to some of these critiques, defending the existence and function {{of dark matter}}.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, Prussian Ministerpräsident Otto Braun {{said that}} he was not {{interested}} in becoming chancellor. When the SPD {{turned out to be the}} clear winner of the May 1928 elections, the Social Democrats thus designated Müller as chancellor. However, the other parties proved reluctant to compromise and it took a personal intervention by Stresemann for a government to be formed on 28 June 1928. The coalition—of Social Democrats, Zentrum, DDP and DVP—only managed to settle on a written agreement on the government's policies in spring 1929. In particular domestic policy differences between SPD and DVP dominated the government's work. Its continued existence was mainly due to the mutual personal esteem in which Müller and Foreign minister Stresemann held each other. Relations between the parties were strained by the arguments over Panzerkreuzer A (construction of a battleship), during which the SPD forced its ministers to vote against the allocation of funds to the project in the Reichstag although they had endorsed it in cabinet meetings. In addition, the Ruhreisenstreit was a bone of contention, as the DVP refused to provide financial support even to those only indirectly affected by the strike. Financing the budget 1929 and the <b>external</b> <b>liabilities</b> of the Reich was a huge problem, and an agreement was only possible by counting on negotiating more lenient conditions with the Allies. Müller himself had been the leader of the delegation to the League of Nations in the summer of 1928 where he—despite a heated argument with French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand over German rearmament—had laid the groundwork for concessions by the Allies. By January 1930, the government had succeeded in negotiating a reduction in reparation payments (the Young Plan signed in August 1929) and a promise by the Allies to completely remove the occupation forces from the Rhineland by May 1930.|$|E

40|$|Hungary’s net <b>external</b> <b>liabilities</b> have {{increased}} significantly {{in recent years}} and its external liabilities-to-GDP ratio currently stands at a very high level by international standards. As the credit market crisis emanating from the Unites States has put renewed emphasis on the vulnerability of emerging economies, it may be useful to look more closely at the factors shaping developments in a country’s <b>external</b> <b>liabilities</b> in general, and those specific for the Hungarian economy in particular. A review of the academic literature sheds light on the fact that in emerging economies the increase in external debt due mainly to the gradual easing in liquidity constraints and increasing financial integration is a natural process. International comparisons appear to reinforce this view. Accordingly, similar developments have taken place in recent years in each of the newly joined EU Member States and Hungary. However, these comparisons also reveal that Hungary’s <b>external</b> <b>liabilities</b> are higher than those of countries at a comparable stage of economic development. It is also {{important to note that the}} stock of <b>external</b> <b>liabilities</b> was higher in Hungary than in other countries even in the period prior to EU accession. This implies that the outflow of income related to a country’s high external debt can by itself keep debt at a high level.

The assessment suggests that, for auditors, self-insurance is better than external insurance so that the claim does not necessarily support damages caps. Even if the claim were valid, the inquiry concerning additional insurance suggests superior alternatives by using previously-discussed financial statement insurance, to tailor coverage to risks of ordinary audit failure, and the novel innovation of insurance securitization to pool and distribute risks of catastrophic audit failure through capital markets...|$|R

40|$|In theory, one of {{the main}} {{benefits}} of financial globalization is that it should allow for more efficient international risk sharing. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the patterns of risk sharing among different groups of countries and examine how international financial integration has affected the evolution of risk sharing patterns. Using a variety of empirical techniques, we conclude that there is at best a modest degree of international risk sharing, and certainly nowhere near the levels predicted by theory. In addition, only industrial countries have attained better risk sharing outcomes during the recent period of globalization. Developing countries have, by and large, been shut out of this benefit. The most interesting result is that even emerging market economies, which have witnessed large increases in cross-border capital flows, have seen little change in their ability to share risk. We find that the composition of flows may help explain why emerging markets {{have not been able to}} realize this presumed benefit of financial globalization. In particular, our results suggest that portfolio debt, which has dominated the <b>external</b> <b>liability</b> stocks of most emerging markets until recently, is not conducive to risk sharing...|$|R

The effect of de facto financial integration on TFP growth is less clear, but this masks an important and novel result. We find strong evidence that FDI and portfolio equity liabilities boost TFP growth while external debt is actually negatively correlated with TFP growth.

I use data on stocks of gross <b>external</b> assets and <b>liabilities</b> for 167 countries over 1973 - 2003, in an unbalanced panel probit regression to obtain robust estimates of the probability and determinants of a post-crisis recession. Several single and simultaneous equation specifications support the idea that the output cost of a currency crisis depends on its transmission mechanism. Specifically, a recession is likely to be severe if it is preceded by a crisis that works its way through the financial sector. In addition, the results show that measures of contingent liabilities, capital flight, and lack of financial depth are significant predictors of costly crises.
