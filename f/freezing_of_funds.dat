40|$|At {{the moment}} Croatia {{is facing a}} number of {{economic}} challenges as well as numerous opportunities. The challenges {{are for the most}} part related to the consequences of the economic crisis that began six years ago and the need to reduce budgetary and macroeconomic imbalances. The importance of this line of action in economic policy is further reflected in European Commission findings which point to the vulnerabilities of the Croatian economy and the consequential assessment of the possibility to introduce corrective measures that could ultimately result in the <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> EU <b>funds.</b> Moreover, fiscal vulnerabilities have resulted in excessive deficit procedure being launched in January 2014, whereby Croatia was obliged, in accordance with Council recommendations, to reduce the deficit to 2. 7 % of GDP by the end of 2016 and ensure sustainable trajectory of public debt. On the other hand, a number of indicators point to favourable economic trends, notably high-frequency macroeconomic indicators including industrial production, the number of tourists’ overnight stays, real turnover in retail trade and construction works show an upward trend, while exports and employment rates are increasing. The forecasted GDP growth rate for 2016 will thus significantly exceed initial expectations. Over the medium term the positive trends are expected to continue, with a gradual increase in economic activity. In 2017 and 2018 GDP is projected to increase by 3. 2 %, this increase rising to 3. 3 % in 2019.

40|$|<b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is a common, {{debilitating}} {{feature of}} Parkinson’s disease. We have studied gait planning {{in patients with}} <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, using motor imagery of walking in combination with {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}}. This approach exploits the large neural overlap that exists between planning and imagining a movement. In addition, it avoids confounds introduced by brain responses to altered motor performance and somatosensory feedback during actual freezing episodes. We included 24 patients with Parkinson’s disease: 12 patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, 12 matched patients without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait and 21 matched healthy controls. Subjects performed two previously validated tasks—motor imagery of gait and a visual imagery control task. During functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, we quantified imagery performance by measuring the time required to imagine walking on paths of different widths and lengths. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry to test whether between-group differences in imagery-related activity were related to structural differences. Imagery times indicated that patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait, patients without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait and controls engaged in motor imagery of gait, with matched task performance. During motor imagery of gait, patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait showed more activity than patients without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait in the mesencephalic locomotor region. Patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait also tended to have decreased responses in mesial frontal and posterior parietal regions. Furthermore, patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait had grey matter atrophy in {{a small portion of the}} mesencephalic locomotor region. The gait-related hyperactivity of the mesencephalic locomotor region correlated with clinical parameters (<b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait severity and disease duration), but not with the degree of atrophy. These results indicate that patients with Parkinson’s disease with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait have structural and functional alterations in the mesencephalic locomotor region. We suggest that <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait might emerge when altered cortical control of gait is combined with a limited ability of the mesencephalic locomotor region to react to that alteration. These limitations might become particularly evident during challenging events that require precise regulation of step length and gait timing, such as turning or initiating walking, which are known triggers for <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait is {{a common}} cause of {{disability}} and falls in patients with Parkinson's disease. We studied brain functional connectivity, by means of resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}}, in patients with Parkinson's disease and <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T was collected in 29 patients with Parkinson's disease, of whom 16 presented with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait as determined by a validated <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait questionnaire, and 15 matched healthy controls. Single-subject and group-level independent component analysis was used to identify the main resting-state networks differing between Parkinson's disease patients with and without <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait. Statistical analysis was performed using BrainVoyager QX. RESULTS: Between-group differences in resting-state networks revealed that patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait exhibit significantly reduced functional connectivity within both "executive-attention" (in the right middle frontal gyrus and in the angular gyrus) and visual networks (in the right occipito-temporal gyrus) [p < 0. 05 corrected for multiple comparisons]. <b>Freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait clinical severity was significantly correlated with decreased connectivity within the two networks. Consistent with their "executive-attention" network impairment, patients with <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait scored lower on tests of frontal lobe functions (phonemic verbal fluency: p = 0. 005; frontal assessment battery: p < 0. 001; ten point clock test: p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a resting-state functional connectivity disruption of "executive-attention" and visual neural networks may be associated with the development <b>of</b> <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> gait in patients with Parkinson's disease...|$|R

It {{is concerned with}} the increasing amount of international cooperation between police and, to a lesser extent, intelligence actors in this field and analyses how far traditional mechanisms of accountability and oversight are keeping up with this development. For this purpose, the book develops a model of democratic legitimacy for the field of international counter-terrorism co-operation. The EU, like its Member States, understands itself to be based on principles of representative liberal democracy and the model follows roughly this idea by identifying parliamentary and judicial scrutiny as key instruments to ensure 'democratic' counter-terrorism actions and the protection of human rights. Drawing on the literature on security networks, it is proposed that current forms of counterterrorism policing under the EU's umbrella should be understood as networks which are defined as sets of expert institutional nodes or individual agents from at least two countries that are interconnected in order to authorize and/or provide security with regard to counter-terrorism {{for the benefit of the}} network participants or external 'clients'. The empirical focus of this research is on the European Police Office (Europol) which provides a key example in which to explore the emergence and current status quo of EU counter-terrorism policing. In addition, debates about the EUUS exchange of Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, the so-called Pr?m arrangements concerning intensified counter-terrorism co-operation in the EU, the <b>freezing</b> <b>of</b> terrorist <b>funds</b> as well as European involvement in the CIA's so-called extraordinary rendition campaign are interwoven into this discussion. The book concludes that the EU is an emerging counter-terrorism actor, but that, for the time being, its policies and actions are insufficiently subject to parliamentary and judicial scrutiny.
