50|$|A <b>Digital</b> <b>NOTAM</b> (DIGITAM), is a data setmade {{available}} through digital services containing {{information concerning the}} establishment, condition or change in any aeronautical facility, service, procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to systems and automated equipment used by personnel concerned with flight operations.|$|E
50|$|The current {{version of}} AIXM 5.0 (and {{successive}} updates) was developed through a public design review meeting at the 2006 Global AIM Congress. AIXM 5.0 aligned the format with current ISO standards for geospatial information, including GML, allowed for modular development and future extension and {{was also the first}} version to enable <b>digital</b> <b>NOTAM.</b> This version is still in use by some “early adopters” including the FAA.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of NOTAM in text format, {{which is used}} in aeronautics. It documents the difference between text and <b>digital</b> format of <b>NOTAM,</b> special types of NOTAM messages and items from which the NOTAM consist of. It describes syntax and the functions of program, which was made within the frame of this thesis. The program is fully capable of correct parsing and processing of the NOTAM. The program can display each area of processed NOTAM messages in map and also provides detection of collision between these areas and flight pla...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Digital</b> <b>NOTAM</b> {{encoding}} {{is based}} on the Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) version 5, which has been developed in cooperation between the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (EUROCONTROL) and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), {{with the support of the}} international AIS community.The DIGITAM eliminates the free form text contained within a NOTAM and replaces the text with a series of structured facts, which obtain to the aeronautical entity concerned.|$|E
