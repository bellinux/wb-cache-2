5|$|There was {{no blood}} on her feet or other debris, such as the sugar {{that was on the}} downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and {{forehead}} at postmortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A scientist, Mr Elliott, testified that if she had loaded 18 cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The {{blood on her}} nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that she was wearing just a nightdress, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how she could have carried the cartridges.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the first}} matchup between Eastern Washington and BYU. [...] Corby Hodgkiss took a 39-yard {{touchdown}} interception on Eastern Washington's first drive. [...] Bryan Kehl and Quinn Gooch also came away with an interception each. Due to weather and an early defensive touchdown, BYU went away from the pass fairly early. The final quarter {{was one of the}} shortest in recent memory as the refs were very liberal with the clock. This was mostly due to the fact the score was 42-7 and there was a blizzard. The last 10 minutes in the game <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the field yet the cougar faithful cheered loudly until the end.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the past}} {{travellers}} avoided the Risley (Birchwood) area because it of its dangerous mossland, however gradually over time {{much of the}} fertile mossland was reclaimed and turned into farm land. With {{the advent of the}} Second World War, 927 acres (3.8km²) of agricultural land was changed into a massive Royal Ordnance Factory, ROF Risley. The location was chosen because the low lying mist and cloud helped camouflage the factory from the air; according to a local builder: [...] "It was very lonely and misty at night, and that's why the factory was constructed there ... it was usually covered with a mist or cloud. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it in the day time, you know". Although the location of the factory was known by the German Luftwaffe, the factory was bombed only once during the war.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1971, the Gnat {{proved to}} be a {{frustrating}} opponent for the larger, heavier and older Sabre. The Gnat was referred to as a [...] "Sabre Slayer" [...] by the IAF since most of its combat [...] "kills" [...] during the two wars were against Sabres. The Canadair Sabre Mk 6 was widely regarded as the best dogfighter of its era. [...] Tactics called for Gnats taking on the Sabres in the vertical arena, where the Sabres were at a disadvantage. As the Gnat was lightweight and compact in shape, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> especially at the low levels where most dogfights took place. Apart from air defence operations, they performed multiple roles in the Bangladesh Liberation War, including anti-shipping operations, ground attack, bomber/transport escort and close air support with devastating effects on the PAF.|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} the walk, Wallenda {{said it was}} more difficult than he had expected. [...] "That mist was thick. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at times. The wind was wild. It'd come at me one way and hit me from the front, and hit me from the back." [...] Weather instruments showed gusts up to 14mph during the walk. Wallenda further remarked that the turbulent waters below {{made it difficult for}} him to see the wire. Before the walk, Jay Cochrane, a veteran wire walker who had unsuccessfully petitioned to walk Horseshoe Falls for 30 years, said of the local weather [...] "Unpredictable is a mild word. It is unforgiving... can spray mist anywhere from 380 to 590feet in the air. I've seen it, I've measured it." [...] He added that walking Horseshoe Falls was an opportunity [...] "like none other in history." [...] Long-time circus performer, Jackie LeClaire, remarked [...] "aerialists always try to calculate risk. Nik couldn't do that because this walk had never been done before." [...] Local historian, Paul Gromosiak, who has researched daredevil activity in the Niagara region for his books, said Wallenda's proximity to the falls made his act far more dangerous than any prior act.|$|E

60|$|The {{open ground}} was only too short. That thundering pace soon brought Helen's horse to the timber. Here {{it took all}} her {{strength}} to check his headlong flight over deadfalls and between small jack-pines.

6000|$|... "The {{rain was}} still falling steadily, {{for it was}} just the {{beginning}} of the wet season.

A deep moat lay in front of our door, but the water was in places nearly dried up, and it could easily be crossed.

But to give him food or shelter was, in Norman eyes, an act of {{rebellion}} against the rightful King William; and Ivo rode on, boiling over with righteous indignation, along the narrow drove which led toward Deeping.|$|E

60|$|Kit {{went with}} them. He felt shaken, {{for the man}} who had brought down the plaster was {{obviously}} a good shot. He imagined it was another who had intended to stab him; in fact, a number of his enemies might be lurking about. He was not, as a rule, vindictive, but the stealthy attack had induced a dangerous mood and he was sorry he had missed the man. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why he had done so, but he had, perhaps, been half asleep. Now, however, he resolved to watch until day broke.|$|E
60|$|The sharp hiss {{the steel}} runners made was louder, the wind began to scream, {{and she got}} {{something}} of a shock when she cautiously looked up. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> through the snowy spray, but {{the top of the}} crag looked ominously near. Glancing down hill with smarting eyes, she thought the slope, which, from the top, had seemed to fall evenly to the dale, was also inclined towards the crag. She could not see much of the latter, but there was a fringe of dark rock where the white declivity broke off.|$|E
60|$|Seeing that he {{had made}} up his mind, Edgar raised no more objections, and in another few moments George {{disappeared}} into a haze of driving snow. When he left the trail he found walking more difficult than he had expected, but though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> beyond a few yards, he had the bluff to guide him and he kept along the edge of it until the trees vanished suddenly. Then he stopped, buffeted by the wind, to gather breath and fix clearly in his mind the salient features of the open space that he must cross.|$|E

60|$|Lighting his pipe, he {{took his}} seat on the hand-car and knitted his brows as two colored laborers drove him down the hill. Below, the lights of Santa Brigida gleamed in a cluster against the dusky sea, and he knew {{something}} of the intrigues {{that went on in}} the town. Commercial and political jealousies were very keen, and citizens of all ranks fought and schemed against their neighbors. The place was rank with plots, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how he could be involved. Yet it certainly began to look {{as if he had been}} stabbed by Oliva's order, and Oliva was now employed at the Adexe coaling wharf.|$|E
60|$|Hyslop said {{he would}} like to go, and would do so if it were necessary, but to get away just then was awkward. Grace {{declared}} somebody must stop to look after Cartwright and the house, and she imagined this was her post. For all that, since she was older than Barbara, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her duty. Mrs. Cartwright did not indicate whom she wanted, although she glanced at Barbara. Since she was ill she had got very languid, and Cartwright did not meddle. He knew his stepchildren, and it was characteristic that Grace talked about her duty; taking care of an invalid at a foreign hotel had not much charm for Grace.|$|E
60|$|New York welcomed Jill, as {{she came}} out of the Pennsylvania Station in Seventh Avenue, with a whirl of {{powdered}} snow that touched her cheek like a kiss, the cold, bracing kiss one would expect from this vivid city. She stood at the station entrance, a tiny figure beside the huge pillars, looking round her with eager eyes. A wind was whipping down the avenue. The sky was a clear, brilliant tint of the brightest blue. Energy was in the air, and hopefulness. She wondered if Mr. Elmer Mariner ever came to New York. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how even his gloom would contrive to remain unaffected by the exhilaration of the place.|$|E
