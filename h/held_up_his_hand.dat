2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading ( [...] , aliyah), Amalek attacked Israel at Rephidim. Moses stationed himself {{on the top of the}} hill, with the rod of God in his hand, and whenever Moses <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> Israel prevailed; but whenever he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. When Moses grew weary, he sat on a stone, while Aaron and Hur supported his hands, and Joshua overwhelmed Amalek in battle. The seventh open portion ( [...] , petuchah) ends here.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah quoted [...] which {{described}} how when Moses <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> Israel prevailed, and asked whether Moses' hands really made war or stopped it. Rather, the Mishnah read the verse to teach {{that as long}} as the Israelites looked upward and submitted their hearts to God, they would grow stronger, but when they did not, they would fall. The Mishnah taught that the fiery serpent placed on a pole in [...] worked much the same way, by directing the Israelites to look upward to God.|$|E
2500|$|Cornell’s first {{heat was}} versus the Leander Club crew of London, England, coached by Rudolph C. Lehmann. The {{members of the}} Leander Club were {{composed}} almost entirely of former Oxford and Cambridge oarsman. They had won the Cup seven times and were the four-time defending champion. Leander was considered the best crew in England, and was the favorite to win the Cup in 1895. The race was a contrast of rowing styles. Cornell rowed the Courtney stroke, which was short and choppy compared to the Leander’s long and sweeping stroke. The heat was marred by controversy right from the start. Cornell and Leander crew took up their positions at the starting point. When the umpire asked if the crews were ready, F. D. Colson, the Cornell coxswain, answered [...] "yes". The Leander crew insisted two members shouted [...] "No" [...] and C. W. Kent, the crew’s stroke, <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> [...] The umpire insisted that someone from the English crew answered that they were ready and then gave the command to start the race. Both crews shot out from the starting line. Cornell rowed with strong even strokes, but {{only half of the}} Leander club was rowing. At that point, Leander stopped rowing, and C. F. Beggs and C. W. Kent, the Leander coxswain and stroke respectively, protested to the umpire. When the umpire did not tell Cornell to stop or return to the start, Cornell continued rowing at a leisurely pace, followed by the referee’s boat. Cornell finished the course of one mile (1.6km) and [...] in 8 minutes and 11 seconds. This was more than a minute over the time they were rowing in practice. When they crossed the finish line, they were declared the winner of the heat by the umpire. The Leander crew protested the Cornell victory, stating that they notified the umpire before he gave the notice to start the race. They appealed it to the [...] "steward", who met {{at the end of the}} day but they ruled in favor of Cornell victory. They adopted the following resolution: [...] "Resolved, That the committee, while deeply regretting the most unfortunate misunderstand, feel that they must abide by the laws of boat racing and cannot review the decision of the umpire or starter." ...|$|E
