5|$|The {{names of}} the first two playoff rounds date back to the postseason format that was first used in 1978, when the league added a second wild-card team to each conference. The {{first round of the playoffs}} is dubbed the wild-card playoffs (or wild-card weekend). In this round, the third-seeded {{division}} winner hosts the sixth seed wild card, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth. There are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. The 1 and 2 seeds from each conference receive a bye in the first round, which entitles these teams to automatic advancement to the second round, the divisional playoffs, where they face the wild-card weekend survivors. The NFL does not use a <b>fixed</b> <b>bracket</b> playoff system. The number 1 seed will host the worst surviving seed from the first round (seed 4, 5 or 6), while the number 2 seed will play the other team (seed 3, 4 or 5).|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{microbiological}} and periodontal changes occurring in adolescents during 12 months of orthodontic therapy with removable aligners (Invisalign®) and with fixed appliances. Subjects and Methods: During the years 2012 - 2013, 50 teenagers aged 10 - 18 years with similar orthodontic starting conditions {{participated in this}} trial in a university clinic of northern Italy. After receiving professional oral hygiene and instructions on a standardized oral hygiene protocol, the adolescents {{were randomly assigned to}} either orthodontic treatment with traditional <b>fixed</b> <b>brackets</b> (n= 25) or to treatment with Invisalign® aligners (n= 25). Subgingival microbiological samples, probing depth (PD), plaque index (PI), and bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded from the mesiovestibular subgingival sulcus of the upper right first molar and left central incisor at the beginning of treatment and 3, 6, and 12 months later. Compliance to oral hygiene procedures, full mouth plaque score (FMPS) and full mouth bleeding score (FMBS) were assessed at the beginning of treatment and 12 months later. Two sample independent t-tests and Chi-square test were used to study whether the indices of periodontal health differed for the teenagers by experimental conditions.

After unlocking of solar panel (while in orbit), rotation bracket turns towards ready-to-work position under the action of driving spring. During deployment, once reached the required operating angle (defined by power subsystem engineer), the rotation bracket collides with the <b>fixed</b> <b>bracket</b> that is mounted on body of the satellite, to stop rotation. Due {{to the effect of}} collision force that may alter the {{rotation mechanism}} function, design of centrifugal brake is essential. At stoppage moment micro-switches activate final position sensor and a stopper locks the rotation bracket. Design of spring and centrifugal brake components, static finite element stress analysis of primary structure body of rotation mechanism at stoppage moment have been obtained. Last, reliability analysis of rotation mechanism is evaluated. The benefit {{of this study is to}} aid in the design of rotation mechanism that can be used in micro-satellite applications.

40|$|Purpose: The {{demands of}} an all {{esthetic}} fixed orthodontic appliance system are ever increasing in today 2 ̆ 7 s world. Frictional values of an esthetic, fixed orthodontic appliance system {{are needed to}} evaluate their clinical effectiveness for orthodontic treatment. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate the frictional values of various esthetic orthodontic archwires ligated to an esthetic orthodontic bracket. Methods: Three types of stainless steel and nickel titanium alloy (niti) esthetic orthodontic archwires (epoxy, poly, plastic) in four sizes (. 016,. 018,. 017 x. 025,. 019 x. 025 inches) were ligated to both a stainless steel bracket system and a ceramic (esthetic) bracket system and pulled by a Universal testing machine for 90 seconds. Two types of control wires were also tested (stainless steel, niti). Each of these wires was tested 10 times. The mean frictional values were recorded for each wire in pounds. An ANOVA analysis was done to compare frictional differences between the different esthetic <b>fixed</b> <b>bracket</b> systems and a T-test was done to compare the frictional differences between wires tested in stainless steel brackets and those tested in ceramic brackets. Thickness of each of the esthetic archwires was measured with digital calipers and the means recorded. Results: Of the 14 groups tested using the ANOVA, only 1 was not significant. Of the 13 statistically significant groups, all but 4 of those groups showed that the non-coated archwires systems had increased frictional values. Of the 28 t-tests done to compare frictional differences between archwires tested with stainless steel brackets and those tested with ceramic brackets, 22 were statistically significant. In the 22 significant groups, all but three showed a statistically significant increase in friction in wires tested using ceramic brackets. Of the three types of esthetic archwires measured, the Poly coated archwire had a mean thickness of. 001 inches greater than that of the Epoxy and Plastic coated archwires Conclusions: The non-coated (non-esthetic) archwires had significantly more friction than the coated (esthetic) archwires except for the. 016 Niti Plastic Coated Archwire and. 018 SS Epoxy Coated Archwire. All rectangular coated archwires had less friction than the non-coated controls. The coated (esthetic) archwires pulled through a ceramic (esthetic) bracket system all had significantly greater friction than those pulled through a stainless steel bracket system except for the. 018 Niti Epoxy archwire. The Poly coated archwires had the most friction of the esthetically coated archwires while pulled through a passive arch bracket system. The. 001 inch increase in diameter thickness of the Poly coated archwires was most likely the cause of the increased friction...|$|E

Material and methods: During the years 2012 – 2013, 50 teenagers aged 10 – 18 years with similar initial orthodontic conditions participated in this trial in a university clinic in northern Italy.

40|$|In {{the field}} of orthodontics, the use of Removable Thermoplastic Appliances (RTAs) to treat {{moderate}} malocclusion problems is progressively replacing traditional <b>fixed</b> <b>brackets.</b> Generally, these orthodontic devices are designed {{on the basis of}} individual anatomies and customised requirements. However, many elements may affect the effectiveness of a RTA-based therapy: accuracies of anatomical reference models, clinical treatment strategies, shape features and mechanical properties of the appliances. In this paper, a numerical model for customised orthodontic treatments planning is proposed by means of the finite element method. The model integrates individual patient’s teeth, periodontal ligaments, bone tissue with structural and geometrical attributes of the appliances. The anatomical tissues are reconstructed by a multi-modality imaging technique, which combines 3 D data obtained by an optical scanner (visible tissues) and a computerised tomography system (internal tissues). The mechanical interactions between anatomical shapes and appliance models are simulated through finite element analyses. The numerical approach allows a dental technician to predict how the RTA attributes affect tooth movements.
