25|$|The {{economy of}} Cleve is heavily tied to agriculture, and {{therefore}} rainfall. The most common {{products of the}} areas farms are grain {{of a number of}} cereal crops and wool from sheep. Due to Cleve having such a low rainfall, <b>dryland</b> <b>farming</b> techniques have been applied with success, and the town school integrates the techniques in agriculture courses.|$|E

50|$|In India's <b>drylands,</b> ley <b>farming</b> {{is used as}} a way {{to restore}} soil fertility. It {{involves}} rotations of grasses and food grains in a specific area.

Structurally related physical properties and biological processes of soil often change when different cropping systems, tillage, or management practices are used. Soil fertility can be increased and maintained by enhancing the natural soil biological processes. Farming provides balanced nutrition for sustainable production through continuous turnover of organic matter in the soil.|$|R
40|$|This study {{estimates}} {{the vulnerability of}} Latin American agriculture to climate change using a Ricardian analysis of both land values and net revenues. Examining a sample of over 2, 500 farms in seven countries, the results indicate both land value and net revenue are sensitive to climate. Both small farms and large farms have a hill-shaped relationship with temperature. Estimating separate regressions for <b>dryland</b> and irrigated <b>farms</b> reveals that <b>dryland</b> <b>farms</b> are more sensitive to temperature but irrigated farms are more sensitive to precipitation. Examining the effects from future climate change scenarios reveals thatsevere scenarios could reduce farm earnings {{by as much as}} 62 percent by 2100, whereas more moderate scenarios could reduce earnings by about 15 percent. Small and large farms are equally sensitive to global warming. Land value and net revenue analyses produce quite similar results.

However, the agriculture sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood. About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated wetlands, <b>dryland</b> <b>farming</b> areas, etc., are included. Because {{more than half of}} these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Barossa Valley makes {{extensive}} use of irrigation to supplement the region's low rainfall supply during the growing season. However, concerns about water supply in the late 20th and early 21st century {{led to the development}} of strict regulations on the numbers and locations of irrigation boreholes as well as the amount of water that can be used by vineyards. Some of the region's oldest vineyards, especially those on the slightly cooler west side of the valley, practice <b>dryland</b> <b>farming.</b> The increased water stress of the practice, coupled with the naturally reduced yields of old vines, tends to produce the most deeply concentrated grapes in the valley which often go into the Barossa Valley 's most expensive and sought after wines.

Among the Montezuma Hills are a number of intermittent drainage swales that flow during winter months; otherwise the monotypic <b>dryland</b> <b>farms</b> support even less diversity of wildlife than more agriculturally diverse land uses to the north. Exceptions to the dearth of wildlife are the considerable populations of ground squirrels and other small rodents, which populations in turn support modest numbers of raptors.

Moderate numbers of avian nests have been documented in the Montezuma Hills including red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and historic nests of the golden eagle.|$|R

50|$|From an {{economic}} standpoint, Carmona was a primarily agricultural town and undoubtedly rich in this aspect. Although {{the lands of}} the surrounding floodplain, (la vega de Carmona) were known for producing abundant wheat crops, there were occasional famines and local shortages.

To this was added the circumstance that many of the area's <b>dryland</b> <b>farms</b> belonged to people outside Carmona, their production destined for international trade. To deal with these food crises, pósitos, or municipal granaries, were created to serve as a sort of deposit bank of grain to aid farmers in need.

2500|$|The Dust Bowl, {{also known}} as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and {{agriculture}} of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply <b>dryland</b> <b>farming</b> methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939–1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years. With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. [...] The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small gasoline tractors, and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10 inches (250mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.|$|E
