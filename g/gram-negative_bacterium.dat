5|$|H. pylori is a helix-shaped (classified as {{a curved}} rod, not spirochaete) <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> about 3μm long with a {{diameter}} of about 0.5μm. H. pylori can be demonstrated in tissue by Gram stain, Giemsa stain, haematoxylin–eosin stain, Warthin–Starry silver stain, acridine orange stain, and phase-contrast microscopy. It is capable of forming biofilms and can convert from spiral to a possibly viable but nonculturable coccoid form.|$|E
5|$|The {{diseases}} and parasites that affect octopuses have been little studied, but cephalopods {{are known to}} be the intermediate or final hosts of various parasitic cestodes, nematodes and copepods; 150 species of protistan and metazoan parasites have been recognised. The Dicyemidae are a family of tiny worms that are found in the renal appendages of many species; it is unclear whether they are parasitic or are endosymbionts. Coccidians in the genusAggregata living in the gut cause severe disease to the host. Octopuses have an innate immune system, and the haemocytes respond to infection by phagocytosis, encapsulation, infiltration or cytotoxic activities to destroy or isolate the pathogens. The haemocytes {{play an important role in}} the recognition and elimination of foreign bodies and wound repair. Captive animals have been found to be more susceptible to pathogens than wild ones. A <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Vibrio lentus, has been found to cause skin lesions, exposure of muscle and death of octopuses in extreme cases.|$|E

50|$|A 2002 {{study showed}} that Chlorella cell walls contain lipopolysaccharides, {{endotoxins}} found in <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> that affect {{the immune system and}} may cause inflammation. However, more recent studies have found that the lipopolysaccharides in organisms other than <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria,</b> for example in cyanobacteria, are considerably different from the lipopolysaccharides in <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> A 2010 study found that Chlorella contains a peptide, known as Chlorella-11, that actually inhibits the inflammation caused by lipopolysaccharides from <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> {{are spread}} worldwide, in {{virtually}} all environments that support life. The <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> include the model organism Escherichia coli, {{as well as many}} pathogenic bacteria, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Yersinia pestis. Several classes of antibiotics target <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> specifically, including aminoglycosides and carbapenems.|$|R
40|$|Multidrug-resistant <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> are an {{emerging}} problem. The present article addresses 2 relevant questions: (1) should active surveillance be performed to identify patients colonized with multidrug-resistant <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and (2) should contact isolation precautions {{be taken with}} patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria?</b> Data and variables that are needed to scientifically answer these questions are reviewed, as are existing data on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species in particular), and Acinetobacter baumannii. Multidrug-resistant <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> are an emerg-ing problem that infection control practitioners, hospital epidemiologists, clinicians, and hospital administrators are struggling to control. The National Nosocomial In-fections Surveillance System has reported that the prev-alence of multidrug-resistant <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> is increasing.

25|$|This {{family is}} also known as Ptx and {{contains}} the toxin responsible for whooping cough. Pertussis toxin is secreted by the <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium,</b> Bordetella pertussis. Whooping cough is very contagious and cases are slowly increasing in the United States despite vaccination. Symptoms include paroxysmal cough with whooping and even vomiting. The bacterium Bordetella pertussis was first identified as the cause of whooping cough and isolated by Jules Bordet and Octave Gengou in France in 1900.|$|E

40|$|Today’s medical world {{encompasses}} {{an environment}} in which <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> that once were defeated with common antibiotics, have now become resistant. <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> like Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter, and Acinetobacter are pathogens that are an emerging threat causing sepsis due to multidrug-resistance (Pop-Vicas 2 ̆ 6 Opal, 2014, p. 189). The multidrug-resistance mechanisms of <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> coupled with a patient population commonly seen in hospital settings, that consist of immunocompromised adults due to advancing age, comorbidities (e. g. AIDS, history of transplants, diabetes, and chemotherapy), and immunotherapies, create an environment for advanced infection or sepsis to take place. Complications of multidrug-resistant <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> can cause infection and ultimately sepsis in the host. <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> with multidrug-resistance has caused a rise in hospital admissions across The United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2014), reported that between the years of 2000 and 2008 the number of patients admitted with sepsis increased from 621, 000 to 1, 141, 000 respectively. This increase in hospital admissions has resulted in sepsis being the most expensive medical condition since 2011 with a cumulative cost of over 20. 3 billion (Chong et al., 2015, p. 111). The topic of <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> and sepsis was chosen due to the medical challenge presented to healthcare providers and the high mortality rates associated with <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> Traditional management and treatment of sepsis resulting from <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> is no longer effective and healthcare providers are having to update and modify current sepsis protocols to fight the infection...|$|R
25|$|In Helycobacter pylori, a spriral-shaped <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium,</b> the filamentation {{mechanism}} {{are regulated}} by two mechanisms: the peptidases that cause peptidoglycan relaxation and the coiled-coil-rich proteins (Ccrp) {{that are responsible}} for the helical cell shape in vitro as well as in vivo. A rod shape could have probably an advantage for motility than the regular helical shape. In this model, there is another protein Mre, which is not exactly involved in the maintenance of cell shape but in the cell cycle. It has been demotrated that mutant cells were highly elongated due to a delay in cell division and contained non-segregated chromosomes.|$|E
2500|$|Neisseria meningitidis, often {{referred}} to as meningococcus, is a <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacterium</b> that can cause meningitis and other forms of meningococcal disease such as meningococcemia, a life-threatening sepsis. The bacterium is referred to as a coccus because it is round, and more specifically, diplococcus because of its tendency to form pairs. About 10% of adults are carriers of the bacteria in their nasopharynx. As an exclusively human pathogen it is the main cause of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults, causing developmental impairment and death in about 10% of cases. It causes the only form of bacterial meningitis known to occur epidemically, mainly Africa and Asia. It occurs worldwide in both epidemic [...] and endemic form.|$|E

40|$|The {{bacterial}} flora {{of the skin}} from five anatomical sites on 10 leukemia patients, 10 patients with malignant melanoma, and a control group of 10 medical personnel was examined quantitatively and qualitatively. This was done to determine whether malignant disease results in changes in skin flora and to establish carrier rates of <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> on the skin of personnel in hospital environments. <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> were isolated more frequently (74 isolates from 100 cultures) from the skin of leukemia patients than from either patients with malignant melanoma (8 isolates from 100 cultures) or the medical personnel (9 isolates from 100 cultures). Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated exclusively from leukemia patients. Relative proportions of <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> in total populations were determined. The axilla was the only site with a uniformly high proportion of <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria.</b> From all other sites cultured, gram-negative populations were low (1 to 5 bacteria/cm 2 of skin), although {{a high proportion of}} gram-negative populations occurred randomly throughout all subject groups. It was concluded that leukemia patients tend to carry <b>gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> on the skin.

50|$|Scientists have {{hypothesized}} that enzymes {{involved in the}} riboflavin biosynthesis pathway, including riboflavin synthase, {{can be used to}} develop antibacterial drugs in order to treat infections caused by <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> and yeasts. This hypothesis is based on the inability of <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria,</b> such as E. coli and S. typhimurium, to uptake riboflavin from the external environment. As <b>Gram-negative</b> <b>bacteria</b> need to produce their own riboflavin, inhibiting riboflavin synthase or other enzymes involved in the pathway may be useful tools in developing antibacterial drugs.|$|R
