5|$|Bergonzoli {{knew that}} if Bardia and Tobruk <b>held</b> <b>out,</b> <b>a</b> British advance further into Libya {{eventually}} must falter under the logistical difficulties of maintaining a desert force using an extended overland supply line. Not knowing how long he had to hold out, Bergonzoli was forced to ration his stocks {{of food and water}} so that O'Connor could not simply starve him out. Consequently, hunger and thirst adversely affected the morale of the Italian defenders that had already been shaken by the defeat at Sidi Barrani. So too did medical conditions undermine morale, particularly lice and dysentery, the results of poor sanitation.|$|E
5|$|The end came swiftly in {{the months}} after the Grey Cup. By the time of a December 1 CFL Board of Governors meeting, the Mad Dogs had already folded and the Barracudas were on the brink. The Pirates <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> little longer and flirted with a {{relocation}} to Norfolk, but local officials broke off talks after they learned that Glieberman was still facing legal disputes in Shreveport. The Barracudas resurfaced in the news in January 1996 when Williams sold them for $750,000 to a group that planned to move them to Shreveport as a replacement for the Pirates. However, that deal was contingent upon the league approving the sale and relocation, which never happened.|$|E
5|$|Late in Friday's {{first season}} in Wales, Cardiff took on Luton Town on 16 April 1977. Cardiff {{were in the}} relegation zone and had not won in seven games, while Luton were fifth in the table and {{challenging}} for promotion. After clashing repeatedly early in the match with Luton goalkeeper Milija Aleksic, Friday was lectured by the referee for a high tackle on the goalkeeper in the 36th minute. Friday <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> hand to apologise, but Aleksic reacted angrily. When the free kick was taken, Friday ran back, stole the ball from Luton defender John Faulkner, broke away, rounded Aleksic and slotted the ball past him into the net. In celebration, Friday jogged back past the goalkeeper while giving him the V-sign. Cardiff won the match 4–2 {{and at the end}} of the season avoided relegation to the third tier only on goal difference. Meanwhile, without Friday, Reading were relegated back to the Fourth Division by one point. Friday's actions became even stranger during his time at Cardiff; after they lost the second leg of the Welsh Cup final 3–0 to Shrewsbury Town on 18 May 1977, the players and staff were awoken in the middle of the night by loud bangs coming from below their rooms. The cause was found to be Friday, standing on the hotel's snooker table in his underpants and throwing the balls around the room in fury.|$|E

25|$|In Norse mythology, after Loki tricked {{the blind}} god Höðr into killing his brother Baldr, Loki jumped into a river and {{transformed}} {{himself into a}} salmon to escape punishment from the other gods.

25|$|Like young {{children}} most of Genie's first words were monosyllabic consonant-vowel-(consonant) sequences, usually consisting of an unaspirated Bilabial stop or dental stop and a monophthong. But while most children's first disyllabic words also follow this pattern, hers had both consonant-vowel and vowel-consonant sequences. Unusually, {{from the very}} first disyllabic words Genie more fully articulated, except when referring to herself by her (real) name she immediately demonstrated proper stress patterns. For approximately two years the length of time she <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> vowel was her only stress indicator, and during that time was very exaggerated. People unfamiliar with her speech said she sounded either like a deaf child or someone with cerebral palsy, although trained speech pathologists only said the latter.|$|E
25|$|Allan Border {{would have}} still <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> faint hope of victory {{on the morning}} of day five, but it seemed unlikely. Fraser failed to add to his {{overnight}} score and was run out for 12 soon after the resumption. Emburey and Graham Dilley added 30 for the ninth wicket, much to the frustration of the Australians before Emburey fell for a well made 26 to a sharp chance taken by David Boon off Lawson. If the ninth wicket stand of 30 had frustrated the Australian bowlers the 10th wicket partnership of 27 between Dilley and Paul Jarvis was just annoying, and made an Australian victory all but impossible. Alderman finally trapped Jarivs LBW with what was fast becoming his trademark of the series, the inswinging yorker, but England had struggled to 242, which although a disappointing score, had dragged out their innings long enough to avoid the follow-on and not leave the Australians with enough time for victory.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Arab Revolt, Ahmed Bey {{had been}} made the {{commander}} of Ottoman forces in Tā'if. He had under him a force of 3,000 soldiers and 10 guns of the mountain artillery. Ghalib Pasha, {{the governor of the}} Hejaz was also present in the city. In 1916, the Hashemites launched their revolt against the Ottoman Empire in Mecca in June. That city had fallen and then in July, Abdullah, the eldest son of the Hashemite leader and Sharif of Mecca Husayn ibn Ali, was sent with seventy men to Tā'if. Whilst his activities in the area aroused the suspicion of Ahmed Bey, Ghalib Pasha was unconcerned by so small a force. Abdullah secretly built up his army to 5,000 men. He then cut the telegraph wires to the city and then went on the attack. All Hashemite assaults on the city were repelled by the mountain guns, and both sides settled down to an uneasy siege. However, Hashemite guns were slowly brought up to Tā'if, and then the city <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> little longer; it finally surrendered on 22 September. The city thus later became a part of the self-proclaimed Hashemite Kingdom of Hejaz.|$|E

Jagger hosted the season finale of Saturday Night Live on 19 and 20 May 2012, doing several comic skits and playing some Rolling Stones' hits with Arcade Fire, Foo Fighters, and Jeff Beck.|$|E
500|$|Fresh battalions of the New Zealand Division leap-frogged {{through the}} battalions which had {{attacked}} earlier, advancing {{either side of}} Messines, where some German posts still <b>held</b> <b>out.</b> <b>A</b> German artillery headquarters at Blauwen Molen (blue windmill), [...] beyond Messines, was captured and a tank broke into a strong point at Fanny's Farm, causing a hundred Germans to surrender. The reserve brigade of the 25th Division continued the advance to the north except at Lumm Farm, which was eventually taken with assistance from the right flank troops of the 36th (Ulster) Division. Helped by two tanks, {{the rest of the}} 36th (Ulster) Division advanced to the right of Wytschaete village and captured a German battalion headquarters. Wytschaete had been fortified like Messines but special bombardments fired on 3 June had demolished the village. Two battalions of the 16th (Irish) Division overran the German survivors and on the left, the reserve brigade of the 19th Division took the area from Wytschaete village to Oosttaverne Wood with little resistance.|$|E

500|$|Best {{decided to}} leave show business, {{and by the time}} of Hunter Davies' {{authorised}} Beatles' biography in 1968, he was not willing to talk about his Beatles association. Years later he stated in his autobiography, [...] "the Beatles themselves certainly never <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> helping hand and only contributed to the destruction with their readily printed gossip that I had never really been a Beatle, that I didn't smile, that I was unsociable and definitely not a good mixer. There was not a single friendly word from any one of them". This culminated in a Beatles' interview published in Playboy magazine in February 1965 in which Lennon stated that [...] "Ringo used to fill in sometimes if our drummer was ill. With his periodic illness." [...] Starr added: [...] "He took little pills to make him ill." [...] Best sued the Beatles for defamation of character, eventually winning an out-of-court settlement for much less than the $18 million he had sought.|$|E

Anthony Birley, Marcus' modern biographer, detects a hint of sexual tension in Marcus' writings on the mistress. Marcus was grateful {{that he did not have}} to live with her longer than he did. Marcus thanks the gods that he did not lose his virginity before its due time, and even <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> bit longer. He is proud that he did not indulge himself with Benedicta or Theodotus (household slaves, presumably).|$|E

2500|$|On 3 November 1969 President Richard M. Nixon made a {{televised}} speech laying out his policy toward Vietnam. He promised {{to continue to}} support the South Vietnamese government (through Vietnamization) and <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> plan for the withdrawal of American combat troops. This [...] "silent majority" [...] speech, not the Tet Offensive, marked the real watershed of the American involvement. In it, Nixon permanently altered {{the nature of the}} issue. [...] "No longer was the question whether the United States was going to get out, but rather how and how fast." [...] Nixon's policy toward the media was to reduce as far as possible the American public's interest in and knowledge of the war in Vietnam. He began by sharply limiting the press's access to information within Vietnam itself.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{encounter}} {{between the two}} sides was between the vanguard of the British force and a picket guard consisting of a sergeant and his squad. [...] The picket engaged the British, but was quickly overwhelmed by the horsemen and captured. [...] The British cavalry then rode on toward the house, where Captain Roberts and his company had already arrived and taken up a position on the house's right. [...] After exchange fire at long range, the cavalry halted to wait for the infantry, which arrived {{at about the same time}} as Captain-Lieutenant Farley's company; the companies of Stoddard and Cooper did not arrive in time to participate. [...] A hot fire then began between the three American companies and the British force which lasted about 15 minutes. [...] The numerically superior British flanked the Americans and successfully occupied the orchard that was behind the house. [...] Roberts was mortally wounded, and the American line broke, with some men fleeing into the house, while others tried to escape into the countryside. [...] The men in the house <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> little longer, but the British infantry forced their way in and captured the surviving occupants, while the cavalry chased down stragglers outside.|$|E

2500|$|Susenyos at last {{announced}} his conversion to Catholicism {{in a public}} ceremony in 1622, and separated himself from all of his wives and concubines except for his first wife, Wäld Śäʿala. However, the tolerant and sensitive Pedro Páez died soon afterwards, and he was replaced by Afonso Mendes, who arrived at Massawa on 24 January 1624. E. A. Wallis Budge has stated the commonly accepted opinion of this man, as being [...] "rigid, uncompromising, narrow-minded, and intolerant." [...] Strife and rebellions over the enforced changes began within days of Mendes' public ceremony in 1626, where he proclaimed the primacy of Rome and condemned local practices which included Saturday Sabbath and frequent fasts. Yet a number of Ethiopians did embrace the new faith: Richard Pankhurst reports 100,000 inhabitants of Dembiya and Wegera alone {{are said to have}} converted to Catholicism. The most serious response was launched by a triumvirate composed of his half-brother Yimena Krestos, a eunuch named Kefla Wahad, and his brother-in-law Julius. Susenyos avoided their first attempt to assassinate him at court, but while he was campaigning against Sennar they raised a revolt, calling to their side [...] "all those who were friends to the Alexandrian faith". However, Susenyos had returned to Dembiya before the rebels expected, and quickly killed Julius. Yimena Krestos <b>held</b> <b>out</b> <b>a</b> while longer on Melka Amba in Gojjam, before Af Krestos captured him and brought him to Dankaz where Susenyos had his camp; here the Emperor's brother was tried and sentenced to banishment.|$|E
