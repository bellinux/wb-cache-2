2500|$|The LFA's {{engineers}} {{selected a}} V10 engine over an equivalent displacement V8 engine {{for its ability}} to rev higher, and over a V12 for its lower reciprocating mass, allowing for more rapid engine response.

This necessitated the use of a <b>digital</b> <b>tachometer</b> which can instantly display engine speed. The engine reportedly weighs less than the manufacturer's own 3.5-liter 2GR-FE V6 engine.

2500|$|Starting {{with the}} 1977 models, all VAM Gremlins were {{powered by the}} [...] I6 {{regardless}} of trim level. The exterior featured the shorter new front end clip and rear end treatment as did the U.S. models. The 1977 Gremlin X model included a new <b>digital</b> <b>tachometer</b> and three-point retractable seatbelts, {{as well as new}} in-house VAM designs for the seats. The sporty side decal was slightly revised {{and for the most part}} was the same as the year before. The seatbelts on the base Gremlin were also changed to three-point units, which were fixed and lacked retractable mechanisms. The option list was expanded with the possibility of ordering a factory air conditioning system for the first time in the VAM line, which was available only in the X model. The previously optional dealership-offered universal air conditioning system remained available for the base model. The VAM Gremlin X (along with the 1977-1979 American ECD, Concord DL four-door equivalent) would be the only VAM car with the 258 six engine to be available with a factory air conditioning system, as all other VAM models with it would be 282 cu in units.

40|$|Since the {{photoelectric}} pickups which generate 6000 pulses for {{one revolution}} {{have been on}} the market, greater accuracy of low-speed measurements has been obtained using <b>digital</b> <b>tachometers.</b> 　The photoelectric tachometer which employs a magnetic core having very sharp saturation characteristic has recently been utilized as a method of detecting the rotating speed of moters. 　In case that the first stage magnetic amplifier which acts as a pulse-width modulator is controlled by the output of photoelectric tachometer using this core, if the pulse voltage is applied directly to the magnetic amplifier under moderate consideration, the gate output pulse-width of the first stage circuit varies in proportion to the rotating speed, while the second stage circuit acts as an analog memory element. It is possible to convert the variation of very low rotating speed into the difference of pulse-width; to detect high-sensitively rotating acceleration if the difference between the gate pulse-widths of the first and the second stages is detected. In addition, since the magnetic amplifier has inherently a half-cycle dead time, a fast-response magnetic amplifier can be realized...|$|R

While being mechanically identical, they were differentiated by the available options; tire size, wheel size, and body trim. The P-type had fiberglass fender flares over the wheel wells, while the L-type did not. The P-type was also standard with the more sporty eight-way adjustable seats. The P-type {{did not get the}} option of a leather interior until 1983. All editions of the P-type had the same 14x7-inch aluminum alloy wheels and throughout the years the L-type had 14x5.5-inch wheels until 1985 when they were changed to a P-type styled 15x6. The L-type also had the option of a digital dash with trip computer; some Canadian models had this option as well as a few rare instances of American models.

2500|$|As the 1977 models arrived, the {{engineering}} upgrades {{seen on the}} 258 six the year before finally saw {{the light on the}} 282. An all-new head design with Quench-type combustion chambers took compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity.

With the second method usually recommended in high speed range, pulses coming from an encoder are counted in a fixed period of time. In this paper it will be proved that using an FPGA circuit, working at the right frequency, the first method of speed measuring can be adequate for all speed range. The <b>digital</b> <b>tachometer</b> will be implemented into XC 3 S 200 FPGA circuit and {{will be used for}} closing the velocity loop for a brushless DC motor. 1...|$|E
5000|$|GLX: 1294cc G1A, 1360cc TU3, and 1580cc XU5 engines, {{all with}} 5 speed {{gearboxes}} and all with 5-doors. Standard equipment includes a <b>digital</b> clock, a <b>tachometer,</b> a sliding glass moonroof, sports style seats (similar to those fitted to the 205 XS), rear wash/wipe, door bump strips, intermittent wipe, {{and a small}} boot spoiler. The 1.6 model also added central locking and front electric windows to the list. Post facelift 1.3 models and the 1.4 model also have central locking. Curiously, if the GLX was ordered in white, and later burgundy red, the bumpers were body coloured, with a contrasting trim strip, red with the white bumpers and silver with the burgundy ones. After the facelift the bumpers also gained a pair of fog lights. A reflective strip panel was also on the options list, that replaced the louvred panel that sits between the rear lights.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} our work, which is doing an energy audit on {{alternator}}’s current output and battery’s voltage based on alternator speed. Up until today, {{the demand for}} power in automobile is ever increasing. As technology advances, more and more electrical devices were produced and being installed in vehicles. To cope with the demand, alternator has been designed and modified {{so that it can}} produce enough power. This research is to study the effect of alternator speed to the charging system. The car used in this experiment is Proton Preve 1. 6 Manual. In both ISO 8854 and SAE J 56, alternator testing and labelling standards indicate that the rated output an alternator is the amount of current that it is capable of producing at 6, 000 RPM. Three different constant speed of engine which is 750 RPM as idle speed, 1500 RPM and 3000 RPM as cruise speed were taken as parameter. The speed of the alternator was measured using <b>tachometer,</b> <b>digital</b> multi-meter was used to measure battery’s voltage, and AC/DC Clamp was used to measure alternator current output. The result shows that the faster the alternator spin, the more power it can produce. And when there is more power, the faster the charging rate of the battery...|$|R
5000|$|The second {{generation}} Vigor also benefited from Honda deciding to employ double-wishbones {{at both the}} front and rear ends—a layout that spread to other Honda products in subsequent years. While more expensive than competitors' MacPherson strut systems, this setup provided better stability and sharper handling for the vehicle. All had front sway bars and upper models had rear sway bars as well. Brakes were either small 4-wheel discs with twin-piston calipers (only available on the JDM 2.0-Si model [...] ), larger 4-wheel discs with single piston calipers, or a front disc/rear drum system. ABS was available as an option on the 4-wheel disc brake models. Base model Vigors rode on 13-inch steel wheels with hubcaps with more expensive models having the option of 14-inch alloy wheels. As established with the first generation car, the luxury content was also extensive in comparison to luxury equipment available from competitors at the time. Some of the items on the top level 2.0Si included a power tinted glass moonroof, optional four-wheel anti-lock brakes, optional coloured LCD <b>digital</b> instruments (speedometer, <b>tachometer,</b> fuel gauge and engine temperature), tilt steering with speed sensitive power steering, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, electronic AM/FM stereo radio with cassette and 4 speakers (high power) with subwoofer and amplifier, intermittent front wipers (variable), 4-Wheel disc brakes (front: 2 piston calipers with ventilated front discs), and optional leather interior.|$|R
