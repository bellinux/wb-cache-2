40|$|NOTE: Text or symbols not renderable {{in plain}} ASCII are {{indicated}} by [ [...] . ]. Abstract is included in. pdf document. During {{the summer and}} fall of 1958, 38 pairs of simultaneous measurements of cosmic ray ionization in the atmosphere were made with <b>integrating</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> carried to high altitudes by balloons, and accompanied by barometric sensors. One of each pair of measurements was made at a base station and the other at a roving station which released balloons at a set of different geomagnetic latitudes ranging from 87 °N to 79 °S. The base station data exhibit variations with time corresponding to changes in the primary flux. The effects of the time variations upon the roving station measurements are partially removed with the aid of the base station data leaving the ionization as a function of latitude only. The symmetry of the geomagnetic field in the northern and southern hemispheres is studied by means of the latter data. By assuming a charge spectrum, the differential rigidity spectrum of primary cosmic rays in 1958 is calculated from the ionization as a function of latitude by means of geomagnetic theory. The corresponding integral spectrum shows that [ [...] . ](> 0. 6 Bv) = 0. 107 particles/cm(2) sec sterad, [ [...] . ](> 16 Bv) 0. 012 particles/cm(2) sec sterad. A primary rigidity spectrum is calculated from similar data taken by Neher, et al. in 1954. The ionization at Thule, Greenland, from 1951 - 1960 is presented. These data show the inverse correlation between cosmic ray intensity and sunspot number, and suggest that the intensity modulation lags the sunspot number by about 6 months...|$|R
40|$|Aims: This study {{investigates the}} impact of cine {{acquisition}} mode on the dosimetric characteristics of a Varian aS 500 amorphous silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID). Materials and Methods: The performance of an a-Si EPID operated in cine mode was assessed and compared to its performance when operated in an integrated mode and dose measurements using an <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> This study was conducted at different photon energies and the EPID performance was assessed as function of the delivered dose, dose rate, multileaf collimator speed, field size, phantom thickness, and intensity-modulated radiation therapy fields. Results: The worst nonlinearity was observed at low monitor unit (MU) settings &lt; 100 MU with the highest dose per frame. The nonlinearity of response at a low MU setting was attributed due {{to the loss of}} four cine images during each delivery. The EPID response with changing dose rate for 10 MU delivered had similar results to its performance in an <b>integrated</b> mode and <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> Despite the nonlinearity of response with low MU delivered, EPID performance operated in cine and integrated acquisition modes had comparable responses within 2 %. Conclusions: For EPID dosimetry application using cine mode, this study recommends the calibration of the EPID images to be undertaken at a large MU. There were no additional corrections that were required when the EPID operated in cine acquisition mode as compared to calibration in integrated mode...|$|R

In addition to the Van Allen inner zone and the great outer zone, a stable and distinct intermediate zone was detected throughout August and September 1959. The outer-zone intensity showed a large decrease following the sudden commencement of a geomagnetic storm. Later in the storm the outer zone increased to much in excess of its prestorm level. During stable periods the outer zone was fairly constant and less intense {{than it had been}} observed to be with Pioneer III or Pioneer IV or the first Soviet cosmic rocket.

In the present investigation, the relative response of 17 cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was evaluated at three proton beam qualities: at two points in a modulated beam and one point in a non-modulated beam, all with an incident energy of 75 MeV. Thirteen of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> had a Farmer-type geometry but consisted of different combinations of wall and central electrode materials. All <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> were calibrated in terms of air kerma as well as in terms of absorbed dose to water in a Co- 60 beam. The relative response of the <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> was compared with results of Monte Carlo simulations of proton and secondary electron transport in the phantom and the <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber</b> geometry. The results of the measurements for cylindrical <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> show relative perturbation effects that are limited to 0. 5 - 1 %, resulting in perturbation correction factors that are larger than unity compared with an NE 2571 <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> The experimental relative wall and total perturbation correction factors agree with Monte Carlo calculated values, indicating that the differences between the responses of different <b>ionization</b> <b>chambers</b> are due to secondary electron effects, This conclusion is supported by the comparison of our results with those from other investigators after re-analysis of their data.

A determination of absolute cosmic-ray ionization at balloon altitudes {{has been made}} using an <b>integrating</b> <b>ionization</b> <b>chamber.</b> It was filled to 1 atm with argon, and was calibrated to give ionization in the argon. The ionization produced by nuclear particles in 5 charge groups, electrons, [ [...] . ], and stars was computed between 10 and 140 gm cm[superscript - 2] to form a basis for estimating the wall effect and recombination. The important corrections for wall effect were from stars and low-energy electrons. A 1. 4 [+ or -] 1. 7 % effect was estimated, the ionization being less without the wall. Recombination was investigated and found negligible in the 1 -atm chamber. The resulting ionization in argon was converted to ionization in air {{on the basis of}} the relative ionization by charged particles in the two gases. The relative ionization of 340 -Mev protons, from cyclotron experiments, was corrected by energy loss theory to give the relative ionization of particles with cosmic-ray velocities. The final result was that ionization values obtained with the existing calibration should be multiplied by 1. 049 [+ or -] 0. 031 to obtain the correct ionization, from 7 - 140 gm cm[superscript - 2] depth.
