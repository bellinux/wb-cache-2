40|$|AbstractWide spread use of {{biometric}} based authentication {{implies the}} need to secure biometric reference data. Various template protection schemes have been introduced to prevent biometric forgery and <b>identity</b> <b>thefts.</b> Cancelable biometrics is a recent approach introduced to address the concerns regarding privacy of biometric data, public confidence, and acceptance of biometric systems. It allows biometric templates to be cancelled and revoked like passwords innumerable times. The work proposes a novel cancelable biometric template generation algorithm using Gaussian random vectors and one way modulus hashing. Instead of using the original templates, the proposed system uses its transformed versions for storing and matching. The approach is tested on face and palmprint biometric modalities. A thorough analysis is performed to analyze the performance, non-invertibility, and distinctiveness of the proposed approach which reveals that the generated templates are non-invertible, easy to revoke, and also deliver good performance...|$|R

40|$|While {{cybercrime}} {{has existed}} {{for many years and}} is still reported to be a growing problem, reliable estimates of the economic impacts are rare. We develop a survey instrument tailored to measure the costs of consumer-facing cybercrime systematically, by aggregating different cost factors into direct losses and expenses for protection measures. We use our instrument to collect representative primary data on the prevalence of seven different types of consumer-facing cybercrime in six European countries. Our results show that cybercrime rather causes losses of time than money and that the losses of victims are dwarfed by the expenses for preventive protection. We identify scams to be the worst type of cybercrime in terms of losses. While <b>identity</b> <b>thefts</b> associated with financial accounts cause high initial losses for the victims, most of them receive substantial compensation. We find that loss distributions are skewed to the left, bearing the risk of overestimating costs when looking at figures summarized by the arithmetic mean. Policy, Organisation Law and Gamin...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} years, global access to {{information}} has become available at all time through different network architectures and computers for an ever-changing target of employees, suppliers, and clients. In thissense, Internet has been defining the latest trends for the online companies and their customers. Together {{with the growth of}} the role that Internet plays in the continuous extending of the online environment as a potential for business, also increased the chances of online malicious attacks and intrusions. They all have at their basis the stealing of user’s identity. User names and passwords areweak and can always be cracked with a little effort from the attacker's side. Users credentials can be phished, stolen, discovered and hacked in multiple ways. In order to contra-attack the new growingthreats, efficient, rapid and reliable means for an automatic recognition of the identity of online users are being developed. Biometric security systems enable more secure authentication methods to access a computer's resources.

40|$|In {{the smart}} grid, an {{integrated}} distributed authen- tication protocol {{is needed to}} not only securely manage the system but also efficiently authenticate many different entities for the communications. In addition, a lightweight authentication protocol is required to handle frequent authentications among billions of devices. Unfortunately, in the literature, {{there is no such}} integrated protocol that provides mutual authentication among the home environment, energy provider, gateways, and advanced metering infrastructure network. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a lightweight cloud-trusted authorities-based integrated (centrally controlled) distributed authentication protocol that provides mutual authentications among communicated entities in a distributed manner. Based on certificateless cryptosystem, our protocol is lightweight and efficient even when there are invalid requests in a batch. Security and performance analysis show that the protocol provides privacy preservation, forward secrecy, semantic security,perfect key ambiguous, and protection against <b>identity</b> <b>thefts</b> while generating lower overheads in comparison with the existing protocols. Also, the protocol is secure against man-in-the-middle attacks, redirection attacks, impersonation attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. Moreover, our protocol provides a complete resistance against flood-based denial-of-service attacks...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAccording to {{the records}} on "digital trust" from ACSEL, {{which is an}} acronym for the French Digital Economy Association, French Internet users used an average of 16. 4 digital IDs in 2013, {{compared}} to 12. 2 in 2009. By digital ID, we mean information - like login and password - needed to activate an account, but also any traces left by an individual due to their activities or technological devices (IP address, photos, types of purchase, etc.). Ninety percent of Internet users use their digital IDs to access e-administration and e-commerce services, 8 % for online banking, and 77 % for social networks.

40|$|The mobile {{commerce}} has {{given birth to}} many mobile payment systems and this thesis covers {{the security of a}} theoretical system where the communication is handled by the customer. There are many technologies that can be used when implementing such a system, each with different strengths and weaknesses. The system designed in this project was constructed for micropayments in vending machines that has no connection to the vendor except for the connection supplied by the customer. The design was then used for analyzing the threats against the designed system and comparing it to an identical system where the connection is supplied by the seller in order to find out the effects on security when changing the communication channel. The comparison shows that even though the designed system is more vulnerable, it is not a major difference and with low value payments, the mobile payment system can depend on the connection supplied by the user. The main advantages to security with this method is the protection against Denial of Service attacks and the protection against mass <b>identity</b> <b>thefts</b> as authentication is no longer done on the machine...|$|R
