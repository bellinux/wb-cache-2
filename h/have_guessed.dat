25|$|Why did I take my own life? Well, {{when you}} {{committed}} two double murders you would too. Yes I did kill Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin {{in the city}} park that night, and killed Mr. Starks {{and tried to get}} Mrs. Starks. You wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> it, I did it when Mother was either out or asleep, and no one saw me do it. For the guns, I disassembled them and discarded them in different places. When I am found, which has already been done, please give this typewriter to Craig , and tell him that I hope that his child is a boy, it will (help) him in his work. Everything can go wherever you think it will do best except for the View-Master which will go to Belva Jo. Please take my bankroll and give it to Daddy, I think it should go to him, and tell him I don't want the car now.|$|E

500|$|Mark Androvich of Classic Gamer Magazine was {{similarly}} negative, writing [...] "Games by Apollo released {{a couple of}} decent games before going bankrupt, but you never would <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that anyone at the company knew how to program the Atari 2600 judging by their debut game." [...] Androvich opined that while the game was playable, it was not [...] "a {{step in the right}} direction" [...] for Apollo.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ten {{thousand}} one hundred," [...] said Jim; {{and even}} as he spoke he made a sudden gesture with his hand, his face changed, and I {{could see that he}} <b>had</b> <b>guessed,</b> or thought that he <b>had</b> <b>guessed,</b> the mystery. As he scrawled another memorandum in his note-book, his hand shook like a telegraph operator's.|$|R
60|$|Meriem's trained ears {{heard his}} every move. She {{made no attempt}} to seek closer {{knowledge}} of his identity. Already she <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> that he was a messenger from the Hon. Morison. She stooped and picked up the envelope. Tearing it open she easily read the contents by the moon's brilliant light. It was, as she <b>had</b> <b>guessed,</b> from Baynes.|$|R
500|$|On Sunday, 26 May, the USEE team {{caught the}} ferry back to England and Grace {{continued}} by train to London, {{probably in the}} company of Bannerman and Midwinter, as all three were due to take part in another match at Lord's the following day. They could not <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that the match would be remembered as, to quote Grace's biographer Simon Rae, [...] "arguably the most momentous six hours in cricket history".|$|E
500|$|Tradition names {{her mother}} as Cleïs, though ancient {{scholars}} may simply <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> this name, assuming that Sappho's daughter Cleïs {{was named after}} her. [...] Sappho's father's name is less certain. [...] Ten names are known for Sappho's father from the ancient testimonia; this proliferation of possible names suggests {{that he was not}} explicitly named in any of Sappho's poetry. [...] The earliest and most commonly attested name for Sappho's father is Scamandronymus. [...] In Ovid's Heroides, Sappho's father died when she was seven. [...] Sappho's father is not mentioned in any of her surviving works, but Campbell suggests that this detail may have been based on a now-lost poem. Sappho's own name is found in numerous variant spellings, even in her own Aeolian dialect; the form that appears in her own extant poetry is Psappho.|$|E
500|$|Billen {{called the}} episode [...] "distressing comedy to watch", {{but said that}} [...] "the acting, the scripting, the satisfactions of one-act {{resolution}} and the laughter it generated" [...] were redeeming qualities, and gave the episode four {{out of a possible}} five stars. Dessau felt that parts of the script were predicable, but some twists [...] "catch you completely unaware", while the ending [...] "may haunt [...] for days". Jack Seale, of the Radio Times, suggested that viewers will believe that they <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> the plot by the half-way point in the episode. However, he said that the writers [...] "give their story of how we're all one slip away from the gutter a chilling sense of rising dread" [...] which counteracts this. [...] "Nobody", he said, [...] "plays wicked games with the audience more skilfully." [...] Larushka Ivan-Zadeh and Carol Carter, writing in Metro, suggested that viewers would want to rewatch the episode in an attempt to pick up clues to the plot twists that they originally missed.|$|E
60|$|Emily coloured, {{and then}} she laughed faintly; admitting, however, that I <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> right.|$|R
60|$|It {{certainly}} {{looked as}} if he <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> correctly, and Jet drew his revolver.|$|R

500|$|Upon {{its release}} in the United Kingdom on 5 March 2007, [...] "She's Madonna" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews from music critics. Nick Levine from Digital Spy awarded it {{three out of}} five stars, noting that the track {{was a kind of}} [...] "damage control" [...] for Williams' fallen public image following his rehabilitation. [...] "Who'd <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> he'd sound so comfortable—his most convincing in years, actually—singing about {{one of the few people}} in the world who's more famous than him ?", Levine concluded. Alexis Petridis from The Guardian described the track as a [...] "brilliant, icy meditation on fame's corrupting power". NMEs Priya Elan listed [...] "She's Madonna" [...] as one of Williams' most [...] "bonkers song ever", along with three other songs from Rudebox: [...] "The 80's", [...] "The 90's" [...] and [...] "The Actor". Hubbard explained that the Pet Shop Boys brought an [...] "added spray of sheen to the glacially excellent" [...] song, and working with them brought some [...] "credibility" [...] to it. Julie Broadfoot from BBC Music described [...] "She's Madonna" [...] as a [...] "weird but fun tune". Lauren Murphy from Entertainment website noted that Pet Shop Boys' own musical influence was prevalent in the track, with its [...] "sparse, spacey glow and not least on synth-laden tongue-in-cheek homage" [...] of the song.|$|E
500|$|Although it wagered only $947 on the clue, Watson was {{the only}} {{contestant}} to miss the Final Jeopardy! response in the category U.S. CITIES ("Its largest airport was named for a World War II hero; its second largest, for a World War II battle"). Rutter and Jennings gave the correct response of Chicago, but Watson's response was [...] "What is Toronto?????" [...] Ferrucci offered reasons why Watson would appear to <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> a Canadian city: categories only weakly suggest the type of response desired, the phrase [...] "U.S. city" [...] did {{not appear in the}} question, there are cities named Toronto in the U.S., and Toronto in Ontario has an American League baseball team. Dr. Chris Welty, who also worked on Watson, suggested that {{it may not have been}} able to correctly parse the second part of the clue, [...] "its second largest, for a World War II battle" [...] (which was not a standalone clause despite it following a semicolon, and required context to understand that it was referring to a second-largest airport). Eric Nyberg, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the development team, stated that the error occurred because Watson does not possess the comparative knowledge to discard that potential response as not viable. Although not displayed to the audience as with non-Final Jeopardy! questions, Watson's second choice was Chicago. Both Toronto and Chicago were well below Watson's confidence threshold, at 14% and 11% respectively. (This lack of confidence was the reason for the multiple question marks in Watson's response.) ...|$|E
2500|$|By now {{the reader}} will <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that this process can be iterated. [...] In this way we get a proof of the Euler–Maclaurin {{summation}} formula which can be formalized by mathematical induction, in which the induction step relies on integration by parts and on the identities for periodic Bernoulli functions.|$|E

60|$|Blake {{told him}} he <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> correctly, and asked how far they had still to go.|$|R
6000|$|She turned around, {{apparently}} reassured. [...] "You are not {{to think}} that I have been told anything," [...] she said; [...] "I <b>have</b> only <b>guessed.</b> But when I looked at you, as you came in, I was sure I <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> aright." ...|$|R
2500|$|Many sinologists and {{scholars}} of traditional Chinese medicine <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> at the anaesthetic components of mafei powder. Frederick P. Smith contends that Hua Tuo, [...] "the Machaon of Chinese historical romance", used yabulu (押不蘆; [...] "Mandragora officinarum") rather than huoma (火麻; [...] "cannabis") and mantoulo (曼佗羅; [...] "Datura stramonium", nota bene, Hua's given name [...] "Tuo") [...] "infused in wine, and drunk as a stupefying medicine".|$|E
2500|$|Cooper {{has served}} as a {{composer}} and arranger on more than 150 works since first writing music in the early 1980s, including solo instrumental pieces all the way through full symphonic works for orchestra and singers. His writing style has been described as [...] "propulsive and sassy on an initial listen, revealing subtle shadings and intricate nuances upon repeated listening. [...] I might <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> Don Sebesky...on a blindfold test." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea of an}} equidissection {{seems like}} the kind of {{elementary}} geometric concept that should be quite old. [...] remark of Monsky's theorem, [...] "one could <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> that surely the answer must have been {{known for a long time}} (if not to the Greeks)." [...] But the study of equidissections did not begin until 1965, when Fred Richman was preparing a master's degree exam at New Mexico State University.|$|E
50|$|By this point, Janet <b>has</b> <b>guessed</b> Smitty's identity. He {{describes}} himself as a crusading journalist and newspaper editor.|$|R

2500|$|On Sunday, 26 May, the USEE team {{caught the}} ferry back to England and W. G.

2500|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was described}} by biographer Paul Webster who stated she was [...] "the muse to whom Saint-Exupéry poured out his soul in copious letters..... Consuelo was the rose in The Little Prince. [...] "I should have judged her by her acts and not by her words," [...] says the prince. [...] "She wrapped herself around me and enlightened me. I should never have fled. I should <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> at the tenderness behind her poor ruses." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name mafeisan {{combines}} ma ( [...] , meaning [...] "cannabis, hemp, numbed or tingling"), fei ( [...] , meaning [...] "boiling or bubbling"), and san ( [...] , meaning [...] "to {{break up}} or scatter", or [...] "medicine in powder form"). Therefore, the word mafeisan probably means something like [...] "cannabis boil powder". Many sinologists and scholars of traditional Chinese medicine <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> at {{the composition of}} Hua Tuo's mafeisan powder, but the exact components still remain unclear. His formula {{is believed to have}} contained some combination of: ...|$|E
60|$|Jimmy was {{a little}} startled, for it almost seemed that she <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> his thoughts, but he smiled.|$|R
60|$|We <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> as much, and {{the deep}} baying of the hounds {{convinced}} us of the truth of his statement.|$|R
60|$|This was a {{girl whose}} secret he <b>had</b> <b>guessed,</b> but who <b>had</b> not yet <b>guessed</b> his; an honest girl who loved him--one who would have made as good, or nearly as good, a {{practical}} farmer's wife as Tess.|$|R
2500|$|However, as Freud {{put it to}} the {{imagined}} auditors of his New Introductory Lectures (1932), [...] "You may perhaps shrug your shoulders and say: [...] "That isn't natural science, it's Schopenhauer's philosophy!" [...] But, ladies and gentlemen, why should not a bold thinker <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> something that is afterwards confirmed by sober and painstaking detailed research?" [...] He then went on to add that [...] "what we are saying is not even genuine Schopenhauer....we are not overlooking {{the fact that there is}} life as well as death. We recognise two basic instincts and give each of them its own aim".|$|E
2500|$|The {{story of}} his conception, {{development}} and installation of the Fokker synchronization device {{in a period of}} 48 hours (first found in an authorised biography of Fokker written in 1929) is not now believed to be factual. Another possible explanation is that Garros' Morane, partly destroyed by fire as it was, had sufficient traces of the original synchronization gear remaining for Fokker to <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> how it worked. For various reasons this also seems unlikely, and the current historical consensus points to a synchronization device having been in development by Fokker's team (including engineer Heinrich Lübbe) prior to the capture of Garros' machine.|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{excellent}} review, {{giving it a}} A-. In her recap, she gave the performances high marks: [...] "Y’know, when I get so frustrated with OUAT, it’s because it sets a high bar up against itself. Like this episode, for example. It takes a classic myth, perfectly twists it into the show’s own purposes, and manages to be jaw-dropping in a single hour. I didn’t realize {{we were about to}} get so much out of “Nimue,” but I should <b>have</b> <b>guessed</b> once we found out that it was penned by Jane Espenson, who writes most of OUAT’s best episodes." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon {{examination}} Duane {{found that}} his bullet had furrowed the robber's temple, torn a great piece out of his scalp, and, as Duane <b>had</b> <b>guessed,</b> <b>had</b> glanced. He was not seriously injured, and already showed signs of returning consciousness.|$|R
60|$|But already Mistress Charity <b>had</b> <b>guessed</b> what <b>had</b> occurred, {{her good}} humor vanished, {{and she began}} {{scouring}} her cheek with her pinner.|$|R
