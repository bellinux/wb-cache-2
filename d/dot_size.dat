Total dot gain is the difference between the <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> on the film negative and the corresponding printed <b>dot</b> <b>size.</b> For example, a dot pattern that covers 30% of the image area on film, but covers 50% when printed, is said to show a total dot gain of 20%.|$|E

Two screening methods or types are Amplitude Modulation (AM) screening and stochastic or Frequency Modulation (FM) screening. In AM screening, <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> varies depending on object density—tonal values; dots are placed in a fixed grid. In FM screening, <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> remains constant and dots are placed in random order to create darker or lighter areas of the image; dot placement is precisely controlled by sophisticated mathematical algorithms.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the strain energy and intersubband optical {{transitions}} in self-assembled dots on GaAs and InP substrates. On the GaAs substrate, {{in addition to the}} InAs/GaAs dots we examine strain compensated InAs/GaAsP dots on GaAs substrates. We find that the strain energy configuration profile shows that there is preference for certain <b>dot</b> <b>sizes</b> and shapes. Our calculated <b>dot</b> <b>sizes</b> agree well with experimental observations. We find that the addition of phosphorus in the covering matrix reduces the total strain energy of the system with little effects on the intersubband transition strength for the vertical incident light. The reduced strain energy should allow one to incorporate a large number of dot array stacks for devices such as lasers and detectors and thus increases the optical responses. Our studies for the InAs/InP system show that due to the lower strain mismatch there is no particular preference for <b>dot</b> <b>sizes.</b> The optical response for intersubband transitions is weaker and occurs at longer wavelengths in comparison to the InAs/GaAs dots. © 2002 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

These results were found for two quantum <b>dot</b> <b>sizes,</b> in the first one the characteristic quantities of the harmonic and Coulomb potentials are equals, and in the second one they differ by one order of magnitude.

50|$|A {{quantum dot}} laser is a {{semiconductor}} laser that uses quantum dots as the {{active laser medium}} in its light emitting region. Due to the tight confinement of charge carriers in quantum dots, they exhibit an electronic structure similar to atoms. Lasers fabricated from such an active media exhibit device performance that is closer to gas lasers, and avoid some of the negative aspects of device performance associated with traditional semiconductor lasers based on bulk or quantum well active media. Improvements in modulation bandwidth, lasing threshold, relative intensity noise, linewidth enhancement factor and temperature insensitivity have all been observed. The quantum dot active region may also be engineered to operate at different wavelengths by varying <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> and composition.

40|$|The role of {{nitrogen}} (N) in emission wavelengths from InAs quantum dots (QDs) was studied with intentional supplies of a N precursor (monomethylhydrazine) to InAs dot surfaces just before burying them with GaAs capping layers by metalorganic molecular-beam epitaxy. Luminescence from the InAs QDs showed a red shift with the N-precursor supplies {{on the dot}} surfaces, and more clear separations of the luminescence sub peaks originating from QD excited-state transitions were observed. The increase in the N precursor supplies on the dot surfaces however changed the relative variation in the emission wavelengths from the red shift to the blue shift. Additional observations of the <b>dot</b> <b>sizes</b> {{as well as the}} model calculations of the emission peaks and of the energy separations of the lowest and QD excited-state transitions showed that the red shift is due to the reduced Ga inclusion in the InAs QDs and that the blue shift is due to the reduced <b>dot</b> <b>sizes...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of image-formation in photopolymer flexographic relief printing plates is reviewed. In {{addition to the}} identified factors, {{it was hypothesized that}} the level of exposure could influence the plate shoulder angle. It was further hypothesized that an optimization of shoulder angle with respect to halftone dot area may reduce the dot gain of the printing process. An experiment was conducted using a novel method of plate exposure. Continuous-tone masks were placed in contact with the plate back and the halftone negative used on the plate face. The resulting shoulder angles were measured and analyzed for significant fit to a linear mathematical model. For many <b>dot</b> <b>sizes</b> the face exposure level was significant in determining shoulder angle.

50|$|Unlike simple atomic {{structure}}s, {{a quantum}} dot structure has the unusual property that energy levels are strongly {{dependent on the}} structure's size. For example, CdSe quantum dot light emission can be tuned from red (5 nm diameter) to the violet region (1.5 nm dot). The physical reason for QD coloration is the quantum confinement effect and {{is directly related to}} their energy levels. The bandgap energy that determines the energy (and hence color) of the fluorescent light is inversely proportional to the square of the size of quantum dot. Larger QDs have more energy levels that are more closely spaced, allowing the QD to emit (or absorb) photons of lower energy (redder color). In other words, the emitted photon energy increases as the <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> decreases, because greater energy is required to confine the semiconductor excitation to a smaller volume.|$|E

40|$|The {{segmented}} contact {{technique has}} been used to study the effects on nonradiative recombination of stacking multiple quantum-dot layers. As the number of stacked layers is increased a shift in the balance of dots in the bimodal dot distribution is observed due to a reduction in the number in the smaller <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> subset. This is attributed to an increase in the density of defect islands, as the number of layers is increased, that preferentially take material from the smaller dots, and lead to an increased level of nonradiative recombination per layer at low injection level. A second nonradiative process is apparent at higher injection level, which is related to the population of the small <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> subset. Spontaneous radiative efficiency was improved in a five-layer sample where the large to small <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> energy separation and relative density of the large <b>dot</b> <b>size</b> subset were increased...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports the}} {{interaction}} of aliphatic (triethyl amine, butyl amine) and aromatic amines (PPD, aniline) with CdSe quantum <b>dots</b> of varied <b>sizes.</b> The emission properties and lifetime values of CdSe quantum dots {{were found to be}} dependent on the oxidation potential of amines and crystallite sizes. Smaller CdSe quantum <b>dots</b> (<b>size</b> similar to 5 nm) ensure better surface coverage of amines and hence higher quenching efficiency of amines could be realized as compared to larger CdSe quantum <b>dots</b> (<b>size</b> similar to 14 nm). Heterogeneous quenching of amines due to the presence of accessible and inaccessible set of CdSe fluorophores is indicated. PPD owing to its lowest oxidation potential (similar to 0. 26 V) has been found to have higher quenching efficiency as compared to other amines TEA and aniline having oxidation potentials similar to 0. 66 and > 1. 0 V, respectively. Butyl amine on the other hand, plays a dual role: its post-addition acts as a quencher for smaller and enhances emission for larger CdSe quantum dots, respectively. The beneficial effect of butyl amine in enhancing emission intensity could be attributed to enhance capping effect and better passivation of surface-traps...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{two samples}} of quantum dot based {{intermediate}} band solar cells were studied and compared by transmission electron microscopy. These samples were grown on a (100) GaAs substrate, {{with a general}} structure consisting of 50 InAs quantum dot layers, where each quantum dot layer was separated by a spacer layer. The {{difference between the two}} samples was that one sample had GaAs spacer layers, while the other had GaNAs spacer layers. The N was added as a strain compensator, and it was therefore expected that this sample would exhibit less defects. By bright field (BF) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) the crystal structure of both samples were studied. This showed that the sample containing no N had fewer defects, compared to the other sample. Using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron-probe micro analysis it was determined that the N content in both samples was either below the detection limit of 200 ppm or zero. The quantum <b>dot</b> <b>sizes</b> were then found for both samples by STEM and it was seen here that the sample supposedly containing N, had on average higher quantum <b>dot</b> <b>sizes.</b> The better crystal structure of the sample containing no N, were attributed to the lower average quantum <b>dot</b> <b>sizes.</b> As the N content of both samples was determined to be insignificant, the only likely cause for the difference in size where attributed to a difference in growth parameters. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy and BF imaging, the quantum dot sheet density was found. The sheet density of both samples was around 1 ^ 11 cm^(- 2), with the sample containing no N having a factor 2 higher density compared to the other sample. Lastly, the polarity for both samples was determined by convergent electron beam diffraction, and these results were confirmed by a high resolution STEM image. </p...|$|R
