40|$|Background : Population aging {{proceeds}} {{with other}} socioeconomic developments, including educational expansion. <b>Improvements</b> <b>in</b> educational attainment lead {{to changes in}} demographic behaviors such as assortative mating, fertility, and the intergenerational transmission of education, which change {{the health of the}} elderly and the education of their offspring generation. Objective : We examine such a jointly-changing process in South Korea. Methods : We apply a recursive demographic model (Mare and Maralani 2006) by using the Korean Longitudinal Study of Ageing (KLoSA). Results : First, <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> education lead to <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> health among the elderly. Intermediate demographic factors make positive contributions to this <b>improvement.</b> Second, <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> education lead to a decline in the ratios of offspring to the elderly because better-educated people have fewer children. However, this decrease is not substantial. Third, <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> education increase the ratio of college-educated offspring to the unhealthy elderly because of <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> both offspring's education and elderly health. Conclusions : The results suggest that <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> education change configurations of the elderly and their offspring's generations, mitigating the negative consequences of population aging, such as increasing burdens of elderly support...|$|R
