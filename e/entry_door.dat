25|$|The {{interior}} of the dome was possibly intended to symbolize the arched vault of the heavens. The oculus at the dome's apex and the <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> are the only natural sources {{of light in the}} interior. Throughout the day, the light from the oculus moves around this space in a reverse sundial effect. The oculus also serves as a cooling and ventilation method. During storms, a drainage system below the floor handles the rain that falls through the oculus.|$|E
25|$|Most gas {{chambers}} were dismantled {{or destroyed}} as the Soviet troops approached, {{except for those}} at Dachau, Sachsenhausen and Majdanek. The gas chamber at Auschwitz I was amongst those blown up. It was reconstructed after the war to stand as a memorial, albeit with the <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> and the wall that originally separated the gas chamber from a washroom removed. The door that had been added when the gas chamber was converted into an air raid shelter was left intact.|$|E
25|$|Police {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} {{the lives of people}} in the three-story apartment building might be at risk, so they couldn't afford to barricade the building and wait. They determined that due to the location of Mixon's sister's apartment within the building, {{there was no way to}} ensure that other residents could safely be brought through the single front <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> to the street. Mufarreh decided to send in the SWAT officers prematurely, assessing that the threat level was low due to a high unlikelihood that Mixon would actually be present inside the apartment. Tactical commander Captain Rick Orozco approved of Mufarreh's plan.|$|E

25|$|This {{left the}} receiver, time base {{system and the}} display inside the {{aircraft}} cabin. There was ample room for this in the Beaufighter where the radar operator sat {{at the back of}} the fuselage. In the Mosquito, the radar operator sat to the right and slightly behind the pilot. The main <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> was located on the left side of the fuselage, just in front of the radar operator. With the radar installed, this left almost no room to reach the door, so the time base circuitry was mounted on rails that allowed it to be slid up and forward, out of the way of the door. Among the parts inside the aircraft were the Type 73 display and the TR.3152 Lucero.|$|E
25|$|The {{cockpit of}} the TBM seats {{a pair of}} flying crew. According to Flying Magazine, even in the {{standard}} configuration, the cockpit is provided with a generous suite of avionics and equipment. It features an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), {{traffic collision avoidance system}} (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, lightning detection, dual Garmin GNS 530 navigation/communication systems, Bose headsets, dual transponders, dual compasses, and full cockpit instrumentation for both positions. Pilots can enter the cockpit either from the main cabin or via a small pilot's door on the left hand side, forward of the wing; in a cargo configuration, the pilot's door eliminates the need to clamber over the cargo payload. The pilot's door is an optional extra, and is not installed upon all aircraft. From the TBM 700B onwards, an enlarged cabin <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> was introduced, which later became standard upon subsequent models.|$|E
25|$|Built in 1939, {{and named}} for renowned actor Richard B. Harrison, who taught Drama and {{directed}} productions at the college; Harrison Auditorium {{was designed by}} architect Leon McMinn. The auditorium was constructed by the Public Works Administration for usage as the college's main auditorium. The flat-roofed two story building features seven-bay main entrance with the bays defined by plain brick pilasters with simply molded stone bases and capitals. Extending above the pilasters is a plain stone frieze inscribed with the auditorium's name. Five pairs of glass and wood doors topped by five-light transoms give access to the lobby. Above each <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> at the second story level are large twelve-over-twelve sash windows. The roof line steps up {{at the rear of}} the lobby/entrance portion of the building to provide additional height to the main, large auditorium portion of the building. In 2004, the building underwent a two-year renovation process that involved both the interior and exterior of the building. The nearly $3 million renovation repaired the building's exterior surfaces, upgraded building systems, replaced seating, and made the building compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{building}} entrance {{is centered on}} the narrow northwest face of the six-story tower. The main <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> are framed by a slightly protruding concrete surround that matches the base element. Two wrought-iron coach-lights (not original) are located {{at the sides of}} the <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> and original cast bronze letters reading [...] "FEDERAL BUILDING KETCHIKAN ALASKA" [...] are located directly above the doors. The commemorative granite corner stone is located near the east end of the north wall.|$|R
25|$|The 1896 {{lighthouse}} is a timber-framed structure clad in corrugated iron, standing twelve metres {{high and}} capped with a domed lantern. The tower is conical in form with a base diameter of approximately 4.3 metres reducing to a top diameter of 2.26 metres. It has been reinstalled at its original location on a round concrete slab {{placed over the}} top of the original 1896 footing when it was returned from Golden Beach in 1999. Corrugations in the iron sheeting taper inwards for the full height of the tower. Most exterior sheeting is early, slip-sheeted in places with zinc sheeting to repair rusted sections. A small timber-framed entry projects from the northern side, clad in corrugated iron with an arched corrugated iron roof. The door is made from tongue and groove boards on a timber frame. Four small, rectangular windows provide daylight to the interior – two at ground level and two corresponding to the level of the central interior platform. They are vertical sliders, framed with cedar and weather-proofed on the exterior by lead flashing. The exterior of the tower is painted white, with the exception of a red border on the <b>entry</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
500|$|The temple complex, as built, has a well {{proportioned}} and complex [...] "cruciform plan". Overall {{there are only}} nine shikharas (temple towers) arranged sequentially in an [...] "hierarchical scale". The central shikhara is the largest and is built above the garbhagriha (sanctum sanctorum), which has nine tiers topped by a decorated amalaka, which at present is seen separated from the shikhara (following the earthquake of 1905). The Thakurdwara has a huge door {{which leads to the}} garbhagriha which has elaborate carvings. The chambers which follow from the <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> are the antarala, mandapa and mukha mandapa ( [...] supported on huge pillars). The garbhagriha, in a square plan ( [...] each side), has an altar where the deities are deified. The approach to the entrance door of the temple (prominently decorated), is through a steep flight of steps. There is also a stairway {{on either side of the}} main temple which leads to the highest part of the shikhara (rises to a height of [...] above the floor of the inset) of the temple complex which provides scenic views all round, particularly of the Dhauladar Range. The intricate sculptural detailing on the doors, jambs, lintels, walls, shikharas, and column capitals on the main shrine and other smaller temples consist of figurines of gods and goddesses such as Shiva, Parvati, Laksmi and Saraswati, and floral designs. In particular, the temple was conceptualized as a tribute to Shiva. There are many lintels which depict scenes of festivals to celebrate the crowning of Shiva, not seen anywhere else in the country. The lintel on the garbagriha of the main shrine shows Shiva's coronation in a [...] "benign posture" [...] with eyes closed like Buddha. The same type of carving is also seen in the medallion on the shikhara. The lintel carvings also show many divinities including Shiva in the central portion flanked by his sons Ganesha and Kartikeya.|$|E

2500|$|After the DC-9 {{came to rest}} on Runway 32L, a fire {{broke out}} in the aft part of the plane, the cabin rapidly filled with smoke, and {{interior}} illumination in the passenger cabin was poor. [...] The captain pulled the fire extinguisher handles and ordered an emergency evacuation. [...] One passenger opened the right overwing door and escaped that way. One flight attendant opened the left overwing exit, exited the aircraft, and called on passengers to follow her; four passengers escaped via this door. The other flight attendant opened the main <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> and deployed the emergency slide, which did not inflate; she then was pushed out the door, but assisted passengers off the plane from outside the doorway. The captain entered the passenger cabin from the cockpit, calling passengers to come forward, then exited the plane via the main <b>entry</b> <b>door</b> and helped them to the ground before reboarding to assist more passengers off through the main door. The first officer escaped through a cockpit window and assisted passengers out of the aircraft from outside the plane at the main <b>entry</b> <b>door.</b> A total of 27 passengers exited via the main <b>entry</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After a {{production}} hiatus of twelve years, Cessna started manufacturing {{a new version}} of the venerable 206 in 1998, with the introduction of the newly certified 206H.

A model range may include multiple configurations, as with the 2001-2007 Ford Focus which offered sedan (ZX4), wagon (ZXW), and three or five-door hatchback (ZX3 and ZX5) models. The models typically share a platform, drivetrain and bodywork forward of the A-pillar. Hatchbacks may have a removable rigid parcel shelf, liftable with the tailgate, or flexible roll-up tonneau cover to cover the cargo space behind the rear seats.|$|R

[...] These modifications included the relocation of the altar, {{the addition of a}}n enclosed stair to the choir loft, the addition of a vestry room to the north, and the construction of an enclosure for the main <b>entry</b> <b>door.</b> [...] A horse shed was built in 1850, and added to in 1871. [...] The horse shed has since been demolished.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} a rectangular double height nave with square projections at both ends. The gable roofs over the two projecting rooms are lower than the nave roof. At the eastern end is a 1972 concrete block entry vestibule that replaced a timber entry porch. It is rendered to match {{the rest of the}} building and has double <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> located on its eastern face. The original <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> have been removed. On the western end is a private room that contains the staircase leading to the pulpit.|$|R
50|$|On the {{northern}} elevation the verandah is enclosed and a small, central, gable-roofed portico (a later addition) shelters the main <b>entry</b> <b>doors.</b> The portico roof is supported on two timber posts {{identical to those}} on the southern elevation. The double <b>entry</b> <b>doors</b> are low-waisted with glass fitted between fine mullions in the upper sections and a three-centred fixed fanlight above the transom. A narrow band of green and red glass forms a border to {{the upper half of}} each door leaf. On each side of the main doors are single banks of timber-framed windows.|$|R
