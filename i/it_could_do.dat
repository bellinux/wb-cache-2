5|$|In August 1867, the {{commander}} of the Department of Washington wrote to the Chief of Ordnance, asking how much longer he needed Fort Greble as an ordnance depot for materiel removed from dismantled forts. When <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, the Ordnance Department removed its property to the Washington Arsenal, now Fort McNair, or transferred it to a still-garrisoned fort, though with post-war budget cuts, these were becoming few and far between.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Elephant Point was an {{airborne}} operation {{conducted by a}} composite Gurkha airborne battalion that took place on 1 May 1945. In March 1945, plans were made for an assault on Rangoon, the capital of Burma, as a stepping-stone {{on the way to}} recapturing Malaya and Singapore. Initial plans for the assault on the city had called for a purely land-based approach by British Fourteenth Army, but concerns about heavy Japanese resistance led to this being modified {{with the addition of a}} joint amphibious-airborne assault. This assault, led by 26th Indian Division, would sail up the Rangoon River, but before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so, the river would have to be cleared of Japanese and British mines. In order to achieve this, coastal defences along the river would have to be neutralized, including a battery at Elephant Point.|$|E

5|$|With 42 seconds remaining, the Jets {{still had}} a chance to score; however, on the kickoff, New York return man Earl Christy fumbled the ball at the Jets' 12-yard line when he was tackled by Raiders linebacker Bill Budness. Oakland reserve running back Preston Ridlehuber picked up the fumbled ball and ran into the end zone, which with another Blanda extra point gave the Raiders a 43–32 lead, deflating any hopes of the Jets coming back to win the contest. Ridlehuber could not {{remember}} whether AFL rules permitted advancing a fumbled kickoff return (they did), so tried to make it appear he was entering the end zone with the same motion he gathered in the ball. Oakland kicked off to New York again, but <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> little with the ball in the final seconds, and the game ended.|$|E

25|$|In 1890, Troelstra {{joined the}} Sociaal-Democratische Bond (Social-Democratic League, SDB), an early Dutch socialist {{movement}} {{under the leadership}} of Ferdinand Domela Nieuwenhuis. In time, he got into conflict with the anarchist tendencies of the movement. In 1893, the SDB took a decisive anti-parliamentary stance, and Troelstra no longer believed <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> any useful socialist work.|$|E
25|$|In 1985, {{the arts}} institute, {{along with the}} {{watercolor}} museum, was destroyed by the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. In 1987, the city government bought the house on Salvador Novo Street in Coyoacan, the present site, and donated it to the watercolor museum. However, the government also stated that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> no more to support the project. The museum continued on private donations and the efforts of Guati Rojo’s work. He not only provided much of the funding, but his popularity helped to promote the museum along with Mexican watercolor painting in general.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the reason}} for the May reauthorization was that the CIA promised that {{improvements}} from Project RAINBOW would make the majority of U-2 flights undetected. On 2 April 1957, a RAINBOW test flight crashed in Nevada, killing the pilot. The U-2's large wingspan slowed its descent during crashes, often leaving its remains salvageable; Lockheed was able to rebuild the wreckage from the incident into a flyable airframe, but that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so should have been evidence to the CIA that its cover story might not be viable after a crash in hostile territory. The RAINBOW anti-radar modifications were not very successful, and their use ended in 1958.|$|E

25|$|Plymouth Argyle {{was limited}} in what <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with the stadium {{throughout}} the 1900s, {{because of a}} long-standing lease agreement with the City Council. That changed in 2006 when the club purchased the freehold of the ground for £2.7m. Soon after, the club announced it would begin hosting live music in the summer months, starting in 2007, and the first act to perform there was Elton John. Other major acts have followed, including George Michael, Meat Loaf, Westlife, and Rod Stewart. The stadium also hosts an annual free-admittance carol service in December to celebrate Christmas, {{in association with the}} Plymouth branch of Christian organisation Faith and Football.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2012, the President of South Korea, Lee Myung-Bak, {{visited the}} Liancourt Rocks, {{which made him}} the first South Korean {{president}} to do so. Japan temporarily withdrew its ambassador to South Korea, Masatoshi Muto, and Minister for Foreign Affairs Kōichirō Gemba summoned the South Korean ambassador to file a complaint and threatened to lodge a case with the International Court of Justice, (ICJ) which was rejected by South Korea. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so because both countries {{party to a dispute}} must agree to such ICJ cases. It was the first time for Japan to make such a move in 47 years, since Japan and South Korea officially re-established relations in 1965.|$|E
25|$|Two {{days before}} George Washington's birthday, President Hoover laid the {{cornerstone}} of the National Archives building on February 20, 1933. The structure's cost was set at $8.75 million. Just three days later, he laid {{the cornerstone of}} the Department of Justice building with a trowel made from wood and cooper nails from the USS Constitution. Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Associate Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, Associate Justice Owen Roberts, Associate Justice James Clark McReynolds, Solicitor General Thomas D. Thacher, and Attorney General William D. Mitchell all attended the ceremony. Five months later, a small fire at the Post Office construction site was extinguished by a security guard before <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> any damage. Late in 1933, the northern addition to the Internal Revenue building (the land had been condemned in December 1930) began to rise.|$|E

25|$|Seeing {{that other}} Japanese car makers were {{allowing}} their dealers in Puerto Rico to transship excess inventory to Latin America and the continental United States, Soler asked if <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> the same. Mitsubishi refused, saying the vehicles were customized for the Puerto Rican market. They lacked heaters and defoggers {{that they would}} have needed on the mainland, and their engines could not run on the lower-grade leaded gasoline sold in many Latin American countries at that time. Further, Soler had no experience with maritime shipping and would not been able to meet its service obligations under warranty for transshipped cars and trucks. Mitsubishi also was concerned that transshipments to the continental U.S. would be seen as skirting the voluntary import restraints Japanese automakers had been practicing in the American market to mitigate the potential political backlash from their distressed American counterparts.|$|E
25|$|The self {{is found}} to be a cause of force, free in its action, on the ground that we are obliged to relate the {{volition}} of consciousness to the self as its cause, and its ultimate cause. It is not clear from the analysis whether the self is immediately observed as an acting or originating cause, or whether reflection working on the principle of causality is compelled to infer its existence and character. If self is actually so given, we do not need the principle of causality to infer it; if it is not so given, causality could never give us either the notion or the fact of self as a cause or force, far less as an ultimate one. All that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would be to warrant a cause of some sort, but not this or that reality as the cause. And further, the principle of causality, if fairly carried out, as universal and necessary, would not allow us to stop at personality or will as the ultimate cause of its effect—volition. Once applied to the facts at all, it would drive us beyond the first antecedent or term of antecedents of volition to a still further cause or ground—in fact, land us in an infinite regress of causes.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of 1712, Peter the Great ordered that further campaigns in war-ravaged regions of Finland with poor {{transportation}} networks were to be performed along the coastline and the seaways near the coast. Alarmed by the Russian preparations Lybecker requested naval units to be brought in {{as soon as possible}} in the spring of 1713. However, like so often, Swedish naval units arrived only after the initial Russian spring campaign had ended. Nominally under the command of Fyodor Apraksin, but accompanied by Peter the Great, a fleet of coastal ships together with 12,000 men - infantry and artillery - began the campaign by sailing from Kronstadt on 2 May 1713; a further 4,000 cavalry were later sent overland to join with the army. The fleet had already arrived at Helsinki on 8 May and were met by 1,800 Swedish infantry under General Carl Gustaf Armfeldt. Together with rowers from the ships the Russians had 20,000 men at their disposal even without the cavalry. The defenders, however, managed to fend off landing attempts by the attackers until the Russians landed at their flank at Sandviken, which forced Armfelt to retire towards Porvoo (Borgå) after setting afire both the town and all the supplies stored there as well as bridges leading north from the town. It was only on 12 May that Swedish squadron under Admiral Erik Johan Lillie made it to Helsinki but there was nothing <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
