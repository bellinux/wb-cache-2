40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze to what extent potentially <b>teratogenic</b> medicinal <b>products</b> are dispensed concomitantly with contraceptives. Data on dispensed medicinal products in this population-based study were obtained from the Dutch Foundation for Pharmaceutical Statistics. For over 178 potentially <b>teratogenic</b> medicinal <b>products,</b> concomitant use of contraceptives was assessed. The proportion of potentially <b>teratogenic</b> medicinal <b>products</b> dispensed concomitantly with a contraceptive varied significantly from 40. 9 % (95 % CI 40. 7 - 41. 2) in 2005 to 43. 4 % in 2009 (95 % CI 44. 2 - 43. 7). Significant differences existed as well between age categories with the lowest proportions of concomitant use of contraceptives for any potentially teratogenic drug in women aged 36 through 45 years (35. 0 %, 95 % CI 34. 9 - 35. 1) in comparison to those aged 26 through 35 years (47. 1 %, 95 % CI 46. 9 - 47. 3) and 15 through 25 years (53. 6 %, 95 % CI 53. 4 - 53. 8).

40|$|Background: In recent years, {{there has}} been an {{increase}} in the use of automated healthcare databases for drug safety in pregnancy evaluation; their suitability for this purpose needs to be evaluated. Aim: To evaluate the utility of the United Kingdom’s General Practice Research Database (GPRD) to act as an alternative to pregnancy registries, using anticonvulsants as a case study. Methods: Pregnancies in women with epilepsy were identified and first trimester anticonvulsant exposure was determined. Major congenital malformations in the offspring were identified and verified. The risk of major congenital malformations following exposure to a range of anticonvulsants was calculated and compared to those reported by the UK Epilepsy and Pregnancy Register. The ability to identify a <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> association using GPRD data was also assessed. An algorithm was created to identify and classify different types of pregnancy loss in an automated manner. Results: The risks of a pregnancy outcome with a major congenital malformation following first trimester anticonvulsant exposures, were found to be similar in the GPRD to those of the UK Register. The number of exposures to individual products in the GPRD was often small and therefore lacked statistical power. It was, however, possible to identify a <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> association using data from the GPRD. Verification of the algorithm developed to classify pregnancy losses demonstrated that, although not perfect, it would be a beneficial tool when using the GPRD for drug safety in pregnancy research. Conclusion: It is unlikely a single data source or study design will be sufficient for monitoring all aspects of the safety of medicine use during pregnancy. The GPRD has the potential to make a valuable contribution to this field of research and could {{play an important role in}} complementing the work of other surveillance systems.

40|$|Treatment of bipolar {{disorder}} with lithium therapy during pregnancy {{is a medical}} challenge.

First, we modeled time-dependent lithium concentration profiles resulting from lithium therapy known to have caused birth defects. Next, we identified maximum and average fetal lithium concentrations during treatment.

These doses were selected to span the range of human exposure used to induce labor. In addition, adult mice underwent a battery of behavioral tests relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism including tests for anxiety, stereotyped behaviors, social communication and interactions, and learning and memory. No significant effects of exposure were found for any measure of development or behavioral endpoints.

40|$|AbstractRetinoic acid (RA) {{affects the}} {{response}} of many cells to growth factors, including the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). The BMPs {{are members of the}} TGF-β family of growth factors, originally identified by their bone-inducing activities. Their widespread expression suggests many roles other than that in osteogenesis. Because RA modulates the cell's response to growth factors, this may be a means by which the retinoids exert some of their <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> effects. One such cellular response may be apoptosis. While apoptosis is required for normal development, the location and timing of its induction must be carefully controlled. Recently, several TGF-β family members have been implicated in the induction of apoptosis in certain cell types. We show here, using P 19 embryonal carcinoma cells, that the combination of RA and BMP 2 or BMP 4 synergistically induces apoptosis in 40 % of the population within 24 hr. In contrast, RA alone induces apoptosis in only 10 – 15 % of the population and each of the BMPs alone minimally induces apoptosis. Apoptosis depends on the dose of both the RA and the BMP as well as on new protein synthesis. Further, the induction of apoptosis prevents the formation of fully differentiated neurons and glial cells and instead leads to primarily smooth muscle cell differentiation. These results suggest that some of the malformations caused by retinoids {{may be due to the}} induction of inappropriate apoptosis in cells exposed to BMPs...|$|R

Here we extend our original analysis of the TGFA TaqI RFLP to two other TGFA RFLPs and seven other RFLPs at five candidate genes in 117 nonsyndromic cases of CL/P and 113 controls. The other candidate genes were the retinoic acid receptor (RARA), the bcl- 2 oncogene, and the homeobox genes 2 F, 2 G, and EN 2. Significant associations with the TGFA TaqI and BamHI RFLPs were confirmed, although associations of clefting with previously reported haplotypes did not reach significance.

40|$|Introduction. Heavy episodic ('binge') {{drinking}} {{among women}} in Scotland is commonplace; prepregnancy drinking is associated with continued antenatal drinking. Evidence for effectiveness of standardized antenatal alcohol assessment is lacking. Alcohol-exposed pregnancies may be missed. We assessed peri-conceptual and mid-pregnancy consumption using a week-long retrospective diary and standard alcohol questionnaires, and evaluated the agreement between these instruments. Material and methods. Cross-sectional study in two Scottish health board areas involving 510 women attending mid-pregnancy ultrasound scan clinics. Face-to-face administration of alcohol retrospective diary and AUDIT or AUDIT-C assessed weekly and daily alcohol consumption levels and patterns. Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS- 21) assessed maternal wellbeing. A sub-sample (n = 30) provided hair for alcohol metabolite analysis. Pearson's correlation coefficient investigated associations between questionnaires and alcohol metabolite data. Results. The response rate was 73. 8 %. The retrospective diary correlated moderately with AUDIT-C and AUDIT but elicited reports of significantly higher peri-conceptual consumption, (median unit consumption on 'drinking days' 6. 8; range 0. 4 - 63. 8). Additional 'special occasions' consumption ranged from 1 to 125 units per week. Correlations between DASS- 21 and retrospective diary were weak. Biomarker analysis identified three instances of hazardous peri-conceptual drinking. Conclusions. Women reported higher consumption levels when completing the retrospective diary, especially regarding peri-conceptual 'binge' drinking. Routine clinical practice methods may not capture potentially harmful or irregular drinking patterns. Given the association between prepregnancy and antenatal drinking, and alcohol's <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> effects, particularly in the first trimester, the retrospective diary may be a useful low-tech tool to gather information on alcohol intake patterns and levels...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The study {{goal was}} to assess {{teratogenic}} effects of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) {{through the use of}} a surveillance system (MADRE) of infants with malformations. Methods: Information on all malformed infants (1990 - 1996) with maternal first-trimester drug exposure was collected by the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects and Monitoring Systems (ICBDMS). Cases were defined as infants presenting with a specific malformation, and controls were defined as infants presenting with any other birth defect. Exposure was defined by the use of AEDs during the first trimester of pregnancy. The association of AEDs with malformations was then estimated by calculating the odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals and testing their homogeneity among registries. Results: Among 8005 cases of malformations, 299 infants were exposed in utero to AEDs. Of those exposed to monotherapy, 65 were exposed to phenobarbital, 10 to methylphenobarbital, 80 to valproic acid, 46 to carbamazepine, 24 to phenytoin, and 16 to other AEDs, Associations were found for spina bifida with valproic acid. Infants exposed to phenobarbital and to methylphenobarbital showed an increased risk of oral clefts. Cardiac malformations were found to be associated with phenobarbital, methylphenobarbital, valproic acid, and carbamazepine. Hypospadias was associated with valproic acid. Porencephaly and other specified anomalies of brain, anomalies of face, coarctation of aorta, and limb reduction defects were found to be associated with valproic acid.

Although axial skeletal malformations (vertebral column) and limb defects have been described, its main target organ is neuroepithelium of neural tube. Therefore it seems that administration of VA during early pregnancy may affect on neural tube and adjacent tissues. The goal of {{present study was to}} determine whether there is a relationship between maternal valproic acid exposure and developmental changes during neural tube and notochord and their interactions. For this reason, on 9 th day of gestation, wistar rats were treated with double dose of 600 mg/kg VA given once in the morning and another in the evening (in experimental group). The controls were received the same volume of normal saline by animal feeding. For teratological studies, fetuses were examined on 20 th day of gestation and histological study were carried out. Our findings showed that in addition to some well known congenital malformations (such as axial skeletal defects and spina bifida) there was an abnormal cavitation in cervical and thoracic segments of spinal cord (syringomyelia) which was accompanied with a delay in determination of notochord at these levels. At these area, the syrinx (cyst) is lined by compact glial tissue. In this kind of abnormality there is an atrophy of gray and white matter in the neighboring of syrinx in the spinal cord.

40|$|Background Exposure to Benzodiazepines (BZD) during foetal {{life has}} been {{suggested}} to contribute to neonatal morbidity and some congenital malformations, for example, orofacial clefts. Here we aimed to study the neonatal outcome and congenital malformations in neonates whose mothers reported use of BZD and/or hypnotic benzodiazepine receptor agonists (HBRA) during pregnancy. Methods In the Swedish Medical Birth Register we identified 1979 infants whose mothers (n = 1944) reported use of BZD and/or HBRA in early pregnancy. An additional 401 infants were studied, born to 390 mothers who were prescribed such drugs during late pregnancy. Neonatal outcome including congenital malformations after exposure was {{compared with that of}} all births (n = 873 879). Results An increased risk for preterm birth and low birth weight was detected in the exposed population. The rate of relatively major congenital malformations was moderately increased among infants exposed in early pregnancy (adjusted OR = 1. 24, 95 %CI 1. 00 - 1. 55), not explained by <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> maternal co-medication. A higher than expected number of infants with pylorostenosis or alimentary tract atresia (especially small gut) was found. This was, however, based on only seven infants for each group of malformation without association to any specific BZD or HBRA. The earlier proposed increased risk for orofacial clefts was not confirmed in our study. Conclusions Maternal use of BZD and/or HBRA may increase the risk for preterm birth and low birth weight and cause neonatal symptoms, but {{does not appear to have}} a strong teratogenic potential.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: {{this study}} aimed {{to relate the}} use of alcohol during {{pregnancy}} with hepatic morphological changes, both in the mother as in fetuses, through microscopic analysis of histological sections by routine techniques. Methods: the authors used 15 pregnant Wistar rats divided into three groups: Alcohol, Water and Control. It has been administered ethyl alcohol and distilled water to females of Alcohol and Water, respectively, on the 7 th, 8 th and 9 th days of gestation. At the time of collection of fetuses, they have been measured and weighed, and then the livers of these and their mothers have processed and analyzed on slides using the method of hematoxylin and eosin staining for both, and Masson Trichrome for the mother. Results: {{there has been no}} statistically significant difference about the number of fetuses and the number of megakaryocytes in the three groups (p > 0. 05). However, concerning fetal weight, the comparisons among Water versus Control and Water versus Alcohol have showed significant differences (p < 0. 001). Furthermore, significance has been noted in the comparisons among the lengths of the cranio-caudal fetal Alcohol versus Control groups (p < 0. 05). Using the qualitative analysis of the livers of the mothers, we have observed the presence of inflammatory infiltrate, normal pattern of hepatocytes cords, portal triad and distribution of collagen fibers besides absence of steatosis in all three groups.

40|$|Pregnancy {{registries}} are {{the most}} commonly used data resource for the post-marketing surveillance of drug teratogenicity. However, the limited sample size and potential selection bias in these registries has led us to investigate the potential of the UK General Practice Research Database (GPRD) as an alternative data source for monitoring drug safety during pregnancy. In addition, a literature review identified further observational data sources that monitor pregnancy outcomes for future evaluation. Initial feasibility studies focused on the ability of the GPRD to capture pregnancy outcomes for a range of drug class exposures, all of which are currently under investigation in pregnancy registries, during pregnancy. The comparator pregnancy registries were identified via a MEDLINE search, whilst eligible pregnancies, in which women received one or more prescriptions for the drug of interest during pregnancy, were identified in the GPRD using the mother-baby link. The number of pregnancy outcomes following exposure to medication for a range of conditions with varying prevalence, including depression, migraine, epilepsy, herpes simplex and HIV, captured by the two data sources were compared. For depression, a relatively prevalent condition, the GPRD recorded the same number of mean annual intrauterine exposures to fluoxetine as the pregnancy registry (118 exposures/year). Ascertainment of intrauterine exposure to drug treatments for less prevalent conditions was found to be higher for the pregnancy registries than the GPRD; for the older antiepileptic drugs (valproate and carbamazepine), the pregnancy registry recorded between four and five times as many mean annual exposures as the GPRD. Virtually no antiretroviral exposures (three) were identified during the time period of interest on the GPRD, compared with 3946 in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. Data from the GPRD meet established criteria for evaluating outcomes of pregnancy.

40|$|The {{organization}} of the newborn's brain {{and the nature of}} the effects of toxins and pollutants conspire to produce complex and difficult problems for the assessment of the behavioral effects of environmental agents. The newborn's brain can be characterized as relatively undifferentiated, and more vulnerable to, but potentially more capable of recovery from, the effects of environmental agents specific to this time period than it will be later in development. Environmental agents tend to have nonspecific, possibly subtle, effects that invade many areas of newborn functioning. These characteristics of the newborn and the behavioral effects of teratogens make assessment at this point in development difficult. Further exacerbating this difficulty is the nature of development. Development is critically dependent on the care the newborn receives. Distortions of a newborn's behavior can produce disturbances in the caretaking environment, and these caretaking disturbances can amplify the original behavioral distortion and produce other distortions. Attention to these types of effects must be built into an assessment. These considerations lead to the conclusion that an apical assessment of newborn behavior is required. The most standardized, valid, and reliable instrument currently available is the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale developed by Brazelton. It assesses the integrated actions of the infant that function to regulate simultaneously the infant's internal state and exchanges with the animate (caretaking) and inanimate environment. The scale uses a set of reflex and behavioral items to assess the critical domains of infant functioning (e. g., the infant's ability to control his states of consciousness). It has been found to be sensitive to the behavioral effects of <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> agents (e. g., PCBs) and to the potential disturbances in caretaking produced by them. However, because no single assessment is likely to be sufficient, a strategy may be needed in which the effects detected by repeated application of the Neonatal Assessment are followed up with more specific assessments of those effects, such as acoustical cry analysis...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This {{is one of}} {{a series}} of reviews of methods of {{cervical}} ripening and labour induction using standardised methodology. The use of complementary therapies is rising and some women look to complementary therapies during pregnancy and childbirth to be used alongside conventional medical practice. Acupuncture involves the insertion of very fine needles into specific points of the body. The limited observational studies to date suggest acupuncture for induction of labour appears safe, has no <b>known</b> <b>teratogenic</b> effects, and may be effective. The evidence regarding the clinical effectiveness of this technique is limited. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effects of acupuncture for third trimester cervical ripening or induction of labour. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register, the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register and bibliographies of relevant papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: The criteria for inclusion included the following: (1) clinical trials comparing acupuncture used for third trimester cervical ripening or labour induction with placebo/no treatment or other methods listed above it on a predefined list of labour induction methods; (2) random allocation to the treatment or control group; (3) adequate allocation concealment; (4) violations of allocated management not sufficient to materially affect conclusions; (5) clinically meaningful outcome measures reported; (6) data available for analysis according to the random allocation; (7) missing data insufficient to materially affect the conclusions. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A strategy has been developed to deal with the large volume and complexity of trial data relating to labour induction. This involves a two-stage method of data extraction. The initial data extraction is done centrally, and incorporated into a series of primary reviews arranged by methods of induction of labour, following a standardised methodology. The data will then be extracted from the primary reviews into a series of secondary reviews, arranged by category of woman. To avoid duplication of data in the primary reviews, the labour induction methods have been listed in a specific order, from one to 25. Each primary review includes comparisons between one of the methods (from two to 25) with only those methods above it on the list. MAIN RESULTS: No trials met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is a need for a well designed randomised controlled trial to evaluate the role of acupuncture to induce labour. Smith CA, Crowther C...|$|R
40|$|Although some psychotropic {{drugs are}} <b>known</b> to be <b>teratogenic</b> no psychotropic drug is of proven safety for {{treatment}} of depression during pregnancy. Untreated mood disorders during pregnancy pose significant risks for mother and the newborn. This review focuses {{on the use of}} somatic tretments of depression during pregnancy. Electroconvulsive therapy, bright light therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation and vagal nerve stimulation are relatively safe and effective treatments during pregnancy if steps are taken to decrease potential risks. A clear information related to the somatic treatment should be given to the patient and informed consent should be obtained.

40|$|Behavioral {{effects have}} been found to result from the {{prenatal}} administration of substances <b>known</b> to be <b>teratogenic</b> to the CNS. These effects occur at dose levels lower than those producing gross malformations and when the agent is administered at times other than that optimal for CNS relevant technique for detecting adverse consequences of prenatal exposure to drugs and chemicals. Behavioral testing, however, also appears to have attributes that dictate a thoughtful approach to its role as a method for assessing risk, and additional research is needed to obtain usable techniques. The need for such research is intensified by the present inability to identify potential behavioral teratogens by means other than laboratory investigation...|$|R
40|$|At a multidiscipline {{international}} meeting {{sponsored by}} L'Institut de la Vie held at Guadeloupe in January 1974, current methods for detecting teratogenic agents were outlined and discussed. Recommendations {{of the participants}} of the conference wete: recognize {{the limitations of the}} present defenses against teratogenic agents; educate the public and medical profession about the <b>known</b> human <b>teratogenic</b> agents; select for animal teratogenicity screening among new and existing agents by emphasizing substances to which the entire population will be exposed, agents to which pregnant women are exposed, viruses which are found to persist in the human fetus, and agents which have become suspect from clinical experience; recognize that nearly all compounds have a fetotoxic dose but that this does not imply teratogenicity; encourage the development of new, quick in vitro testing methods for detecting teratogenic agents; monitor for sudden increases in the frequency of specific malformations in newborn infants and in aborted fetuses; assure that expert multidiscipline committees are available to evaluate the threat when suspected teratogens are reported; improve teratology information storage and retrieval systems by record linkage of clinical data, linkage between computer systems, and universal identifier system for chemical compounds and congenical malformations; foster the exchange of data, particularly those held by the pharmaceutical industry...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Encephalomeningocele, {{especially}} in the frontoethmoidal region, {{is a form of}} neural tube defect which affects patients in Southeast Asia more commonly than in Western countries. Its underlying cause is not <b>known</b> but <b>teratogenic</b> environmental agents are suspected. However, nutritional deficiency, as in spina bifida, cannot be excluded. Methods This study reports 21 cases of meningocele (without brain tissue in the lesion) and encephalomeningocele (with brain tissue) that were admitted to our hospital for surgical corrections in the period of ten years, from 1990 to 1999. Clinicopathological findings, as well as occupations of family members and prenatal exposures to infectious agents or chemicals were reviewed and analyzed. Results The most commonly involved area was the frontoethmoidal region, found in 20 cases. The combined pattern between nasoethmoidal and nasoorbital defects was found most frequently (11 from 21 cases) and had more associated abnormalities. Encephalomeningocele had more related abnormalities than meningocele with proportions of 0. 6 and 0. 3, respectively. Conclusions Here, we confirmed that genetic defects {{are not likely to be}} the single primary cause of this malformation. However, we could not draw any conclusions on etiologic agents. We suggest that case control studies and further investigation on the role of nutritional deficiencies, especially folic acid, in the pathogenesis of encephalomeningocele are necessary to clarify the underlying mechanisms. </p...|$|R
