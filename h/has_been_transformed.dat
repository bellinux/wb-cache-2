He has a {{habit of}} disobeying his master's strict rules, {{sometimes}} causing tension between them, but the Beast often turns to him for advice. He is depicted as flirtatious, as he is frequently seen with the Featherduster and immediately takes a liking to Belle. A running gag throughout the movie is Lumière burning Cogsworth. Nik Ranieri served as the supervising animator for Lumière.|$|E
5|$|In recent decades, South Dakota <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> {{from a state}} {{dominated}} by agriculture to one with a more diversified economy. The tourism industry has grown considerably since {{the completion of the}} interstate system in the 1960s, with the Black Hills becoming more important as a destination. The financial service industry began to grow in the state as well, with Citibank moving its credit card operations from New York to Sioux Falls in 1981, a move that has been followed by several other financial companies. South Dakota was the first state to eliminate caps on interest rates.|$|E
5|$|N. nigricollis usually inhabits savanna and {{semi-desert}} {{regions of}} Africa. However, {{they can be}} found at altitudes up to , as well as in tropical and subtropical regions of central Africa in moist savanna and cleared former forest regions, particularly near rivers and streams. Adaptable snakes, Naja n.nigricollis occurs in southeastern Nigeria where their habitat <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> from rainforest to man-made farmlands, plantations, suburban areas, and a few fragmented forests. This species of cobra has found advantages in the drastic changes which have taken place in Nigeria's rainforests. A study by herpetologist Luca Luiselli suggests this snake now forages in much drier microhabitats.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the last}} 250 years, Wales <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> first from a {{predominantly}} agricultural country to an industrial, {{and now a}} post-industrial economy. Since the Second World War, the service sector has come {{to account for the}} majority of jobs, a feature typifying most advanced economies. Total headline Gross Value Added (GVA) in Wales in 2010 was £45.5 billion, or £15,145 per head of population; 74.0 per cent of the average for the UK total, the lowest GVA per head in the UK. In the three months to July 2010, the employment rate for working-age adults in Wales was 67 per cent, compared to 70.7 per cent across the UK as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Raziel <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> into a possum by Bavmorda, and Willow and {{his party}} return with her to shore. They are {{captured}} by Sorsha, who already has Madmartigan in custody, and are taken to a snowbound mountain camp of the Nockmaar army. Willow tries to restore Raziel, but turns her into a rook instead. Madmartigan is dosed with love dust by the brownies and declares his undying love for Sorsha. The prisoners escape and reach a village {{at the foot of}} a mountain, where they again encounter Airk and the remains of his army, recently defeated by Bavmorda's forces. Madmartigan proclaims his loyalty to the Nelwyn and promises to protect Willow and Elora.|$|E
5|$|The castle's fourth corner forms its {{gatehouse}}. Here {{the classic}} Edwardian gatehouse design <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> into an asymmetrical structure, with one tower {{much larger than}} the other. The gatehouse included portcullises, murder-holes and a drawbridge. Beyond the gatehouse lies a large barbican, inspired by a similar design of the period at the Tower of London and possibly built by the same workmen, designed to protect the causeway leading to the gatehouse. The barbican today is only half of its original height, and includes its own gate, designed to trap intruders within the inner defences. The gatehouse and barbican are linked by a stone causeway.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Istanbul had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s to complement the exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E
5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of Gates is a two-lane highway, the portion of Chili Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> into a major {{commercial}} destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large shopping plaza anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects to Howard Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

5|$|The portal {{takes the}} marine {{directly}} into Hell, where he proceeds to fight {{his way through}} the large number of demons to the Soul Cube, defeating its demonic guardian. The marine is then able to reinitialize the teleportation equipment left by research expeditions into Hell and return to the Delta Labs. Betruger, however, tells the marine that although the main UAC teleporter has been destroyed, Hell is opening a Hellmouth on Mars, capable of bringing millions of demons to Mars. Further in the Delta Labs, the marine encounters the injured Swann. Swann informs the marine that Kelly has been working with Hell for possibly the whole time, and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> by the demons. Telling the marine that Campbell has gone after Kelly, Swann gives the marine his PDA containing information on the location on the Hellmouth under the surface of Mars and assures him that he will try to make {{his way out of the}} base alone.|$|E
5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation. They say {{the man in the}} moon is a wood-stealer, who during church time on the holy sabbath committed a trespass in the wood, and was then transported to the moon as a punishment; there he may be seen with the axe on his back and the bundle of brushwood (dornwelle) in his hand. Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E
5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E

5|$|Through {{a series}} of miscommunications, Edward {{believes}} that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught over her apparent suicide attempt, Edward travels to Italy and attempts to provoke the Volturi (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive {{just in time to}} stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from committing suicide. Realizing that Bella is alive, Edward explains to Bella that he always loved her and only left to protect her. However, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her premonition, in which Bella <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>transformed,</b> with Aro, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks. Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote in favor of that much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay. Later, Jacob reminds Edward, the treaty Cullens and Quileutes made years before that they will not attack each other, as long as the Cullens do not feed on any humans, a necessity for Bella's transformation. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire after she marries him.|$|E
