Type of this {{research is}} descriptive qualitative research. While, the used method in this research is random by taking a part of sample from whole population on the research location, which is used as research object or respondent. The purpose {{of this research is}} to know the dominant factors in increasing <b>fisherman</b> <b>s</b> income besides natural factors in Blimbingsari villages. Data analysis technique used in this research is double linear regression analysis, which represents regression with more than two variables. This regression is done upon one dependent variable (Y) toward more than one independent variables (Xi). The regression has aims to know the effect of independent variable entirely to dependent variable. From data analysis results by using SPSS program, it can be known that the dominant factor in increasing <b>fisherman</b> <b>s</b> income is technological factor and its lifetime. The factors with negative effect or has reducing quality to <b>fisherman</b> <b>s</b> income is age, family responsibility, and education factors. So that, it can be concluded that if the fisherman want to increase their income, then the technological factor should be improved too...|$|R

The Turkish admiral and his entourage requested a riding tour of parts of the island which members of the Communal Council such as Ioannis Sigouros and others obliged.

Further up the production chain, there are practical barriers to joint efforts in training, market information, modernising equipment and managing shared fish stocks.

40|$|We present {{periodic}} Density Functional Theory {{calculations of}} the electronic properties of molecular junctions formed by amine-, and thiol-terminated alkane chains attached to two metal (Au, Ag) electrodes. Based on extensive analysis that includes molecular monolayers of varying densities, we establish {{a relationship between the}} alignment of the molecular energy levels and the interface dipoles, which shows that the band alignment (BA) in the limit of long, isolated chains is independent of the link group and can be computed from a reference system of non interacting molecule + metal electrodes. The main difference between the amine and thiol linkers is the effective dipole moment at the contact. This is very large, about 4. 5 D, for amine linkers, leading to a strong dependence of the BA on the monolayer density and a slow convergence to the isolated molecule limit. Instead, this convergence is fast for <b>S</b> <b>anchors</b> due to the very small, ~ 0. 2 D, effective dipoles at the contacts...|$|R

Its methodol-ogy is based on the systematic analysis of bibliographical and documentary sources, aiming to point out dilemmas, tensions and paths, at the conceptual level, regarding that relationship.

However, the U. S. imports fisheries products from countries that have significant cetacean bycatch problems which fisherman are not required to mitigate. I examined case studies of the California/Oregon drift gillnet, American lobster and Atlantic cod fisheries to demonstrate the costs of U. S. cetacean bycatch reductions and their economic affect. The cost of cetacean bycatch reduction in the California/Oregon drift gillnet fishery represents 1. 9 - 4. 5 % of the fishery's total ex-vessel value. The annual cost to the lobster fishery is 0. 7 - 6. 3 % of the industry's value and 3. 3 % - 13. 3 % of the ex-vessel landings value of an Atlantic cod vessel using sink gillnets is going to cetacean bycatch mitigation. U. <b>S.</b> <b>fishermen</b> face a competitive disadvantage because they have to bear the costs for mitigating cetacean bycatch while their foreign competitors do not. The U.

Thus, the third mobile OB-fold of S 1, which is spatially anchored near the surface of the -subunit, primarily recruits the Q RNA toward the -subunit, leading to the specific and efficient replication initiation of Q RNA, and S 1 functions as a replication initiation factor, beyond its established function in protein synthesis...|$|R
