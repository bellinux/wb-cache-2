5|$|After {{directing}} Finding Nemo, Stanton felt Pixar {{had created}} believable simulations of underwater physics and {{was willing to}} <b>direct</b> <b>a</b> film set largely in space.

It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E
40|$|Finding motifs is {{important}} for understanding {{the structure of a}} network in terms of its building blocks. A network motif is a sub graph that appears significantly more often in a real network than expected in randomised networks. This paper looks at motif detection for a special class of <b>directed</b> networks: <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic networks. Normally, randomised networks are obtained using the switching algorithm. This algorithm preserves the in-degree and out-degree of each node. However, it does not preserve the <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic nature of <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic networks. Karrer and Newman introduced an algorithm that does preserve the <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic property but which may create multiple edges. This paper introduces alternative null-models that maintain the degree sequences, <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic property and do not introduce multiple edges. It is shown that there are explicit formulas for the number of occurrences of each possible 3 -node pattern in such random networks. Even though the different random network models result in networks with different properties, the patterns that are keyed as network motifs in three real-world <b>directed</b> <b>a</b> cyclic networks do not depend on the choice of null-model. However, when using the switching model as a null-model, sometimes anti-motifs are found that contain directed cycles...|$|R
