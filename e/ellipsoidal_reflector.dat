25|$|The Electronic Theatre Controls (ETC) Source Four (also known unofficially as Source 4 or S4) is an <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> {{spotlight}} (ERS) used {{in stage}} lighting. First released in 1992, the Source Four {{was invented by}} David Cunningham and features an improved lamp and reflector compared to previous ERS designs, tool-free lamp adjustment, and a rotating, interchangeable shutter barrel.

25|$|The <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> {{spotlight}} (ERS), {{also known}} as profile (after its ability to project the silhouette or profile of anything put in the gate) (UK) and Découpe (French), is the most abundant instrument type currently in theatrical use. The flexibility of the ERS allows it to fulfill the bulk of lighting roles in the theater. They are sometimes known as a profile spotlight (in Europe) or by their brand names, especially the Source Four (a popular lantern from ETC) and 2 the Leko (short for Lekolite, from Strand lighting).|$|E

For a two beam laser, this is best achieved using a fast catadioptric system. In designing such a system, the total thickness of refracting material must be minimized, to avoid loss of optical quality through small scale self focusing. Such a system is being fabricated for use with the ARGUS laser.

25|$|Scoop {{lights or}} scoops are {{circular}} fixtures {{that do not}} have any lenses. They have an <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> {{at the back of the}} fixture that directs the light out of the fixture. Since they do not have any sort of lens system they are cheaper than other fixtures. However, the light cannot be focused at all (even PARs allow more control than scoops). Scoops are most often used to flood the stage with light from above, or to light backdrops. Scoops can have gels affixed. Occasionally they are used as work lights (see below).|$|E
25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and sharpness of the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|E
25|$|The {{reflector}} {{affects the}} quality and directionality of the light output. A reflector is located behind or around the light source {{in such a way}} as to direct more light towards the lens or opening. Each unit has a characteristic reflector, used in conjunction with the lens (or lack thereof) to create the desired effect. An <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> has a lamp set at one focus point of an ellipsoid-shaped reflector that bounces the light and focuses it at the second focus point of the ellipse. This focuses the beam of light into a tight beam. Ellipsoidal reflectors often are used for tight, focusable spots, although they can be used for floodlights, such as in scoops (see below). A parabolic reflector has a lamp set at the focus point of a parabola-shaped reflector that bounces the light in parallel beams away from the reflector. There is no point at which the light converges, so the light is unfocusable. Parabolic reflectors are used for lights intended to provide an unfocused wash, such as PAR cans.|$|E

A means for further improvement of the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector's</b> focusing properties thus its performance is herein investigated. The main differentiating factor of our new approach is that the receiving antenna is more realistically modelled and also covered by two layers of different dielectric properties. The present paper provides details on the electromagnetic theoretical analysis of the problem and presents numerical results for the electric field distribution inside the head model, using two main operating frequencies, namely 0. 5 GHz and 1. 5 GHz for four distinct cases.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of {{investigations}} of a wide band soft X-ray source and a lobster eye optic specially designed for collecting radiation of the source. Soft X-rays in the wavelength range from about 3 nm to 20 nm were produced {{as a result of}} irradiation of a doublestream gas puff target with laser pulses of energy 0. 8 J and time duration of about 3 ns. The spectra and absolute energies of soft X-ray pulses for different gas puff targets were measured. The plasma size was measured for the optimum radiation parameters of the source. A wide wavelength range lobster eye optic having a collection angle of 0. 1 sr was specially designed to focus the soft X-ray radiation of the source. It consists of two orthogonal stacks of ellipsoidal mirrors forming a double-focusing device. The ellipsoidal surfaces are covered by a layer of gold that has relatively high reflectivity at the wavelength range between 8 - 20 nm up to about 10 degrees of the incidence angle. Variable distances between the reflectors enable the collection of practically the whole radiation entering the optic. The ray tracing simulations of focusing of the optics were performed either for a point or a finite size X-ray source. The intensity distribution of focused radiation was also measured {{with the use of a}} visible and the soft X-ray source. However focusing in the case of a lobster eye optic is not perfect, it appears that the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflectors</b> should create a focus spot with the size comparable to the X-ray source dimensions...|$|R

The term Profile Spot used in the UK refers to a focussing spotlight which may, or may not use the <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> design, this design was not common in the UK until the 1970s and many UK and European manufacturers have still to adopt this design instead preferring a twin PC lens design.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proprietary}} HPL (High Performance Lamp) lamp uses {{a compact}} filament, which concentrates the most light {{where it is}} efficient in an <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector.</b> [...] At 575 watts, the HPL lamp in a Source Four produces light equivalent to a 1000 watt spotlight using previous technology. This lower energy consumption saves electricity and creates less heat. [...] The HPL lamp also gives the fixture its name. The lamp (light source) has four filament strands, hence Source Four. It is also available in 375 W and 750 W versions, {{at a variety of}} rated supply voltages. HPL lamps are also available in longer life versions that reduce the color temperature from 3250 K to 3050 K to give the lamp a life of around 15002000 hours as opposed to the 300-400 hour life of the standard HPL.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} 3. 168 kW solid-state {{solar thermal}} simulator (SSSTS), capable of supplying ~ 30, 000 suns at a focal plane via a fibre optical delivery, has been developed. The source consists of 41 diode lasers, each operated at a wavelength {{and power of}} ~ 915 nm and ~ 80 watt, respectively. The SSSTS provides a semi-top hat radiation profile and can be focused to a diameter of ~ 10. 5 mm. The electro-optical power efficiency of the SSSTS was evaluated to be 55 %, where the maximum value of the uniform radiation flux exceeds 36. 6 MW/m 2. As such, the present technology is relevant to solar thermal applications that are not wavelength-sensitive or where narrow line-width is desirable. Additionally, the fibre optical delivery feature enables ease of direction onto a suitable target, without the need of large <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflectors</b> usually employed for the conventional arc solar simulators. To demonstrate the new SSSTS, ZnO:Zn particles were introduced {{into the path of}} the radiation to investigate the change in their own temperature by using the laser induced phosphorescence technique (LIP). The temperature of the averaged particles was measured at a different radiation flux over a ~ 87 mm 2 cross sectional area. A change in the average particle temperature of up to 225 °C was detected within the measurement volume when the SSSTS was operated at a flux of ~ 30, 000 suns. The unique characteristics of the SSSTS, namely, the uniformity, high power flux, efficiency, ease of delivery, and precise control of the radiation flux responds to the current demands of solar thermal research.

40|$|We report {{improvements}} in the scanning speed and standoff range of an ultra-wide bandwidth terahertz (THz) imaging radar for person-borne concealed object detection. Fast beam scanning of the single-transceiver radar is accomplished by rapidly deflecting a flat, light-weight subreflector in a confocal Gregorian optical geometry. With RF back-end improvements also implemented, the radar imaging rate has increased {{by a factor of}} about 30 compared to that achieved previously in a 4 m standoff prototype instrument. In addition, a new 100 cm diameter <b>ellipsoidal</b> aluminum <b>reflector</b> yields beam spot diameters of approximately 1 cm over a 50 x 50 cm field of view at a range of 25 m, although some aberrations are observed that probably arise from misaligned optics. Through-clothes images of a concealed threat at 25 m range, acquired in 5 seconds, are presented, and the impact of reduced signal-to-noise from an even faster frame rate is analyzed. These results inform the system requirements for eventually achieving sub-second or video-rate THz radar imaging...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} design of a {{reflector}} system that can rapidly scan and refocus a terahertz beam for high-resolution standoff imaging applications. The proposed optical system utilizes a confocal Gregorian geometry with a small mechanical rotating mirror and an axial displacement of the feed. For operation at submillimeter wavelengths and standoff ranges of many meters, the imaging targets are electrically very close to the antenna aperture. Therefore the main reflector surface must be an ellipse, instead of a parabola, in order to achieve the best imaging performance. Here we demonstrate how a simple design equivalence can be used to generalize {{the design of}} a Gregorian reflector system based on a paraboloidal main reflector to one with an <b>ellipsoidal</b> main <b>reflector.</b> The system parameters are determined by minimizing the optical path length error, and the results are validated with numerical simulations from the commercial antenna software package GRASP.

2500|$|Direction {{refers to}} the shape, quality and {{evenness}} of a lamp's output. [...] The pattern of light an instrument makes is largely determined by three factors. [...] The first are {{the specifics of the}} lamp, reflector and lens assembly. [...] Different mounting positions for the lamp (axial, base up, base down), different sizes and shapes of reflector {{and the nature of the}} lens (or lenses) being used can all affect the pattern of light. [...] Secondly, the specifics of how the lamp is focused affect its pattern. [...] In <b>ellipsoidal</b> <b>reflector</b> spotlights (ERS) or profile spotlights, there are two beams of light emitted from the lamp. [...] When the cones of both intersect at the throw distance (the distance to the stage), the lamp has a sharply defined 'hard' edge. [...] When the two cones do not intersect at that distance, the edge is fuzzy and 'soft'. [...] Depending on which beam (direct or reflected) is outside the other, the pattern may be 'thin and soft' or 'fat and soft'. Lastly, a gobo or break up pattern may be applied to ERSs and similar instruments. [...] This is typically a thin sheet of metal with a shape cut into it. [...] It is inserted into the instrument near its aperture. [...] Gobos, or templates, [...] come in many shapes, but often include leaves, waves, stars and similar patterns.|$|E
