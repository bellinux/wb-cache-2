40|$|Hydradenomas, {{also known}} as nodular hydradenomas are usually rare seen {{cutaneous}} eccrine tumors. They are usually seen on the scalp, trunk and extremities. Hydradenomas occur most commonly in the adulthood. They can reach very large sizes, taking the name of giant <b>hydradenoma</b> which may present with tenderness and change in skin color. The differential diagnoses must include cystic hygroma, soft tissue tumors like fibroma, synovial cell sarcoma, osteochondroma and neuroblastoma metastasis in childhood. Here, a 14 -year-old boy is presented with a giant clear cell <b>hydradenoma</b> case on the left thigh. Acoording to the furthest literature we have reached; {{this is the first}} case in which the giant clear-cell <b>hydradenoma</b> was reported on the thigh location in childhood...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to present {{clinical}} features, diagnostic procedures and surgical treatment of a rare ear tumor. We report a case of 78 year old female with hidradenoma of the external auditory canal. Patient had a sensation of pain and fullness with permanent ottorhea from the right ear for one year. Temporal bone computed tomography showed a tumor of the external ear, 6 centimeters in diameter, without bone, temporomandibular joint or intracranial invasion; the tumor was limited medially by the tympanic membrane. Biopsy was performed and pathohistology finding was: <b>hydradenoma</b> nodulare atypicum. Surgical intervention and wide tumor removal in general endotracheal anesthesia was performed. One year after the surgery there was no sign of tumor recurrence. Hidradenoma is rare ear tumor arising from the epithelial cells of sweat glands of the external auditory canal. Radiological evaluation and pathohistology confirmation of hidradenoma is necessary and wide excision of the tumor is the treatment of choice...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{present a}} new {{terminology}} for vulvar cytology {{based on the}} Bethesda System. STUDY DESIGN: Material for cytologic diagnosis was collected by scraping vulvar lesions with a scalpel blade. RESULTS: This terminology was presented {{for the first time}} at an International Academy of Cytology conference in Kamuela, Hawaii, in 1997. It is based on the Bethesda System (1994) and WHO system. We recommend the following elements for a vulvar cytologic report: adequacy of specimen, general categorization and descriptive diagnosis. The terminology of vulvar lesions includes benign cellular changes (vulvitis and reactive changes) and epithelial cell abnormalities. If epithelial cell abmormalities are found, the following diagnoses are made: atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, LSIL, HSIL and vulvar tumors. The most common epithelial tumors are papillary <b>hydradenoma,</b> squamous cell carcinoma and Paget's disease. Five hundred and sixty-three patients with vulvar cytology were examined in our department over 11 years, including 132 with normal vulvas, 220 with vulvitis, 145 with VSIL and 56 with squamous cell carcinoma. Histologic examination of 147 patients (26. 11 %) showed a sensitivity of 97. 70 % for benignity and 98. 21 % for malignancy and 98. 87 % and 94. 82 % for specificity, respectively. CONCLUSION: Vulvar cytodiagnosis with the new terminology allows both reporting on the type of vulvar lesions and cancer detection...|$|E
