The goal of the practical part is to apply the theoretical finding to the change from tax <b>evidence</b> <b>into</b> accounting of a concrete businessman, who is obligated to change into accounting on the date 1 / 1 / 2006. The practical part targets transferring businessmans items of assets and liabilities from tax <b>evidence</b> <b>into</b> accounting. In the following the tax incidence is analysed.

5|$|A primary {{theme of}} the defense was that the CPUSA sought to convert the US to {{socialism}} by education, not by force.

Starobin, p 207. The defense attempted to introduce documents <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> which represented the CPUSA's advocacy of peace, claiming that these policies superseded the older texts that the prosecution had introduced which emphasized violence. Medina excluded most of the material proposed by the defense because it did not directly pertain to the specific documents the prosecution had produced.

5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged.

A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|E
5|$|Schmerber {{submitted}} {{an appeal}} to the Supreme Court of the United States, which granted certiorari on January 17, 1966. In his brief, Schmerber argued, inter alia, that the warrantless blood test violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, as well as his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office represented the State of California on appeal. In their brief, the City Attorney argued that the blood test did not violate the Fourth Amendment because the seizure was conducted incident to a lawful arrest. The City Attorney also argued that admitting the sample <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> did not violate Schmerber's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination because blood is not testimonial evidence under the Fifth Amendment. Oral arguments were held on April 25, 1966, and the Court issued its opinion on June 20, 1966.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of November 12, 1964, Armando Schmerber and a {{passenger}} were driving home after drinking at a tavern and bowling alley in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California when their car skidded {{off the road and}} struck a tree. Schmerber and his companion were injured in the crash and taken to a hospital for treatment. When investigating police officers arrived at the hospital, they asked Schmerber to submit a sample of his blood, but Schmerber refused. Although they did not possess a search warrant, officers instructed attending physicians to take a blood sample from Schmerber. The blood sample indicated that Schmerber was intoxicated, and he was placed under arrest. The blood sample was ultimately admitted <b>into</b> <b>evidence</b> at trial, and Schmerber was convicted for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquors. Schmerber objected to the admissibility of the blood sample, claiming that the police violated his rights to due process, his privilege against self-incrimination, his right to counsel, and his right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures. The Appellate Department of the California Superior Court rejected Schmerber's arguments, and the California District Court of Appeal declined to review his case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Often {{knowledge}} from human experts {{is expressed in}} the form of uncertain implication rules, such as “if A then B” with a certain degree of confidence. Therefore, it is important to include such a representation of knowledge into the process of reasoning under uncertainty. Incorporating inference rules based on the material implication of propositional logic <b>into</b> the <b>evidence</b> theory framework (e. g. Dempster-Shafer, Smets, Dezert-Smarandache theory etc.) is conceptually simple, which is not the case with classical probability theory. In this paper, a transformation for converting uncertain implication rules <b>into</b> an <b>evidence</b> theory framework will be presented and it will be shown that it satisfies the main properties of logical implication, namely reflexivity, transitivity and contrapositivity...|$|R
