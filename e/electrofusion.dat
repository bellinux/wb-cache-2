The pipes to be joined are trimmed, cleaned, inserted into the <b>electrofusion</b> fitting (with a temporary clamp if required) and a voltage (typically 40V) is applied using a device called an <b>electrofusion</b> processor. The processor controls how much voltage is applied, and for how long, depending on the fitting in use. As current is applied to the resistive wire, the coils heat up and melt the inside of the fitting and the outside of the pipe wall which weld together producing a very strong homogeneous joint. The assembly is then left to cool for a specified time. The joints produced tend to be more reliable than threaded fittings sealed with O-rings.|$|E

In 1959 Tarkowski showed that a single blastomere isolated from a 2-cell stage mouse embryo is fully able to develop {{and the result is}} healthy and fertile mouse (Tarkowski, 1959, Nature). His next achievement was, reported in 1961, birth of first chimaeric mice produced experimentally by injecting blastomeres from one embryo to genetically different embryo (Tarkowski, 1961;Nature). Since then the chimaera has become a useful tool, used in producing genetically modified animals (in this technique genetically engineered stem cells are aggregated with developing embryo. Chimaera obtained this way is phenetypically changed and passes it to the next generation). In 1966 Tarkowski developed a technique which enabled observing chromosome in oocytes, which has been widely used in early studies of embryo (Tarkowski, 1967;Cytogenetics). This Publication is often citaded, although has been publicised over 50 years ago. In later years professor Tarkowski with his collaborators showed {{for the first time in}} history that partenogenetically activated mouse oocytes are able of developing until mid-gestation (Tarkowski, et al.,1970;Nature).

First, the amplitudes of the electric field were determined spectrofluorometrically, where sufficient permeabilization in hypotonic buffer occurred for B 16 -F 1 and CHO cells. In further <b>electrofusion</b> experiments 14 ± 4 % of fused cells for B 16 -F 1 and 6 ± 1 % for CHO was achieved.
