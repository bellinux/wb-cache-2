25|$|Xenon short-arc lamps have a {{negative}} temperature coefficient like other <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps.</b> They are operated at low-voltage, high-current, DC and started with a high voltage pulse of 20 to 50kV. As an example, a 450 W lamp operates normally at 18 V and 25 A once started. They are also inherently unstable, prone to phenomena such as plasma oscillation and thermal runaway. Because of these characteristics, xenon short-arc lamps require a proper power supply.|$|E

2500|$|Similar {{structure}} but not fluorescent, germicidal lamps {{depend on}} the property that spectrum of 254nm kills most germs. Germicidal lamps contain no phosphor at all (making them mercury vapor <b>gas</b> <b>discharge</b> <b>lamps</b> rather than fluorescent) and their tubes are made of fused quartz that is transparent to the UV light emitted by the mercury discharge. The 254nm UV emitted by these tubes will kill germs and ionize oxygen to ozone. In addition it can cause eye and skin damage {{and should not be}} used or observed without eye and skin protection. Besides their uses to kill germs and create ozone, they are sometimes used by geologists to identify certain species of minerals by the color of their fluorescence. When used in this fashion, they are fitted with filters {{in the same way as}} blacklight-blue lamps are; the filter passes the short-wave UV and blocks the visible light produced by the mercury discharge. They are also used in some EPROM erasers. Germicidal lamps have designations beginning with G (meaning germicidal), rather than F, for example G30T8 for a 30-watt, [...] diameter, [...] long germicidal lamp (as opposed to an F30T8, which would be the fluorescent lamp of the same size and rating).|$|E
