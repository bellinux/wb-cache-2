50|$|A {{baseline}} {{in medicine}} is information {{found at the}} beginning of a study or other initial known value which is used for comparison with later data. The concept of a baseline is essential to the daily practice of medicine in order to establish a relative rather than absolute meaning to data. The meaning of baseline in medicine is very similar to that of the running baseline (baseball) being the direct path that a baserunner is taking to the base he is in route to. If the baserunner is outside the 3 <b>foot</b> <b>margin</b> around his running baseline, then he is considered out. Whereas if a patient with kidney failure (whose creatinine is usually 3.0 mg/dL) suddenly has a creatinine of 5.0 mg/dL, then his creatinine is out of his normal. For that person with kidney failure, absolute normal no longer applies because he will never again be able to obtain an absolutely normal creatinine level (0.5-1.2 mg/dL) with kidneys that no longer function properly.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{proposes that}} markedness constraints in Optimality Theory are lenient: a form can be marked {{with respect to}} a constraint only if there is another form that is unmarked. Thus, no constraint bans the least marked thing. The central consequence of this idea is that there are no economy constraints that penalize structure as such. Economy effects follow from the interaction of lenient markedness constraints. Economy constraints are shown to be not only unnecessary but actually harmful: their very presence in C ON predicts unattested patterns that remove structure regardless of markedness. ^ Chapter 2 develops the theory of CON and argues that various structural economy effects (preferences for smaller structures over larger ones and for fewer structures over more) follow from constraint interaction. Also addressed are economy effects that involve the deletion of input structure, including foot-sized maximum effects in truncation and syllable-sized and segment-sized maximum effects in reduplication. OT 2 ̆ 7 s economy constraints of the *STRUC family are argued to produce unattested patterns under re-ranking and are excluded from CON as a matter of principle. ^ Chapter 3 examines metrical syncope in Hopi, Tonkawa, and Southeastern Tepehuan. Different patterns fall out from the interaction of the same metrical markedness constraints in language-specific rankings. All of these constraints have other, non-economy effects—in principle, they can be satisfied by the addition of structure as well as by removal of structure. Metrical shortening and syncope remove marked structure, not all structure: the well-formedness of an output is determined by the distribution of weight in its feet and exhaustivity of footing, not by the number of syllables, moras, and feet. ^ Chapter 4 examines differential syncope in Lillooet, Lushootseed, and the Lebanese and Mekkan dialects of Arabic. Under the leniency hypothesis, there are constraints against low-sonority syllable nuclei and foot peaks but not high-sonority ones; likewise, there are constraints against high-sonority <b>foot</b> <b>margins</b> but not high-sonority vowels in general. The interaction of lenient constraints cannot duplicate the effects of economy constraints. There are real crosslinguistic asymmetries in attested differential syncope patterns that can only be explained if we abandon the notion that “everything is marked. ”...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} new {{numerical}} surface process model {{allowing us to}} take into account submarine erosion processes due either to submarine landslides or to hyperpycnal currents. A first set of models show that the frequency of hyperpycnal flows influences the development of submarine canyons at the mouth of continental rivers. Further experiments show that an increase in submarine slope leads to faster regressive canyon erosion and a more dentritic canyon network, whereas increasing the height of the unstable sediment pile located on the shelf break leads to wider and less dendritic canyons. The models are then applied to the western segment of the north Ligurian margin (northwestern Mediterranean), which displays numerous submarine canyons with various sizes and morphologies. From west to east, canyon longitudinal profiles as well as margin-perpendicular profiles progressively change from moderately steep, concave-up shapes to steeper linear to convex-up shapes suggesting increasing eastward margin uplift. Moreover, the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin</b> is affected by a marked slope increase with evidences of mass transport due to landslides. Numerical models which reproduce well the North Ligurian margin morphologic features indicate that {{the western part of the}} margin is submitted to rather low (i. e. 0. 4 [*]mm[*]yr− 1) uplift and intense submarine erosion due to frequent hyperpycnal currents, whereas the eastern part bears more rapid (i. e. 0. 7 [*]mm[*]yr− 1) uplift and has little or no hyperpycnal currents.

The high temperature/low pressure(HT/LP) thermal imprint of the extensional event is studied thanksto a dataset of more than hundred peak temperature measurementsby Raman spectroscopy of the carbonaceous material (RSCM). Thepre- and syn-rift metasediments are characterized by an intense, synmetamorphicductile deformation. Focusing on several key-localitiesof the NPZ, we examine the emplacement conditions of the peridotitesin response to this extreme crustal thinning. Geological evidencessuch as the occurrence of peridotite bodies directly underlying metamorphicpre-rift sediments indicate an early attenuation of the rifted continentalcrust. Moreover, syn-rift, Albian-Cenomanian flysch sequenceswere deposited synchronously with the syn-metamorphic ductile deformationof the pre-rift sequences. All along the Internal MetamorphicZone (IMZ), the base of the flysch deposits also recorded the HT tectonicevent. Such a synchronicity between geological events, which aregenerally separated in time, is not common in mountain belts. We examinehow tectonics, metamorphism and sedimentation may be activein a single basin during extension. We propose an original mechanismfor the evolution of the basins involving continuous basal extraction ofthe pre-rift metamorphic sediments.

40|$|International audience[1] The {{origin of}} the Algerian margin {{remains one of the}} key {{questions}} still discussed in the Western Mediterranean sea, due to the imprecise nature and kinematics of the associated basin during the Neogene. For the first time, the deep structure of the Maghrebian margin was explored during the SPIRAL seismic survey. In this work, we present a N-S transect off Tipaza (west of Algiers), a place where the margin broadens due to a topographic high (Khayr-al-Din Bank). New deep penetration seismic profiles allow us to image the sedimentary sequence in the Algerian basin and the crustal structure at the continent-ocean boundary. Modeling of the wide-angle data shows thinning of the basement, from more than 15 km in the continental upper margin to only 5 - 6 km of oceanic-type basement in the Algerian basin, and reveals a very narrow or absent transitional zone. Analysis of the deep structure of the margin indicates features inherited from its complex evolution: (1) an oceanic-type crust in the deep basin, (2) similarities with margins formed in a transform-type setting, (3) a progressive deepening of the whole sedimentary cover, and the thickening of the Plio-Quaternary sediments at the <b>margin</b> <b>foot,</b> coeval with (4) a downward flexure of the basement in the basin. These features argue for a multiphased evolution of the margin, including (1) an early stage of rifting and/or spreading, (2) a late transcurrent episode related to the westward migration of the Alboran domain, and (3) a diffuse Plio-Quaternary compressional reactivation of the margin...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this talk}} is to {{summarize}} recent advances {{in our understanding of}} the tectonic evolution of {{the western part of the}} North African margin, where most of the plate convergence between Africa and Europe is taken up today. Although this plate limit appears to be poorly defined (Figure 1), its central part (Algeria) evidences several large, overlapping active thrust faults and folds that are found from the Atlas domain on land to the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin</b> offshore. Among others, the 1980 Mw 7. 3 El Asnam and 2003 Mw 6. 9 Boumerdes-Zemmouri earthquakes provide support for this active deformation and call for improving earthquake mitigation. I review the recent geophysical and geological observations that argue for a clear segmentation of the fault-and-fold network, both offshore and onshore, and for strain focussing that is apparently migrating from the collisional belt on land (Miocene suture zone of the Tethyan, Maghrebian ocean) towards the foot of the Algerian margin. Fault activity offshore was until recently ignored or not explored, whereas available geodetic and seismological data indicate that a significant part (about one third) of the relative plate convergence may be taken up there (Figure 1; Serpelloni et al., 2007). Plio-Quaternary growth strata within uplifted areas are the first evidence for this ongoing activity. They are found as stepwise, en-échelon systems on the slope and in the deep basin, from eastern Algiers to the Annaba coastline (Figure 2).

40|$|International audienceShaking by {{moderate}} to large earthquakes in the Mediterranean Sea has proved {{in the past}} to potentially trigger catastrophic sediment collapse and flow. On 21 May 2003, a magnitude 6. 8 earthquake located near Boumerdès (central Algerian coast) triggered large turbidity currents responsible for 29 submarine cable breaks {{at the foot of the}} continental slope over ~ 150 km from west to east. Seafloor bathymetry and backscatter imagery show the potential imprints of the 2003 event and of previous events. Large slope scarps resulting from active deformation may locally enhance sediment instabilities, although faults are not directly visible at the seafloor. Erosion is evident at the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin</b> and along the paths of the numerous canyons and valleys. Cable breaks are located at the outlets of submarine valleys and in areas of turbiditic levee overspilling and demonstrate the multi-source and multi-path character of the 2003 turbiditic event. Rough estimates of turbidity flow velocity are not straightforward because of the multiple breaks along the same cable, but seem compatible with those measured in other submarine cable break studies elsewhere. While the signature of the turbidity currents is mostly erosional on the continental slope, turbidite beds alternating with hemipelagites accumulate in the distal reaches of sediment dispersal systems. In perspective, more chronological work on distal turbidite successions offshore Algeria offers promising perspectives for paleoseismology reconstructions based on turbidite dating, if synchronous turbidites along independent sedimentary dispersal systems are found to support triggering by major earthquakes. Preliminary results on sediment core PSM-KS 23 off Boumerdès typically show a 800 -yr interval between turbidites during the Holocene, in accordance with the estimated mean seismic cycle on land, even if at this stage it is not yet possible to prove the earthquake origin of all the turbidites...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Algiers region, {{northern}} Algeria, {{is known}} to be seismically active, with recurrent large (M> 6) earthquakes. Because of the lack of high-resolution bathymetry, the offshore structures remained for a long time poorly known. Thanks to a new marine data base (MARADJA 2003 cruise), the offshore part of the margin is accurately mapped, and new active and recent structures are described. West of the bay of Algiers, the margin enlarges, forming the Khayr al Din bank, interpreted as a tilted block of the passive margin born during the opening of the Algero-Provençal basin. At the slope break, a 80 km-long fault-tip Quaternary fold, namely the Khayr al Din fault, extends at the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin</b> off NW Algiers and represents the largest active structure of the coastal area, together with the Sahel anticline. We also map {{for the first time a}} set of overlapping, en echelon active folds in the upper part of the Khayr al Din bank, located off previously known active structures on land. Most of these faults represent actually a threat for the Algiers region in terms of seismic hazard but also geological hazards, such as tsunamis, as most of them depicts significant dimensions and slip rates. The highest long-term horizontal shortening rate is found on the Khayr al Din fault and is estimated at 0. 5 ± 0. 1 mm/yr, with a maximal magnitude of 7. 3, which provides one of the highest seismogenic potential in the region. A new tectonic framework for the Algiers region is proposed, in which the main south-dipping offshore structure, of opposite vergence relative to most thrusts on land, appears to be nowadays the main driving fault system, as also found further east in the Boumerdès (M 6. 8) 2003 rupture zone. The overall apparent pop-up structure of the recent and active faults may result from a progressive migration of the plate limit from the Late Miocene, north-dipping suture zone on land, to the Quaternary, south-dipping main Khayr al Din fault at sea, suggesting a process of subduction inception...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} the results of a deep seismic survey across the north Algerian margin, based on the combination of 2 -D multichannel and wide-angle seismic data simultaneously recorded by 41 ocean bottom seismometers deployed along a north-south line extending 180 km off Jijel into the Algerian offshore basin, and 25 land stations deployed along a 100 -km-long line, cutting through the Lesser Kabylia and the Tellian thrust-belt. The final model obtained using forward modelling of the wide-angle data and pre-stack depth migration of the seismic reflection data provides an unprecedented view of the sedimentary and crustal structure of the margin. The sedimentary layers in the Algerian basin are 3. 75 km thick to the north and up to 4. 5 - 5 km thick at the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin.</b> They are characterized by seismic velocities from 1. 9 to 3. 8 km s(- 1). Messinian salt formations are about 1 km thick in the study area, and are modelled and imaged using a velocity between 3. 7 and 3. 8 km s(- 1). The crust in the deep sea basin is about 4. 5 km thick and of oceanic origin, presenting two distinct layers with a high gradient upper crust (4. 7 - 6. 1 km s(- 1)) and a low gradient lower crust (6. 2 - 7. 1 km s(- 1)). The upper-mantle velocity is constrained to 7. 9 km s(- 1). The ocean-continent transition zone is very narrow between 15 and 20 km wide. The continental crust reaches 25 km thickness as imaged from the most landward station and thins to 5 km over a less than 70 km distance. The continental crust presents steep and asymmetric upper- and lower-crustal geometry, possibly due to either asymmetric rifting of the margin, an underplated body, or flow of lower crustal material towards the ocean basin.

We classified and mapped 12 echo types {{according to their}} sub-bottom acoustic facies observed on this margin on 2 - 5. 2 kHz Chirp echo-sounder data (MARADJA 2003 cruise). The echo-character maps are interpreted in terms of sedimentary processes: the B 1 echo type (parallel to subparallel high- to low-amplitude sub-bottom reflections), mainly in the deep basin, corresponds to hemipelagic sedimentation; R 1 (prolonged single echo with no sub-bottoms) and R 2 (small irregular overlapping hyperbolae) echo types, generally near or in canyon systems, are associated with turbidity currents or more rarely to contour currents or mass-transport deposits such as slumps, slides and debris flows; the transparent echo types (T 1 -T 5) and R 3 (chaotic lens of low-amplitude reflections on top of higher amplitude), often located {{at the foot of}} the slope or canyons walls, typically indicate mass-transport deposits (like slides) or turbidites. Large zones that display a large variety of echo types are evidenced in the study area and are generally associated with turbidity currents, but could also be associated with bottom currents. It appears that active tectonics plays a significant role in this part of the margin which presents a few active faults offshore but also a strong and relatively frequent seismicity onland. The general pattern of the distribution of mass-transport deposits is particular - i. e. many but small slides all along the margin - and suggests a probable triggering by recurrent earthquake shakings. However, active tectonics is not the only factor influencing the deposition pattern, as some zones seem characterized by predominant strong turbidity currents transporting sediments far away from the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin,</b> whereas others depict retrogressive erosion features on the slope, i. e. small slides scarps in gullies rather than transport by turbidity currents. In particular, the rivers sediment discharge fluxes and the geomorphologic characteristics of the margin seem to be very important factors too...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Messinian {{salinity}} crisis (MSC) {{is characterized}} by gigantic erosion that remodels the margins while a thick, essentially evaporitic and detrital, sedimentary sequence forms in the deep basins. Based on recent (MAURESC, 2003) and earlier (MESEA 1, 1990; MAGIRAA, 1996; GEOBREST, 2002) seismic reflection data, this work brings to light {{the record of the}} MSC on the Provençal margin, which has until now been rarely explored from this perspective. Beyond its strictly regional interest, this study fits into a larger synthesis of MSC seismic markers in the Mediterranean and Black Sea marine domain [Lofi et al., 2011] and employs the new nomenclature established on this occasion. The results obtained reveal a Messinian detrital body (CU unit) of 625 metres maximum thickness at the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin,</b> accumulating at the mouths of the principal canyons. Its form, facies and extension assimilate it to clastic fans, fed by subaerial erosion linked to the MSC. The relative geometry of CU and the Messinian units MU and UU deposited in the deep basin give indications to their chronostratigraphic relations. The deposition of the CU unit is posterior to the basal part of the mobile unit consisting of halite (MU), but contemporary to its top. These results agree with the recent scenarii, which propose that the precipitation of MU in the basin began early, during the lowering of the sea level, and ended at a low level during the MSC [Blanc, 2000; Martin et al., 2001; Sage et al., 2005; Ryan, 2009]. The UU unit surmounts MU and is subdivided into two sub-units with perceptibly different seismic facies : UU 1 at the base and UU 2 at the summit. UU 1 could correspond to a unit containing more halite and/or more clastic material than UU 2. The UU 1 sub-unit could be partially contemporary to the CU unit. Concerning salt tectonics and its markers, three structural provinces have been evidenced in the sector of study, respectively : an upslope domain in extension (normal faults), an intermediary domain in translation (tabular MU) and a downslope domain in contraction (salt diapirs). These domains are directly linked to the gravity spreading and/or gliding of the brittle sedimentary cover formed by the CU, UU and Plio-Quatenary units and of the mobile level, MU. In the study area, a close relation between the distribution and thickness of CU and salt tectonics has additionally been evidenced at the mouths of the large Messinian canyons, being best expressed where CU is thick...|$|R
50|$|The first pair {{of nerves}} come from the {{olfactory}} ganglions, and are large, but of no great length; they divide into several filaments {{as they enter the}} base of the dorsal tentacles. The second pair pass from the under surface of the anterior border of the cerebroid ganglions, not far from their union with the olfactory ganglions; these nerves go to supply the upper surface of the channel of the mouth. The third and fourth pairs of nerves issue from the same ganglions, but considerably behind the second pair; these also go to the channel of the mouth; the third probably sending a branch to the oral tentacles. A strong cord passes off close to the root of the fourth pair: these cords curve round the oesophagus and are united to the outer extremities of the buccal ganglions, forming the anterior collar. The fifth pair of nerves issue apparently from the outer border of the branchial ganglia, and go to the skin {{by the side of the}} head. The sixth pair are small, and come from the upper surface of the branchial ganglions; these nerves go to the skin of the sides of the back. The seventh, much larger than the sixth, emerge from the posterior margin of the same ganglions, and supply the dorsal skin, and apparently likewise the cerata. These are the branchial nerves. The eighth and ninth pairs are large nerves; they issue from the outer border of the pedial ganglions and go to the <b>foot.</b> The posterior <b>margins</b> of these ganglions are united by a stout, shortish commissure, composed of two or three cords, which, passing below the gullet, form the great oesophageal collar. The tenth pair of nerves are given off from the posterior margin of the buccal ganglions; these pass into the buccal mass and go to supply the tongue. The eleventh pair, issuing from the outer extremities of the buccal ganglions, are distributed to the muscles of the buccal mass. The twelfth pair come from the apex of the gastro-oesophageal ganglions, and being applied to the gullet, each divides into two branches, one of which supplies the upper portion of that tube, the other, passing down it, goes to the stomach as in the other nudibranchs. The thirteenth pair are large; these are the hepatic nerves; they issue from the buccal mass and probably (as in genus Aeolidia) are connected at their origin with ganglions, which must be looked upon as belonging to the sympathetic system. Immediately on emerging from the buccal mass, they are connected to the buccal ganglions at their point of union with the gastrooesophageal, and then, arching outwards and upwards, pass from within the anterior oesophageal collar, and go to supply the glands of the cerata.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Ligurian basin, western Mediterranean Sea, {{has opened}} from late Oligocene to early Miocene times, behind the Apulian {{subduction}} zone and partly within the western Alpine belt. We analyze the deep {{structures of the}} basin and its conjugate margins in order to describe the tectonic styles of opening and to investigate the possible contributions of forces responsible for the basin formation, especially the pulling force induced by the retreating subduction hinge and the gravitational body force from the Alpine wedge. To undertake this analysis, we combine new multichannel seismic reflection data (Malis cruise, 1995) with other geophysical data (previous multichannel and monochannel seismic sections, magnetic anomalies) and constrain them by geological sampling from two recent cruises (dredges from Marco cruise, 1995, and submersible dives from Cylice cruise, 1997). From an analysis of basement morphology and seismic facies, we refine {{the extent of the}} different domains in the Ligurian Sea: (1) the continental thinned margins, with strong changes in width and structure along strike and {{on both sides of the}} ocean; (2) the transitional domain to the basin; and (3) a narrow, atypical oceanic domain. Margin structures are characterized by few tilted blocks along the narrow margins, where inherited structures seem to control synrift sedimentation and margin segmentation. On the NW Corsican margin, extension is distributed over more than 120 km, including offshore Alpine Corsica, and several oceanward faults sole on a relatively flat reflector. We interpret them as previous Alpine thrusts reactivated during rifting as normal faults soling on a normal ductile shear zone. Using correlations between magnetic data, seismic facies, and sampling, we propose a new map of the distribution of magmatism. The oceanic domain depicts narrow, isolated magnetic anomalies and is interpreted as tholeitic volcanics settled within an unroofed upper mantle, whereas calcalkaline volcanism appears to be discontinuous but massive and has jumped in space and time, from the beginning of rifting on the Ligurian margin (∼ 30 Ma), toward the Corsican margin at the end of the Corsica-Sardinia block rotation (∼ 16 Ma). This space and time shift reveals the importance of the rollback of the Apulian slab and of the migration of the Alpine-Apennines belt front toward the E-SE for driving basin formation. We also state that initial rheological conditions and inherited crustal fabric induce important changes in the styles of deformation observed along margins and between conjugate margins. In the NE Ligurian basin the prerift Alpine crustal thickening together with slow rollback velocity likely contribute to distribute strain across the whole NW Corsican margin, whereas farther south the inherited Hercynian structural pattern combined with a faster rollback of the subducting plate tend to focus the extension at the <b>foot</b> of the <b>margin,</b> up to the Sardinian rift which ends within the SW Corsican margin. Therefore the mode of opening and the margin structures mainly depend on the balance between intrinsic, inherited crustal heterogeneity (fabric and rheological changes) and external conditions imposed by rollback of the subducting lithosphere...|$|R
