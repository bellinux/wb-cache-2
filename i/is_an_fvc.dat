40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} the prognostic value of pulmonary function test (PFT) trends at {{one and two}} years in interstitial lung disease associated with systemic sclerosis (SSc-ILD). METHODS: The prognostic significance of PFT trends at one year (n= 162), and two years (n= 140) was examined against 15 year survival. PFT trends, expressed as continuous and categorical change in separate analyses, were examined against mortality in univariate and multivariate models. SSc-ILD was defined at presentation as limited lung fibrosis or extensive lung fibrosis using the UKRSA staging system. RESULTS: One year PFT trends were predictive of mortality only in patients with extensive lung fibrosis: categorical FVC change, alone or in combination with categorical change in DLco, had greater prognostic significance than continuous FVC change or trends in other PFT variables. Taking into account both prognostic value and sensitivity to change, the optimal definition of progression for trial purposes <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> and DLco composite, consisting of either <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> decline from baseline ≥ 10 % or <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> decline of 5 - 9 % in association with a DLco decline of ≥ 15 %. At two years, gas transfer trends had the greatest prognostic significance, in the whole cohort and in limited lung fibrosis. However, in extensive lung fibrosis, the composite end-point defined above was the strongest prognostic determinant. Larger changes were required in the FVC/DLco ratio than in Kco to achieve prognostic significance. CONCLUSION: Our findings provide support for routine spirometric and gas transfer monitoring in SSc-ILD, based on linkages to long-term outcome, with further evaluation of <b>a</b> composite <b>FVC</b> and DLco end-point warranted for trial purposes.

30|$|The {{majority}} of traditional research into automated fingerprint identification {{has focused on}} algorithms using minutiae-based features. However, shortcomings of this approach are becoming apparent due {{to the difficulty of}} extracting minutiae points from noisy or low-quality images. Therefore, there has been increasing interest in algorithms based on nonminutiae features in recent years. One vital stage in most fingerprint verification systems is registration, which involves recovering the transformation parameters that align features from each fingerprint. This paper investigates the use of orientation fields for registration; an approach that has the potential to perform robustly for poor-quality images. Three diverse algorithms have been implemented for the task. The first algorithm is based on the generalized Hough transform, and it works by accumulating evidence for transformations in a discretized parameter space. The second algorithm is based on identifying distinctive local orientations, and using these as landmarks for alignment. The final algorithm follows the path of steepest descent in the parameter space to quickly find solutions that are locally optimal. The performance of these three algorithms <b>is</b> evaluated using <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> 2002 dataset.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] The "Escort" {{spirometer}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lightweight, {{hand held}} spirometer employing a Fleisch pneumotachograph. Measurements of {{forced expiratory volume}} in one second (FEV 1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and peak expiratory flow (PEF) <b>are</b> obtained from <b>a</b> single <b>FVC</b> manoeuvre. Results <b>are</b> displayed on <b>a</b> small liquid crystal display, {{but there is no}} graphical display. The performance of the Escort spirometer has been compared with that of a wedge bellows spirometer (Vitalograph S model) and a Wright PEF meter. METHODS [...] One hundred and thirteen subjects performed three FVC manoeuvres on the wedge bellows and Escort spirometers and three PEF manoeuvres on the Wright meter. The best reading for each index was recorded. In 21 of the subjects comparison of a Wright manoeuvre with <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> manoeuvre on the Escort spirometer was performed, whilst in three subjects the effect of repeated blows was studied. RESULTS [...] The FEV 1 ranged from 0. 5 to 5. 4 litres, FVC from 1. 05 to 6. 2 litres, and PEF from 100 to 725 l/min. The mean (SD) difference for the FEV 1 was - 0. 05 (0. 15) (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) - 0. 07 to - 0. 02) litres, for FVC 0. 03 (0. 28) (95 % CI - 0. 02 to + 0. 08) litres, and for PEF 1. 68 (50. 6) (95 % CI - 7. 7 to + 11. 1) l/min. The differences were positively correlated with the mean reading for PEF and FVC but not for FEV 1. The Wright PEF manoeuvre performed on the Escort produced significantly higher PEF readings (mean difference - 22. 9 litres). There was no significant effect of repeated FVC manoeuvres on any of the indices. CONCLUSIONS [...] The Escort spirometer compares extremely well with a wedge bellows spirometer for measurement of FEV 1 and FVC, whilst yielding results of PEF from <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> manoeuvre which <b>are</b> comparable to those obtained from a Wright meter.

In this subgroup of patients, the reduction in FVC was correlated with higher CT scores, but not with higher weakness score (acquired ICU weakness score), suggesting that the reduction in pulmonary function was related to lung fibrosis [6]. In fact, we observed an association between driving pressure and NT-PCP-III, a marker of fibrogenesis, paralleled by increased mean densities of the parenchyma, especially in those patients ventilated with higher driving pressure (Fig.  3). In those long-term studies, the changes in HRCT and in pulmonary function tests were both related to a poorer QoL [22]. In our study, the QoL could be further related to the level of driving pressures applied during mechanical ventilation.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Many {{conditions}} and characteristics {{are associated with}} nocturia, however, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> paucity of data on the factors that predict the development of nocturia. We therefore determined factors predictive of incident nocturia. METHODS: We analyzed the database of a population-based cohort study among 1, 688 men aged 50 - 78 years old, without radical prostatectomy, transurethral surgery, or bladder or prostate cancer, living in Krimpen aan den IJssel, The Netherlands. Data were obtained using frequency-volume charts (FVC), from which the nocturnal voiding frequency (NVF) was determined. Nocturia was defined as NVF ≥ 2. Conditions and characteristics were determined via medical examination and a 113 -item questionnaire. Men without nocturia at baseline (BL) and no exclusion criteria met were selected. At the first follow-up round (FU- 1; after 2. 1 years) we determined how many men developed nocturia. Univariable analyses were done to determine the association between the BL characteristics and nocturia-status at FU- 1. Variables with an association p < 0. 25 were selected to create a multivariable logistic regression model. After a manual backward selection procedure <b>a</b> final model <b>was</b> created with only significant associations (p¡ü 0. 05). RESULTS: At BL 1597 men completed <b>an</b> <b>FVC,</b> 133 men met the exclusion criteria. 342 men {{were excluded because of}} missing sleeping-hours, and 386 men had nocturia (34. 4 %), resulting in a target population of 736 men. At FU- 1, 341 men were excluded because they did not void during the night or within the first hour of rising, did not complete <b>a</b> <b>FVC,</b> or due to loss to follow up. Therefore, analysis could was possible in 395 men. These men did not significantly differ from the total population regarding {{conditions and}} characteristics. Median age was 59. 8, the incidence-rate after 2. 1 years for nocturia was 24. 8 %. Table 1 shows the univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.

EMG changes in the rectus abdominis (RA) display an effect {{similar to those in}} paraspinal muscles with respect to the function of lower motor neurons in the thoracic spinal cord. The RA denervation was examined to determine its association with ventilation dysfunction in ALS. Methods: We collected the clinical data of 128 patients with sporadic ALS in Department of Neurology of Peking University Third Hospital from 2009 to 2013. EMG, Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and forced vital capacity (FVC) were performed in all patients and the differences in the EMG changes in RA between those with and without FVC ≥ 80 % were analysed. Results: The mean FVC value was 83. 4 % ± 17. 1 % (range: 45 %– 131 %) of the predicted value. A total of 79 patients displayed FVC ≥ 80 %, and 49 patients displayed FVC < 80 %.

Methods: Fifteen participants (9 males; mean age, 56. 1 years), with moderate COPD (mean % predicted forced expiratory volume in the first second [FEV 1 % predicted], 61. 8 %), were randomly allocated to 1 of 3 groups: soft tissue therapy only (ST); ST and spinal manipulation (SM); or ST, SM, and Ex. The intervention continued for 4 weeks. Outcome measures included FEV 1, forced vital capacity (FVC), chronic respiratory questionnaire (CRQ-SAS) scores, distance walked in a 6 -minute walking test, and monitoring for adverse events. Results: There <b>was</b> <b>an</b> increase in <b>FVC</b> for the SM + ST + Ex group compared with ST only and ST + SM (1. 01 and 1. 00 L, respectively).

The {{aim of this}} study was to quantify change in pulmonary function as a predictor of outcome in SSc-ILD. METHODS: All patients had SSc-ILD defined by HRCT chest. All PFTs during follow-up, including FVC (L), DLCO (ml/min/mmHg) and KCO (DLCO/alveolar volume ratio; DLCO/VA) (ml/min/mmHg/L) were retrieved. The rate of change over the first four years, and percentage change in the first year of follow-up were used in ROC curve analysis to determine the best cut-off points to predict adverse outcome (home oxygen, lung transplantation, or death). RESULTS: Among 264 patients, there were 49 events (38 deaths, 10 supplemental oxygen, one lung transplant) over a mean (±SD) follow-up of 3. 0 (± 1. 7) years. The rates of decline over time and percentage change over one year in each of FVC, DLCO and KCO were predictive of adverse outcome. Stable PFTs over four years gave the optimal negative predictive values (NPVs) of 88 – 96 %.

40|$|Abstract 678 Clinically {{meaningful}} {{change in}} systemic sclerosis (SSc) related interstitial lung (SSc-ILD) disease is unknown. The {{aim of this}} study was to quantify change in pulmonary function as a predictor of outcome in SSc-ILD. All patients had SSc-ILD defined by HRCT chest. All PFTs during follow-up, including FVC (L), DLCO (ml/min/mmHg) and KCO (DLCO/alveolar volume ratio; DLCO/VA) (ml/min/mmHg/L) were retrieved. The rate of change over the first four years, and percentage change in the first year of follow-up were used in ROC curve analysis to determine the best cut-off points to predict adverse outcome (home oxygen, lung transplantation, or death). Among 264 patients, there were 49 events (38 deaths, 10 supplemental oxygen, one lung transplant) over a mean (±SD) follow-up of 3. 0 (± 1. 7) years. The rates of decline over time and percentage change over one year in each of FVC, DLCO and KCO were predictive of adverse outcome. Stable PFTs over four years gave the optimal negative predictive values (NPVs) of 88 - 96 %.

40|$|BACKGROUND In {{patients}} with pleural effusion, irrespective of aetiology, the alterations in physiological states leading to restrictive lung functions and hypoxemia. In this study, we {{have aimed to}} {{study the effects of}} tuberculous pleural effusion on the pulmonary function and the predictive value of the initial severity of pleural effusion on chest x-ray and the residual pleural thickening in the severity of the restrictive abnormality. Also, we have compared the various pleural fluid characteristics in predicting the restrictive abnormality in tuberculous pleural effusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS The patients selected for the study, were initially subjected to diagnostic and therapeutic pleural tap on admission. They were then put on standard DOTS therapy. Their PFT was done on admission, then at one month, then two months {{and at the end of}} therapy at six months. Their chest X-ray was taken at monthly intervals and the residual pleural thickening was estimated. The resultant data was analysed statistically by ANOVA test, paired-t test and by Pearson’s correlation. RESULTS In our study, we have found a significant restrictive abnormality in lung function testing in our selected patients of tuberculous pleural effusion. They had <b>a</b> <b>FVC...</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecombinant human DNase I (rhDNase) {{has been}} shown to improve {{pulmonary}} function in patients treated for up to 6 months. A cohort of 52 cystic fibrosis patients with <b>a</b> <b>FVC</b> > 40 % predicted <b>were</b> enrolled into <b>an</b> open label study in order to evaluate longer-term effects of rhDNase. They received 2 · 5 mg rhDNase twice daily for 6 months followed by a 2 -week wash-out period, and for the subsequent 18 months were treated with rhDNase once daily. Twenty-six male and 26 female patients with <b>a</b> mean <b>FVC</b> of 2 · 941 and FEV 1 of 1 · 471 were recruited. Thirteen patients did not complete the study; there were seven deaths, three patients withdrew consent and three patients were lost to follow-up. Improvement in pulmonary function was seen following treatment and changes were evaluated as mean percent change from baseline. The maximum improvement occurred in the first month followed by a plateau at a lower level of improvement. The mean improvement in FEV 1 over the first month was 13 · 3 % (range 12 – 14 · 1 %), followed by a plateau at around 7 · 1 % (range 4 · 6 – 11 · 0 %) for the subsequent 23 months. Mean FVC was improved by 12 · 03 % (range 9 · 0 – 14 · 3 %) over the first month and subsequently 4 · 2 % (range − 2 · 2 – 10 · 2 %). The effects on pulmonary function were similar for both treatment doses of rhDNase. There <b>was</b> also <b>a</b> steady improvement in weight from a mean of 54 · 2 kg to 55 · 7 kg {{at the end of the}} study. Analysis of the results of only those patients who completed the full 2 -yr treatment period show that changes in pulmonary function and weight were similar to those observed for the whole group. The death rate and adverse event profile were consistent with that seen in a cystic fibrosis population. This study confirms that longer-term treatment with rhDNase maintains the improvement in lung function, is associated with weight gain and has a good safety profile...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Lower lung {{function}} <b>is</b> associated with <b>an</b> elevated systemic white cell count in men. However, these observations have not <b>been</b> demonstrated in <b>a</b> representative population that includes females {{and may be}} susceptible to confounding by recent airway infections or recent cigarette smoking. We tested the hypothesis that {{lung function}} is inversely associated with systemic white cell count in a population-based study. METHODS: The study population consisted adults aged 17 - 90 + years {{who participated in the}} Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not report a recent cough, cold or acute illness in a non-smoking and smoking population. RESULTS: In non-smoking adults with the highest quintile of the total white cell count had a FEV(1) 125. 3 ml lower than those in the lowest quintile (95 % confidence interval CI: - 163. 1 to - 87. 5). Adults with the highest quintile of the total white cell count had <b>a</b> <b>FVC</b> 151. 1 ml lower than those in the lowest quintile (95 % confidence interval CI: - 195. 0 to - 107. 2). Similar associations were observed for granulocytes, mononuclear cells and lymphocytes. In current smokers, similar smaller associations observed for total white cell count, granulocytes and mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic cellular inflammation levels are inversely associated with lung function in a population of both non-smokers and smokers without acute illnesses. This may contribute to the increased mortality observed in individuals with a higher baseline white cell count...|$|R

Thus, higher syndication could also possibly arise from the need to leverage greater financial capital.

40|$|Objective: To {{design a}} spirometry-based {{algorithm}} to predict pulmonary restrictive impairment {{and reduce the}} number of patients undergoing unnecessary lung volume testing. Design: Two prospective studies of 259 consecutive patients and 265 consecutive patients used to derive and validate the algorithm, respectively. Setting: A pulmonary function laboratory of a tertiary care hospital. Patients: Consecutive adults referred to the laboratory for lung volume measurements and spirometry. Measurements: The sensitivity of the algorithm for predicting pulmonary restriction and the cost savings associated with its use. Results: Total lung capacity correlated strongly with FVC (r 0. 66) and showed an inverse correlation with the FEV 1 /FVC ratio (r 0. 41). According to the algorithm, only patients with <b>an</b> <b>FVC</b> 55 % required lung volume measurements following spirometry. The algorithm had a high sensitivity for predicting restriction and a high negative predictive value (NPV) for excluding restriction (sensitivity, 96 %; NPV, 98 %). The diagnostic properties of the algorithm were reproducible in the validation study. Application of the algorithm would eliminate the need for lung volume testing in 48 to 49 % of patients referred to the pulmonary function test (PFT) laboratory, reducing costs by 33 %. Conclusions: A spirometry-based algorithm accurately excludes pulmonary restriction and reduces unnecessary lung volume testing in the PFT laboratory almost in half.

40|$|Abstract—The set of minutia {{points is}} {{considered}} to be the most distinctive feature for fingerprint representation and is widely used in fingerprint matching. It was believed that the minutiae set does not contain sufficient information to reconstruct the original fingerprint image from which minutiae were extracted. However, recent studies have shown that it is indeed possible to reconstruct fingerprint images from their minutiae representations. Reconstruction techniques demonstrate the need for securing fingerprint templates, improve the template interoperability and improve fingerprint synthesis. But, there <b>is</b> still <b>a</b> large gap between the matching performance obtained from original fingerprint images and their corresponding reconstructed fingerprint images. In this paper, the prior knowledge about fingerprint ridge structures is encoded in terms of orientation patch and continuous phase patch dictionaries to improve the fingerprint reconstruction. The orientation patch dictionary is used to reconstruct the orientation field from minutiae, while the continuous phase patch dictionary is used to reconstruct the ridge pattern. Experimental results on three public domain databases (FVC 2002 DB 1 <b>A,</b> <b>FVC</b> 2002 DB 2 A and NIST SD 4) demonstrate that the proposed reconstruction algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms in terms of both i) spurious and missing minutiae and ii) matching performance with respect to type-I attack (matching the reconstructed fingerprint against the same impression from which minutiae set was extracted) and type-II attack (matching the reconstructed fingerprint against a different impression of the same finger).
