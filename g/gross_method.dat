40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the analysis of}} data from a three-year gross time study of skyline, balloon, and helicopter yarding systems operating in Western Oregon. Data collection activities were designed and supervised by the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station, U. S. D. A. Forest Service. The specific logging systems studied were running skyline, North Bend standing skyline, long-span standing skyline, balloon (inverted skyline, highlead, inverted skyline yo-yo, and highlead yo-yo), medium helicopter, and heavy helicopter. These systems were observed under {{a wide range of}} silvicultural and landscape design prescriptions, timber type, terrain, and weather conditions. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop yarding production equations, to sumarize delays, road change times,and landing change times, and to compare yarding production estimates made from both gross and detailed time study data. This kind of information is useful for the comparison of alternative logging methods in environmentally sensitive, landscape-designed harvest units. The data were segregated according to the individual logging systems and analyzed via multiple regression. Then individual system data were combined into the categories of short-span skyline, long-span skyline, balloon, and helicopter. These combined data were also analyzed via multiple regression. Chi-square tests were performed to determine whether the equations developed from the combined data were significantly different from the set of equations developed from the segregated data. The results of these tests support a conclusion, at the 95 percent level of fiducial probability, that the equations developed from the combined data are as adequate for predicting yarding production rates for these logging systems as the equations developed from the individual-system data. The variables shown statistically to influence yarding production rates for all logging systems studied were yarding distance and number of logs per turn. In addition, helicopter yarding productivity was also found to be influenced by the type of cutting prescription, and short-span skyline yarding, by chordslope. A variable combining aspect and the season of work was found to be significant for both the running skyline and the heavy helicopter. Yarding delays were found to be affected by yarder, landing size, season, and crews' experience. In order to compare similar systems' delays, it was found important to segregate out weather-related delays. In a separate study, detailed time studies were made on four of the yarding systems analyzed in this paper. This allowed a comparison between the measurements of yarding production rates made during the detailed time study and those made during the gross tinte study. The gross time study rates were consistently lower than the detail time study rates. This suggests that the detailed method does not reflect the total downtime as accurately as the <b>gross</b> <b>method.</b> Thus the <b>gross</b> <b>method</b> appears better suited for developing information that is useful for appraisal purposes and the detailed method is better suited for evaluation of system efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} whether tourniquet release intraoperatively {{is better than}} postoperative release in reducing overall blood loss, duration of surgery, duration of tourniquet, length of hospital stay, wound related complications and transfusion requirement. Study Design: Comparative study. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Surgery, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 2004 to June 2007. Methodology: One hundred and thirty patient files were reviewed retrospectively. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups. Group-A consisted of 65 patients with early deflation of tourniquet and group-B comprised of 65 patients with the release of tourniquet after applying compressive dressing. Total blood loss (determined by <b>Gross</b> <b>method)</b> and other study variables were noted as per objective and computed. Results: There were 22 males and 108 females with comparable BMI. All had undergone posterior stabilized cemented total knee replacement. Calculated blood loss was 1. 208 L and 1. 108 L in group-A and B respectively (p = 0. 27). Significant increase in duration of surgery was noted in group-A patients. Four patients in group-B showed complication related to wound with 3 being minor and 1 requiring additional operation room visit. Mean length of hospital stay was 9 days. Transfusion frequency was higher in group-B despite comparable postoperative haemoglobin values. Conclusion: Intraoperative tourniquet release does not reduce overall blood loss with no effect in conserving blood after total knee replacement, however, this group had relatively shorter hospital stay...|$|E

40|$|Background Rearing a {{child with}} a {{developmental}} disability is associated with increased parental stress. Theories of stress and adjustment and bi-directional theories of child development suggest that parenting could influence these negative outcomes. Methods Relationships between parenting approaches and stress in parents of children with developmental disabilities (DD) (N = 53) were examined across two age groups, 3 - 5 years and 9 - 11 years and compared with a contrast group of typically developing children (TD) (N = 60). Measures used were the Parenting Stress Index-Short Form and Rickel and Biasatti's modification of Block's Child Rearing Practices Report, classified into Baumrind's parenting styles using Reitman and <b>Gross's</b> <b>method.</b> Results Parents in the older DD group used Authoritative parenting less than parents in the younger DD group, while the opposite developmental pattern was seen in the TD group. Multivariate analysis of variance showed a significant group Ã— parenting style interaction for Parental Distress, Parent-Child Dysfunctional Interaction and Difficult Child. Stress measures were higher for the DD group and seemed to be associated with Authoritative parenting approaches, an effect that was not observed in the TD group. Conclusions Findings suggest that the well-established effect of group on stress may be moderated by parenting style. Authoritative parenting may be highly stressful for parents of children with DD to implement, resulting in a decrease in its use across the two age groups...|$|R
