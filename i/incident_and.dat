5|$|Although {{there were}} no deaths, the fire caused $1.8million of damage, and {{officers}} were injured.

5|$|Aratus took {{advantage}} of this <b>incident,</b> <b>and</b> began plotting against Cleomenes with King Antigonus III Doson of Macedon.

Aratus wanted the Macedonian king to come to the Peloponnese and defeat Cleomenes, but Antigonus asked control of Acrocorinth in return. This was a sacrifice that the League was not willing to make, however, and they declined to seek help from Macedon.|$|E
