50|$|The {{inventor}} Alfred Kärcher (1901-59) from Baden-Württemberg {{founded the}} company in 1935 in Stuttgart Bad-Cannstatt. Initially Kärcher specialised {{in the design of}} industrial submersible heating elements, i.e. in salt smelters which were heated with immersion heaters. After numerous experiments, a <b>hardening</b> <b>furnace</b> for alloys was produced, the so-called “Kärcher Salt-Bath Furnace”. Some 1,200 units were sold up to 1945. Karcher invented the first modern pressure washer, the DS 350 in 1950. The company’s main focus then switched to cleaning equipment for professional and private users. Since then, Kärcher has made lead in the design and development of pressure washers. The company’s product range was expanded and now covers the entire field of cleaning (sweepers, detergents, scrubber-driers, wet and dry vacuums, vacuum cleaners, battery-powered brooms, steam cleaners, dry ice blasting equipment, parts cleaners, water treatment systems, vehicle washes and wastewater recycling systems). Kärcher also offers pumps and watering systems.|$|E

60|$|The sea {{of black}} and {{threatening}} waters, and of destructive upheaving of wave against wave, whose depths were yet unfathomed and whose forces were yet unknown. The remorseless sea of turbulently swaying shapes, voices of vengeance, and faces <b>hardened</b> in the <b>furnaces</b> of suffering until the touch of pity could make no mark on them.|$|R
25|$|Such {{a massive}} and {{difficult}} iron and charcoal making operation need a massive and <b>hardened</b> workforce. The <b>furnace</b> alone needed {{as many as}} sixty people {{working around the clock}} in twelve-hour shifts. The iron works support staff included a company clerk, a host of teamsters, woodcutters, the colliers, farmers and household servants. There was a wide gap between the classes. Workers were housed in small homes and worked very hard for low wages. The owners and supervisors of the furnace lived in mansions with sizable servant staffs. Historians have likened life at the furnace to life in a feudal barony.|$|R
40|$|Hardening heat-treatment is an {{important}} operation in the fabrication of large chains for both the shipping industry and anchorage of offshore oil-platforms. This paper presents the outcome of an investigation {{that led to the}} introduction of modifications in a <b>hardening</b> <b>furnace</b> resulting in a substantial improvement and largely eliminating the problem of gradual cooling of the chain before immersion in the water-quenching tank. Comparing this with the present operating conditions, it can be concluded that redirecting the gas flow increases the gas temperature in {{the lower part of the}} furnace, which changes the chain's temperature-distribution accordingly.

40|$|The {{progressing}} {{development of}} industry and the associated rising environmental pollution create {{the need for the}} intensification of combustion processes and the implementation of increasingly stringent environmental protection standards. Therefore, an intensive progress in scientific and research work that is lately observed and studies with the use of numerical methods, are becoming an indispensable element of experimental research. This allows for: optimization of combustion processes, development of new designs of burners and technologies of low-emission combustion, as well as prediction of ecological effects. This article presents the possibilities of numerical modelling in combustion processes in heat furnaces. The chemistry of the combustion process was modelled in CHEMKIN software, while the dynamics of flue gas flow in the combustion chamber was modelled with the use of FLUENT software. Numerical computations were performed for both, the experimental chamber and the real objects, i. e. a pusher furnace and a sheet <b>hardening</b> <b>furnace.</b> The results of obtained measurements and numerical calculations clearly show that the use of hot air affects the growth of emissions, in particular NOx. Furthermore, it has also been proved that the design and the appropriate location of the lance supplying the secondary air result in the reduction of emissions of nitrogen oxides...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} keep a high level and to stay {{competitive}} in the world market in the future, {{it is important for}} the Swedish steel industry to improve their efficiencies continuously and to reduce the energy consumption. In order to realize these goals, the Swedish steel association Jernkotoret was found and by their initiative Triple Steelix was found in 2006 in Berglanden, a significant area for the steel industry. In 2009, the Clean Production Centre was found in Hofors in order to build a cluster of local steel manufacturers, factories and companies. One of those companies is Gästrike Härdverkstad, a small steal heat treatment industry with six employees and about 700. 000 tons treated materials every year. The aim for this thesis is to suggest solutions for recovering waste heat and lowering the total energy consumption in furnaces for heat treatment in the case of Gästrike Härdverkstad. Some limitations were necessary to complete the analysis and to come to conclusions. The yearly treated material and energy prices were assumed to be constant and the yearly power consumption was estimated by an extrapolation of a one to five days measurement. Gästrike Härdverkstad is located in Uhrfors, the southern part of Åshammar, a village with 727 inhabitants. There are not any buildings with a possibility to supply heat and there is no district heating in the surroundings. The company has a power consumption of 1. 40 GWh/year, of which 65. 7 % is consumed by the 12 main furnaces. The rest is used by eight seldom used furnaces, devices and auxiliary machines of the support process like fans, pumps, compressor, office heating, and some other. The efficiencies of the main furnaces are between 10 % and 20 %. The estimated energy consumption of the space heating is about 27 MWh/year, which completely can be covered by the material coolant and the combustion heat of the exhaust gases from the <b>hardening</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Since there are 10 different types of furnaces with different duties and efficiencies, the preheating furnace was taken as an example and compared with a new furnace. According to the needs of Gästrike Härdverkstad, the furnace VAW 60 / 100 - 650 °C from the company Vötsch was chosen at the cost of 248, 827 SEK. The payback time depends on the efficiency. With an efficiency of 40 % the payback time would be about 13 years, see Figure 20. After the annealing and ageing, the finished products are cooled down in the building hall by the ambient air. In future, the possibility of preheating the material with the heat of the finished products should be considered. With an efficiency of 30. 87 %, one preheating furnace could bereplaced, and taken a payback time of 5 years into account; the price of the construction would be allowed to be up to 253, 200 SEK...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to {{identify}} the need for Surface Hardening in Crankshafts and establishing Induction Hardening as the most practically viable process for the same. Crankshaft is one of the largest components in the internal combustion engine that has a complex geometry consisting of cylinders as bearings and plates as the crank webs. Geometry section changes in the crankshaft cause stress concentration at fillet areas where bearings are connected to the crank webs. In addition, this component experiences both torsional and bending load during its service life. The crankshaft must be capable of withstanding the intermittent variable loads impressed on it. The principal purpose of Surface Hardening is to increase the hardness, wear resistance and endurance limit of the surfaces of metal components. The core remains tough and can withstand impact loads. Prior to the advent of Induction Hardening methods such as <b>furnace</b> <b>hardening,</b> flame hardening and liquid nitriding were used. However each of these processes presented problems such as inadequate or non-uniform hardening and distortion. Induction Hardening overcomes many of these problems through rotation of the part during heat-treating and selection of frequency and power to obtain adequate case depth and uniform hardness...|$|R
40|$|Process capability, {{which is}} an {{important}} concept within statistical process control (SPC), describes {{the ability of a}} process i. e. a thermal process to produce components within the tolerance limits. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify possible methods for how to perform process capability study and temperature uniformity survey. In this essay the capability of the case <b>hardening</b> at continuous <b>furnaces</b> have been studied, considering a number of quality parameters. The outcome form these parameters described how well the process could produce components within the tolerances. The parameters of interest were case depth, core hardness, surface hardness, and surface carbon content. Practical work was done at Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE), Eskilstuna and Getrag All Wheel Drive AB, Köping. The parameters were measured from dummy test specimens in Getrag All Wheel Drive AB, and were analyzed by statistical software Minitab version 16. Temperature uniformity surveys (TUSs) were studied for both companies according to standard AMS 2750 D. However, it was not written in it how to make analysis of temperature data. In TUSs, a datapaq with ten thermocouples where used during production from which the temperature could be logged at different positions of the stacking trays and over the entire cross-section of the furnaces. The furnace temperature was within the specified tolerances; however, the significant differences within each track from each of the furnaces were recorded. One of the furnaces was constructed with two parallel tracks while the other was constructed with three parallel tracks. It’s related with the ratio of production capacity for the actual furnace, it will also give information of how the degree of production capacity is influenced by temperature uniformity. The author recommends that both companies perform the same test next year. It is also recommended that further research should be carried out by the methodology that was utilized in this essay...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} {{measures have}} become a top priority for large energy consuming companies because of the increasing energy prices and implemented energy policies. Many companies also receive demands from their customers to reduce their climate impact. Heat treatment processes are performed at high temperature, sometimes up to 1000 °C, and the holding time can be up to several hours. A {{large amount of energy}} is needed for these processes and this reflects in a large energy cost for these companies. The purpose of this project was to identify advantageous, both economically and environmentally, energy efficiency improvements in a specific steel heat treatment plant. The first part of the project was to perform an energy audit and map the energy consumption in the plant. When the distribution of the energy consumption had been determined, the largest energy consumers could be identified. The search for energy efficiency opportunities was then focused on the largest energy consumers in the plant. The profitability of the identified energy saving possibilities was evaluated as well as the environmental benefits of the suggestions. The energy audit showed that the major part of the energy was consumed in the process itself and that the largest energy consumer among the support processes is the ventilation system. The <b>hardening</b> and nitrokarburizing <b>furnaces,</b> or the main furnaces, are the largest energy consumers of the process equipment. It was found that 753 MWh/year (7. 7 %) of electricity can be saved by housekeeping measures. The suggested measures were to remove unnecessary lighting, turn off the manual equipment during weekends, plan the production more energy efficiently, search the compressed air system for leaks and close a damper in a preheating furnace. The proposed energy saving investment measures will all together save 418 MWh/year (4. 3 %) of electricity and remove the district heating demand. The suggested investments were to switch the lighting to low energy lamps, insulate the door hoods of the main furnaces, move the intake to the compressor outdoors, heat exchange exhaust furnace gases with washing water and heat exchange the waste heat from the compressor with the heating of the offices. All suggested investment were shown to be profitable, i. e. having a positive net present value. However, the payback periods for the heat exchanging between the compressor and the offices and the low energy lighting may be regarded to be too long as they were more than five years. If all housekeeping measures and all investment measures were implemented, the energy cost for the plant would decrease with almost 1 MSEK/year...|$|R
