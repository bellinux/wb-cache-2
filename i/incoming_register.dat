5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called the outgoing register in R2 parlance. The termination end is called the <b>incoming</b> <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The outgoing register transmits forward MF tones to the <b>incoming</b> <b>register.</b> The <b>incoming</b> <b>register</b> transmits backward MF tones to the outgoing register. The outgoing register detects backward MF tones arriving from the <b>incoming</b> <b>register.</b> The <b>incoming</b> <b>register</b> detects forward MF tones arriving from the outgoing register. The outgoing register transmits the first signal, but from that point forward the outgoing register merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by the <b>incoming</b> <b>register.</b> (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, the outgoing register's first push signal to the <b>incoming</b> <b>register</b> is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas the incoming register's pull signals, which request information from the outgoing register, are client-server, where the client is the <b>incoming</b> <b>register</b> and the server is the outgoing register.) ...|$|E

50|$|Incoming {{registers}} used a time-shared electronic dial path (TDM) {{to transfer}} pulsing {{information from the}} incoming junction to the <b>incoming</b> <b>register.</b> This feature was necessary {{to ensure that no}} pulsing information was lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{registers}} {{were made}} entirely from discrete components. The exchange had about 20 local <b>registers</b> and 12 <b>incoming</b> <b>registers,</b> each register containing nine double units, which were hinged {{and could be}} lowered for easier access. These units, unlike the common control, were hard-wired. However, a unit could be changed by breaking straps at the rear and then rewiring them, {{but it was a}} lengthy process taking about an hour to change just one unit on one register. A subscriber was connected to the local register using the normal reed switching as the local registers were connected to the C switches. However, they communicated directly to the common control translator via hard wiring.|$|R
50|$|The AT&E {{registers}} {{looked after}} all the dialling, and there were three sorts of registers:loop-disconnect, MF (later called DTMF), and <b>incoming.</b> The local <b>registers</b> (loop-disconnect and MF) took care of own-exchange and outgoing calls, while the <b>incoming</b> <b>registers</b> dealt with calls coming into the exchange. A local register would provide dial tone to the subscriber, wait for the first dialled digit, and then apply to the translator to see what action was required. The translator could decide by the first digit {{if it was a}} local call, and if it was it would instruct the register to come back when it had all the digits. If it was not a local call and therefore to be routed out of the exchange, then it would tell the register to come back with each digit until it could decide on the routing, as not all calls went to the GSC (Group Switching Centre) as there was AAR (alternative available routing). Once the routing had been decided and digits passed on, the register was free to take another call.|$|R

50|$|Connection of trunks to {{incoming}} registers {{and outgoing}} senders is {{not through the}} four-stage voice fabric. Rather it is through a dedicated single-stage crossbar network known as <b>incoming</b> <b>register</b> link (IRL) or outgoing sender link (OSL) respectively. Registers and senders are in groups of ten, assigned one to each level of as many crossbar switches as are appropriate to the traffic they can handle. Different trunks are wired to different IRLs or OSLs depending {{on what kind of}} signaling they use; i.e. IRDP, IRRP (see panel switch), or IRMF.|$|E
50|$|Programs {{were mostly}} written in machine code. Bugs that {{previously}} went unnoticed became prominent when 1ESS {{was brought to}} big cities with heavy telephone traffic, and delayed the full adoption of the system for a few years. Temporary fixes included the Service Link Network (SLN), which did approximately {{the job of the}} <b>Incoming</b> <b>Register</b> Link and Ringing Selection Switch of the 5XB switch, thus diminishing CPU load and decreasing response times for incoming calls, and a Signal Processor (SP) or peripheral computer of only one bay, to handle simple but time consuming tasks such as the timing and counting of Dial Pulses. 1AESS eliminated the need for SLN and SP.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Boxed Ambients (BA) replace Mobile Ambients’open {{capability}} with communication primitives acting across ambient boundaries. Expressiveness {{is achieved}} {{at the price}} of communication interferences on message reception whose resolution requires synchronisation of activities at multiple, distributed locations. We study a variant of BA aimed at controlling communication interferences aswell as mobility ones. Our calculus draws inspiration from Safe Ambients (SA) (with passwords) and modifies the communication mechanism of BA. Expressiveness is maintained through a new form of co-capability {{that at the same time}} <b>registers</b> <b>incoming</b> agents with the receiver ambient and performs access control...|$|R
50|$|Line {{scanning}} circuits sequentially {{examined the}} state of each line, junctions and so on {{by means of a}} pulse many times a second and immediately after each pulse a data store (the Cyclic Store) offered the MCU permanent information relating to the line. When a calling condition was detected, the scanning pulse was passed to the MCU indicating to it that a new call had to be set up and busying it temporarily to further calls. As the first steps in dealing with the new call the MCU recorded the directory number and class of service (shared service, PABX line, <b>incoming</b> junction <b>register,</b> TOS and so on) information offered by the Cyclic Store and allocates one of its associated group of up to 30 registers. The registers were connected to peripheral terminals of the switching network, {{in the same way as}} subscribers' lines, junction circuits and other units and the MCU proceeded to issue instructions to the network to connect the subscriber and register terminals.|$|R
50|$|Broadbent's Filter Model of Attention proposes the {{existence}} of a theoretical filter device, located between the <b>incoming</b> sensory <b>register,</b> and the short-term memory storage. His theory is based on the multi-storage paradigm of William James (1890) and the more recent 'multi-store' memory model by Atkinson & Shiffrin in 1968. This filter functions together with a buffer, and enables the subject to handle two kinds of stimuli presented at the same time. One of the inputs is allowed through the filter, while the other waits in the buffer for later processing. The filter prevents the overloading of the limited-capacity mechanism located beyond the filter, which is the short-term memory. Broadbent came up with this theory based on data from an experiment: three pairs of different digits are presented simultaneously, one set of three digits in one ear, and another set of three digits in the other. Most participants recalled the digits ear by ear, rather than pair by pair. Thus, if 496 were presented to one ear and 852 to the other, the recall would be 496852 rather than 489562.|$|R
40|$|When a {{universal}} personal telecommunications (UPT) user visits a mobile network, both terminal mobility and personal mobility are involved and {{it may take a}} long time for UPT call delivery to the UPT user because it is required to retrieve both the terminal mobility related data in mobile network and the UPT user related data in UPT database. If the UPT database also manages location and status information of the MT on which the UPT user has <b>registered,</b> <b>incoming</b> call delivery to the UPT user can be improved in a situation. Mobility management schemes for UPT users roaming in a mobile network are analyzed. The performance is evaluated in terms of signaling cost and the number of node accesses during an InCall registration...|$|R
50|$|Born John Hampden Hobart-Hampden-Mercer-Henderson, Buckinghamshire {{was the son}} of Sidney Hobart-Hampden-Mercer-Henderson, 7th Earl of Buckinghamshire and Georgiana Wilhelmina Haldane-Duncan-Mercer-Henderson. He {{was educated}} at Eton from September 1919 to March 1924. In his youth he was {{regarded}} as a very handsome and dashing young man, much sought after by his female contemporaries who thought him adorable, but Bertie, an adventurous young man, eschewed marriage in favour of exploration and foreign travel. In 1926 he boarded a freighter bound for Australia and worked on farms in the outback as a cowboy herding cattle. But with his father's health worsening he was called back to England. He landed at Hull docks on 21 April 1928 after a six-week voyage from Brisbane via Sydney to Hull. On the <b>Incoming</b> Passenger <b>Register</b> his occupation was listed as ‘Gentleman Farmer’. He succeeded his father in the earldom in January 1930. On 5 April 1938 his name was legally changed to John Hampden Mercer-Henderson by Royal Licence. Despite his love of the countryside he continued to set hearts racing in society London but much preferred the open spaces to bustling city life. He was on excellent terms with his Hobart cousins; the Baronets of Langdown and often visited his cousins on the Isle of Wight and Hythe in Hampshire.|$|R

40|$|Neurons in {{the frontal}} eye fields (FEFs) <b>register</b> <b>incoming</b> visual {{information}} and select visual stimuli {{that are relevant}} for behavior. Here we investigated {{the timing of the}} visual response and the timing of selection by recording from single FEF neurons in a curve-tracing task that requires shifts of attention followed by an oculomotor response. We found that the behavioral selection signal in area FEF had a latency of 147 ms and that it was delayed substantially relative to the visual response, which occurred 50 ms after stimulus presentation. We compared the FEF responses to activity previously recorded in the primary visual cortex (area V 1) during the same task. Visual responses in area V 1 preceded the FEF responses, but the latencies of selection signals in areas V 1 and FEF were similar. The similarity of timing of selection signals in structures at opposite ends of the visual cortical processing hierarchy supports the view that stimulus selection occurs in an interaction between widely separated cortical region...|$|R
40|$|Books of {{correspondence}} were introduced by Cracow municipal office in 1621. Approximately 90 % {{of the letters}} are correspondence sent from the city hall. Most of the letters were directed to influential persons, called “patrons”. They were central and province officials, dignitaries of the Church. They were mainly informed {{about the problems of}} the city. More than half of the letters were received by clergymen (especially the Bishop of Cracow), castellans, Chancellor of the Crown, provincial governors and the king. The city council also wrote to their relatives. Only 10 % of letters were sent to other cities. These were mainly trade related issues. Most of the letters to private persons were not entered into the books. On the other hand <b>registered</b> <b>incoming</b> letters come mostly from the office of the Bishop of Cracow. City of Cracow described in the letters their problems such as tax rates, merchants avoiding to obey the storage law, threats from other armies. City hall referred in the correspondence to their privileges. Most of letters were written in Polish. Agnieszka Uziębł...|$|R
40|$|Hedgehog is {{a member}} of Insectivora (Eulipotyphla). There are European Hedgehog (Erinaceus europaeus) and Southern White-breasted Hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor) in our country. They have similar natural history. Both feed {{primarily}} invertebrates and live solitary. It is typical for these two species to hibernate during cold part of the year. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine how to reduce the mortality of the hedgehogs in the Zoological Garden Ústí nad Labem and suggest better breeding conditions. Basis of the work forms <b>registering</b> <b>incoming</b> hedgehogs and checking their health since November 2009 to March 2010. Furthermore an individual measuring has been taken every week to decide whether hedgehog has sufficient weight for hibernation. Comparison of breeding conditions in Hluboká nad Vltavou, Třeboň and Vlašim rescue stations was also done during this study. This comparison showed that the biggest shortcoming of the Zoological Garden Ústí nad Labem is small knowledge of keepers about keeping of hedgehogs. Another failure is little time given to them. Definitely, the biggest problem is a lack of place, thereby they are kept together in large numbers. Thats probably the main reason why there is a lot of aggressive behavior and disease transmission between individuals...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} process relies upon the effective management {{of a variety}} of project information including drawings, specifications, bills of quantities, and other technical data. The method of information transfer determines the ease with which information can be assimilated and used in the {{construction process}}. Despite the widespread use of computers for the generation of project information, hard copy documentation remains the primary method of information transfer within the construction industry.   Electronic Document Management (EDM) systems offer a level of control over information flow within the construction process, whether documents are in hard copy or in electronic format. However, many of the existing methods of information transfer undermine the performance of EDM systems in two respects, (1) they require the user to re-enter information to <b>register</b> <b>incoming</b> documents into a data base, (2) they cannot interpret and manipulate information contained in or supporting the document. This paper describes a method of bar coding hard copy drawings in order to electronically transfer document information from designer to contractor. This approach is designed to improve the functionality of EDM systems where hard copy documents predominate. The paper also considers the requirements for bar code application standards which would further improve the data exchange process concerning documents. ...|$|R
40|$|Cisco’s {{embedded}} {{logic analyzer}} module (ELAM) is a debugging device used {{for many of}} Cisco’s application specific integrated chips (ASICs). The ELAM is used to capture data {{of interest to the}} user and stored for analysis purposes. The user enters a trigger expression containing data fields of interest {{in the form of a}} logical equation. The data fields associated with the trigger expression are stored in a set of Match and Mask (MM) <b>registers.</b> <b>Incoming</b> data packets are matched against these registers, and if the user-specified data pattern is detected, the ELAM triggers and begins a countdown sequence to stop data capture. The current ELAM implementation is restricted in the form of trigger expressions that are allowed and in the allocation of resources. Currently, data fields in the trigger expression can only be logically ANDed together, Match and Mask registers are inefficiently utilized, and a static state machine exists in the ELAM trigger logic. To optimize the usage of the ELAM, a trigger expression is first treated as a Boolean expression so that minimization algorithms can be run. Next, the data stored in the Match and Mask registers is analyzed for redundancies. Finally, a dynamic state machine is programmed with a distinct set of states generated from the trigger expression. This set of states is further minimized. A feasibility study is done to analyze the validity of the results...|$|R
40|$|Network {{processors}} are custom {{high performance}} embedded processors deployed {{for a variety}} of tasks that must operate at high line (Gbits/sec) speeds to prevent packet loss. With the increase in complexity of application domains and larger code store on modern network processors, the network processor programming goes beyond simply exploiting parallelism in packet processing. Unlike the traditional homogeneous threading model, modern network processor programming must support heterogenous threads that execute simultaneously on a microengine. In order to support such demands, we first propose hardware management of registers across multiple threads. In their PLDI 2004 paper, Zhuang and Pande for the first time proposed a compiler based scheme to support register allocation across threads; in this work, we extend their static allocation method to support aggressive register allocation taking dynamic context into account. We also remove the load/stores due to aliased memory accesses converting them into register moves exploiting dead registers. This results in tremendous savings in latency and higher throughput mainly due to the removal of high latency accesses as well as idle cycles. The dynamic register allocator is designed to be light-weight and low latency by undertaking many tradeoffs. In the second part of this work, our goal is to design an automatic register allocation scheme that makes compiler transperant to dual bank register file design for network processors. By design network processors mandate that the operands of an instruction must be allocated to registers belonging to two different banks. The key goal in this work is to take into account dynamic contexts to balance the register pressure across the banks. Key decisions made involve, how and where to map <b>incoming</b> virtual <b>register</b> on a physical register in the bank, how to evict dead ones, and how to minimally undertake bank to bank copies and swaps. It is shown that it is viable to solve both of these problems by simple hardware designs that avail of dynamic contexts. The performance gains are substantial and due to simplicity of the designs (which are also off critical paths) such schemes may be attractive in practice. M. S.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: One year (2003) {{regional}} {{analysis of}} all blood exposure incidents from hospitals {{as well as}} from the community. DESIGN: Establishment of an easily accessible regional expert counseling center, operating 24 h a day, for all accidental blood exposures. Tasks of the center were to <b>register</b> <b>incoming</b> calls, to inform and counsel the victim, to assess the risk of the incident, and to provide a plan of further actions, including prophylactic measures. SETTING: A Dutch region (Northeast Brabant) with 500, 000 inhabitants and two major hospitals (1, 786 beds). RESULTS: A total of 454 incidents (1. 2 per day) were recorded. Only half of the incidents occurred in the hospital setting (n = 234), whereas the others (n = 220) took place in the community setting. Nearly all (95 %, n = 432) incidents occurred during work, and most of them (84 %, n = 385) were related to health care activities. In the hospital setting injuries occurred with physicians (13 %), nursing staff (45 %), operating room (OR) staff (13 %), ancillary (18 %), others (10 %). In the community setting, incidents took place among healthcare workers (48 %), detention and police officers (10 %), civilians (10 %), general practitioners/dentists and their staff (8 %), cleaning staff (4 %) and work-related incidents not falling into any of the above categories (7 %). More low risk incidents took place outside the hospital (87 % vs. 68 % in hospital), while high-risk incidents predominantly occurred within the hospital setting (23 % vs. 6 %). The hepatitis-B immunization rate was significantly lower in victims from the community than in those working in hospitals (38 % vs. 96 %). Reports from incidents in the community setting were delayed. CONCLUSIONS: Incidents that expose individuals to blood-borne pathogens occur equally frequent in the hospital and non-hospital (community) setting. Therefore, a regional expert counseling center, accessible around-the-clock, for all types of blood-exposure incidents is needed. Blood-exposure prevention programs should aim at a reduction of high-risk incidents within hospitals, and at increasing the awareness for vaccination and early reporting within the community setting...|$|R
