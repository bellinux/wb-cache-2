25|$|However, {{with the}} {{technological}} advances, {{the government has}} received the ability to invade privacy in more subtle ways; further, {{there is no reason}} to think that the rate of such technological advances will slow down. “Can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Constitution affords no protection against such invasions of individual security?”, Brandeis asks. He answers that a clear negative answer is evident in Boyd v. United States.|$|E
500|$|Amundsen did not {{understand}} the apparent aversion of British explorers to dogs: [...] "Can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dog has not understood its master? Or is it the master who has not understood the dog?" [...] he later wrote. Following his decision to go south he ordered 100North Greenland sledge dogs—the best and strongest available.|$|E
60|$|Concho shuddered. Could <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> devil {{was really}} going to fly away with his mule? He dared not look up.|$|E

30|$|Here <b>it</b> has <b>been</b> {{observed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{weighted average}} of CN is increasing, and from graph also <b>it</b> <b>is</b> observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> run-off <b>is</b> increasing from 1990 to 2009.

50|$|Despite {{the added}} penalties, {{citizens}} and shippers openly ignored the embargo. Protests continued to grow; and so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Jefferson administration requested and Congress rendered yet another embargo act.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. It {{appears to}} hang fire somewhere. I {{never saw a}} sunrise act like that before. Can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> hotel is playing {{anything}} on us?" ...|$|E

25|$|The test <b>is</b> whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{established}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> debtor <b>is</b> without {{funds to}} pay his debts in full, and whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> improbable <b>that</b> <b>the</b> assets will realise enough for this purpose.|$|R

60|$|Bukawai {{leaped to}} his feet. Could <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> devil-god was {{to prevail against}} his servants? Impossible! The {{creature}} was unarmed, and he was down with two hyenas on top of him; but Bukawai did not know Tarzan.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} archdeacon jumping up; [...] "nothing new;--what is it?" [...] Many ideas about Mr. Crawley {{at that moment}} flitted across the archdeacon's mind.

6000|$|... "Do {{you then}} keep this paladin here arrayed like a clerk?" [...] quoth Ramiro in his sardonic way. [...] "And can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{secret of his}} feat of arms has been guarded so well that you are still in ignorance of it?" ...|$|E
3000|$|... (b) The {{iterative}} {{scheme is}} run by a sequence of ϕ-contractive self-mappings which are not built based on the basic self-mapping of the above situation. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> assumed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sequence converge uniformly or point-wise to a self-mapping on the same abstract set.

40|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> known <b>that</b> <b>the</b> exact wave {{function}} of an atom or a molecule {{should have a}} cusp at γ_ = 0.

50|$|For n = 1 <b>it</b> <b>is</b> obvious <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{algorithms}} <b>are</b> optimal, {{since there}} is only a single move.

60|$|Could <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> son was unworthy, or had the father's {{feelings}} {{been too}} much chilled ever to warm again, and all home affections lost in the strife of politics?

50|$|A {{significant}} {{challenge to}} {{the skills of the}} puppeteers (especially those controlling the witnesses) {{came in the form of}} manipulating them at the right pace, a pace usually rather more sluggish than that of a normal actor, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important <b>that</b> <b>the</b> audience see precisely what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> puppet <b>was</b> doing. The puppeteers worked extensively with their figures to determine this, while also settling on specific moments of physical contact between puppet and orthodox human actor.|$|R
40|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> shown <b>that</b> <b>the</b> non-associative {{operators}} in a non-associative quantum theory are unobservables.

30|$|From {{the trend}} of the {{performance}} of the parameter settings, based on <b>the</b> results, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lesser the value assigned to parameters n and P a, the better the fitness value. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> noticed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ranking of the parameter settings based on the best fitness follows this observation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> lesser the value assigned to parameter n, the solution was obtained faster.|$|R

40|$|Non-isothermal {{oxidation}} enthalpies {{have been}} measured for three Colombian coals {{which have been}} weathered under ambient conditions for period up to 105 days. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> found <b>that</b> although <b>the</b> total oxidation enthalpies decreased with increasing oxidation the decrease <b>was</b> not systematic. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> random behaviour <b>was</b> due to weight losses {{during the course of}} <b>the</b> experiments. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> onset temperature of oxidation increased with oxidation in a more systematic way and also increased with increasing coal rank. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> therefore proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> onset temperatures <b>was</b> a better indicator of the propensity of the coals to oxidation...|$|R
