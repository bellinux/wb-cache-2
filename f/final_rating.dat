However, one contains a styryl side chain {{and the other}} contains an a-methylstyryl side chain. Isothermal degradations under nitrogen and air were carried on both polymers. From the GC/MS analysis of the cold traps, it showed that both polymers gave off benzene or oxygenated benzene related products. Homopolymers containing only phenyl or a-methylstyryl side chain were prepared by solution polymerization techniques. Then isothermal degradation under air were also carried out on both homopolymers. The GC/MS analysis showed that the a-methylstyryl side chain {{was responsible for the}} formation of the oxygenated benzene products. The activation energies determined for the polyesters did not show the relative stability of the polyesters as expected. Solution polymerized polyester 6 was studied initially under both air and nitrogen atmospheres using the Perkin-Elmer TGS- 2 TGA. For polyester 6 under nitrogen, the activation energy (Eg) was determined to be 43 kcal/mole.
