The following parameters were measured: alkalinity concentration, dissolved oxygen concentration, specific conductance, hydrogen ion concentration, turbidity, temperature, nitrate concentration, nitrite concentration, ortho- and meta-phosphate concentrations. At the time of each sample, discharge measurements were calculated and averaged. At the conclusion of sampling, the 34 measurements for each parameter were graphed and statistically analyzed. The parameters appeared to separate into two groups: <b>Group</b> <b>A,</b> which contained those parameters {{which seemed to be}} affected by discharge, and Group B, which contained those parameters which seemed to be unaffected by discharge. <b>Group</b> <b>A</b> <b>parameters</b> included nitrate concentration, nitrite concentration, turbidity, ortho- and meta-phosphate concentrations.

40|$|Background. Burns cause a {{systemic}} inflammatory response, endothelial dysfunction, and increased microvascular permeability {{which results in}} oedema being formed; these effects {{are probably the result}} of a complex interplay between the direct effects of heat on the microcirculation and the action of chemical mediators, including reactive oxygen species. The use of antioxidants can reduce these changes, which are considered a promised step in burns management. Patients and methods. Forty-eight burn patients of either sex and with varying burns percentages were involved in the study. They were each allocated to one of four groups: A, B, C, and D, each group composed of 12 patients. Groups B, C, and D were treated with antioxidants: allopurinol, melatonin, and N-acetylcysteine respectively, while <b>group</b> <b>A</b> was treated according to normal hospital policy, without antioxidants; 12 healthy subjects (group E) served as <b>a</b> control <b>group</b> for comparison. In each group, serum malondialdehyde and serum glutathione levels were measured and liver and kidney function tests were performed, as well as microalbuminuria tests, using standard methods. Results. The administration of antioxidants to burns patients produced significant improvements in the parameters studied compared to <b>group</b> <b>A</b> <b>parameters</b> (no antioxidant given). Conclusion. This study clearly demonstrates the role of reactive oxygen species in endothelial dysfunction occurring in burn patients and the beneficial effect of antioxidants in reducing it, as shown by the reduced microalbuminuria and reduced resuscitation fluid in antioxidant-treated burn patients; the study also supports newly emerging evidence regarding the use of microalbuminuria as an indicator for endothelial dysfunction in burn patient...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Treatment of dilutional {{coagulopathy}} by transfusing {{fresh frozen}} plasma (FFP) remains sub-optimal. We hypothesized that partial replacement of transfused FFP by fibrinogen concentrate results in improved coagulant activity and haemostasis. This was tested in a controlled clinical intervention trial with patients experiencing massive bleeding during major surgery. METHODS: Patients undergoing major elective surgery were treated according to current protocols. When transfusion with FFP was required, patients were randomized as follows: <b>group</b> <b>A</b> received 4 units FFP and group B received 2 units FFP plus 2 g fibrinogen concentrate. Blood samples were taken {{before and after the}} intervention. Analysts were blinded to the treatment type. RESULTS: <b>Group</b> <b>A</b> (B) consisted of 21 (22) patients, in 16 (17) of whom bleeding stopped after intervention. Plasma fibrinogen increased significantly more in group B (0. 57 g/l) than in <b>group</b> <b>A</b> (0. 05 g/l). However, levels of prothrombin and factors VIII, IX and X increased more in <b>group</b> <b>A</b> than in <b>group</b> B. Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) of whole blood and plasma revealed improved fibrin clot formation in group B but not in <b>group</b> <b>A.</b> Thrombin generation [calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT) ] in plasma increased more in <b>group</b> <b>A.</b> Principal <b>parameters</b> determining whole-blood thromboelastometry were the fibrinogen level and platelet count. In vitro addition of fibrinogen and prothrombin complex concentrate to pre-intervention samples restored both ROTEM and CAT parameters.
