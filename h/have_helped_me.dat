500|$|Details {{of a film}} {{examining}} Hitchcock's {{obsession with}} Hedren were reported in December 2011. The Girl, written by Gwyneth Hughes, would star Toby Jones as Hitchcock and Sienna Miller as Hedren. In a post-production BBC press release about the film in November 2012, Hughes described her enthusiasm when she was approached about the project while on holiday: [...] " [...] {{got a phone call}} from producer Amanda Jenks. She only managed to get out the words 'Alfred Hitchcock and Tippi Hedren' before I was already shouting 'yes yes yes!' to this seductive, sinister, deeply touching story of love and obsession among Hollywood royalty." [...] Hughes interviewed Hedren and members of Hitchcock's crew before preparing a script. She described her discussions with Hedren: [...] "Her wisdom and insights <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to put her real life ordeal on to the screen. I know Tippi is absolutely thrilled, as I am, with the casting of Sienna Miller to play her." [...] The film's title was inspired by the name Hitchcock used for Hedren after she stopped working for him.|$|E

Later on in the press conference, he commented on equalling Ayrton Senna's number of victories: [...] "Also knowing that this would be the race that I would equal Ayrton, who won here and who had quite an interesting [...] here. So, yeah, quite an emotional day. But to be honest I'm not a teary guy, so I'm just full of joy and happiness and light and I'm really grateful for [...] all the people who <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> get to where I am today and this team, because without them I would not be here." [...] Nico Rosberg acknowledged that [...] "it's going the wrong way" [...] in terms of his championship hopes as he would have needed a victory and declared: [...] "Just need to try to win next time out." [...] Sebastian Vettel lamented his chances at second place, as he said that he could have stayed in front of Rosberg had he made a pit stop a lap earlier during the second round of stops, However, he stated that [...] "with hindsight, it's always easy so, nevertheless, it's a great day". Hamilton followed up on his delight at matching Senna later on, saying: [...] "For me to win here at a race where I loved watching Ayrton drive and to match his wins, it doesn't feel real at the moment." [...] Senna had won his three world championship titles at Suzuka.|$|E

[...] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, [...] "I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word."

2500|$|Jud Friedman and Allan Rich had {{previously}} written a No. 1 hit for James Ingram, [...] "I Don't Have the Heart", but that didn't necessarily {{give them an}} edge in placing a song for [...] soundtrack. After all, they had to compete {{with many of the}} top songwriters in the industry for the hot soundtrack project. Firstly, Rich began working on the lyric for [...] "Run to You". Rich said that [...] "I was going through a break-up in my life at the time, which may <b>have</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> write a lyric which reflected the feelings I was experiencing. I wrote the lyric in a few days, then I presented the lyric to Jud." [...] Friedman, who was inspired by Rich's lyric wrote most of the music, then they finished the song together. When it was completed, they recorded a very simple demo with just piano, guitar samples and strings and then brought in Valerie Pinkston to sing the demo.|$|E
