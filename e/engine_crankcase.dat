25|$|On 23 September 2006, 55 022 (D9000) Royal Scots Grey {{returned}} to the main line after a lengthy and extensive restoration at Barrow Hill, carried out {{on behalf of the}} owners by the DPS. It successfully hauled the SRPS 'Moray Mint' railtour from Edinburgh to Inverness, via Perth on the outward trip and back via Aberdeen. On its second working two weeks later, severe damage occurred to the number 2 end engine. The engine suffered from a leg out of bed, a term which means the engine con-rod breaks out of the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase.</b> This left Royal Scots Grey still able to operate but on one engine only. By January 2007, the faulty power unit was removed from 55 022, put into storage and replaced by an ex-marine Napier Deltic engine modified for rail use; work was completed by Royal Scots Greys dedicated team in August 2007. After extensive testing at the East Lancs Railway the locomotive hauled its first tour since the previous engine malfunction on RTC's 'Autumn Highlander' with 50 049 and 40 145 in October 2007. 55 022 successfully hauled a number of charter tour services during 2008 but the replacement marine-sourced engine gave rise for concern following the discovery of oil in the coolant {{and at the end of}} August the locomotive was removed from future large railtour duties. The locomotive continued working mainline duty by visiting other preserved railway and moving other non-mainline registered locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|His {{first plane}} was a Thomas-Morse S-4C Scout, A single-seat biplane with fabric-covered wooden {{airframe}} {{it had been}} an advanced trainer for World War I pilots. Its engine was quite common at the time, while being most unusual today - a rotary Le Rhône [...] Rotary, in which the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> with cylinders rotate and drive the propeller, while the crankshaft is stationary, being attached to the firewall. Moye paid movie stunt pilot Leo Nomis [...] $450 for the Scout after his father relented and allowed the boy to buy the plane. (In 2007 a [...] "Tommie" [...] was on sale for $125,000.) Stephens' plane weighed 961 pounds empty and had no throttle. It did have two power-control levers, or manettes, in its place, which served in lieu of carburetor, one controlling air intake, the other, fuel. Engine speed was controlled by a so-called blipper, a switch. To manage speed as he taxied for take off, the pilot cut ignition with the blipper switch, then let it start again. With this plane Moye really learned how to fly.|$|E
5000|$|Exhaust steam {{goes into}} the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase.</b> Any oil used to {{lubricate}} crankshaft and connecting rod bearings would soon form an emulsion of oil and water that would have very poor lubricating properties.|$|E
50|$|This vacuum {{can also}} be used to draw any piston blow-by gases from the <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase.</b> This is known as a {{positive}} crankcase ventilation system, in which the gases are burned with the fuel/air mixture.|$|R
50|$|The MS was a {{modified}} Lambretta Series III with very narrow leg shields and cropped side panels that revealed the <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase.</b> It was first produced in 1973 and was colloquially {{known as the}} 'mini-saia' (mini-skirt).|$|R
50|$|The {{frame was}} a diamond design with a {{reinforced}} single front down tube bolting to the <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase.</b> The {{top of the}} frame was a reinforced double-tube over and under configuration meeting a multi-tube box under the rider.|$|R
5000|$|A {{carburetor}} {{that does}} not completely close can contribute to running once the engine is off, since the extra fuel and oxygen mixture can combust easily in the warm piston chamber. Similarly, hot vaporized oil gases from the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> can provide ample fuel for dieseling.|$|E
50|$|The Waste Heat Engine's design {{requires}} {{the use of}} water to lubricate the moving parts because exhaust steam goes into the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase.</b> Any oil used to lubricate crankshaft and connecting rod bearings would soon form an emulsion of oil and water that would have very poor lubricating properties.|$|E
5000|$|The four-speed gearbox was {{bolted to}} the back of the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> and was powered by double-helical gears, and a nine-plate clutch. The engine ran [...] "backward", or counter to the rear wheel. Shifting was {{initially}} by hand, but was changed to a foot-shift system in 1935. The engine oil filter was mounted behind the gearbox.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{aim of this}} {{elaboration}} was {{an attempt}} to determine a mathematical description of a blow-by phenomenon to <b>engine</b> <b>crankcases</b> for various types of engines on the basis of many years of the author’s previous work.

5000|$|Wright Aeronautical used a {{magnesium}} crankcase in the WWII-era Wright Duplex Cyclone aviation engine. This {{presented a}} serious problem for the earliest models of the Boeing B-29 heavy bomber when an in-flight engine fire ignited the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase.</b> The resulting combustion was as hot as 5,600 °F (3,100 °C) and could sever the wing spar from the fuselage.|$|E
50|$|In {{a normal}} {{in-service}} power assembly replacement situation, the replacement will follow an {{inspection of the}} engine specifically performed to find internal engine failures. With the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> access and cylinder block airbox covers removed, a visual inspection of the engine's rotating and reciprocating assemblies can be performed. The use of a fiber optic endoscope (flexible borescope) may facilitate this inspection and evaluation, {{but this is not}} a requirement, nor is it a part of EMD's maintenance program.|$|E
5000|$|The White Cliffs Solar Power Station, {{running in}} the 1980s, used a very high {{efficiency}} single acting steam engine based on a Diesel <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase,</b> with uniflow exhaust ports and [...] "bash" [...] type admission valves. The high steam admission pressure (about 600 PSI, 41 Bar), high operating speed (1500 RPM), and uniflow porting allowed steam engine cycle efficiency in excess of 20%, very rare for a reciprocating steam cycle.

Its practical application to the calculation of intake pipes is illustrated by example...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] Mercedes D.II six-cylinder liquid-cooled inline engine {{selected}} for the design had a simple, clamshell-like horizontally split cowling enclosing the <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase</b> and lower cylinder block, and an advanced engine radiator layout, placing the radiator in a ventral position under the forward fuselage, with {{the front of the}} radiator housing's opening just behind the front gear strut's attachment points to the fuselage, and with the radiator's housing having a width equal to that of the fuselage above it.|$|R

50|$|After {{leaving the}} shipyard, Windlass {{conducted}} diving operations off Cape Charles, Virginia before she proceeded to Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, {{to assist in}} rigging YC-1060 for technical tests. On 14 February 1952, Windlass, towing YC-1010, got underway for Norfolk. Two days later, while the salvage ship and her charge were en route to their destination, an explosion occurred in Windlass port <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase,</b> injuring one man and starting a fire. After the crew extinguished the blaze with no further damage, Windlass proceeded {{the remainder of the}} way to Norfolk on one engine. After arrival, both of Windlass engines were inspected carefully and again overhauled.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{differences}} {{distinguish the}} three series: After the first series, brake discs were drilled. The first series kept the [...] "/5" [...] series kick start lever. The later 17mm diameter front axle {{was stronger than}} the first series 14mm axle. The original R90S had [...] "/5" [...] switchgear, but this was changed in 1975 to a new non-standard design that proved unpopular. The <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> breather was a phenolic disc-&-spring item which made a 'popping' sound as the breather operated. The modified [...] "/7" [...] breather was a reed valve design, which could be retro-fitted to [...] "/6" [...] models to replace their noisy breathers.|$|E
50|$|In 1932, New Imperial {{started to}} use unit construction, where the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> and gearbox are {{incorporated}} in the same casting. They made a Unit Minor 150 and Unit Super 250. They continued to use unit-construction, and some models used Bentley and Draper sprung frames, in an era still dominated by rigid frames. By 1938 all New Imperial engines employed unit construction. In 1934 Ginger Woods, riding a New Imperial 500 cc V-twin for one hour, achieved a 102.2 mph (164.4 km/h) average at Brooklands. In September 1935 R J D 'Bob' Burnie of Sketty, Swansea, completed 'The Flying Kilometre' at Southport Sands in the British Open Speed Championship on the same bike with a speed of 100.76 mph.|$|E
5000|$|Two-stroke engines have a total-loss {{lubrication}} system. Lubricating oil {{is mixed}} with the fuel, either manually beforehand (the petroil method), or automatically via an oil pump. Prior to being burned in the combustion chamber, this air/fuel/oil mixture passes through the <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase,</b> lubricating the moving parts as it does so. In order to reduce exhaust smoke, the Kawasaki H2 [...] 2-stroke triple motorcycle had a scavenge pump with a spring-loaded ball-valve under each crankcase to return surplus oil to the tank for reuse.|$|R
50|$|In a {{four-stroke}} <b>engine,</b> the <b>crankcase</b> {{is filled}} mainly with air and oil, and is largely sealed {{off from the}} fuel/air mixture by the pistons.|$|R
5000|$|Compounds {{sold for}} {{addition}} to the vehicle's fuel may include tin, magnesium and platinum. The claimed purpose of these is generally toimprove the energy density of the fuel. Additives for {{addition to the}} engine oil, sometimes marketed as [...] "engine treatments", contain teflon, zinc, or chlorine compounds; none of these is appropriate or helpful when added to an <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase,</b> and they can in fact damage the engine. The US Federal Trade Commission has aggressively pursued marketers of oil additives falsely claimed to improve fuel economy.|$|R
50|$|The Honda CBR600F4 was {{produced}} between 1999 and 2000. It {{is the last}} of the CBR600 series of Honda sportbikes to be carbureted. An aluminium twin spar frame which reduced frame weight was used, and the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> was designed to share swing-arm pivot. Through a reduction of internal friction and weight, combined with larger valves, shorter stroke, and a bigger bore, higher revs were enabled. The spark plug caps had Ignition coils built into them. Slightly larger carbs were added and the oil cooler was now located by the oil filter. A new suspension had larger 43 mm forks and used Fireblade parts. The front brakes were upgraded, and the rear rim increased to 5.5” with new 3-spoke wheels. The F4 was fitted with Honda’s HISS engine immobiliser system.|$|E
50|$|Diels-Alder {{reaction}} of maleic anhydride and butadiene and isoprene gives the respective tetrahydrophthalic anhydrides {{which can be}} hydrogenated to the corresponding hexahydrophthalic anhydrides. These species are used a curing agents in epoxy resins. Another market for maleic anhydride is lubricating oil additives, which are used in gasoline and diesel <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> oils as dispersants and corrosion inhibitors. Changes in lubricant specifications and more efficient engines have had {{a negative effect on}} the demand for lubricating oil additives, giving flat growth prospects for maleic anhydride in this application. A number of smaller applications for maleic anhydride. The food industry uses maleic anhydride in artificial sweeteners and flavour enhancements. Personal care products consuming maleic anhydride include hair sprays, adhesives and floor polishes. Maleic anhydride is also a precursor to compounds used for water treatment detergents, insecticides and fungicides, pharmaceuticals, and other copolymers.|$|E
50|$|Harley-Davidson's {{intention}} {{in introducing}} a new middleweight model was {{to increase the}} size of the motorcycle market by appealing to new riders with an entry-level product. The design imitated the British Douglas motorcycle flat-twin with cylinders in line with the frame, and offered several features that were meant to bring new motorcyclists into the market, including a smoother running engine than a typical Harley-Davidson V-twin, a lower center of gravity for easier handling, and a design that kept the rider and the motorcycle cleaner from oil and the dirt that oil attracted. It was cleaner because there were fewer oil compartments, due to the transmission and clutch being integrated with the <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase,</b> providing fewer ways for the oil to leak. In addition, an optional drive chain enclosure could keep chain lubricant off the motorcycle and the rider's clothing.|$|E
50|$|A {{supplementary}} {{air supply}} {{controlled by a}} foot pedal operated at will by the driver provides an oil mist from inside the <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase</b> to lubricate {{the tops of the}} valve sleeves. A three-plunger pump driven by the valve shaft forces oil from the sump to troughs under and {{in the path of the}} big ends. With each revolution the big ends dipping into the troughs throw oil to all parts of the engine. The dashboard has a telltale to warn if the pump is not working properly.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{the first}} all-Italian Bimota {{it came with}} a 750 cc Ducati 90° V-twin engine with Desmodromic valve-train in {{different}} levels of tune and styling. The frame is made of Chrome-Molybdenum steel tubing and uses a Triangulated Upper Space Frame or [...] "Birdcage" [...] design. The engine is a stressed member and the swingarm pivots in <b>engine's</b> <b>crankcase.</b> The DB1s triple-trees, clip-ons, rear-sets and several other bits are made of lightweight, hot stamped and billet Avional 14 aluminum. The Cagiva/Bimota/Ducati/DB1 prototype morphed into the Ducati Paso ironically designed by Bimota co-founder Massimo Tamburini.|$|R

50|$|The {{spark plug}} was {{installed}} horizontally {{into the rear}} of the cylinder at the top but had no connecting high-voltage wire. An internal-tooth ring gear mounted on the engine drove a stationary magneto mounted on the firewall, whose high-voltage output terminal was in close proximity to the spark plug terminals as they passed by. This arrangement eliminated the need for distributor and high-voltage wiring found in conventional mechanically timed ignition systems. This ring gear also drove the oil pump, which supplied oil to all bearings, and through hollow pushrods to the rockers and valves and also drove an air pump which pressurized the fuel tank. The later, 160 CV Gnome 9N engines had dual ignition systems for safety, with twin spark plugs per cylinder which were electrically wired, with the wires routed onto the crankcase and a central pair of magnetos driven by the spinning <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase.</b>|$|E
50|$|By 1943 the {{ultimate}} {{development of the}} new bomber program, the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, was flying. The engines remained temperamental, and showed an alarming tendency for the rear cylinders to overheat, partially due to minimal clearance between the cylinder baffles and the cowl. A number of changes were introduced into the Superfortress' production line {{in order to provide}} more cooling at low speeds, with the aircraft rushed into operational use in the Pacific in 1944. This proved unwise, as the early B-29 tactics of maximum weights, when combined with the high temperatures of the tropical airfields where B-29s were based, produced overheating problems that were not completely solved, and the engines having an additional tendency to swallow their own valves. Because of a high magnesium content in the potentially combustible crankcase alloy, the resulting engine fires — sometimes burning with a core temperature approaching 5,600 °F (3,100 °C) from the Duplex Cyclone's magnesium <b>engine</b> <b>crankcase</b> alloys — were often so intense the main spar could burn through in seconds, resulting in catastrophic wing failure.|$|E

50|$|Unlike a {{four-stroke}} <b>engine,</b> whose <b>crankcase</b> {{is closed}} except for its ventilation system, a two-stroke <b>engine</b> uses the <b>crankcase</b> {{as part of}} the induction tract, and therefore, oil must be mixed with gasoline to be distributed throughout the engine for lubrication. The resultant mix is referred to as petroil. This oil is ultimately burned along with the fuel as a total-loss oiling system. This results in increased exhaust emissions, sometimes with excess smoke and/or a distinctive odor.|$|R

At {{the same time the}} machine gun used was also changed: an lMG 08 machine gun (the so-called [...] "Spandau") replacing the Parabellum used with the prototype gear. At this time the Parabellum was still in very short supply, and all available examples were required as observers' guns, the lighter and handier weapon being far superior in this role.|$|R
