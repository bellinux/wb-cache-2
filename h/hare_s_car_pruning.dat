40|$|Extensive LWP-HI spectra were {{obtained}} of the Mira <b>S</b> <b>Car</b> {{at a rapid}} time cadence {{as compared with the}} shock cycle time of <b>S</b> <b>Car.</b> These spectra {{were obtained}} in an attempt to understand the velocity structures in the shocked wind using the fluoresced iron lines. Data analysis of the IUE observations, which included the primary calibration of all of the IUE spectra obtained of <b>S</b> <b>Car,</b> was carried out. In addition, line identifications, flux calculations, background subtractions, and line profile analysis as a function of <b>S</b> <b>Car's</b> pulsational phase were performed. The database incorporated all line identifications as a function of pulsation phase for all IUE LWP-HI observations to date of <b>S</b> <b>Car.</b> At least 45 separate iron line features are identified in the <b>S</b> <b>Car</b> spectrum at one or more phases of the shock cycle, including those due to Fe II (UV 161) which is pumped by three different iron lines; Fe I(UV 44) which is pumped by the Mg II k line. Other strong multiplets that have been identified include UV(1), UV(2), UV(5), UV(32), UV(60), UV(63), UV(161), UV(207), and UV(399). Over 300 weaker lines have also been tentatively identified with Fe line transitions...|$|R

According to a Tesla spokesman, the major reasons for the discrepancy could be that registration rules were holding deliveries in Shanghai, and Tesla only recently was able to start delivering the electric cars to customers who bought them in Shanghai.

40|$|We present time-resolved fs two-photon pump-probe data {{measured}} with photosystem I (PS I) of Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Two-photon excitation (λexc/ 2) 575 nm) in the spectral {{region of the}} optically forbidden first excited singlet state of the carotenoids, <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1, {{gives rise to a}} 800 fs and a 9 ps decay component of the <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 f Sn excited-state absorption with an amplitude of about 47 (16 % and 53 (10 %, respectively. By measuring a solution of pure "-carotene under exactly the same conditions, only a 9 ps decay component can be observed. Exciting PS I at exactly the same spectral region via one-photon excitation (λexc) 575 nm) also does not show any sub-ps component. We ascribe the observed constant of 800 fs to a portion of about 47 (16 % "-carotene states that can potentially transfer their energy efficiently to chlorophyll pigments via the optically dark <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 state. We compared these data with conventional one-photon pump-probe data, exciting the optically allowed second excited state, <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 2. This comparison demonstrates that the fast dynamics of the optically forbidden state can hardly be unravelled via conventional one-photon excitation only because the corresponding <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 populations are too small after <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 2 f <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 internal conversion. A direct comparison of the amplitudes of the <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 f Sn excited-state absorption of PS I and "-carotene observed after <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 2 excitation allows determination of a quantum yield for the <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 formation in PS I of 44 (5 %. In conclusion, an overall <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 2 f Chl energy-transfer efficiency of∼ 69 (5 % is observed at room temperature with 56 (5 % being transferred via <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 2 and probably very hot <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 states and 13 (5 % being transferred via hot and “cold ” <b>Car</b> <b>S</b> 1 states...|$|R
