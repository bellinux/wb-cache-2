5|$|An enhanced-potency IPV (inactivated polio vaccine) was {{licensed}} in the United States in November 1987, and {{is currently}} the vaccine of choice in the United States. The first dose of polio vaccine is <b>given</b> shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, a second dose is <b>given</b> at 4 months of age. The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation but should be <b>given</b> between 6 and 18 months of age. A booster vaccination is <b>given</b> at 4 to 6 years of age, {{for a total of}} four doses at or before school entry. In some countries, a fifth vaccination is <b>given</b> during adolescence. Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries. In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix) containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Any initial two {{disjoint}} <b>given</b> circles can {{be rendered}} concentric as follows. The radical {{axis of the}} two <b>given</b> circles is constructed; choosing two arbitrary points P and Q on this radical axis, two circles can be constructed that are centered on P and Q and that intersect the two <b>given</b> circles orthogonally. These two constructed circles intersect each other in two points. Inversion in one such intersection point F renders the constructed circles into straight lines emanating from F and the two <b>given</b> circles into concentric circles, with the third <b>given</b> circle becoming another circle (in general). This follows because the system of circles is equivalent {{to a set of}} Apollonian circles, forming a bipolar coordinate system.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius {{problem is}} to {{construct}} one or more circles tangent to three <b>given</b> objects in a plane, which may be circles, points, or lines. This gives rise to ten types of Apollonius' problem, one corresponding to each combination of circles, lines and points, which may be labeled with three letters, either C, L, or P, to denote whether the <b>given</b> elements are a circle, line or point, respectively (Table 1). As an example, the type of Apollonius problem with a <b>given</b> circle, line, and point is denoted as CLP.|$|E
5|$|Apollonius' {{problem can}} be {{extended}} to construct all the circles that intersect three <b>given</b> circles at a precise angle θ, or at three specified crossing angles θ1, θ2 and θ3; the ordinary Apollonius' problem corresponds to a special {{case in which the}} crossing angle is zero for all three <b>given</b> circles. Another generalization is the dual of the first extension, namely, to construct circles with three specified tangential distances from the three <b>given</b> circles.|$|E
