40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a new method 1 developed for equivalent loading for conducting <b>heat</b> <b>run</b> test for measuring full load temperature rise of three phase induction motors. This method {{does not require}} mechanical load, auxiliary machines or identical motor of similar rating. It simulates the running conditions with normally available apparatus avoiding laborious computations. The induction motor is run on no load at rated voltages across two phases with third phase open. The third phase is connected to a variable inductance. The rated load currents in all the phases are obtained by adjusting the third phase external inductance and making a little difference in two voltages. The different components of losses in new method are nearly same as the losses during normal full load operation. Hence the rise above ambient temperature can be determined accurately. The experimental results on <b>heat</b> <b>run</b> tests with new method and with conventional method show an excellent agreement with each other, confirming {{the validity of the}} proposed method.

Results: These techniques were applied for the hot resistance estimation for dry type transformer by using the input variables cold resistance, ambient temperature and temperature rise. The results are compared and they show a good agreement between measured and computed values.

40|$|Voltage {{stability}} {{requires the}} continuing {{control of the}} total system 2 ̆ 7 s supply of reactive power during emergency situation. The supply of reactive power, however, can be curtailed {{by the action of}} rotor over-current protection or over-excitation limiter (OEL) in reducing the rotating unit reactive power output. Practical <b>heat</b> <b>run</b> tests shows that the timing of the activation of the OEL can be very conservative, resulting in earlier than necessary operation and system voltage collapse. Significant benefit can be achieved if the timing of the OEL activation can be delayed while ensuring sufficient margin is provided to avoid harming the rotor of the synchronous generator. This paper proposes a new thermal-based method to determine the timing of the OEL activation that is based on the thermal capacity of the rotor as the main indicator for limiting the excitation level of the synchronous generator. The proposed thermal based method is validated using the extensive simulations of a single-machine and the Nordic power system. Simulation studies show that the system voltage collapse can be delayed significantly by delaying the OEL activation without compromising the thermal capacity of the rotor if the proposed OEL setting is used...|$|E
