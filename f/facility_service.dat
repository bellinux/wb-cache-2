50|$|Just over one-third (35%) of births in Nepal {{occur in}} health facilities. They most {{commonly}} occur in Eastern terai (50%) and Western terai (48%) regions. One {{may go to}} a private or public hospital or clinic, but costs are generally higher at private ones. The remaining two-thirds of births occur at home due to the aforementioned belief in the natural process and lack of perceived need for a health <b>facility</b> <b>service.</b> Home births are skewed in areas of rural regions (67%) compared with urban areas (28%) due to various factors including access, cost, and awareness of delivery care. On the other hand, birthing centers are starting to increase, but are still rarely used currently. UNICEF has supported the establishment of 12 birthing centres in Humla as one of many plans to increase access to women in more rural, remote villages in Nepal.|$|E

5000|$|A Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) is {{a notice}} filed with an {{aviation}} authority to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards along a flight route or {{at a location}} that could affect {{the safety of the}} flight. [...] NOTAMs are unclassified notices or advisories distributed by means of telecommunication that contain information concerning the establishment, conditions or change in any aeronautical <b>facility,</b> <b>service,</b> procedure or hazard, the timely knowledge of which is essential to personnel and systems concerned with flight operations. NOTAMs are created and transmitted by government agencies and airport operators under guidelines specified by Annex 15: Aeronautical Information Services of the Convention on International Civil Aviation (CICA). The term NOTAM came into common use rather than the more formal Notice to Airmen following the ratification of the CICA, which came into effect on 4 April 1947. Notices to Airmen were normally published in a regular publication by each country's air authorities (e.g., in Flight Magazine in the UK). A number of developments and amendments to the CICA have resulted in the more automated system available today.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to define the added value of {{facility}} management (FM) in general and to develop a typology of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> based on their added value in the educational environment. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is based on a literature review and first assesses the different aspects of FM added value. The different variables and relations between the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> and their effects on the educational achievement are then conceptualised and studied. Findings – Research shows that FM added value is the customer perceived trade-off between the effects of the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> on the outcome of their processes, its costs and risks. On this basis, a typology of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> was constructed around their level of fixity and their influence on the learning outcome. Practical implications – The typology strongly indicates for FM when to engage in the decision-making process relating to the educational environment in order to contribute to education. Also the typology is useful for deriving priorities for adjusting the current use situation of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> to enhance their effectiveness in both a time and financially efficient manner. Originality/value – This paper operationalises the concept of FM added value and provides several hypotheses and firm recommendations for further research to maximise the contribution of FM. The paper also presents a practical framework for evidenced-based decision making on the use of <b>facility</b> <b>services</b> in the educational environment. It thus offers opportunities for FM to support the future learning landscap...|$|R

40|$|TOPIC: An Analysis of Marketing Strategies of an Integrated Facility Services Company: The Case of ISS, Sweden AUTHORS: Collins Nwakanma Amanze, Sondengam B. K. A SUPERVISOR: Anders Hederstierna COURSE: Master Thesis in Business Administration DEPARTMENT: School of Management, Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden PROGRAMME: Masters in Business Administration (MBA) PURPOSE: The {{purpose of}} our {{research}} is to understand how Integrated <b>Facility</b> <b>service</b> companies (using ISS, Sweden as our focus) develop, plan and implement useful marketing strategies that are result orientated and {{in line with the}} triple bottom line which encompasses economic profitability,social awareness and environmental responsibility. METHOD: We used both primary and secondary data sources. The secondary data used were literature review to enable us understand the general concept on marketing strategies and what research has been conducted on our topic. The primary data source was mainly interview with our contact person at ISS. These methods are all geared towards answering our research questions. RESEARCH QUESTION: The research questions are: 1. What strategies are used by ISS? 2. What strategies (if any) are relevant for the possible growth of an integrated facility services company? 3. How can these strategies be used to yield expected results in form of environmental responsibility, profits and company growth? FINDINGS: From the research we conducted as well as the analysis we made, we were able to determine ISS marketing strategy and to also find out that their marketing strategies lead the organization towards their corporate vision of leading facility services globally. We also established the fact that since we studied only one integrated facility company which is ISS, our conclusions can not be generalized {{as a rule of thumb}} for every integrated <b>facility</b> <b>service</b> company due to several factors highlighted in the body of our thesis. Also, we stressed the importance of environmental management system for every integrated <b>facility</b> <b>service</b> company. This standard in our opinion, would not only proof that such a company is serious about corporate social responsibility, it would also help lead the organization towards the triple bottom line...|$|E
