Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 22–34 by 8–9μm. The fusiform (fuse-shaped) cystidia are colourless with oil droplets, and have dimensions of 40–50 by 7–8μm.

5|$|Balfour {{also gave}} the island its most {{noticeable}} landmark when he recruited an Edinburgh architect, David Bryce, to transform Cliffdale House into the Scottish Baronial Balfour Castle. Other buildings he {{added to the}} island include the porter's lodge (now a public house called The Gatehouse), a water mill, a school, and a gasworks that remained operational until the 1920s. The gasworks <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a round tower with a corbelled parapet of red brick and carved stones—including one possibly removed from Noltland Castle on Westray, which is inscribed with the year 1725. The structure appears to be fortified, in accordance with Balfour's intention to give the village a medieval appearance. David Balfour was also responsible {{for the construction of}} Mill Dam, a wetland which was once the water supply for the mill and is now an RSPB nature reserve.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{essential}} to all known living systems, and without it {{life as we know}} it could not exist (see alternative biochemistry). The major economic use of carbon other than food and wood <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of hydrocarbons, most notably the fossil fuel methane gas and crude oil (petroleum). Crude oil is distilled in refineries by the petrochemical industry to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other products. Cellulose is a natural, carbon-containing polymer produced by plants in the form of wood, cotton, linen, and hemp. Cellulose is used primarily for maintaining structure in plants. Commercially valuable carbon polymers of animal origin include wool, cashmere and silk. Plastics are made from synthetic carbon polymers, often with oxygen and nitrogen atoms included at regular intervals in the main polymer chain. The raw materials for many of these synthetic substances come from crude oil.|$|E

The volume of each unit cell of vanadinite, given by the formula V = a2c sin(60°), is 678.72Å3.|$|E
5|$|Kīlauea {{has been}} active {{throughout}} its history. Since 1918, Kīlauea's only prolonged period of rest was an 18-year pause between 1934 and 1952. The bulk of Kīlauea consists of solidified lava flows, intermittent with scattered volcanic ash and tephra sourced from relatively lower-volume explosive eruptions. Much of the volcano is covered in historical flows, and 90 percent of its surface dates from the last 1,100 years. Kīlauea built itself up from the seafloor over time, and thus much of its bulk remains underwater; its subaerial surface <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a gently sloping, elongate, decentralized shield with a surface area of approximately , making up 13.7 percent of the island's total surface area.|$|E

5|$|On {{the largest}} scale, the Universe is {{continually}} expanding, {{resulting in an}} average increase in the separation between individual galaxies (see Hubble's law). Associations of galaxies can overcome this expansion on a local scale through their mutual gravitational attraction. These associations formed early in the Universe, as clumps of dark matter pulled their respective galaxies together. Nearby groups later merged to form larger-scale clusters. This on-going merger process (as well as an influx of infalling gas) heats the inter-galactic gas within a cluster to very high temperatures, reaching 30–100 megakelvins. About 70–80% of the mass in a cluster <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of dark matter, with 10–30% consisting of this heated gas and the remaining few percent of the matter {{in the form of}} galaxies.|$|E

5|$|The {{church was}} {{designed}} in the French Gothic style by French architects including Étienne de Bonneuil. It <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a cross formed by the nave and transept. Most of the structure was built between 1272 and 1420 but the western end was completed only {{in the middle of}} the 15th century. Twin towers were built shortly afterwards on the west end of the church. High spires were added later, but after a fire in 1702, they were adorned with low helms by Carl Hårleman in 1735. They were completely redesigned by Helgo Zetterwall who undertook substantial changes to the building in the 1880s. The cathedral's principal construction material is brick but the pillars and many details are of Gotland limestone.|$|E

The larger section depicts George Stephenson's Locomotion No 1, the steam locomotive that hauled the first train on the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825, representing the importance of the railway industry to the area. Across the bottom of the shield is a ribbon bearing the club's nickname, The Quakers, and the whole rests on a bed of oak leaves, symbolic of strength and endurance.|$|E
5|$|The fruits are small, {{round and}} yellow, and can ripen and turn red {{at any time}} of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of a syconium, an {{inverted}} inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. F.rubiginosa is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species Pleistodontes imperialis, which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), F.rubiginosa grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.|$|E
5|$|The present {{structure}} has many traces of great antiquity, being large and {{built in the}} form of a cross, with a door of early Gothic architecture. The building was probably erected some time after the Norman Conquest, as the plain pointed arch prevails throughout; exactly when we cannot be sure, though possibly after 1246. The earliest visible stonework is thirteenth century, in the tower and the arches supporting it. The external appearance of the church is large and ancient, being erected of rubble stone, with ashlar quoins and windows. The severe appearance and thick walls of the nave suggest Norman architecture, however the presence of pointed lancet windows indicate that it is early Gothic, perhaps from early thirteenth century. Internally the church <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> of an aisleless cruciform church with substantial transepts. It was rebuilt (or built afresh) in the thirteenth century after a fire, and the chancel extended in the fifteenth century, after which the structure was largely complete as it is seen today.|$|E
