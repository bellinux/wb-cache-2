25|$|A popular {{movement}} against {{nuclear power}} has gained {{strength in the}} Western world, based on concerns about more nuclear accidents and concerns about nuclear waste. Anti-nuclear critics see nuclear power as a dangerous, expensive way to boil water to generate electricity. The 1979 Three Mile Island accident and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster {{played a key role}} in stopping new plant construction in many countries. Major anti-nuclear power groups include Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Energy</b> and Environmental Research, Nuclear Information and Resource Service, and Sortir du nucléaire (France).|$|E
25|$|Bjørge was {{responsible}} for hardware, Skår for software and Konrad-Mohn for sales. The company's first computer was Nord-1, which was a further development of SAM 2. It offered 0.5 million instructions per second (MIPS) and would sell for {{a few hundred thousand}} krone. To secure a bank guarantee for the first loan, life insurance was taken out on the three founders, with the beneficiary going to the bank. The development work started while the trio were working at NDRE, which was cooperating with the <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Energy</b> Technology and Kongsberg. Preliminary work was therefore sent to both organizations to allow them to build computers.|$|E

During this time period, five new interdisciplinary research institutes were initiated that are the focal point for Florida Tech undergraduate and graduate research. These new research university institutes include the Indian River Lagoon Research Institute, Human-Centered Design Institute, <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Energy</b> Systems, Institute for Marine Research, Institute for Materials Science & Nanotechnology and Institute for Research on Global Climate Change. Other research facilities include the Harris Institute for Assured Information, Institute for Computing and Information Systems, National Center for Hydrogen Research, Institute for Biological and Biomedical Sciences and the National Center for Small Business Information.|$|E

25|$|In September 2012, Carnegie Mellon {{announced}} {{the construction of}} the Sherman and Joyce Bowie Scott Hall on the Pittsburgh campus. The new building will be situated between Hamerschlag Hall, Roberts Hall, and Wean Hall and will house the university-wide Wilton E. Scott <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Energy</b> Innovation, a new nanotechnology research center, the Institute for Complex Engineered Systems, and the Biomedical Engineering Department. Further, in November 2013, Carnegie Mellon announced a $67 million gift from David Tepper, who previously donated $56 million, to develop the Tepper Quadrangle on the north campus. The Tepper Quad will include a new Tepper School of Business facility across Forbes Avenue from a renovated and expanded Heinz College as well as other university-wide buildings and a welcome center which will serve as a public gateway to the university. Alongside the Tepper Quad and Hamburg Hall, Carnegie Mellon will construct an innovation center with a $35 million gift from Tata Consultancy Services which will partner with Carnegie Mellon to develop technology and business solutions.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Energy</b> Research {{commissioned}} the Danish think-tank CEPOS (Centre for Political Studies) {{to report on}} electricity exports from Denmark and {{the economic impact of}} the Danish wind industry. This heavily criticized report states that Danes pay the highest residential electricity rates in the European Union (mostly for government revenue, but partly to subsidize wind power), and that the cost of saving a ton of carbon dioxide between 2001 and 2008 has averaged 647 DKK (€87, US$124). It also estimated that 90% of wind industry jobs were transferred from other technology industries, and states that as a result Danish GDP is 1.8billion DKK (US$270million) lower {{than it would have been}} without wind industry subsidies of 1.7-2.6 billion DKK (roughly $320M - $480M) yearly in 2001-2005. The report was later heavily criticised. Firstly Danish engineering magazine Ingeniøren claimed that the report was ordered and paid for by the American oil and coal lobby through IER. Later, several Danish researchers and professors from all technical universities in Denmark, wrote a joint response to the report, refuting it. The report from CEPOS was even brought to Government level, where minister of Climate and Energy Lykke Friis discredited the work done by CEPOS and the report. The World Nuclear Association estimates that the report was IER's response to US president Obama's 2009 Earth Day speech in Newton, Iowa claiming that USA could generate 20% of its electricity from wind by 2030, as Denmark already was.|$|E

2500|$|The Times {{published}} an article alleging that the key aim of the Kremlin was to stifle the continued expansion of the EU and NATO into Eastern Europe by exposing Ukraine as an unreliable ally. This view was shared by Vladimir Milov, president of the Institute of Energy Policy in Moscow and former deputy energy minister of Russia, who also claimed that Russia was putting pressure on the Ukrainian government for pursuing pro-western goals. The US Ambassador to NATO, Kurt Volker, stated that {{although it was a}} commercial dispute, he believed that Russia was using the event to gain political leverage. Contrarily, the Oxford <b>Institute</b> <b>for</b> <b>Energy</b> Studies concluded in a report: [...] "We {{do not believe that the}} often-cited desire of the Russian government to use energy as an economic or political ‘weapon' against European countries played any part in this crisis." [...] Although the report also stated that the Russian decision to cut back deliveries on January 5, 2009 [...] "may have reflected Prime Minister Putin’s anger and frustration, and been aimed at punishing Ukraine for its repeated threats to disrupt transit. These emotions may have been personalized to President Yushchenko, given the historical animosity of Russia towards the Orange Revolution and towards Yushchenko’s subsequent policy orientation away from Russia." ...|$|E
