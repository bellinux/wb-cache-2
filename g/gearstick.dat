2500|$|One {{novel model}} was the 2CV Sahara, a four-wheel drive (4×4) car, {{equipped}} with two engines (12hp each), each one having a separate fuel tank. One was {{mounted in the}} front driving the front wheels {{and one in the}} back driving the rear wheels. A single <b>gearstick,</b> clutch pedal and accelerator were connected to both engines. It was originally intended for use by the French colonies in Northern Africa. As well as a decreased chance of being stranded, it provided four-wheel-drive traction with continuous drive to some wheels while others were slipping because the engine transmissions were uncoupled. Therefore, it became popular with off-road enthusiasts. Between 1958 and 1971, Citroën built 694 Saharas. The top speed was [...] on one engine, and [...] with both engines running. These rare vehicles are highly collectible.|$|E
2500|$|Between 2000 and 2002, Volkswagen offered two {{sporting}} models — the 16V and GTI. The 16V {{came with}} the 1.4 litre16V [...] engine and had options such as 15" [...] Spa alloys and air conditioning. However, the GTI – available only in 3 or 5 door hatchback body styles in three colours being red, silver and black. Its power plant was a 1.6 litre16V [...] engine with variable valve timing. External changes included a deeper front splitter with honeycomb mesh grilles, lowered sports suspension (10mm), a subtle rear spoiler, deeper side skirts, fog lights, and 15" [...] BBS RXII split rims for the wheels bearing 195/45/15 tyres. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, xenon headlights with a headlight washer system, a six-disc CD autochanger with a GAMMA head unit, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel, handbrake and <b>gearstick,</b> chrome inserts, and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Polo GTI Mk3F however never got the new six-speed gearbox that {{was introduced in the}} smaller Volkswagen Lupo GTI which shared the same engine. Sadly, many of the Polo GTI 5 speed gearboxes fail due to faulty differential rivets and bearings which can only be rectified through a rebuild.|$|E
50|$|The I-Shift has no clutch pedal. It is {{controlled}} either by a <b>gearstick</b> {{mounted on the}} driver's seat or by buttons on the dashboard, just like a standard automatic gearbox. With the <b>gearstick,</b> the driver can use buttons to manually select gear, although this feature is disabled on some vehicles (where the <b>gearstick</b> has no buttons).|$|E
5000|$|In {{line with}} {{changes to the}} {{corresponding}} Oxford line, BMC redesigned the Isis for 1956 with updated styling including a more elaborate mesh grille, chrome side strips and small fins. The engine power increased to [...] An automatic transmission option was also added. The manual version had a four-speed box operated by a short <b>gearstick</b> {{on the right-hand side}} of the front bench seat. The handbrake lever was just behind the <b>gearstick.</b> Sales remained weak, and the line ended in 1958.|$|E
50|$|The DS {{remained}} {{popular and}} competitive throughout its production run. Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted <b>gearstick,</b> and separate fenders {{began to seem}} a little old-fashioned in the 1970s.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2000, the Twingo {{underwent}} {{its second}} major restyling. Additions included larger 14" [...] wheels, revised door trims with larger door pockets, a black trunk-opener lever (instead of shiny silver) and cup holders {{in front of}} the <b>gearstick.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The car was {{introduced}} with a four-speed gearbox which featured synchromesh {{on the top}} three ratios with no syncro on 1st gear, this gearbox {{was based on the}} reliant regal but had an extended tailshaft with a linkage for the <b>gearstick.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1969: Saab {{creates an}} {{ignition}} system near the <b>gearstick</b> - instead of behind {{the steering wheel}} like most cars - in an attempt to reduce the very common serious and permanent knee injuries during collisions, caused by the knee impacting the key.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{gradually}} modernized - e.g. the manual starter {{was replaced by}} an electrical one, the <b>gearstick</b> was moved inside the car, front brakes were added, etc. It was sold mostly as a luxurious limousine, although other variants were also made - e.g. ambulance or a race car.|$|E
50|$|Most models had a rear {{limited slip}} {{differential}} and some variants had a vacuum or electric solenoid operated manual rear differential lock. A rear sway bar release mechanism appeared on some models. Some Y60s had a PTO-driven front-mounted winch, with an in-cab control lever {{to the right of}} the <b>gearstick.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Panda {{includes}} {{an option for}} split rear seats, which makes the Panda a four-seater. Since September 2005, all Pandas are equipped with ABS, EBD {{and at least one}} front airbag. The gear-lever is located high on the central dashboard, which is designed to make changing gears more comfortable than with a conventional floor-mounted <b>gearstick.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including centrifugal clutches, torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic declutching when moving the <b>gearstick,</b> pre-selector controls, centrifugal clutches with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|E
50|$|Automatic {{transmissions}} can typically shift ratios {{faster than}} a manual gear change can be accomplished, due to the time required for the average driver to push the clutch pedal {{to the floor and}} move the <b>gearstick</b> from one position to another. This is especially true in regards to dual-clutch transmissions, which are specialized computer-controlled automatic transmissions that mechanically operate more like a manual transmission than a traditional automatic one.|$|E
5000|$|Some [...] "Series" [...] {{cars are}} found with a floor-type gear change {{replacing}} the (good quality) standard column-mounted <b>gearstick</b> — these are later owner modifications resembling the original factory option, and the parts necessary for this {{were obtained from}} the Commer Karrier Walk-thru-type vans and light lorries which were also made by the Rootes Group at this time. All of the automatic transmission-optioned cars were fitted with the column-type selectors only.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear stick}} (rarely spelled <b>gearstick),</b> gear lever (both UK English), {{gearshift}} or shifter (US English) is a metal lever {{attached to the}} shift assembly in a manual transmission-equipped automobile and is used to change gears. In an automatic transmission-equipped vehicle, a similar device {{is known as a}} gear selector. A gear stick will normally be used to change gear whilst depressing the clutch pedal with the left foot to disengage the engine from the drivetrain and wheels. Automatic transmission vehicles, semi-automatic transmissions, and those with continuously variable transmission gearboxes do not require a clutch pedal.|$|E
5000|$|Audi also {{released}} an S-line version in Germany {{as of late}} 2002, with 17" [...] 9-spoke [...] "RS4" [...] style wheels (standard were 15"), sports seats with large side bolsters and lumbar support, special half-leather seat coverings with Pearl Nappa leather and Sprint cloth, leather handbrake handle, perforated leather <b>gearstick</b> and 3-spoke steering wheel and 10 mm lowered sports suspension. Additionally, the interior roof lining, the dashboard and carpets were black, the instrument faces titanium-coloured and an S-line badge {{was added to the}} rear doors. The driver information system and illuminated vanity mirrors for driver and passenger completed the package ...|$|E
5000|$|For 1979 {{there were}} some minor modifications, {{including}} the change of the petrol filler cap from round to square. The US 604s receives a larger 2849 cc engine, although with no change in power. In 1980 the 604 underwent a minor facelift, featuring a new rear-view mirror, while the bonnet badge was removed, the indicators were changed to orange, {{and there was also}} a new plastic dashboard and <b>gearstick.</b> The limited edition luxury [...] "Grand Comfort" [...] model with power windows and locks, a sunroof, tinted windows, and other amenities was also made available this year. US sales [...] "faded away" [...] during 1980.|$|E
50|$|In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, {{fuel-efficient}} highway cruising {{with low}} engine speed was in some cases enabled on cars equipped with 3- or 4-speed transmissions {{by means of a}} separate overdrive unit in or behind the rear housing of the transmission. This was actuated either manually while in high gear by throwing a switch or pressing a button on the <b>gearstick</b> knob or on the steering column, or automatically by momentarily lifting the foot from the accelerator with the car travelling above a certain road speed. Automatic overdrives were disengaged by flooring the accelerator, and a lockout control was provided to enable the driver to disable overdrive and operate the transmission as a normal (non-overdrive) transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Tyres were Pirelli 225/40/16 P7000 directional, their 225 {{width and}} 40 profile made these the most {{aggressive}} standard-fit tyre supplied with any RD (or RD2) Hyundai Coupe. The [...] "F2" [...] also featured a deeper and more aggressive front spoiler, incorporating an oval chrome mesh grille insert. There was also [...] "F2" [...] badging on the front wings and rear valance, an uprated CD/tuner stereo by Sony (CDX C5000R with RDS), [...] "Coupe F2" [...] monogrammed aluminium kick plates, a unique leather-and-aluminium <b>gearstick</b> and a discreet [...] "Coupe F2" [...] badge on the ashtray fascia. The front carpet mats were inlaid with rectangular silver-coloured [...] "Coupe F2" [...] badges. According to the Hyundai Coupe F2 brochure, total on-the-road price was £17,999 (as of July 1998).|$|E

5000|$|In 2001 Shadforth {{made her}} {{directing}} breakthrough with the Kylie Minogue video, [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head". The video features Minogue {{in a computer}} generated futuristic city, arriving in a space-age car, seductively and rhythmically shifting the <b>gearstick</b> as she drives, before eventually dancing in a clipped pulsating style {{in front of a}} group of male dancers all wearing bizarre red plastic headgear. The video is well known for its tight choreography as well as for featuring Minogue in a deceptively revealing white costume with a plunging neckline and wide open front. The video was quickly picked up by many music video channels and is credited with making the song a number one hit worldwide. The exposure from the video quickly made Shadforth a [...] "must have" [...] director, and the film has been widely mimicked and parodied.|$|E
50|$|The third {{generation}} Transit, received a facelift to the body, introduced in November 2006, including new {{front and rear}} lights, a new front end and a new interior featuring the <b>gearstick</b> on the dashboard and Ford's new corporate radio design. Besides the styling changes, the powertrains were revised. The old petrol engine was replaced with one from the Ford Ranger, the front-wheel-drive diesel went from 2.0 to 2.2 litres capacity, and all diesel engines gained high-pressure common rail (TDCi) systems. The powertrains were changed to meet new emissions legislation. Additionally, the facelift introduced CAN bus electronics to the Transit for the first time. The new version (Ford nomenclature V347 for front-wheel drive and V348 for rear-wheel drive) won International Van of the Year for 2007 despite tough competition from several all-new rivals. This Transit arrived in Mexico to replace the Freestar after the 2007 model year. This was the first Transit having a five-cylinder engine.|$|E
5000|$|The Lotus 76 was a Formula One car {{designed}} by Colin Chapman, Tony Rudd and Ralph Bellamy for the 1974 Formula One season. The car {{was intended to}} be a more advanced version of the Lotus 72, powered by the Ford Cosworth DFV and featuring modified aerodynamics, a lighter chassis, longer wheelbase and a narrower, lower monocoque. The car also featured a bi-plane rear wing, designed to increase rear downforce and stability. Additionally it had an electronically operated clutch, which was the precursor to the modern semi automatic gearboxes seen on today's F1 cars, with the control mounted into the <b>gearstick</b> which theoretically speeded up gearchanges. The Lotus 76 was seen as a major technological breakthrough by Team Lotus. Outwardly, the car looked sleek and impressive. Internally, the suspension set up and inboard brake positioning were carried over from the Lotus 72. The car's development had been paid for by title sponsor John Player Special, so the 76 was given the chassis number 'John Player Special Mk I.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Between 2000 and 2002 VW offered two {{sporting}} models, the 16V and GTI. The 16V {{came with}} the 1.4 16V 100 PS (74 kW) engine and had options such as 15" [...] Spa alloys and air conditioning. However more interest was in the GTI. Available only in hatchback form, the GTI was powered by a 1.6 16V 125 PS (92 kW) engine with variable valve timing, making it the most powerful Polo to come out the factory to date. External changes gave the car the looks to match its power. Deeper front bumpers with honeycomb mesh inserts, side skirts, fog lights, a honeycomb mesh grill and 15" [...] BBS split rims suited the car well. There were also standard extras such as Climatronic fully automatic air conditioning, Xenon headlights (with a headlight washer system), a 6 disc CD autochanger, exclusive sports interior with leather steering wheel and <b>gearstick,</b> chrome inserts and driver aids such as ABS with EBD and an EDL (a system to aid traction). Leather and satellite navigation were also optional extras. The Mark 3F Polo GTI however missed the new six-speed gearbox that {{was introduced in the}} smaller Lupo GTI.|$|E
