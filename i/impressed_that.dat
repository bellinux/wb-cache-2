5|$|Conran {{spent four}} years making {{a black and white}} teaser with a bluescreen set up in his living room and using a Macintosh IIci. He was able to show it to Avnet, who was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he spent two years working with him on his screenplay. No major studio was {{interested}} in Sky Captain, but Avnet convinced Aurelio De Laurentiis to finance Sky Captain without a distribution deal.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Manchester Mark 1 {{began in}} August 1948, {{with the initial}} aim of {{providing}} the university with a more realistic computing facility. In October 1948 UK Government Chief Scientist Ben Lockspeiser was given {{a demonstration of the}} prototype, and was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he immediately initiated a government contract with the local firm of Ferranti to make a commercial version of the machine, the Ferranti Mark 1.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Rossen {{wrote and}} {{directed}} his first play,The Body Beautiful, a comedy about a naive burlesque dancer. Although the play closed after four performances, Warner Bros. director Mervyn LeRoy was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> in 1936 he signed Rossen to a personal screenwriting contract.|$|E

5000|$|The school organizes many fundraiser events {{including}} Bayboo, Walkathon, and the Terry Fox Run. Bayview's {{motto is}} [...] "We are only defeated {{if we give}} up", and the 48 teachers and staff <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> motto on the students.|$|R
50|$|His {{childhood}} friend, Poala, who Beet keeps <b>impressing</b> <b>that</b> she {{is going}} to marry him, later joins Beet and they form the “Beet Warriors”. As the story continues more is learned about the fight between the Zenon Warriors and Beltorze and the fantasy world of Beet is expanded on.|$|R
5|$|Matthew Weiner, {{who served}} as staff writer and {{producer}} for the show's fifth and sixth seasons, wrote a spec script for the series Mad Men in 2000. The script was passed on to Chase who, after reading it, was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he immediately offered Weiner {{a job as a}} writer for The Sopranos.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{wrote the}} concert Hebrides Overture (Fingal's Cave) in 1830, {{inspired}} by visits to Scotland {{around the end}} of the 1820s. He visited Fingal's Cave, on the Hebridean isle of Staffa, as part of his Grand Tour of Europe, and was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he scribbled the opening theme of the overture on the spot, including it in a letter he wrote home the same evening.|$|E
5|$|After Frank Boucher of the New York Rangers won {{the award}} seven times within eight years, Lady Byng was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> {{she gave him}} the {{original}} trophy to keep. Lady Byng then donated a second trophy in 1935–36. When Lady Byng died in 1949, the NHL presented another trophy and changed the official name to the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy. In 1962, the original trophy was destroyed in a fire at Boucher's home.|$|E

"I {{hope you}} won't forget, my dear fellow, that your most really urgent {{business}} is to look after your health; and if, hereafter, you'll only remember the old Lookout enough to <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> fact upon you, I shall feel that any poor service I have rendered you has been amply repaid." ...|$|R
30|$|Mendes et al. (2012) {{had done}} a study of {{coupling}} with heterogeneity. They get their special boundary conditions and solve the two-phase flow problem using Monte Carlo algorithm. They reach to the result of locally conservative numerical solution and <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> there is an obvious change in production resulted by heterogeneity (Mendes et al. 2012).|$|R

Why don't you <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> on him?" ...|$|R
5|$|In May 1878 Gaudí {{designed}} a display cabinet for the Esteban Comella glove factory, which was {{exhibited in the}} Spanish pavilion at the Paris World Exhibition that year. It was this work that {{attracted the attention of}} the entrepreneur Eusebi Güell, visiting the French capital; he was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he wanted to meet Gaudí on his return, beginning a long friendship and professional collaboration. Güell became Gaudí's main patron and sponsor of many of his large projects.|$|E
5|$|The RLM {{was still}} not {{interested}} in the Ju 87 and was not <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> it relied on a British engine. In late 1935, Junkers suggested fitting a DB 600 in-line engine, with the final variant to be equipped with the Jumo 210. This was accepted by the RLM as an interim solution. The reworking of the design began on 1 January 1936. The test flight could not be carried out for over two months {{due to a lack of}} adequate aircraft. The 24 January crash had already destroyed one machine.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache territory, {{and arrived}} at {{the north shore of}} Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525. The Roman Catholic priests accompanying the expedition celebrated mass {{in the presence of the}} king of the Itza, who was said to be so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he pledged to worship the cross and to destroy his idols. Cortés accepted an invitation from Kan Ek' to visit Nojpetén. On his departure, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame horse that the Itza treated as a deity, but the animal soon died.|$|E

60|$|And so on, up {{and down}} the dim vista of the past, {{following}} the sound of the dead feet that wander so restlessly, stamping upon the <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> will not be stamped out. Rave on, wild wind, eternal voice of human misery; fall, dead footsteps, eternal echo of human memory; stamp, miry feet; stamp into forgetfulness that which will not be forgotten.|$|R

5|$|To {{continue}} his studies, Champollion {{wanted to go}} to Paris, Grenoble offering few possibilities for such specialized subjects as ancient languages. His brother thus stayed in Paris from August to September that same year, so as to seek his admission in a specialized school. Before leaving however Champollion presented, on the 1st September 1807, his Essay on the Geographical Description of Egypt before the Conquest of Cambyses before the Academy of Grenoble whose members were so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> they admitted him to the Academy six months later.|$|E
5|$|A Trick of the Tail had a {{positive}} reception from music critics, who were <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> the group could not only survive the loss of Gabriel but still deliver a good album. The sound quality had improved from previous albums {{as a result of}} Hentschel's production skills. The album reached No. 3 in the UK, remaining on the charts for 39 weeks, and No. 31 in the U.S. It was certified Gold in the UK by the British Phonographic Industry in June and in the US by the RIAA in March 1990. The album remained in the UK charts for 39 weeks and recouped a significant amount of $400,000 worth of debt they had accumulated by the time Gabriel left.|$|E
5|$|Besides the patrols {{made during}} this {{deployment}} in northwestern waters, Yorktown conducted routine operations such as target practices. Among the officers {{assigned to the}} ship {{at that time was}} Lt. Bradley Fiske, a young officer who had invented and constructed a practical telescopic gunsight. Fiske's sight had been tested in Baltimore and had favorably <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> ship's officers—including her commander, Captain Winfeld S. Schley. Evans, however, had not taken a liking to Fiske's newfangled gadget but nevertheless consented to allow a second test on board Yorktown (the first one had failed miserably). On the afternoon of 22 September 1892, during scheduled target practice, Fiske's invention worked as designed and elicited praise from Evans. As Fiske himself later wrote in the United States Naval Institute's magazine Proceedings, modern naval gunnery had its birth not in the British Navy but in the American—off Unalaska on 22 September 1892, in Yorktown.|$|E
60|$|Desmond exerted all {{his powers}} of persuasion {{during the next}} minute or two, {{and it was not}} his fault if his comrade did not realize that it was a folly he was undertaking. Desmond, at least made a strenuous attempt to <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> point on him, {{in spite of the fact}} that it was a folly he would in all {{probability}} have been guilty of himself. Ormsgill, however, only smiled.|$|R
60|$|An {{imposing}} little procession approached {{along the}} deck. There was the deck steward leading the way; {{a very smart}} French maid carrying a wonderful collection of wraps, cushions, and books; a black-browed, pallid man-servant, holding a hot-water bottle {{in his hand and}} leading a tiny Pekinese spaniel wrapped in a sealskin coat; and finally Madame la Duchesse. It was so obviously a procession intended to <b>impress,</b> <b>that</b> neither Peter nor Sogrange thought it worth while to conceal their interest.|$|R
50|$|In the 2013 summer, Floro went {{on trial}} with English Football League Championship side Sheffield Wednesday, which {{had all of}} its full-backs injured, and signed a one-year {{contract}} on 6 August after <b>impressing.</b> <b>That</b> same day, he made his professional debut, being replaced midway through {{the second half of}} a 1-2 away loss against Rotherham United for the season's League Cup; his first league game took place on the 10th, when he played the first half of another 1-2 defeat, now at home to Burnley.|$|R
5|$|Despite {{his growing}} talent, Prokofiev's parents hesitated over {{starting}} their son on a musical career {{at such an}} early age, and considered the possibility of his attending a good high school in Moscow. By 1904, his mother had decided instead on Saint Petersburg, and she and Prokofiev visited the then capital to explore the possibility of moving there for his education. They were introduced to composer Alexander Glazunov, {{a professor at the}} Saint Petersburg Conservatory, who asked to see Prokofiev and his music; Prokofiev had composed two more operas, Desert Islands and The Feast during the Plague, and was working on his fourth, Undina. Glazunov was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he urged Prokofiev's mother to have her son apply for admission to the Conservatory. He passed the introductory tests and enrolled that year.|$|E
5|$|Having secured patent {{protection}} for his designs and general adoption by the Brandywine millers, Evans now {{turned his attention}} outside Delaware. His brother Joseph travelled widely to promote Evans's work, and according to some sources, by 1792 over one hundred mills were operating Evans machinery. When George Washington called upon Joseph Tatnall in 1790 {{to thank him for}} the flour he provided to feed the Continental Army during the War of Independence, he saw Evans's technology at work in the mills in Brandywine Village and was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> had his own gristmill at Mount Vernon converted to the Evans system in 1791, the completion of which was overseen by Evans's brothers. In 1793, Evans sold his share in the Red Clay Creek mill and moved his family from Wilmington to Philadelphia, where he opened a store for milling supplies.|$|E
5|$|In July 1941, Radford was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} Naval Air Station in Trinidad, British West Indies. He protested this appointment because he feared he would remain there for years, sidelined as World War II loomed. In the event he only remained in this station for three months, following an organizational shift in the Bureau of Aeronautics. By mid-1941, thanks to a large expansion in the naval aviator program, squadrons could no longer train newly arrived aviators. Further, at that time, the vast difference {{in the performance of}} combat aircraft over training aircraft meant that pilots needed more time in combat aircraft before becoming proficient in them. Radford was subsequently visited by Artemus L. Gates, Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Air. The latter was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he ordered Rear Admiral John H. Towers, chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, to transfer Radford to a newly formed training division.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, now the {{new owner}} Doughty Hanson & Co. {{arranged}} a loan through Anglo Irish Bank {{to take control of}} the company through Tullamore Beta Ltd. As the Irish economy crashed due largely to bad lending practices by Irish Banks TV3's loan book was under pressure to perform. Initially the government avoided placing the loans in the National Asset Management Agency as this might create the <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> all Irish Broadcasters were state owned. The loans remained with the newly formed government own IBRC bank.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the midst}} of the rushing gale and surging seas he sat there, every gleam of hope almost extinguished, when there came to his mind a brief passage from the Bible--"Hope thou in God." [...] Many a time had his mother tried, in days gone by, to <b>impress</b> <b>that</b> text on his mind, but {{apparently}} without success. Now it arose before him like a beacon-star. At the same time he thought of the possibility that he might be seen and picked up by a passing vessel.|$|R

5|$|In September 1929, Devers {{was ordered}} to Washington, D.C., {{to serve on the}} staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. Chosen to attend the Army War College in Washington, he began his studies there on 15 August 1932, and {{graduated}} on 29 June 1933. This was followed by a one-year assignment to Fort Hoyle, Maryland, as executive officer of the 1st Field Artillery Brigade, and then as commander of the 2nd Battalion, 6th Field Artillery. After 14 years as a major, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel again on 26 February 1934. On 15 June 1934, he was sent to Fort Myer, Virginia, near the District of Columbia, as commander of the 1st Battalion, 16th Field Artillery. Young regimental officers like Second Lieutenant Alexander Graham were surprised when Devers had them fire their 75mm guns. Graham, who married Devers' daughter Frances on 30 July 1935, was <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> Devers had them do so at every opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In actuality, Boyce {{stopped in}} London {{en route to}} a safari in British East Africa. It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip. But this Scout only helped him cross a street; he did not take him to the Scout {{headquarters}} and Boyce never met Baden-Powell. Upon Boyce's request, the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters, where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting. He read this while on safari and was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> instead of making his return to America an around-the-world trip via San Francisco, he returned to the Scout headquarters in London. He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual. While Boyce's original account does not mention fog, a 1928 account says there was fog. Climatologists report no fog on that day in London.|$|E
5|$|Leslie never advertised his speakers. After {{demonstrating a}} {{prototype}} with Bob Mitchell, an organist with radio station KFI in Los Angeles, a contract {{was made to}} install another prototype in the station's studios, where Mitchell {{would be the only}} organist authorized to use it. Mitchell was so <b>impressed</b> <b>that</b> he tried to patent the speaker, but discovered that he could not. Soon afterwards, Mitchell became an organist with the Mutual Broadcasting System, and played a Hammond with the Leslie on its shows, ensuring national exposure for the sound. The Leslie was subsequently a standard component of several notable jazz organists, including Jimmy Smith, Jack McDuff, Jimmy McGriff and Shirley Scott. Graham Bond was the first notable British organist to play a Hammond through a Leslie.|$|E
