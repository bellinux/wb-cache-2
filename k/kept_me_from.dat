500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Lethem entered Bennington College in Vermont in 1982 as a {{prospective}} art student. At Bennington, Lethem experienced an [...] "overwhelming....collision {{with the realities of}} class—my parents’ bohemian milieu had <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> understanding, even a little, that we were poor....at Bennington that was all demolished by an encounter with the fact of real privilege." [...] This, coupled with the realization that he was more interested in writing than art, led Lethem to drop out halfway through his sophomore year.

500|$|In {{the moment}} of surrender, I let go of all the {{theological}} or social questions which had <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> [...] for countless years. I simply let them go. There was the sense, profound and wordless, that if He knew everything I {{did not have to}} know everything, and that, in seeking to know everything, I'd been, all of my life, missing the entire point. No social paradox, no historic disaster, no hideous record of injustice or misery should keep me from Him. No question of Scriptural integrity, no torment over the fate of this or that atheist or gay friend, no worry for those condemned and ostracized by my church or any other church should stand between me and Him. The reason? It was magnificently simple: He knew how or why everything happened; He knew the disposition of every single soul. He wasn't going to let anything happen by accident! Nobody {{was going to go to}} Hell by mistake." ...|$|E

That at any rate has been <b>kept</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> He has been here as your friend, and when he came,--into my house,--the purport of his visit was <b>kept</b> <b>from</b> <b>me.</b> He asked for something, which was refused, and {{consequently}} he has written to me. For what did he ask?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, I {{wish you}} would please tell him that I didn't reply to his letter because it <b>kept</b> {{following}} <b>me</b> <b>from</b> place to place, and I only got it at the Register office this morning." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "I trusted Jack with my life. He was {{the only}} person on earth who could have <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> flying the X-1.

2500|$|Lewis {{said after}} the fight [...] "Bruno did his {{homework}} and <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> <b>from</b> throwing my right hand early... but he must have forgotten I have a terrific left hook.

60|$|I find it not {{a little}} {{difficult}} to state what <b>kept</b> <b>me</b> back <b>from</b> proposing marriage to Margaret that summer, and what urged me forward at last to marry her.
