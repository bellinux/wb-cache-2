40|$|The {{origin and}} {{maintenance}} of intraspecific variation in vocal signals is important for population divergence and speciation. Where vocalizations are transmitted by vertical cultural inheritance, similarity will reflect co-ancestry, and thus vocal divergence should reflect genetic structure. Horseshoe bats are characterized by echolocation calls dominated by a <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>component</b> that is partly determined by maternal imprinting. Although previous studies showed that <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> calls are also influenced by some non-genetic factors, {{it is not known}} how frequency relates to genetic structure. To test this, we related <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> variation to genetic and non-genetic variables in the Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros). Recordings of bats from across Taiwan revealed that females called at higher frequencies than males; however, we found no effect of environmental or morphological factors on call frequency. By comparison, variation showed clear population structure, with frequencies lower in the centre and east, and higher in the north and south. Within these regions, frequency divergence was directional and correlated with geographical distance, suggesting that call frequencies are subject to cultural drift. However, microsatellite clustering analysis showed that broad differences in <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> among populations corresponded to discontinuities in allele frequencies resulting from vicariant events. Our results provide evidence that the processes shaping genetic subdivision have concomitant consequences for divergence in echolocation call frequency...|$|R
40|$|Based on a {{hierarchical}} neural network archi-tecture proposed by Waki et al. [1], {{we tried to}} clarify neuronal mechanisms of the perception of monosyllabic vocal sounds.

A neural network of the third stage integrates these three components into single point attractors corresponding to the monosyllables.

A laser diode interferometer was used to measure basilar membrane displacements in the basal turn of the cochlea at a location that is 4 - 6 mm basal to the 61 -kHz place on the basilar membrane. The region of the basilar membrane from which the measurements were made was tuned not only to those characteristic of this location (88 - 98 kHz) but also very sharply tuned to 61 kHz. The 61 -kHz tuning was labile and could be modeled as a simple resonance. The resonance is not restricted to the 61 -kHz place but involves more basal regions.

40|$|Auditory {{feedback}} from the animal's own voice is essential during bat echolocation: to optimize signal detection, bats continuously adjust various call parameters in response to changing echo signals. Auditory feedback seems also necessary for controlling many bat communication calls, although it remains unclear how auditory feedback control differs in echolocation and communication. We tackled this question by analyzing echolocation and communication in greater horseshoe bats, whose echolocation pulses are dominated by a <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>component</b> that matches the frequency range they hear best. To maintain echoes within this "auditory fovea", horseshoe bats constantly adjust their echolocation call frequency depending on {{the frequency of the}} returning echo signal. This Doppler-shift compensation (DSC) behavior represents one of the most precise forms of sensory-motor feedback known. We examined the variability of echolocation pulses emitted at rest (resting frequencies, RFs) and one type of communication signal which resembles an echolocation pulse but is much shorter (short <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> communication calls, SCFs) and produced only during social interactions. We found that while RFs varied from day to day, corroborating earlier studies in other <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> bats, SCF-frequencies remained unchanged. In addition, RFs overlapped for some bats whereas SCF-frequencies were always distinctly different. This indicates that auditory feedback during echolocation changed with varying RFs but remained constant or may have been absent during emission of SCF calls for communication. This fundamentally different feedback mechanism for echolocation and communication may have enabled these bats to use SCF calls for individual recognition whereas they adjusted RF calls to accommodate the daily shifts of their auditory fovea...|$|R

40|$|Postnatal {{development}} of the mustached bat's cochlea was studied by measuring cochlear microphonic and compound action potentials. In adults, a cochlear resonance is involved in enhanced tuning to the second harmonic <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>component</b> (CF 2) of their echolocation calls at ~ 61 kHz This resonance is present immediately after birth in bats that do not yet echolocate. Its frequency is lower (46 kHz) and the corresponding threshold minimum of cochlear microphonic potentials is broader than in adults. Long-lasting ringing of the cochlear microphonic potential after tone stimulus offset that characterizes the adult auditory response close to CF 2 is absent in newborns. In {{the course of the}} first 5 postnatal weeks, there is a concomitant upward shift of CF 2 and the frequency of cochlear threshold minima.

Between 2 and 4 wk of age, two cochlear microphonic threshold minima are found consistently in the CF 2 range that differ in their level-dependent dynamic growth behavior and are 1. 5 ¿ 5. 7 kHz apart from each other. In older animals, there is a single minimum that approaches adult tuning in its sharpness. The data provide evidence to show that during maturation of the cochlea, the frequency and the sensitivity of the threshold minimum associated with CF 2 increases and that these increases are associated with the fusion of two resonances that are partly dissociated in developing animals...|$|R
