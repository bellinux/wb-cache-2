5|$|Corman had initial {{trouble finding}} <b>distribution</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film, as some distributors, {{including}} American International Pictures (AIP), {{felt that the}} film would be interpreted as anti-Semitic, citing the characters of Gravis Mushnick and Siddie Shiva. Welles, who is Jewish, stated that he gave his character a Turkish Jewish accent and mannerisms, and that he saw the humor of the film as playful, and felt there was no intent to defame any ethnic group. The film was finally released by its production company, The Filmgroup, nine months after it had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Stochastic {{matrices}} are square matrices whose rows are probability vectors, that is, whose {{entries are}} non-negative and sum up to one. Stochastic matrices {{are used to}} define Markov chains with finitely many states. A row of the stochastic matrix gives the probability <b>distribution</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> next position of some particle currently in the state that corresponds to the row. Properties of the Markov chain like absorbing states, that is, states that any particle attains eventually, can be read off the eigenvectors of the transition matrices.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the release}} of Bleach in June 1989, Nirvana {{embarked}} on its first national tour, and the album became a favorite of college radio stations. Due to increasing differences between Everman {{and the rest of}} the band over the course of the tour, Nirvana canceled the last few dates and drove back to Washington. No one told Everman he was fired at the time, while Everman later said that he actually quit the group. Although Sub Pop did not promote Bleach as much as other releases, it was a steady seller, and had initial sales of 40,000 copies. However, Cobain was upset by the label's lack of promotion and <b>distribution</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> album. In late 1989, the band recorded the Blew EP with producer Steve Fisk.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} that initial shoot {{convinced}} Poole to plan two more segments and seek theatrical <b>distribution</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> completed work. He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan {{for the third}} segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the potential distribution deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, entitled Poolside, and construct the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove, New York, on Fire Island.|$|E

With the non-informative prior distributions presented by these authors, computational difficulties may occur when using MCMC methods. This article considers different prior <b>distributions</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> parameters of the proposed model, and studies the effect of such prior distributions on the convergence and accuracy of the results.
