40|$|Measurements of {{attenuation}} at 230 GHz {{through the}} total atmosphere {{due to the}} presence of oxygen and water vapor molecules, clouds, and rain are presented. The measurements were carried out using a specially designed superheterodyne receiver mounted on a sun tracker. Simultaneous measurements were also carried out at 13 GHz. For a measuring site close to sea level at Holmdel, NJ, the 'clear-sky' zenith attenuation was found {{as a function of the}} measured ground water vapor density. When the ground temperature was below about 7 C, most cloud and overcast gave less than 0. 5 -dB attenuation, whereas with a ground temperature greater than 13 C, cloud attenuation was 8 - 10 times greater. Calculations of zenith attenuation in the 230 -GHz atmospheric window were also made using the Gross analytic line shape, Schulze-Tolbert empirical line shape, and an empirically modified <b>Gross</b> <b>line</b> shape. These calculations were based on determinations of water vapor density and temperature made at the measurement site, and on radiosonde measurements made at a distance of 80 km away...|$|E
40|$|The half-lives of nine {{isomeric}} {{states in}} the rare earth region were measured using magnetic beta-ray spectrometers and an associated fast-slow coincidence system utilizing a time-to-pulse-height converter. The half-lives of the 8. 40 -, 118 - and 139 -keV levels in Tm 1 69 were determined to be (4. 13 ± 0. 12) nsec, (63 ± 7) psec and (289 ± 24) psec, respectively. The half-life of the 8. 40 -keV level was determined using both Erl 69 and Ybl 69 decay. Several different methods were {{used to measure the}} 8. 40 -keV level lifetime including applying various accelerating voltages to the radioactive sources. Comparisons are made with theory for the K = 1 / 2 rotational band in Tm 169. The half-life obtained for the 8. 40 -keV level in Tm 169 corresponds to an energy level width of (1. 10 ± 0. 03) x l 0 - 7 eV. If there were no broadening of the individual line profiles in the Mossbauer effect pattern, the width at half-maximum of the resolved Mossbauer lines would be (2. 20 ± 0. 06) x 10 - 7 eV compared to the narrowest experimental Mossbauer <b>gross</b> <b>line</b> width of 5. 04 x 10 - 7 eV. The half-lives of the 87 - and 105 -keV levels in Gd 155 were also determined and were found to be (6. 27 ± 0. 35) nsec and (1. 20 ± 0. 04) nsec, respectively. Comparisons were made with the theoretical predictions of Nilsson for these two levels. The theoretical-experimental comparison would assign a spin of 5 / 2 to the 1 05 -keV level and a spin of 3 / 2 to the 87 -keV level if the comparison could be taken at face value. The half-lives of the 122 -keV level in Sml 52, 89 -keV level in Gdl 56, 396 -keV level in Lu 175 and 80 -keV level in Prl 44 were also determined. The half-lives of these four levels were found to be (1. 36 ± 0. 06) nsec, (2. 22 ± 0. 08) nsec, (3. 31 ± 0. 10) nsec and (143 ± 11) psec, respectively. These four half-life values agree well with values obtained by other investigators...|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{original}} Basel Accord, under the Standardised Approach, banks’ activities are divided into eight business lines: corporate finance, trading & sales, retail banking, commercial banking, payment & settlement, agency services, asset management, and retail brokerage. Within each business <b>line,</b> <b>gross</b> income is a broad indicator {{that serves as a}} proxy for the scale of business operations and thus the likely scale of operational risk exposure within each of these business lines. The capital charge for each business line is calculated by multiplying gross income by a factor (denoted beta) assigned to that business line. Beta serves as a proxy for the industry-wide relationship between the operational risk loss experience for a given business line and the aggregate level of gross income for thatbusiness line.The total capital charge is calculated as the three-year average of the simple summation of the regulatory capital charges across each of the business lines in each year. In any given year, negative capital charges (resulting from negative gross income) in any business line may offset positive capital charges in other business lines without limit.|$|R
40|$|Operational risk has {{recently}} {{become one of}} the key issues in financial institutions - there have been two main reasons for development of operational risk.

40|$|Although radical {{cystectomy}} with pelvic {{lymph node}} dissection (PLND) {{is the standard}} treatment for muscle-invasive bladder cancer, the optimal extent of PLND and the minimum number of nodes that should be examined for pathology remain unclear. However, evidence is growing that extended PLND has additional diagnostic and therapeutic benefits relative to standard PLND. In particular, a more meticulous and extended PLND may improve the disease-free survival of node-negative patients because it removes undetected micrometastases. Indeed, some patients with positive nodes can be cured by surgery alone, even those with <b>gross</b> adenopathy. Increasing <b>lines</b> of evidence also suggest that {{the extent of the}} primary bladder tumor, the number of lymph nodes that are removed, and the lymph node tumor burden are important prognostic variables in patients undergoing cystectomy. Therefore, extended PLND may not only provide improved prognostic information, it may also have a clinically significant therapeutic benefit for both lymph node-positive and node-negative patients undergoing radical cystectomy. Although the absolute limits of PLND remain to be determined, evidence supports the notion that a more extended PLND should include the common iliac vessels and presacral lymph nodes at cystectomy. Such PLND should only be performed in patients who are appropriate surgical candidates.

40|$|The revised Basel Capital Accord {{requires}} {{banks to}} meet a capital requirement for operational risk {{as part of an}} overall risk-based capital framework. Three distinct options for calculating operational risk charges are proposed (Basic Approach, Standardised Approach, Advanced Measurement Approaches), reflecting increasing levels of risk sensitivity. Since 2001, the Risk Management Group of the Basel Committee has been performing specific surveys of banksÂ’ operational loss data, with the main purpose of obtaining information on the industryÂ’s operational risk experience, to be used for the refinement of the capital framework and for the calibration of the regulatory coefficients. The second loss data collection was launched in the summer of 2002 : the 89 banks participating in the exercise provided the Group with more than 47, 000 observations, grouped by eight standardised Business Lines and seven Event Types. A summary of the data collected, which focuses on the description of the range of individualgross loss amounts and of the distribution of the banksÂ’ losses across the business lines/event types, was returned to the industry in March 2003. The objective {{of this paper is to}} move forward with respect to that document, by illustrating the methodologies and the outcomes of the inferential analysis carried out on the data collected through 2002. To this end, after pooling the individual banksÂ’ losses according to a Business Line criterion, the operational riskiness of each Business Line data set is explored using empirical and statistical tools. The work aims, first of all, to compare the sensitivity of conventional actuarial distributions and models stemming from the Extreme Value Theory in representing the highest percentiles of the data sets: the exercise shows that the extreme value model, in its Peaks Over Threshold representation, explains the behaviour of the operational risk data in the tail area well. Then, measures of severity and frequency of the large losses are gained and, by a proper combination of these estimates, a bottom-up operational risk capital figure is computed for each Business Line. Finally, for each Business Line and in the eight Business Lines as a whole, the contributions of the expected losses to the capital figures are evaluated and the relationships between the capital charges and the corresponding average level of Gross Incomes are determined and compared with the current coefficients envisaged in the simplified approaches of the regulatory framework. operational risk, heavy tails, conventional inference, Extreme Value Theory, Peaks Over Threshold, median shortfall, Point Process of exceedances, capital charge, Business <b>Line,</b> <b>Gross</b> Income, regulatory coefficients...|$|R
40|$|Histone lysine {{methylation}} is {{an important}} epigenetic mark for regulation of gene expression and chromatin organization. Setdb 1 (Set domain, bifurcate 1), one of the histone lysine methyltransferases, specifically methylates histone H 3 at lysine 9 (H 3 K 9) and participates in transcriptional repression and heterochromatin formation. The major task of my thesis work {{was to investigate the}} epigenetic roles of Setdb 1 in regulating brain functions. I started my thesis work by examining Setdb 1 expression pattern during mouse brain development. The most robust signal of Setdb 1 was detected in the fetal brains at embryonic day 12. 5, with a ubiquitous distribution in all the proliferative zones, as well as the cortical plate and other regions comprised of postmitotic neurons. The expression of Setdb 1 decreased as the brain developed, and this down-regulation profile was correlated to neuronal maturation as examined in a primary culture model of mouse cortical neurons. I then generated CK-Setdb 1 transgenic mice, in which a myc-tagged full length mouse Setdb 1 was constantly expressed in postmitotic neurons {{under the control of the}} CaMK II alpha promoter (CK). The expression of mycSetdb 1 was detected in NeuN positive cells throughout most forebrain regions including cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus. A sustained increase of Setdb 1 in CK-Setdb 1 transgenics was verified at both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, an increase of H 3 K 9 trimethylation was detected at major satellite DNA repeats in CK-Setdb 1 forebrains, which indicated that transgene-expressed mycSetdb 1 was functionally active in adult brains. The behavioral phenotype of CK-Setdb 1 transgenics was examined by using two separate founder <b>lines.</b> <b>Gross</b> neurological functions including body weight, locomotion activity, motor coordination, and breeding behavior were generally normal in CK-Setdb 1 mice. CK-Setdb 1 mice were further subjected to behavioral paradigms related to mood and cognitive functions. Intriguingly, as compared to the littermate controls, CK-Setdb 1 mice represent a lower level of depression as indicated by decreased total immobility in two different behavioral despair tests. Moreover, CK-Setdb 1 mice showed an accelerated extinction in the learned helplessness paradigm after a delayed interval (7 days), indicating a faster recovery from an established status of despair. The potential confounding factors, like memory deficits, were ruled out as CK-Setdb 1 mice showed normal or even improved performances in different memory-related paradigms. Anxiety scores and stimulant drug response were normal in CK-Setdb 1 mice. Taken together, these findings suggested that a specific antidepressant-like phenotype was elicited by the over-expression of Setdb 1 in adult mice forebrains. To further study the molecular mechanism underlying Setdb 1 -associated antidepressant-like behavioral changes, I screened for Setdb 1 -binding sites in a genome-scale by ChIP-on-chip using a tiling microarray from Affymetrix. Unexpectedly, Setdb 1 showed a very restricted binding profile with a high specificity towards ionotropic glutamate receptor genes including the NMDA receptor 2 B subunit gene Grin 2 b, which is a new target for the treatment for major depression. An increase of H 3 K 9 dimethylation at Setdb 1 -binding site on Grin 2 b locus was detected in CK-Setdb 1 hippocampus, which was correlated to a decrease of Grin 2 b expression as well as an accelerated desensitization of NMDA receptor. Furthermore, Chromosome Conformation Capture (3 C) on Grin 2 b locus revealed a repressive chromatin loop structure, which tethered the distal Setdb 1 -binding site (~ 32 Kb downstream of transcriptional start site (TSS)) to a proximal intronic region (~ 12 Kb downstream of TSS) that is enriched for the binding of KAP 1, a well-studied Setdb 1 -interacting transcriptional corepressor. Taken together, our data indicated that Setdb 1 repressed Grin 2 b expression via H 3 K 9 hypermethylation and higher-order chromatin loop formation, which may contribute to the antidepressant-like phenotype we observed in CK-Setdb 1 mice. The second part of my thesis work was to investigate the role of Setdb 1 in the animal model of a neurodevelopmental disorder - Rett syndrome (RTT). Loss-of-function mutations of the gene encoding methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MECP 2) is the primary cause of RTT. There is an overlap between Setdb 1 - and Mecp 2 -associated repressive chromatin machineries, which both include histone deacetylase complex, H 3 K 9 methyltransferase, DNA methyltransferase and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1). Moreover, in contrast to Setdb 1, which is downregulated during the cortical neuronal differentiation, Mecp 2 is upregulated and the expression level is positively correlated to neuronal maturation. Therefore, we hypothesized that there is a functional redundancy between Setdb 1 and Mecp 2, and the up-regulation of Setdb 1 in mature neurons will compensate for brain deficiency due to the loss of Mecp 2. To test this hypothesis, I crossed CK-Setdb 1 transgenic mice with nestincre-Mecp 2 conditional knockout mice (Mecp 2 -/y). The behavior changes of CK-Setdb 1 /Mecp 2 -/y mice, including body weight, locomotion, motor coordination, and life span, were then compared to Mecp 2 -/y mice. No significant improvements in behaviors or survival were observed from CK-Setdb 1 /Mecp 2 -/y mice. Because the activation of CK promoter is limited to defined population of postmitotic neurons in forebrain, I tested our hypothesis by generating another strain of Setdb 1 overexpression mice – tauSetdb 1, in which the expression of mycSetdb 1 is under the control of an endogenous pan-neuronal active promoter Tau. However, the introduction of tauSetdb 1 also failed to rescue Mecp 2 deficiency. The life span of tauSetdb 1 / Mecp 2 -/y was even shorter as compared to Mecp 2 -/y mice (Kaplan-Meier, p= 0. 07). In conclusion, up-regulation of Setdb 1 in adult brain was not sufficient to rescue Mecp 2 deficiency in the mouse model of RTT. One of the most challenges to study neuronal dysfunctions in brain diseases is the cellular heterogeneity of central nervous system. Current techniques for chromatin studies, including chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, usually lack of single cell resolution and are unable to examine the neurobiological changes in defined cell populations. In the third part of my thesis work, I developed a modified protocol to isolate neuronal nuclei from brain homogenates via Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS). In general, total nuclei was extracted from frozen brains, neuronal nuclei were then immuno-tagged with NeuN and sorted via FACS. Besides the NeuN labeling-FACS protocol, I also generated CK-H 2 BeGFP transgenic mice, in which a histone H 2 B-eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) fusion protein was expressed in the nuclei of postmitotic neurons in mouse forebrain. Nuclei extracted from CKH 2 BeGFP brain were directly applied for FACS sorting. By using this protocol, we routinely got around 6 - 8 x 106 neuronal nuclei from one adult mouse forebrain, which was sufficient for ChIP applications followed by single gene PCR and microarray studies. In conclusion, our protocol permits large-scale studies of chromatin modifications or any other nuclei events in defined cell populations from distinct brain regions. Taken together, my dissertation work will lead to a better understanding of the epigenetic roles of histone H 3 K 9 methyltransferase Setdb 1 in brain functions, and may provide new targets for the therapeutic treatment of major depression...|$|R
