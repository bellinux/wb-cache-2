[...] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties.

Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet [...] wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and <b>dune</b> <b>erosion</b> along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models.

50|$|Due to erosion Lütje Horn has {{continuously}} lost surface area. The size of {{the island}} was still relatively stable {{in the first half}} of last century: in 1891 it had an area of 61 hectares and, in 1937, 54 hectares. In 1957 the high-water free area was still 58 hectares, including about one acre of large dunes. The storm surge of February 1962 caused a significant loss of land and <b>dune</b> <b>erosion,</b> and further losses were incurred by the winter storm surges of 1989/1990. In 1987, the area above the mean high-water mark was only 23 hectares, a few years later it had reduced to just 11 hectares. According to the Lower Saxon Department for Water, Coastal and Nature Conservation (NLWKN), Lütje Horn had a flood-free area of approximately 6.5 hectares in summer 2006.|$|E

5000|$|The dunes {{immediately}} {{adjacent to}} the beach support a plant community dominated by beachgrass. The beachgrass grows runners {{under the surface of}} the sand that interlock into a ropelike network, and actually builds the dune by trapping sand. Some tall wormwood plants grow amidst the beachgrass, as do cottonwood trees and sand dune willows. Cottonwood is the only dune-forming tree in the area. Sand dune willows are fairly rare in New York State, but are a common woody plant in these dunes. This [...] "beachgrass plant community" [...] stabilizes the <b>dunes</b> against <b>erosion</b> by wind and storm, and enables the growth of a more complex, [...] "poison ivy-dune grape-cottonwood plant community" [...] deeper in the dunes.|$|R
40|$|Overwash, {{the flow}} of water and {{sediment}} over the crest of a beach, contributes to flooding and the deposition of sand landward of the beach crest. Washover, the sand deposited by overwash, contributes to the sediment budget and migration of barrier islands. The ability to predict the occurrence, location, and thickness of overwash deposits is important for coastal residents, coastal town planners, environmental planners, and engineers alike. In this study, a numerical model that simulates the sediment transport and one-dimensional barrier profile change caused by overwash was developed. The magnitude of overwash and the morphology of washovers are dependent on the overwash regime. New formulae are developed to estimate the sediment transport rate over the beach crest for both run-up overwash, using ballistics theory, and inundation overwash, treating flow over the crest as weir flow. Two-dimensional flow is described on the back barrier by considering the continuity of a block of water at steady state, taking into account lateral spreading, friction, and infiltration. The model is tested against 26 different beach profile sets from several different locations, and several different storms, exhibiting a variety of initial morphologies. The model is capable of reproducing varying overwash morphology responses including <b>dune</b> crest <b>erosion,</b> <b>dune</b> destruction, barrier rollback, the thinning of a washover deposit on the backbarrier, and overwash over a multiple dune system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dune</b> barrier <b>erosion</b> and {{possible}} breakthrough due to storm and hurricane wave activity is studied near Mosquito Lagoon, in Kennedy Space Center property. The {{results of a}} geological as well as hydrodynamic appraisal of the problem area indicate that no inlet has existed across the dune barrier since 500 A. D., {{and that there is}} little likelihood of a possible breakthrough inlet remaining open permanently, primarily because the relatively shallow lagoon does not contain enough volume of water to maintain an inlet between the ocean and the lagoon. It is therefore recommended that only minimal measures, such as closing up the man-made passes across the dunes, be carried out to ensure continuation of the action of natural beach maintaining processes...|$|R
50|$|As well {{as human}} activities, natural {{processes}} operate within coastal dune environments, these processes include {{events such as}} storms, floods, sea level change, and sediment supply changes. Coastal dune systems are mainly controlled by a principle natural process called the sediment supply and transport system. This system consists of an offshore zone (sediment bank), transit zone (beach and active foredune) and a resting zone (stable sand dunes). The sediment in this system is supplied by long shore drift predominantly from rivers and from the erosion of cliffs, headlands, other dune systems and when sediment supply is low sand dunes are subject to erosion. Humans affect sediment supply {{in a number of}} ways including the damming of rivers, dredging in coastal water and the construction of harbours, all of which depletes sediment supply. They also disrupt the long shore transport of sediment through the construction of piers, marinas or groynes, breakwaters and other hard structures. Excavating, building roads, houses and walkways on coastal dunes or beaches also causes sand <b>dune</b> <b>erosion</b> by disrupting natural sediment processes. Effective management of coastal dune systems must consider natural processes as a normal part of the natural environment as well as controlling human activities and seeking to alter natural processes should be kept at a minimum in order for restoration to be successful.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the first}} things a coastal manager must look for when {{establishing}} sand dune management is to ascertain the main cause of sediment loss and from there, make decisions on how to minimise the cause and how to restore sand dunes appropriately. In New Zealand the main cause of <b>dune</b> <b>erosion</b> has been the loss of sand vegetation and this means that sand dune management consists primarily of stabilizing dune systems through the “soft” technique of re planting and protecting native dune vegetation. It is advised that dunes should not be restored with the planting of exotic species and managers should aim to only use species indigenous to an area, originally New Zealand used exotic, fast growing dune vegetation called Marram Grass to stabilize eroding sand dunes. It was later discovered that this exotic species created very high, steep sand dunes that were increasing susceptible to New Zealand’s high storm energy climate, it also became apparent that the native New Zealand dune vegetation were out competed by this introduced species which caused issues biologically. At present there is a large push to eradicate Marram grass as it is now classed as a pest species in New Zealand and at present coastal managers encourage the planting of the two indigenous species, Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) and Spinifex (Spinifex sericeus) as these two species create low angle, strong, stable dunes.|$|E
5000|$|All {{marine turtles}} {{are faced with}} threats such as habitat loss, the {{wildlife}} trade, collection of eggs, collection of meat, by-catch, pollution, and climate change. [...] Flatback turtles are specifically threatened by the direct harvest of eggs and meat by the indigenous people of Australia for traditional hunting. [...] These people are given the right to harvest by the government, but only if for non-commercial purposes. [...] Another threat they are struggling with is the destruction of their nesting beaches due to coastal development {{and the destruction of}} feeding sites at coral reefs and the shallow areas near the shore. [...] Camping on these beaches compacts the sand and contributes to <b>dune</b> <b>erosion,</b> and the wheel ruts caused by vehicles driving on the beaches can trap the hatchlings on their journey to the sea. Coastal development contributes to barriers that make it difficult or impossible for adult turtles to reach nesting and feeding sites. [...] These turtles also fall prey to incidental capture. They are caught by fisherman, particularly by trawling, gillnet fishing, ghost nets, and crab pots. [...] Lastly, pollution is a concern for these creatures. [...] Pollution can affect the timing of their egg laying, how they choose their nesting site, how hatchlings find the sea after emerging, and how adult turtles find the beaches.|$|E

To avoid impacts by not taking or limiting actions, to reduce or rectify impacts by rehabilitation or restoring the affected environments or instituting long-term maintenance operations and compensating for impacts by replacing or providing substitute environments for resourcesStructural mitigation is the current solution to eroding beaches and movement of sand is the use of engineered structures along the coast have been short lived and are only an illusion of safety to the public that result in long term damage of the coastline. Structural management deals {{with the use of the}} following: groins which are man-made solution to longshore current movements up and down the coast. The use of groins are efficient to some extent yet cause erosion and sand build up further down the beaches. Bulkheads are man-made structures that help protect the homes built along the coast and other bodies of water that actually induce erosion in the long run. Jetties are structures built to protect sand movement into the inlets where boats for fishing and recreation move through.The use of nonstructural mitigation is the practice of using organic and soft structures for solutions to protect against coastal hazards. These include: artificial dunes, which are used to create dunes that have been either developed on or eroded. There needs to be at least two lines of dunes before any development can occur. Beach Nourishment is a major source of nonstructural mitigation to ensure that beaches are present for the communities and for the protection of the coastline.
