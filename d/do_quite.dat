While Australia did not <b>do</b> <b>quite</b> as well, its larger land mass/resources meant that after a few decades, it was able to keep up with its more fortunate neighbors, with several new political entities rising from the ashes. The most important nation in Australia was the Kingdom of Capricornia, ruling Northern Australia, with a capital in Darwin.|$|E
500|$|Screenwriter Ian Watson has speculated, [...] "Worldwide, A.I. {{was very}} {{successful}} (and the 4th highest earner of the year) but it didn't <b>do</b> <b>quite</b> so well in America, because the film, so I'm told, was too poetical and intellectual in general for American tastes. Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg." ...|$|E

500|$|Television Without Pity {{gave the}} episode an [...] "A". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave a glowing review, stating that [...] "I have to say, {{this is one}} of the most dense and {{interesting}} episodes of Veronica Mars yet, on a number of different levels." [...] He went on to praise the return of Troy, the various subplots, and the episode's ambiguous conclusion. The reviewer summed up by saying, [...] "With all that going on, it could have been easy for this episode to fall apart somewhere... "The Rapes of Graff" [...] really managed to do everything it was trying to <b>do</b> <b>quite</b> well. It may have been missing something special to put it in the absolute top tier of Veronica Mars episodes, but it's still a marvelous episode for pulling all those different strands together. Anais Bordages of BuzzFeed ranked the episode 27th of 64 episodes of Veronica Mars, but nevertheless gave a positive review, calling it [...] "awesome". She elaborated, [...] "The banter is excellent, our main character shoots down every sexist on campus, and Michael Cera has a cameo. Even better: The other part of the episode revolves around Cliff’s sexual misfortunes." [...] On a similar list, TV Line ranked the episode 16th.|$|E
500|$|Ben, {{although}} extremely well-mannered, has an impeccable {{ability to}} lie and manipulate {{the people around}} him, even when he is at a physical disadvantage. He often speaks in a low, emotionless monotone when at his most unreadable, frequently sprinkling his speech with sarcasm or dry, humorless jokes. He can also be petty and vindictive, {{even to the point}} of murder, when he does not get what he wants. He claims to have been born on the Island, leading to him being thought of as a miracle by the Others, as pregnant women die on the island; but later confesses to Locke that he was lying. He unsuccessfully tries to convince the survivors he is Henry Gale, although succeeds in manipulating Locke to turn against Jack while held prisoner under this guise. While he claims he will not sacrifice innocent lives in order to accomplish his goals, he has been shown to <b>do</b> <b>quite</b> the opposite. In the third-season finale, Ben is informed by Tom Friendly (M. C. Gainey), an Other, that they have captured three of the crash survivors: Sayid Jarrah, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). When Tom tells Ben they are unwilling to reveal any information about the rest of the survivors, Ben quickly replies [...] "Shoot Kwon... You want them to answer questions, kill Kwon - do it now". Conversely, Ben refuses to allow his spy on the freighter to destroy it long before it reaches the Island, as he would not kill anyone who [...] "did not deserve to die". Furthermore, when Locke confronts Ben about causing the freighter to explode, Ben coldly replies, [...] "So?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The slang term, at some facilities, for a {{cycle of}} {{pressurization}} inside the HBOT chamber is [...] "a dive". An HBOT treatment for longer-term conditions is often a series of 20 to 40 dives, or compressions. These dives last {{for about an hour}} and can be administered via a hard, high-pressure chamber or a soft, low-pressure chamber—the major difference being per-dive [...] "dose" [...] of oxygen. Many conditions <b>do</b> <b>quite</b> well with the lower dose, lower cost-per-hour, soft chambers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{striking}} exterior {{design of}} A, which designer Starck had likened to being [...] "more {{like a fish}} than a building", polarized opinions from the outset. Jonathan Beckett, chief executive of London yacht brokers Burgess, was initially skeptical, but changed his mind after seeing the boat in person in the Caribbean: [...] "I have to say I was impressed. It's a very exciting boat to watch. It's simply unlike anything that's ever been done before." [...] David Pelly of Boat International was also enamoured, saying she was [...] "...the most extraordinary yacht launched in recent memory. It is stunning." [...] And writing about the world's biggest mega yachts in the New York Times in 2011, Nazanin Lankarini argued that A was [...] "even more desirable than her larger sisters by virtue of lines reminiscent of a nuclear submarine". A {{was one of the}} featured vessels in the 2011 edition of The Superyachts, where she was described as [...] "bold and eccentric."By contrast, Power & Motoryacht magazine columnist Diane Byrne opined that [...] "overall she does not float my boat (sorry, kids, couldn’t resist), but I <b>do</b> <b>quite</b> like the inverted bow design", while Donald Starkey, a British yacht designer, commented that A [...] "...is aggressive, like a giant finger pointing at you. It seems to {{have nothing to do with}} the whole idea of yachting, which is about cruising around at a leisurely pace, and enjoying your friends and the sea". Maritime commentator Peter Mello was even more scathing in his assessment, deriding her as [...] "one of the most hideous vessels ever to sail the seas". The Wall Street Journals Robert Frank was initially also an outspoken critic, calling A [...] "one of the ghastliest megayachts ever created" [...] and [...] "more like a cruiser for Darth Vader's navy than a family pleasure boat for the Mediterranean" [...] when she was launched. However, in a follow-up blog several months later, he confessed: [...] "I've gained a bit more respect for it. Technically, it's impressive: Because of her inverted bow, the boat barely makes a splash in the front when it's speeding along at 24knots. And it's different in a way few yachts are...So even though I still think it's a monster, A gets a tip of the hat for taking a risk and being different".|$|E
