It has the advantage of remote temperature sensing; it does not require contact or even close proximity unlike most thermometers. At higher temperatures, blackbody radiation becomes visible and is described by the colour temperature. For example a glowing heating element or an approximation of a star's surface temperature.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} {{infrared}} thermometers are the spot <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> or infrared pyrometer, which measures the temperature {{at a spot}} on a surface (actually a relatively small area determined by the D:S ratio).

50|$|The design {{essentially}} {{consists of}} a lens to focus the infrared thermal radiation on to a detector, which converts the radiant power to an electrical signal that can be displayed in units of temperature after being compensated for ambient temperature. This permits temperature measurement from a distance without contact with the object to be measured. A non-contact <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> is useful for measuring temperature under circumstances where thermocouples or other probe-type sensors cannot be used or do not produce accurate data {{for a variety of}} reasons.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>infrared</b> <b>{{thermometer}}</b> is {{a thermometer}} which infers temperature from {{a portion of}} the thermal radiation sometimes called blackbody radiation emitted by the object being measured. They are sometimes called laser thermometers as a laser is used to help aim the thermometer, or non-contact thermometers or temperature guns, to describe the device's ability to measure temperature from a distance. By knowing the amount of infrared energy emitted by the object and its emissivity, the object's temperature can often be determined. Infrared thermometers are a subset of devices known as [...] "thermal radiation thermometers".|$|E
50|$|The show's editing {{has been}} questioned, such as {{activity}} that is not captured on tape and findings that are unsupported by evidence in the show specifically. Tools are used {{in ways that are}} not proven effective, or in ways in which they have been proven ineffective, such as infrared thermometers that are claimed to detect cold spots in the middle of rooms when such tools are able only to measure the surface temperature of objects unless equipped with a probe accessory. However, the show has been seen using a probe attached to the <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> that would then give the temperature of both the surface it is pointed at and the area around the probe.|$|E
50|$|A 2003 {{episode of}} the Discovery Channel {{television}} program MythBusters featured a myth called Exploding Jawbreaker inspired by the incidents with Diggs and Cameron DeHall. Co-hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, with help from Build Team member Tory Belleci and Mythtern Christine Chamberlain, strove {{to find out just}} how a Gobstopper or Jawbreaker could become a bomb. Hyneman, on examining the insides of one, noticed that because of the candy's multi-layered makeup, there is a potential for a temperature differential — meaning that one or more layers could heat faster, causing pressure on the outer shell and making the candy unstable. (Chamberlain found using an <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> that one layer got up to 225 F after microwave heating.) If the candy was compressed — including in someone's jaws — the candy could explosively burst and its almost molten centers could cause painful burns.|$|E
5000|$|The word {{pyrometer}} {{comes from}} the Greek word for fire, [...] "πυρ" [...] (pyro), and meter, meaning to measure. The word pyrometer was originally coined to denote a device capable of measuring the temperature of an object by its incandescence, visible light emitted by a body which is at least red-hot. [...] Modern pyrometers or <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometers</b> also measure the temperature of cooler objects, down to room temperature, by detecting their infrared radiation flux.|$|R

50|$|Adam and Jamie, {{with help}} from Tory and Christine, tested the myth {{in a number of}} ways. When Jamie cut a Jawbreaker open using a band saw, he found that the way the candy is built (various layers of sugar around a solid candy center) creates the {{potential}} for a temperature differential. Specifically, the various layers can heat at different rates, creating a scenario where a layer can expand, cause pressure on the outer shell and make the candy unstable. (Christine found, by using an <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer,</b> that one layer got up to 107 degrees Celsius after microwave heating.) If the candy was compressed - including in someone's jaws - the candy could explosively burst and its almost molten centers could cause painful burns.As a finale, Jamie created a more literal exploding Jawbreaker by removing the core, filling it with gunpowder, adding a fuse and then detonating it.|$|E
50|$|For {{those who}} cannot afford a thermal inspection, it is {{possible}} to get a general feel for the heat loss with a non-contact <b>infrared</b> <b>thermometer</b> and several sheets of reflective insulation. The method involves measuring the temperatures on the inside surfaces of several exterior walls to establish baseline temperatures. After this, reflective barrier insulation is taped securely to the walls in 8 ft by 1.5 ft strips and the temperatures are measured {{in the center of the}} insulated areas at 1-hour intervals for 12 hours (the reflective barrier is pulled away from the wall to measure the temperature in the center of the area which it has covered). The best manner in which to do this is when the temperature differential (Delta T) between the inside and outside of the structure is at least 40 degrees. A well-insulated wall will commonly change approximately 1 degree per hour if the difference between external and internal temperatures is an average of 40 degrees. A poorly insulated wall can drop as much as 10 degrees in an hour.|$|E
