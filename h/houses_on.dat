5|$|The {{perimeter}} wall of {{the citadel}} is not a continuous fortification wall, but consists of the façades of approximately 100 houses that have been built against each other. Because they have been built {{on or near the}} steep slope of the citadel mound, many of these façades were strengthened by buttresses to prevent their collapse or subsidence. There were circa 30 city-palaces; most of them located along the perimeter of the citadel. The oldest surviving house that can be securely dated through an inscription was built in 1893. The oldest houses {{can be found on the}} southeastern side of the mound, whereas <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> the northern perimeter date to the 1930s–1940s. Before the introduction of modern building techniques, most <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> the citadel were built around a courtyard. A raised arcade overlooking the courtyard, a flat roof and a bent-access entrance to prevent views of the courtyard and the interior of the house were characteristic elements of the <b>houses</b> <b>on</b> the citadel.|$|E

The explosion shattered windows a mile away and was heard as far away as Sandy Hook, New Jersey.|$|E
