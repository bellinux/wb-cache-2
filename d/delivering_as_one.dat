The Tactic Knowledge of an experienced faculty can be collected and stored in a Knowledge Management System as Knowledge Objects. A Knowledge Object can be any information artefacts. Learning Objects which are digital entities used to teach a topic in a curriculum can be integrated with Knowledge Objects and can be made available together as Learning Knowledge Object in a teaching module. Thus the Learning Material defined for a particular subject and the in depth knowledge of experts in the same subject can be combined together and <b>delivered</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> whole unit to the students for higher order learning. These Objects have a diversity of Metadata. Using these Metadata we can classify and cluster them.

40|$|Aim: This paper {{describes}} the research protocol {{for a study}} exploring if and how clinical supervision facilitates change in practice relating to psychosocial aspects of care for Health Professionals, who {{have been trained to}} deliver a psychosocial intervention to adults with cancer. Background: There is a recognized need to implement care that is in line with clinical practice guidelines for the psychosocial care of adults with cancer. Clinical supervision is recommended as a means to support Health Professionals in providing the recommended psychosocial care. Design: A qualitative design embedded within an experimental, stepped wedge randomized control trial. Methods: The study will use discourse analysis to analyse audio-recorded data collected in clinical supervision sessions that are being <b>delivered</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> element of a large randomized control trial. The sessions will be attended primarily by nurses, but including physiotherapists, radiation therapists, occupational therapists. The Health Professionals are participants in a randomized control trial designed to reduce anxiety and depression of distressed adults with cancer. The sessions will be facilitated by psychiatrists experienced in psycho-oncology and the provision of clinical supervision. Discussion: The proposed research is designed specifically to facilitate exploration of the mechanisms by which clinical supervision enables Health Professionals to deliver a brief, tailored psychosocial intervention {{in the context of their}} everyday practice. This is the first study to use discourse analysis embedded within an experimental randomized control trial to explore the mechanisms of change generated within clinical supervision by analysing the discourse within the clinical supervision sessions...|$|R

The real interest of using the PERSIANN database into the hydrologic applications is mainly with the goal of having access to the spatial and temporal distribution of precipitation over a significant area (typically here an area equivalent to a SMOS pixel). The goal of this study is to quantify the gain of using PERSIANN instead of distributing sparse rain gauge measurements. The interest of using satellite rainfall estimates as well as the influence that the precipitation events can induce on the modelling of the water content in the soil was depicted by a comparison between different soil moisture products.

40|$|MiM (Mahara in Music) was {{a project}} which {{stemmed from the}} {{introduction}} of ePortfolio into a module {{as part of a}} BA (Hons) Music programme at York St John University. The project aimed to analyse the impact the ePortfolio had upon assessment, employability thinking and the students reaction to mobile learning but more indirectly- the pedagogical implications it had on staff, curriculum design and how it may have impacted on staff-student roles. The research highlighted a number of issues that were not expected: that students aren’t all as technology-proficient as presumed, students were uncomfortable about creating online content, they did not view their musical achievements as transferrable until encouraged to reflect upon their academic journey, and an alarming number of students did not have an occupational aim for life after their university course was completed. In light of this the project was designed to address these issues and the criteria for the YSJU Learning and Teaching Project Bid Themes: •	Mobile learning - To be <b>delivered</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> element of an overall programme of learning interventions {{in the context of a}} blend rather than the primary delivery channel for content. •	Assessment - To use Mahara (ePortfolio) creatively for a combination of formative and summative assessment •	Employability - To create new strategies to embed graduate skills within curriculum, create learning opportunities to develop students’ enterprise skills. This research tracked students’ progress through formative assessment points, pre- and post- module questionnaires, focus groups, and through the creation of an ePortfolio which was used as a reflexive learning tool, summative assessment framework and ultimately a multi-media-and-digital curriculum vitae.

40|$|One of the {{instruments}} on board of the ALOS satellite, launched by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2006, is the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping (PRISM). PRISM has three cameras with different viewing directions (nadir, forward, backward), recording imagery with a ground resolution of 2. 5 m. A main characteristic of raw ALOS PRISM imagery is that depending on the observation mode each scene is split into four or six separate strips, each related to an individual CCD chip. Basic imagery is <b>delivered</b> <b>as</b> <b>one</b> image data file per strip. We have developed a pushbroom sensor model {{that is capable of}} dealing with individual CCD chips sharing some orientation parameters and that can thus be applied to ALOS PRISM imagery. It has previously been shown that pixel-level results can be achieved for georeferencing of ALOS PRISM imagery using this sensor model and a moderate number of ground control points. However, the distribution of resulting residuals suggested that the parameters describing the relative alignment of the individual CCD chips provided by JAXA might not be perfect. Thus, the sensor model was expanded to be capable of self-calibration of these CCD alignment parameters. In this paper, the sensor model will be outlined and the new self-calibration technique described. The effectiveness of self-calibration will be assessed as well as the calibration process carried out by JAXA, in the latter case comparing a set of CCD alignment parameters calibrated in October 2006, and thus representing a very early stage of system calibration, to an updated parameter set obtained in July 2007. Three scenes (forward, backward, nadir) covering a test field in Melbourne (Australia), consisting of more then 100 points surveyed by kinematic GPS, were used for this assessment.

This research project concludes based on evidence that Duplication is the cause of most of the UN’s deficiencies and challenges in Mozambique.

This UNDAF has been developed according to the principles of UN <b>Delivering</b> <b>as</b> <b>One</b> (DaO), aimed at ensuring Government ownership, demonstrated through UNDAF's full alignment to Government priorities and planning cycles, as well as internal coherence among UN agencies and programmes operating in Kenya. The UNDAF narrative includes five recommended sections: Introduction and Country Context, UNDAF Results, Resource Estimates, Implementation Arrangements, and Monitoring and Evaluation as well as a Results and Resources Annex. Developed under the leadership of the Government, the UNDAF reflects the efforts of all UN agencies working in Kenya and is shaped by the five UNDG programming principles: Human Rights-based approach, gender equality, environmental sustainability, capacity development, and results based management. The UNDAF working groups have developed a truly broad-based Results Framework, in collaboration with Civil Society, donors and other partners. The UNDAF has four Strategic Results Areas: 1) Transformational Governance encompassing Policy and Institutional Frameworks; Democratic Participation and Human Rights; Devolution and Accountability; and Evidence-based Decision-making, 2) Human Capital Development comprised of Education and Learning; Health, including Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), Environmental Preservation, Food Availability and Nutrition; Multi-sectoral HIV and AIDS Response; and Social Protection, 3) Inclusive and Sustainable Economic Growth, with Improving the Business Environment; Strengthening Productive Sectors and Trade; and Promoting Job Creation, Skills Development and Improved Working Conditions, and 4) Environmental Sustainability, Land Management and Human Security including Policy and Legal Framework Development; and Peace, Community Security and Resilience.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{increasing}} demand for a reform of the UN system at the national level. Objecting to a failure in aid effectiveness and a paternalistic implementation of a rigid western model of human rights, the call for reform has been concretised in the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), the Hanoi Core Statements on Aid Effectiveness (2005) and the General Assembly Resolution A/ 60 / 1 (2006), which recognize the need for a more effective and coherent UN country presence. The One UN reform – <b>Delivering</b> <b>as</b> <b>One</b> – is currently being piloted in eight different countries, one of them Viet Nam. One of the main principles governing the reform is the shift of power as to who directs the UN’s resources. The principle of increased national ownership is juxtaposed with the fact of a government repressing its people, {{as is the case in}} Viet Nam. This thesis builds upon a field study in Viet Nam, addressing issues of human rights violations, the Communist Party’s rhetoric of protecting the people, and the UN’s rhetoric of expertise conditioned by western thought. The question of whether the subaltern can speak is again raised here, as is further inquiries on whether the Government of Viet Nam and/or the UN hears and/or listens to it. Utilizing Jürgen Habermas’ theory of communicative action to theorise the agencies of The Government of Viet Nam and the One UN, and by placing them in a Habermasian polity of communicative action, it becomes possible to view this occurring encounter of ideologically governed actors in a new light, and inquire as to whether it is possible to reach an understanding and coordinate plans of action by way of agreement. This thesis sheds light on and problematizes issues of western presence, communicative action, the colonial civilizing project, subalternity, as it is activated in the context of Viet Nam and in the principles of the UN reform...|$|E
