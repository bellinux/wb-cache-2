5|$|Governor Desha's {{reputation}} was further tarnished {{because of a}} pardon issued to his son. On November 2, 1824, Isaac B. Desha had brutally murdered Francis Baker, a Mississippian who was visiting Kentucky. On November 24, 1824, John Rowan, one of the governor's allies in the General Assembly, introduced legislation ordering the Fleming County Circuit Court to convene a special session on January 17, 1825, for Isaac Desha's trial and providing that the accused should <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> request a change of venue to Harrison County at that time. Miles {{from the scene of}} the murder, Harrison County was the governor's home county, and he possessed a great deal of influence with officials there. Governor Desha appeared before the legislative committee considering the bill on November 26 and asked that they report it favorably to the full legislature. This was done, and the bill was approved on December 4, 1824.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the genetic disease hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP {{will be required to}} be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are able}} to move around the {{battlefield}} freely, but they <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> create predefined paths for the character to follow. While moving along these paths, characters gain access to Hero actions, which make them immune to damage and speed up charge times. However, {{the use of these}} Hero actions requires the use of Bezels; these items are an essential element in battle and are recharged through a variety of methods, such as destroying portions of an enemy's weapons and armor, or killing an enemy. Characters using Hero actions can attack while jumping in the air, and are also able to unleash special attacks which manifest as stylish firearm maneuvers. Enemies are only able to move while the player's current character is moving and will usually attack only that character.|$|E

Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> kill them, leave them untouched, or incapacitate them, and the game classifies their choices {{in one of three}} categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E

5|$|The game blends investigative {{elements}} with fast-paced action sequences, including chases, combat, interrogations and gunfights. Players use melee {{attacks and}} firearms to fight enemies, and may run, jump or use vehicles {{to navigate the}} world. In combat, auto-aim and a cover system {{can be used as}} assistance against enemies. Should player characters take damage, the character's health will gradually regenerate. Weapons can only be used in appropriate circumstances, such as during firefights. When driving vehicles, players <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>option</b> <b>to</b> skip directly to the destination by nominating their partner as the driver. Players can also ask the partner for directions.
