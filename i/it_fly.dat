25|$|The main {{offensive}} {{began with}} the landing at Lae by Major General George Wootten's Australian 9th Division and the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade on September 4, 1943. The next day MacArthur watched the landing at Nadzab by paratroops of the 503rd Parachute Infantry from a B-17 circling overhead. The B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but MacArthur insisted that <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> on to Nadzab. For this, MacArthur was awarded the Air Medal.|$|E
25|$|Cristiano Ronaldo {{restored}} United's two-goal {{lead in the}} 35th minute, after Park Ji-sung {{had been}} fouled 30 yards from goal; anticipating that Ronaldo would shoot for the open side of the goal, Cañizares took a step to his right as Ronaldo struck the ball, only to see <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> over the wall and into the top corner on the opposite side. The Europe XI {{had a chance to}} reduce the deficit again from the penalty spot a minute later, when Brown fouled Zlatan Ibrahimović inside the penalty area; the Swede wrestled the ball from his compatriot Henrik Larsson to take the penalty himself, denying Larsson the chance to score against the team he had left only the day before, but Ibrahimović's kick hit the crossbar.|$|E
25|$|In Avalonia, Avalon Centrifuge (Colin McFarlane) takes Sackboy on a {{training}} course to learn combat using his machines. Half-way through, though, the Negativitron attacks Avalonia and spreads Meanies throughout. After rescuing the Sackbots among {{the wreckage of}} the facility, they get loaded back onto Huge Spaceship and prepare to leave Avalonia, but a Meanie warship attacks the ship. Even though Sackboy defeats the warship, Huge Spaceship crashes and is in need of repair, but only one creator can make <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> again. Victoria suggests the great inventor Dr. Herbert Higginbotham (Ewan Bailey), but Clive tells them that when he was at his factory, he was infected by a Meanie during the Negativitron attack. Avalon sends Sackboy and Clive to Eve's Asylum for the Mentally Alternative to liberate Higginbotham.|$|E

50|$|The blue {{corporal}} has {{a single}} brood per year. It mates on the wing. The female, guarded by the male, who hovers above her, deposits her eggs immediately after mating, dipping her abdomen into the water to do so. She spreads her eggs out, spacing them several meters apart {{around the perimeter of}} a pond; overall, she lays few eggs in any one site. The young develop synchronously, which increases the amount of intraspecific competition between them. The blue corporal overwinters as a final instar nymph, and the entire population of an area emerges over a one-month period in early spring. The flight period varies with latitude. For example, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from November to May in Florida, while in Louisiana <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from February to May. Further north, it emerges later. In South Carolina, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from late March until early May, while in Kansas <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from April to May. In Ohio and Kentucky, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from April to June, and in New Jersey, <b>it</b> <b>flies</b> from April to July.|$|R
500|$|Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur {{had only three}} American divisions, and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Battle of Buna–Gona and Battle of Guadalcanal. As a result, [...] "it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 {{would have to be}} carried out mainly by the Australian Army." [...] The offensive began with the landing at Lae by the Australian 9th Division on 4 September 1943. The next day, MacArthur watched the landing at Nadzab by paratroops of the 503rd Parachute Infantry. His B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but he insisted that <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> on to Nadzab. For this, he was awarded the Air Medal.|$|E
500|$|Jackson's {{vision of}} Middle-earth was {{described}} as being [...] "Ray Harryhausen meets David Lean" [...] by Randy Cook. Jackson wanted a gritty realism and historical regard for the fantasy, and attempted {{to make the world}} rational and believable. For example, the New Zealand Army helped build Hobbiton months before filming began so the plants could really grow. Creatures were designed to be biologically believable, such as the enormous wings of the fell beast to help <b>it</b> <b>fly.</b> In total, 48,000 pieces of armour, 500 bows, and 10,000 arrows were created by Weta Workshop. They also created many prosthetics, such as 1,800 pairs of Hobbit feet for the lead actors, as well as many ears, noses, and heads for the cast, and around 19,000 costumes were woven and aged. Every prop was specially designed by the Art Department, taking the different scales into account.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less positive. The Herald Suns head {{reviewer}} Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried {{to match the}} edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, [...] "way, way off the mark". He wrote, [...] "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', just wait until you get a load of this lame local production." [...] Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film {{was an example of}} [...] "just how bad local [...] films can get". In particular, he criticised the [...] "stiff" [...] performances, the [...] "woeful" [...] directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and lacked [...] "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and [...] "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that [...] "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that [...] "her slight role is insufficient to make <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of [...] "an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away".|$|E

2500|$|The Hastings {{took off}} from Abingdon about 1600 hrs. One {{eyewitness}} reported it flying in company with two RAF Armstrong Whitworth AW.660 Argosy heavy transport aircraft. Eyewitnesses {{in the village of}} Berinsfield reported seeing <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> over, then lose height or dive. They reported the aircraft [...] "weaving from side to side", [...] "its wings wiggled" [...] or [...] "its tail wobbled" [...] before the Hastings climbed steeply out of control. It then fell with all four engines still running and crashed into a field at Little Baldon called Hundred Acres, about [...] east of Abingdon and [...] southeast of Oxford. The aircraft hit the ground on its back and burst into a ball of flame, killing all six crew and all 35 passengers. It was reported from RAF Abingdon that the pilot, Flight Lieutenant John Akin, had radioed that his aircraft was having control trouble before the radio went dead.|$|E

2500|$|The Phillies got men on {{base in the}} seventh, eighth, {{and ninth}} innings, while Roberts allowed a single to Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella in the eighth, but the score {{remained}} tied, 1–1. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth inning, Roberts walked Cal Abrams, who advanced to second on a single by Reese and came around to home plate on Duke Snider's hard single up the middle. Richie Ashburn threw the ball to catcher Stan Lopata, who had replaced starting catcher Andy Seminick on defense in the bottom of the 9th inning [...] from his position in center field, and Lopata tagged Abrams out at the plate. With runners now on second and third, Roberts walked Robinson intentionally to load the bases, then induced Carl Furillo to foul out to Eddie Waitkus. After Roberts retired the last batter, the game went to extra innings. Newcombe allowed hits to Roberts and Waitkus, who advanced to second and third when Ashburn sacrificed himself. Sisler came to the plate and hit a high outside fastball from Newcombe over the left-field wall, dancing to first base as he watched <b>it</b> <b>fly</b> out. Comfortable on the mound again with a 4–1 lead, Roberts retired the side in the tenth inning to secure the complete-game victory and the Phillies' second pennant in franchise history.|$|E
