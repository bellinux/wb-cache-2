25|$|Many {{people are}} managed through <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> centers, {{and are able}} to return to work within a week or two, while intense {{activities}} are prohibited for a longer period. People who have their hernias repaired with mesh often recover in a number of days, though pain can last longer. Surgical complications include pain that lasts more than three months, surgical site infections, nerve and blood vessel injuries, injury to nearby organs, and hernia recurrence. Pain that lasts more than three months occurs in about 10% of people following hernia repair.|$|E

25|$|Lateral {{internal}} sphincterotomy (LIS) is {{the surgical}} procedure {{of choice for}} anal fissures due to its simplicity and its high success rate (~95%). In this procedure the internal anal sphincter is partially divided {{in order to reduce}} spasming and thus improve the blood supply to the perianal area. This improvement in the blood supply helps to heal the fissure, and the weakening of the sphincter is also believed to reduce the potential for recurrence. The procedure is generally performed as a <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> after the patient is given general anesthesia. The pain from the sphincterotomy is usually mild and is often less than the pain of the fissure itself. Patients often return to normal activity within one week.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hospital}} in Frankston {{opened at the}} turn of the 20th century, as the private <b>day</b> <b>surgery</b> and hospital of the British doctor and former Director of the Melbourne Pharmacy School Sidney Plowman. It operated from Dr Plowman's residence, known as The Lofts (also known as the Plowman Residence), at 20 Davey Street in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD), until his death in 1937. The Lofts was designed as a Queen Anne style California bungalow by Blackett & Rankin Architects and constructed of locally-made bricks. It is listed is on the Victorian and Australian heritage registries through the National Trust of Australia, and was restored and incorporated into the design of Frankston's Australian Government Building, which was built around it in the 1990s. It currently houses the Frankston offices of the Australian Electoral Commission and the member of parliament in the Australian House of Representatives for the Division of Dunkley (of which Frankston is a part).|$|E

40|$|Short term {{psychological}} disturbance in 70 children undergoing minor surgery was compared in two randomly allocated groups {{by means of}} questionnaires answered by their parents. Significantly less {{psychological disturbance}} was reported in children undergoing <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> compared with children admitted {{on the day before}} and discharged on the <b>day</b> after <b>surgery.</b> Children who had <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> were less often reported to require extra attention in the first week after discharge home, and at three months after operation these children were less often said to be still affected by their hospital stay. It is concluded that a reduced psychological upset can now be added to the other arguments in favour of <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> in children...|$|R

40|$|Background: Changes in {{refraction}} follow {{surgery on}} the extraocular muscles. We examined corneal topography {{before and after}} medial or lateral rectus muscle recession using a computer-assisted topographic analysis system. Methods: A total of 36 patients (52 eyes) were examined. Measurements were taken 1 <b>day</b> before <b>surgery</b> and 1, 15, and 30 <b>days</b> after <b>surgery.</b> Results: A significant change in astigmatic power was detected 1 <b>day</b> after <b>surgery</b> in the meridian of the recessed muscle, evidencing a localized flattening of the cornea. Induced astigmatism decreased over time. At 30 <b>days</b> following <b>surgery,</b> 6 % of patients evidenced a residual change higher than 1 diopter (D); 12 % evidenced a residual change higher than 0. 5 D. Conclusion: The increase of astigmatic power recorded 1 <b>day</b> after <b>surgery</b> is higher for medial rectus muscle recession than for lateral rectus muscle recession. Corneal topography changes, located mainly in the meridian of the recessed muscle and the optical zone, are greatly reduced or gone within 1 month of surgery...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionOver {{the past}} decade there has been {{considerable}} change to surgical training such as modernising medical careers which have raised concerns over exposure to operative experience. With the National Health Service (NHS) plan aiming {{for the majority of}} elective surgical cases to be performed as day cases we sought to assess the level of exposure modern day surgical trainees obtain in <b>day</b> case <b>surgery.</b> MethodsAn anonymous electronic questionnaire survey was completed by 100 surgical trainees in surgical training across the United Kingdom (UK) from a variety of sub-specialities. 16 questions pertinent to <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> exposure were answered. ResultsThe majority of the trainees who completed the survey felt <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> is a vital part of their training as a surgeon. Only less than one-third of all the trainees had formal timetabled <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> lists. Of the 31 trainees who had scheduled day lists only 58 % (n =  18) were consistently able to attend. The most common reasons for being unable to attend were rota issues and lack of encouragement from seniors. 90 trainees (90 %) were not satisfied with their overall <b>Day</b> Case <b>Surgery</b> training. ConclusionsThe survey reveals that the modern surgical trainee is gaining a low and inconsistent level of exposure to <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> despite being {{aware of the importance of}} this modality of training. An urgent review is required to ensure trainees become actively involved in <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> and are not missing on this vital training opportunity...|$|R

40|$|Although <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> is recommended, its {{widespread}} feasibility in {{an urban}} environment is unclear. We studied 100 consecutive unselected patients admitted for surgical procedures considered to be suitable for <b>day</b> case <b>surgery.</b> Their age, fitness and social details were recorded and they were asked both before surgery and after discharge by a postal questionnaire, whether they would have preferred treatment as an outpatient. There were 47 men and 53 women {{with a mean age}} of 42. 5 years. Ninety-six were considered to be medically fit for <b>day</b> case <b>surgery</b> but 10 patients lived alone, seven had no suitable companion, 22 had too many stairs to climb, 13 lived too far from the hospital and two could not provide a lift home. Thus 58 of the patients were unsuitable for <b>day</b> case <b>surgery.</b> Seventy-eight of the patients replied to the postal questionnaire. Before the operation 51 patients preferred the idea of day care but only 14 felt the same way afterwards. The single postoperative complication was one case of acute retention after a hernia repair.
