50|$|Morgan P. O'Brien was an {{engineer}} at the A. E. Staley Company, located in Decatur, Illinois, {{as well as a}} football fan who assisted George Halas in <b>managing</b> the <b>administrative</b> <b>matters</b> of the Decatur Staleys (renamed the Chicago Bears in 1922). In the fall of 1920, O'Brien and Halas traveled to Canton, Ohio via train to attend and represent Decatur at a meeting held at Ralph Hay's Hupmobile dealership, which would establish the American Professional Football Association (renamed the National Football League in 1922).|$|R
40|$|By {{almost any}} measure, most South African public schools, and {{especially}} {{schools in the}} Western Cape, have under-performed academically. For a number of years, there has existed a wide degree of consensus among education stakeholders, and particularly in government, that the problems in our schools extend beyond mere academic under-achievement. Principals need to be occupied with the tasks of managing and leading teaching and learning, that is, instruction leadership, and not <b>managing</b> routine <b>administrative</b> <b>matters</b> only. In recognising the potential of school administrative personnel to provide relief {{and support for the}} administrative role of principals, the Western Cape Government initiated a training course in July, 2008 for school business administrators. The course was modelled on a very successful training course developed in the United Kingdom...|$|R
25|$|The {{structure}} of the council mirrored that of most football leagues in Australia at the time: each affiliated full member league appointed a delegate (or, in the early years, two delegates) to the council to act on its behalf in discussions and votes. The decision making process followed by the council was that delegates would meet, generally every one to three years, to discuss and vote on proposed changes. All changes to on-field or off-field laws needed to be passed by a supermajority vote – this was originally a three-quarters majority, then later became a double majority which required an overall simple majority plus minimum number of the designated major states to vote in favour. The council also elected an executive committee which <b>managed</b> the game's <b>administrative</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the Roman Catholic Church a {{chancellor}} is {{the chief}} record-keeper of a diocese or eparchy or their equivalent. Normally a priest, sometimes a deacon or layperson, the chancellor keeps the official archives of the diocese, as a notary certifies documents, and generally <b>manages</b> the <b>administrative</b> offices (and sometimes finances and personnel) of a diocese. He may be assisted by vice-chancellors. Though he manages the paperwork and office (called the [...] "chancery"), has no actual jurisdictional authority: the bishop of the diocese exercises decision-making authority through his judicial vicar, in judicial matters, and the vicar general for <b>administrative</b> <b>matters.</b>|$|R
