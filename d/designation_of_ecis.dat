40|$|While the IS {{community}} is increasingly international, {{there is evidence}} to suggest that different elements of the community have different research and publication orientations, interests and expectations. This paper contributes to this discussion by further developing the profile of European Information Systems (IS) research that was reported on following the first ten years of the European Conference on Information Systems (ECIS). It is timely, in that ECIS celebrates its 20 th anniversary this year. As with the earlier articles, this paper reflects on European IS research, as presented at ECIS, but this time it concentrates on the second decade, in comparison with the first. Based on an analysis of all papers published in ECIS proceedings during the period 2003 - 2012, the paper highlights key research topics, research approaches adopted and key references used by ECIS authors. By comparing these data with the first ten years <b>of</b> <b>ECIS</b> (i. e., the period 1993 - 2002), it provides some evidence of emerging (and declining) trends over the 20 -year history <b>of</b> <b>ECIS...</b>|$|R

40|$|A plenary {{presentation}} at ECIS 2002 (Galliers and Whitley 2002) presented a {{first round of}} research that sought to determine the profile <b>of</b> <b>ECIS</b> as a distinct community of information systems researchers. ECIS draws on a strong tradition of IS research in Europe (the first information systems–specific conference {{to be held in}} the world was the Scandinavian IS Research Seminar (IRIS) in 1978) yet little is actually known about the profile of the European IS community. It is difficult to determine any distinctive features of the community until this profile is known. This panel aims to describe the evolving profile <b>of</b> the <b>ECIS</b> community. The ECIS community {{can be thought of as}} an “invisible college ” (Crane 1972) : an informal communication network with some form of social organization. A common approach to the study of such networks and social organizations in academia is through the use of bibliometrics. Bibliometrics is a research method used in library and information science that utilizes quantitative analysis and statistics to describe patterns of publication within a given field or body of literature. The aim of this panel is to determine the profile <b>of</b> the <b>ECIS</b> community by drawing on various forms of bibliometric data. It will explore how the ECI...|$|R
40|$|In vitro {{neurotoxicity}} {{testing and}} toxicity effect quantification {{plays an important}} role in many disciplines of biomedicine as an alternative to in vivo methods. The principle of the majority of in vitro methods corresponds to the basic concept of biosensors, i. e. measured quantity is by means of biological sensing element transformed to physical quantity easily measurable by electrical methods of measurement. Two types of biosensors suitable for neurotoxicity measurements are described in the paper. A common feature for both types is application of a living organism as biological sensing element. In the first type of biosensor the morphology of cell is evaluated using image processing methods known as videometry. In the second type of biosensors the electrical impedance of cells using an improved version <b>of</b> the <b>ECIS</b> (Electric Cell-substrate Impedance Sensing) method is a measure of toxicity effects. The results of experiments with biosensors using videometry and a proposal for improvements <b>of</b> <b>ECIS</b> based biosensors are included in the paper...|$|R

40|$|An on-line and {{continuous}} technique based on electric cell substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) {{was developed for}} measuring the concentration and time response function of fibroblastic V 79 cells exposed to toxicants. Mercury chloride (HgCl 2), cadmium chloride (CdCl 2), benzalkonium chloride (BAK), sodium arsenate (Na 2 HAsO 4), and trinitrobenzene (TNB) were used as five test models. The first four chemicals {{serve as a model}} for acute toxicants, and TNB represents a model for long-term cytotoxicity effects. Adhesion, spreading, and proliferation of V 79 fibroblastic cells cultured on a microarray of small gold electrodes precoated with fibronectin were detected as resistance changes. The response function was derived to reflect the resistance change as a result of cell attachment, spreading, mitosis and cytotoxicity effect. Exposure of V 79 cells to toxicants led to alterations in cell behavior, and therefore, chemical cytotoxicity was easily screened by measuring the response function of the attached and spread cells in the presence of inhibitor. The half inhibition concentration, the required concentration to achieve 50 % inhibition, was obtained from the response function to provide dynamic information about cytotoxicity during the course of the assay. A simple mathematical model was developed to describe the responses <b>of</b> <b>ECIS</b> that were related to the adhesion, spreading, and proliferation of V 79 fibroblastic cells. The novel results of this paper are mainly characterized by the systematic study of several parameters including the cell number, detection limit, sensor sensitivity, and cytotoxicity, and they may motivate further research and study <b>of</b> <b>ECIS</b> sensors.
