5|$|Jones had {{previously}} codirected AJ Goes to France, a 2006 live-action independent film that also has Thompson {{as the leading}} actor. It was produced as an assignment for Concordia College in Moorhead, Minnesota, where Jones majored in film. Jones had moved from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, to Minneapolis in 2005, after he graduated from Fargo South High School. For AJ's Infinite Summer, Jones was inspired by his hometown, {{as well as the}} comics he drew that featured AJ and his other friends, Danny Davy and Morgan. Additionally, the character of Peter is based on Greg Carlson, Jones' professor from Concordia and also a film director and a critic for the High Plains Reader. Secret Cities, a Fargo-based band in which Jones' friends play, provided the score <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> Jones found it excellent that both his friends and his friend's band were allowed by the network to do work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1930 the Navy ordered nine aircraft, {{designated}} the PH-1, which were fitted with more powerful engines and a partly enclosed cockpit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b> <b>The</b> Coast Guard later ordered seven PH-2 aircraft, {{similar to the}} PH-1 but with armament removed, and seven PH-3 units with armament reinstated and a fully enclosed cockpit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Smoking Man {{is portrayed}} by Canadian actor William B. Davis. When Davis first {{received}} the role, the character was written {{as an extra}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> episode.

Davis never received an award for his portrayal alone, but he was nominated for ensemble awards.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the He 111 A-L {{initially}} had a conventional stepped cockpit, {{with a pair of}} windscreen-like panels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and co-pilot. The He 111P and subsequent production variants were fitted with fully glazed cockpits and a laterally asymmetric nose, with the port side having the greater curvature <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> offsetting the bombardier to starboard. The resulting stepless cockpit, which was a feature on a number of German bomber designs during the war years in varying shapes and formats, no longer had the separate windscreen panels <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> Pilots had to look outside through the same bullet-like glazing that was used by the bombardier and navigator. The pilot was seated on the left and the navigator/bomb aimer on the right. The navigator went forward to the prone bomb-aiming position or could tilt his chair to one side, to move into the rear of the aircraft. There was no cockpit floor below the pilot's feet—the rudder pedals being on arms—giving very good visibility below. Sliding and removable panels were manufactured into the nose glazing to allow the pilot, navigator and or bomb aimer to exit the aircraft quickly, without a time-consuming retreat into the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|By August 1977, discussions {{had been}} held with the main cast from The Original Series, {{as well as some}} of the actors who had played {{recurring}} characters. While none had been signed at the time, Roddenberry expressed confidence that they could do so with the exception of Leonard Nimoy, who had stated that he would not return to television. However, Nimoy said separately that the first offer he received from Roddenberry for Phase II was only <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and then guaranteed appearances in two out of every 11 episodes that followed, which he rejected. Nimoy and Roddenberry were not on good terms, following a legal suit launched by the actor against Paramount over merchandising rights featuring his likeness; Roddenberry had refused to support Nimoy in the case. There was also a problem with the return of William Shatner: owing to the pay he was to receive <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and the first thirteen episodes, the network wanted a contingency plan to replace him afterwards. Shatner was aware at the time that the plan was either to reduce his appearances after the initial episodes and reduce his ongoing fees, or to kill off the character permanently if he refused the pay cut. Negotiations began with Shatner on June 10, but it was not until September 12 that his return was announced.|$|E
5|$|He {{decided to}} set the series in a fictional town of Dillon, Texas, with some {{characteristics}} of Odessa. The football team was given the Panthers name. Berg deliberately carried elements from the film to the series, particularly <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> which was {{closely related to the}} film. He cast Connie Britton as the wife of head coach Eric Taylor, and Brad Leland as Buddy Garrity, a major businessman and football booster, in roles similar to those they played in the film.|$|E

5|$|On-set computer-generated effects <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> {{were done}} by Thomas Special Effects. Certain scenes, because {{of time and}} money, had to be created digitally. The opening {{sequence}} showing {{the destruction of the}} water tower by a meteor was created on the computer. A persistent problem during production was the lack of cornfields. As realistic corn was a necessity for a show based in Kansas, this became a problem for the filmmakers. Over 10,000 stalks of corn were grown in a greenhouse <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> but they only grew two feet high, which was not usable to the crew. The day the crew was filming the scene for Clark's landing there were no cornfields in the surrounding area. The cornfields had to be digitally added. Digital corn was a common substitute for the undersized corn that was grown, but for scenes where digital corn was not an option, six hundred stalks of fake corn were flown in from a manufacturer in Arizona. Other digital effects include the flattened cornfield where Lex was caught in a meteorite blast. Some scenes required physical effects, instead of computer imagery. When Lex drives his car off a bridge and hits Clark, the stunt performer, who doubled as Wolverine in the film X-Men, was literally hit by the car as it went over the bridge.|$|E
5|$|Production <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> {{took place}} almost entirely in Los Angeles to {{accommodate}} Joss Whedon's schedule, {{while the rest}} of the series is primarily filmed in Culver City, California. Additional filming has also taken place around the world, including in Paris, France, Stockholm, Sweden, and Old San Juan, Puerto Rico. The series is filmed on Arri Alexa cameras, with David Boyd serving as director of photography on the pilot, and Feliks Parnell, Jeff Mygatt, and Allan Westbrook doing so throughout the rest of the series. Garry Brown is the second unit director for the series, with stunts coordinated by Tanner Gill. The series is filmed in 2K resolution.|$|E
5|$|The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., premiered on the Fox network at 8:00pm on Friday, August 27, 1993, with {{a two-hour}} pilot movie.

Brisco's ratings <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and first episode were high, particularly with the demographic of adults aged 18–49. The series was aired in Canada, including on Global Toronto (channel 29).|$|E
