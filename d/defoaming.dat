Recycling practices also can decrease the environmental and economical impact of manufacturing the materials from virgin resources, which reduces the overall carbon footprint of industrial materials and processes. This study examined the use of waste materials such as crushed glass, ground tire rubber, and recycled aggregate in concrete. Compressive strength and elastic modulus were the primary parameters of interest. Results demonstrated that ground tire rubber introduced significant amounts of air into the mix and adversely affected the strength. The introduction of a defoamer was able to successfully remove part of the excess air from the mix, but the proportional strength improvements were not noted implying that air left in the <b>defoamed</b> mixture had undesirable characteristics.

40|$|Aqueous foam {{concentrate}} (AFC) 380 foam {{was developed by}} Sandia National Laboratory as a blast mitigation foam for unexploded ordnance (UXO) and its ''engineered foam structure'' {{is reported to be}} able to ''envelop chemical or biological aerosols'' [1]. It is similar to commercial fire-fighting foams, consisting mostly of water with small amounts of two alcohols, an ether and surfactant. It also contains xanthan gum, probably, to strengthen the foam film and delay drainage. The concentrate is normally diluted in a 6 : 94 ratio with water for foaming applications. The diluted solution is normally foamed with air to an expansion factor of about 100 (density 0. 01 g/cc), which is called ''dry'' foam. Higher density foam (0. 18 > {rho} > 0. 03 g/cc) was discovered which had quite different characteristics from ''dry'' foam and was called ''wet'' foam. Some characterization of these foams has also been carried out, but the major effort described in this document is the evaluation, at the small and medium scale, of chemical, mechanical and thermal approaches to <b>defoaming</b> AFC 380 foam. Several chemical approaches to <b>defoaming</b> were evaluated including oxidation and precipitation of the xanthan, use of commercial oil-emulsion or suspension defoamers, pH modification, and cation exchange with the surfactant. Of these the commercial defoamers were most effective. Two mechanical approaches to <b>defoaming</b> were evaluated: pressure and foam rupture with very fine particles. Pressure and vacuum techniques were considered too difficult for field applications but high surface area silica particles worked very well on dry foam. Finally simple thermal techniques were evaluated. An order-disorder transition occurs in xanthan solutions at about 60 C, which may be responsible for the effectiveness of hot air as a defoamer. During <b>defoaming</b> of 55 gallons of foam with hot air, after about 70 % of the AFC 380 foam had been defoamed, the effectiveness of hot air was dramatically reduced. Approximately 15 gal of residual foam containing mostly small bubbles was resistant to further <b>defoaming</b> by methods that had been effective on the original, dry foam.

40|$|AbstractFoam is a {{dispersion}} of gas in a liquid {{in which the}} distances between the gas bubbles are very small. Foams are frequently generated {{in the manufacture of}} many products as result from the aeration and agitation of liquids, from the vaporization of the liquid and also from biological or chemical reactions. Foams are generally an unwanted product in industrial processes because they cause difficulties in process control and in equipment operation. The most efficient conventional method for <b>defoaming</b> is the use of chemical agents but they contaminate the product. High-intensity ultrasonic waves offer a clean procedure to break foam bubbles. The potential use of ultrasound for foam breaking that was known since many years has been recently reinforced by the application of a new type of ultrasonic defoamer based on the stepped-plate high-power transducers to generate air-borne ultrasound. This defoamer has been successfully applied in several industrial problems such as the control of excess foam produced during the filling operation of bottles and cans on high-speed canning lines and in fermenting vessels and other reactors of great dimensions.

Three candidate antifoam/defoam agents were tested on a laboratory scale with simulated KTPB slurry using the proposed STTPB process precipitation, concentration and washing steps.

40|$|Antifoams {{are widely}} used {{for control of the}} foam {{stability}} in various products (detergents, paints, pharmaceuticals, and many others). A significant progress in the understanding of the foam destruction mechanisms by oil-containing antifoams has been achieved recently. Experiments with antifoams comprising silicone oil and hydrophobic silica showed that the antifoam entities (emulsified globules or lenses floating on the solution surface) easily form unstable oil bridges between the two surfaces of the foam film. These bridges rapidly stretch in radial direction, due to uncompensated capillary pressures at the oil-water and oil-air interfaces, and eventually rupture the foam films. As a result, the foam is destroyed within several seconds by the mixed solid-liquid antifoams. In contrast, drops of silicone oil deprived of silica are unable to enter the foam film surface due to significant entry barriers. In these systems, the oil drops are expelled into the neighbouring Plateau borders (PBs), and the foam collapse is observed at a much later stage of the foam evolution, when the drops are compressed by the walls of the narrowing PBs (<b>defoaming</b> time on the order of minutes and hours). The magnitude of the entry barriers can be quantified by the so called Film Trappin...|$|E
