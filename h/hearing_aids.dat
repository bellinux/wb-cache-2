For the management of sensorineural hearing loss, <b>hearing</b> <b>aids</b> have been used.

40|$|Clinical audiologists at Utah State University {{have been}} using a master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> as a basic part of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> {{evaluation}} procedures. To ascertain {{the usefulness of the}} master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> in predicting patient success with a wearable <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> 20 subjects were given speech audiometric tests under the following conditions: (l) without amplification; (2) with the headset system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> (a system which utilizes chassis mounted microphones and external receivers of the type used with body-worn hearing aids); (3) with the ear-level system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> (a system which utilizes a microphone and receiver mounted in an ear-level <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> case); and (4) with a wearable ear-level <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> which had been previously selected for each subject on the basis of master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> data. Using the ANOV procedure, statistically significant differences α=. 05) were found between the mean speech reception thresholds obtained under the three aided test conditions, but differences were not clinically significant. The mean speech reception thresholds a greed within 4. 0 dB. No significant difference was found between the mean speech discrimination scores obtained in quiet under the three aided test conditions. However, the mean speech discrimination score obtained in noise under the head set system condition was significantly poorer (α=. 05) than the mean speech discrimination scores obtained under the ear-level system condition and also the wear able <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> condition. Differences as specified were 9. 1 percent and 10. 2 percent respectively. Conclusions were that the ear-level system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> and the headset system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> can be used to predict the SRT and speech discrimination score in quiet of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> candidate using a wearable <b>hearing</b> <b>aid,</b> but that the ear-level system of the master <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> should be used exclusively when attempting to predict a patient 2 ̆ 7 s success with a wearable <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> on speech discrimination tasks in noise...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIntroductionHearing {{aids are}} {{prescribed}} to alleviate loss of audibility. It {{has been reported}} that about 31 % of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users reject their own <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> because of annoyance towards background noise. The reason for dissatisfaction can be located anywhere from the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> microphone till the integrity of neurons along the auditory pathway. ObjectivesTo measure spectra from the output of <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> at the ear canal level and frequency following response recorded at the auditory brainstem from individuals with hearing impairment. MethodsA total of sixty participants having moderate sensorineural hearing impairment with age range from 15 to 65 years were involved. Each participant was classified as either Good or Poor <b>Hearing</b> <b>aid</b> Performers based on acceptable noise level measure. Stimuli /da/ and /si/ were presented through loudspeaker at 65 dB SPL. At the ear canal, the spectra were measured in the unaided and aided conditions. At auditory brainstem, frequency following response were recorded to the same stimuli from the participants. ResultsSpectrum measured in each condition at ear canal was same in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. At brainstem level, better F 0 encoding; F 0 and F 1 energies were significantly higher in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers than in poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Though the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> spectra were almost same between good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers and poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers, subtle physiological variations exist at the auditory brainstem. ConclusionThe result of the present study suggests that neural encoding of speech sound at the brainstem level might be mediated distinctly in good <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers from that of poor <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> performers. Thus, it can be inferred that subtle physiological changes are evident at the auditory brainstem in a person who is willing to accept noise from those who are not willing to accept noise...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess whether Internet {{competency}} predicted practical <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> knowledge and handling skills in first-time <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users. Method. The design was a prospective, randomized controlled trial of a multimedia educational intervention consisting of interactive video tutorials (or reusable learning objects [RLOs]). RLOs were delivered through DVD for TV or PC, and online. Internet competency was measured at the <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> fitting appointment, whereas <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> knowledge and practical handling skills were assessed 6 weeks postfitting. Results. Internet competency predicted practical <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> knowledge and handling skills, controlling for age, hearing sensitivity, educational status, and gender for the group that received the RLOs. Internet competency was inversely related to the number of times the RLOs were watched. Conclusion. Associations between Internet competency and practical <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> knowledge, handling skills, and watching the RLOs fewer times may have arisen because of improved self-efficacy. Therefore, first-time <b>hearing</b> <b>aid</b> users who are more competent Internet users may be better equipped to apply newly learned information to effectively manage their hearing loss...|$|R
