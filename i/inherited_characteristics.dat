500|$|Evolution in organisms occurs through {{changes in}} {{heritable}} traits—the <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics</b> of an organism. In humans, for example, eye colour is an inherited characteristic and an individual might inherit the [...] "brown-eye trait" [...] {{from one of}} their parents. Inherited traits are controlled by genes and the complete set of genes within an organism's genome (genetic material) is called its genotype.|$|E
500|$|In 1884, the Swiss {{botanist}} Carl Nägeli (1817–1891) {{proposed a}} version of orthogenesis involving an [...] "inner perfecting principle". Gregor Mendel died that same year; Nägeli, who proposed that an [...] "idioplasm" [...] transmitted <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics,</b> dissuaded Mendel from continuing to work on plant genetics. According to Nägeli many evolutionary developments were nonadaptive and variation was internally programmed. [...] Charles Darwin saw this as a serious challenge, replying that [...] "There must be some efficient cause for each slight individual difference", {{but was unable to}} provide a specific answer without knowledge of genetics. Further, Darwin was himself somewhat progressionist, believing for example that [...] "Man" [...] was [...] "higher" [...] than the barnacles he studied.|$|E
2500|$|A century later, {{the idea}} of order without design was {{rendered}} more plausible by Charles Darwin's discovery that the adaptations of the forms of life {{are a result of}} the natural selection of <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics.</b> For philosopher James D. Madden, it is [...] "Hume, rivaled only by Darwin, [...] has done the most to undermine in principle our confidence in arguments from design among all figures in the Western intellectual tradition." ...|$|E

2500|$|The radical {{shift in}} the {{connotation}} of [...] "genetic engineering" [...] from {{an emphasis on the}} <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics</b> of people to the commercial production of proteins and therapeutic drugs was nurtured by Joshua Lederberg. His broad concerns since the 1960s had been stimulated by enthusiasm for science and its potential medical benefits. Countering calls for strict regulation, he expressed a vision of potential utility. Against a belief that new techniques would entail unmentionable and uncontrollable consequences for humanity and the environment, a growing consensus on the economic value of recombinant DNA emerged.|$|E
2500|$|Mendel {{entered the}} Brno Augustinian monastery in 1843, but also {{trained as a}} {{scientist}} at the Olmutz Philosophical Institute and at the University of Vienna. The Brno monastery was a centre of scholarship, with an extensive library and tradition of scientific research. At the monastery, Mendel discovered the basis of genetics following long study of the <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics</b> of pea plants, although his paper Experiments on Plant Hybridization, published in 1866, remained largely overlooked until {{the start of the}} next century. He developed mathematical formulae to explain the occurrence, and confirmed the results in other plants. Where Darwin's theories suggested a mechanism for improvement of species over generations, Mendel's observations provided explanation for how a new species itself could emerge. Though Darwin and Mendel never collaborated, they were aware of each other's work (Darwin read a paper by Wilhelm Olbers Focke which extensively referenced Mendel). Bill Bryson writes that [...] "without realizing it, Darwin and Mendel laid the groundwork for all of life sciences in the twentieth century. Darwin saw that all living things are connected, that ultimately they trace their ancestry to a single, common source; Mendel's work provided the mechanism to explain how that could happen". [...] Biologist J. B. S. Haldane and others brought together the principles of Mendelian inheritance with Darwinian principles of evolution to form the field of genetics known as the modern evolutionary synthesis.|$|E
60|$|William Rodney was fertile in suggestions. He knew {{of little}} galleries, and select concerts, and private performances, and somehow made {{time to meet}} Katharine and Cassandra, and to give them tea or dinner or supper in his rooms afterwards. Each one of her {{fourteen}} days thus promised to bear some bright illumination in its sober text. But Sunday approached. The day is usually dedicated to Nature. The weather was almost kindly enough for an expedition. But Cassandra rejected Hampton Court, Greenwich, Richmond, and Kew {{in favor of the}} Zoological Gardens. She had once trifled with the psychology of animals, and still knew something about <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics.</b> On Sunday afternoon, therefore, Katharine, Cassandra, and William Rodney drove off to the Zoo. As their cab approached the entrance, Katharine bent forward and waved her hand to a young man who was walking rapidly in the same direction.|$|E

50|$|Multiple {{inheritance}} is {{a feature}} of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can <b>inherit</b> <b>characteristics</b> and features {{from more than one}} parent object or parent class.

In some breeds such as the White Leghorn, broodiness is extremely rare.|$|R
60|$|The {{whole family}} had in some degree that foible which affects people who lead {{isolated}} lives; {{they come to}} think that they are the only people who have their virtues; they exaggerate these, and they conceive a kindness even for the qualities which are not their virtues. Mrs. Mavering's life was secluded again from the family seclusion, and their peculiarities were intensified in her. Besides, she had some very marked peculiarities of her own, and these were also intensified by the solitude to which she was necessarily left so much. She meditated a great deal upon the character of her children, and she liked to analyse and censure it both in her own mind and openly in their presence. She was very trenchant and definite in these estimates of them; she liked to ticket them, and then ticket them anew. She explored their ancestral history on both sides for the origin of their traits, and there were times when she reduced them in formula to mere congeries of <b>inherited</b> <b>characteristics.</b> If Eunice was self-willed and despotic, she was just like her grandmother Mavering; if Minnie was all sentiment and gentle stubbornness, it was because two aunts of hers, one on either side, were exactly so; if Dan loved pleasure and beauty, and was sinuous and uncertain in so many ways, and yet was so kind and faithful and good, as well as shilly-shallying and undecided, it was because her mother, and her mother's father, had these qualities in the same combination.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending to revert to an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring <b>inheriting</b> <b>characteristics</b> of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|R
