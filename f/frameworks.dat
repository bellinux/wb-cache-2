5|$|Originally {{designed}} to create dynamic web pages, PHP now focuses mainly on server-side scripting, and it is similar to other server-side scripting languages that provide dynamic content from a web server to a client, such as Microsoft's Classic ASP, Sun Microsystems' JavaServer Pages, and mod_perl. PHP has also attracted the development of many software <b>frameworks</b> that provide building blocks and a design structure to promote rapid application development (RAD). Some of these include PRADO, CakePHP, Symfony, CodeIgniter, Laravel, Yii Framework, Phalcon and Zend Framework, offering features similar to other web <b>frameworks.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Beginning with <b>Framework</b> V (<b>Framework</b> 5), Selections and Functions {{introduced}} {{only a few}} features - mainly features {{required to}} prevent the office suite from becoming out-of-date.
