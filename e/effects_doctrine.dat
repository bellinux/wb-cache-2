40|$|This comment, through {{comparing}} two representative extra-territorial antitrust {{cases in}} the US and Japan, shows that, {{in the age of}} global supply-chains, competition agencies’ enforcement on conduct overseas (based on the <b>effect</b> <b>doctrine)</b> needs to receive proper limitation. Each competition agency needs to limit its law enforcement to cases conducted overseas, which have direct (and substantial effect) on consumers of the agency’s home country. Regarding this “direct” effect, price-fixing of components conducted in foreign countries would normally be interpreted as lacking in direct effect on home countries to which finished products are exported. Moreover, competition agencies of MNEs’ home countries would normally be advised to refrain from extending protection under the competition law to the MNEs’ foreign subsidiaries since the subsidiaries are entitled to seek protection under the competition laws of respective foreign countries where they are incorporated.

40|$|Deriding {{the state}} action {{doctrine}} {{is one of}} the great pastimes of American constitutional law. It has been described as a shamble and 2 ̆ 2 incoherent. 2 ̆ 2 On its face, the core concept seems straightforward enough constitutional rights are rights against the government. But what counts as the 2 ̆ 2 state action 2 ̆ 2 that triggers the protection of rights seems to shift, maddeningly, from case to case in the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s state action jurisprudence. In this article, I aim to help make some sense of why the state action doctrine has developed as it has by setting it in a comparative and historical frame. It can be useful to think about the state action doctrine as an American response to a generic problem that constitutional systems face: the problem of managing the horizontal effect of rights. If the American response to this problem is distinctive, it reflects the distinctive institutional, normative, and historical features of the context in which it developed. The choices that a court makes regarding when and how rights apply horizontally play important, and varied, roles in the course of constitutional development within a legal system. A court 2 ̆ 7 s horizontal <b>effect</b> <b>doctrine</b> says something more broadly about what constitutional rights are and about the constitutional court 2 ̆ 7 s role in enforcing them. This article offers an overview of the role of the horizontal <b>effect</b> <b>doctrines</b> play in the constitutional development of the United States as well as two other jurisdictions, Germany and Canada. I argue that this analysis highlights how the state action doctrine has functioned as a constitutional containment device in the United States. As applied, the state action doctrine does not extinguish the horizontal effect of rights altogether, but rather ensures that the Supreme Court, rather than litigants, lower courts, or legislators, takes the lead in saying when and how rights apply horizontally. I also argue that the Court uses the state action doctrine to curate the conversation that the Court and litigants have about rights, steering it away from certain difficult and unwelcome questions, such as whether state inaction is ever actionable...|$|R

The Court of Justice extended this principle to include disputes arising under international agreements, where the subject matter falls under European Union (EU) competence.

Consequently, the question arises whether Member States still have proper access to justice under these international regimes vis-à-vis other Member States or the EU, given that: first, they cannot pursue litigation under the agreements' dispute resolution system if the foreign body risks interpreting the agreement, which also forms part of EU law; second, they cannot rely on these agreements before the Court.

5000|$|Mason J restated the {{rejection}} of the narrow view of excise, but noted that the broad view was tempered by the insistence of the Court that there be a strict relationship between the tax and the goods (the criterion of liability approach), and the problem of defining that relationship. He referred to the formulation in Bolton v Madsen, which [...] "has not emerged unscathed from the more recent decisions on s 90"; for example, there was Barwick CJ's formulation of a variety of factors in Anderson's Pty Ltd v Victoria. His Honour notes that section 90 would do very little to add to the powers of the Commonwealth's economic and financial powers, if the States were allowed to circumvent the prohibition in section 90 through the criterion of liability approach. Since section 90 also allows the Commonwealth parliament to granting bounties on goods, it would make little sense for the States to be given the power to burden such production. Thus, overall, Mason J found that the objective of the power, to secure control over taxation of commodities, suggests the broad approach to excise. As for the required relationship, his Honour prefers the substantial <b>effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> - there need not be a strict arithmetical relationship between the tax and the quantity or value of the goods sold, and it is sufficient that the tax affects the price of the goods sold. A deciding factor in this case is the factual matrix. It appears that the fee is [...] "not merely a fee for the privilege of carrying on an activity"; it is an exaction of such magnitude on a step of the production process, and it is a convenient means of applying such a tax.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{expropriation}} under international investment law has traditionally entailed {{situations in which}} foreign investors have been deprived of their legal title to property through formal measures attributable to states. In recent years, as formal expropriations have become rare, if non-existent, the focus of international investment law has shifted to indirect expropriations. In other words, to expropriations which take place through state measures with similar effects as those of direct expropriations, but which measures are not formally aimed to expropriate the property of foreign investors. It follows that {{a large group of}} versatile governmental measures, including measures adopted for environmental purposes have been under the scrutiny of tribunals in investment arbitration. In essence, {{it is a question of}} where the line between non-compensable governmental measures and governmental measures amounting to expropriations should be drawn; also a central theme of this study. In this study the questions framing the concept of indirect expropriation were reflected against states’ climate change mitigation measures. A justified approach by virtue of the ever-growing global environmental concerns and likely increase in states’ climate change mitigation measures following the adoption of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. The focus of this study also contributed to a broader theme in the area of international investment law regarding the balance that needs to be struck between the states’ right to regulate on public policy matters and the states’ obligation to guarantee protection to foreign investors under international investment agreements. From a narrower perspective, the main research question of this study concerned the adjudicative means tribunals may use when determining the scope of indirect expropriation. The two main methodological approaches presented within the scope of this study were the police powers and sole <b>effect</b> <b>doctrines,</b> which were analyzed in detail in the course of this study. The analysis of these doctrines was conducted through interpretation and examination of investment treaty jurisprudence and scholarly writings according to which conclusions were drawn on the contents and applicability of the two doctrines. In accordance with these findings where the sole <b>effect</b> <b>doctrine</b> focuses exclusively on the adverse effects of the state’s measure on the investment of the foreign investor, the police powers doctrine carves out bona fide state regulation adopted for public purposes from the hypothetical scope of indirect expropriation. However, although the approaches adopted by the doctrines seem rather clear, it is far from settled, which one of the approaches should be applied by a tribunal in each particular case. Compelling argumentation exists for the use of either one. Moreover, it is even less clear, how international investment law will interact in the future with states’ climate change mitigation measures. Although environmental measures have gained increasing importance during the last few decades their status within the framework of public policy interests seems, at least to some extent, unresolved. However, a careful assumption might be made on the importance of climate change mitigation objectives as a common concern of humankind. Finally, on the basis of this study, although the <b>effect</b> <b>doctrine</b> does provide a well-justified mean for determining the scope of indirect expropriation, it is for practical reasons that tribunals should favor, although with some case-by-case caution, the use of the police powers doctrine. Through the methodological approach adopted by the police powers doctrine a tribunal is not only able to secure rights guaranteed to foreign investors under the international investment law regime, but also able to ensure the functioning of the international climate change regime. These methodological adjustments will further help investment treaty tribunals strike a better balance between differing interests in investment arbitration. This balance will ultimately enable the international investment law regime to conquer the criticism it has faced in the broader field of international law...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. Modern {{competition}} {{occurs in}} a global market and straddles various state borders. This international dimension of competition law (antitrust law) subsequently raises concerns whether one state can apply its competition rules extraterritorially against an undertaking in another country, when the latter behaves in an anti-competitive manner that, for example, have adverse effects in {{the territory of the}} former. In the context of such extraterritorial enforcement, the concept of the <b>Effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> as created and developed in the antitrust jurisprudence of the United States plays an important role. In this dissertation the issue of extraterritorial antitrust jurisdiction is investigated in an attempt to suggest a suitable basis for assertion of such jurisdiction. The evolution of the <b>Effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> in the United States and its further development and qualification in American Antitrust jurisprudence is addressed as well as its interrelation with the concept of international comity. Thereafter the basis for assertion of extraterritorial antitrust jurisdiction by the European Community is investigated. In this regard the long favoured Single Economic Entity Theory is addressed as well as the development of a form of <b>Effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> by the European Commission which eventually culminated in acceptance of an “Effects/Implementa-tion doctrine” by the European Court of Justice in the Wood Pulp case. It should however be noted that the scope of the extraterritorial application of the competition rules of the European Community is extended by the EC Merger Control Regulation 139 / 2004. Thus, the jurisdictional range of the Merger Control Regulation is considered in chapter 4. It is submitted that although the <b>Effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> is competent as sole basis for exercising extraterritorial antitrust jurisdiction, it has various disadvantages, inter alia that it evokes conflict between states due to differences in competition law and policy and various states interests. Consequently co-operation on a bilateral level is investigated in chapter 5 as a possible solution.

40|$|When the Supreme Court {{introduced}} the “secondary effects” doctrine {{to allow for}} zoning of adult businesses, critics fell into two camps.

Others, like Professor Laurence Tribe, predicted secondary effects analysis {{would be limited to}} sexually explicit speech, and would not threaten the First Amendment. The modern consensus is that the doctrine has, in fact, been limited to cases about sex. Recent cases demonstrate, however, that the impact of the secondary <b>effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> on the First Amendment has been broader and more insidious than generally understood. It is true that courts usually avoid expressly invoking the doctrine in non-sexual cases, instead applying the standard content-neutrality analysis.

40|$|Background: The new {{regulation}} of patients' rights creates {{the right to}} informed consent, which allows accepting or refusing any medical treatment. Also, the patient {{has the right to}} be appropriately informed about a variety of aspects determined by the law. Patient's autonomy has limits. Artificial acceleration of death, euthanasia or assisted suicide are not permitted. The problem is that the law does not define those situations. The law provides the intervention of Ethics Committees when the doctor considers that the patient exposes himself to severe harm or the risk of death which would be avoided. This intervention impinges on patient's autonomy. Patients have the right to request discharge and medical facilities could discharge patients against their will if they do not accept medical recommendations. These limitations on autonomy should be explained because the law apparently makes the distinction between killing, letting die and the Double <b>Effect</b> <b>Doctrine.</b> There is plenty of literature questioning the validity of both. The law fails to regulate part of the medical practice, regarding life and death decisions. A lack of consensus could explain this omission.

Is this coherent? According to Chilean doctrine, it could be coherent under the condition of accepting the distinction between killing and letting die and also the double <b>effect</b> <b>doctrine.</b> The problem is that there is abundant English literature in the realm of moral philosophy to disregard both conditions.

40|$|The “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” {{includes}} what {{is called}} an “individual responsibility requirement” or mandate that all persons buy health insurance from a private company and a separate “penalty” enforcing this requirement. In this paper, I do not critique the individual mandate on originalist grounds. Instead, I explain why the individual mandate is unconstitutional under the existing doctrine by which the Supreme Court construes the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses and the tax power. There are three principal claims. First (Part II), since the New Deal, the Supreme Court has developed a doctrine allowing the regulation of wholly intrastate activity: the substantial <b>effects</b> <b>doctrine.</b> Although commonly conceived as a Commerce Clause doctrine, from its inception this doctrine has been grounded in the Necessary and Proper Clause. In the 1990 s, the Supreme Court developed a judicially administrable test for whether it is “necessary” for Congress to reach intrastate activity that substantially affects interstate commerce: the distinction between economic and noneconomic intrastate activity. Because the individual mandate fails {{to satisfy the requirements}} of this test as understood under existing doctrine, it exceeds the power granted to Congress by the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses as currently construed by the Supreme Court. The mandate also fails to satisfy an alternative to the substantial <b>effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> that was proposed by Justice Scalia in a concurring opinion. Second (Part III), because the “individual responsibility requirement” purports to be a regulation of commerce and cannot possibly be construed as a tax, it is not justified under the tax power of Congress; and, if the “requirement” or mandate is an unconstitutional regulation, there is nothing for the “penalty” to enforce. Neither is the penalty, considered apart from the regulatory requirement, a tax under current doctrine. Third (Part IV), the Supreme Court should not further expand Congress’s power beyond existing doctrine to allow it to mandate that individuals engage in economic activity by entering into contracts with private companies. Such economic mandates are directly analogous to the commandeering of the states that the Supreme Court has held to be an improper exercise of the commerce power. The very few mandates that are imposed on the people pertain to their fundamental duties as citizens of the United States, such as the duty to defend the country or to pay for its operation. A newfound congressional power to impose economic mandates to facilitate the regulation of interstate commerce would fundamentally alter the relationship of citizen and state by unconstitutionally commandeering the people...|$|E

As a result, the phenomenon of cross-holdings, both within and across industries, is not unusual. In cases where the level of cross-holding falls short of joint control, the competition authorities have at times sought to apply the co-ordinated <b>effects</b> <b>doctrine</b> or some variation thereof hoping to lessen potential competition. More recently, the Tribunal has also considered the possible unilateral effects of the acquisition of a minority stake in a rival.

Cross-holdings and directorships are treated in the same way as any other evidence relevant to an analysis of a given merger. However, despite the Tribunal’s willingness to wrestle with various economic theories, the most recent decision suggests that the acquisition of a non-controlling cross-holding in a company may not fall under the analysis of South African merger regulation at all.
