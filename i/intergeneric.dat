5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (<b>intergeneric</b> hybrids), such as Triticale, × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are {{offspring}} {{resulting from}} the breeding of two genetically distinct individuals, which usually {{will result in a}} high degree of heterozygosity, though hybrid and heterozygous are not synonymous. The deliberate or accidental hybridizing of two or more species of closely related animals through captive breeding is a human activity which has been in existence for millennia and has grown for economic purposes. Hybrids between different subspecies within a species (such as between the Bengal tiger and Siberian tiger) are known as intra-specific hybrids. Hybrids between different species within the same genus (such as between lions and tigers) are known as interspecific hybrids or crosses. Hybrids between different genera (such as between sheep and goats) are known as <b>intergeneric</b> hybrids. Natural hybrids will occur in hybrid zones, where two populations of species within the same genera or species living in the same or adjacent areas will interbreed with each other. Some hybrids have been recognized as species, such as the red wolf (though this is controversial).|$|E
25|$|The {{brook trout}} {{produces}} hybrids both with its congeners Salvelinus namaycush and Salvelinus alpinus, and <b>intergeneric</b> hybrids with Salmo trutta.|$|E
25|$|Mead {{became the}} first person ever to create a bromeliad <b>intergeneric</b> cross, {{selecting}} cryptanthus beuckeri and crossing it with pollen {{from one of his}} favourites, billbergia nutans, to produce the first cryptbergia, xCryptbergia Mead.|$|E
25|$|The tiger trout is an <b>intergeneric</b> hybrid {{between the}} brook trout and the Eurasian brown trout (Salmo trutta). Tiger trout occur very rarely naturally, but are {{sometimes}} artificially propagated. Such crosses {{are almost always}} reproductively sterile. They are popular with many fish-stocking programs because they can grow quickly, and may help keep rough fish populations in check due to their highly piscivorous (fish-eating) nature.|$|E
25|$|Aronia is a genus of {{deciduous}} shrubs, the chokeberries, in {{the family}} Rosaceae native to eastern North America and most commonly found in wet woods and swamps. The genus is usually considered to contain two or three species, {{one of which is}} naturalized in Europe. A fourth form that has long been cultivated under the name Aronia is now considered to be an <b>intergeneric</b> hybrid, Sorbaronia mitschurinii.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, C. V. Morton {{pointed out}} that, as A.pinnatifidum had {{been shown to}} arise from {{hybridization}} between walking fern and mountain spleenwort, it would constitute an <b>intergeneric</b> hybrid if walking fern {{was placed in the}} genus Camptosorus (as Camptosorus rhizophyllus). The hybrid genus ×Asplenosorus had been published, but Morton noted that it lacked a Latin diagnosis and was therefore invalid under the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature; he preferred to continue recognizing Asplenium pinnatifidum in Asplenium. The ICBN's rules were relaxed in 1972, and in 1974, John Mickel published Asplenosorus pinnatifidus as a new combination for the species to allow the continued recognition of Camptosorus. Since then, phylogenetic studies have shown that Camptosorus nests within Asplenium, and current treatments do not recognize it as a separate genus.|$|E
2500|$|Fairyflies exhibit {{considerable}} {{variation in}} their wing shapes {{in comparison to}} other chalcid wasps. The fully developed (macropterous) wings of fairyflies are normally flat with rounded tips and are several times longer than they are wide. These kinds of wings usually exhibit interspecific and <b>intergeneric</b> variation {{in terms of the}} length to width ratio and the shape of the wing outline (especially of the tips and the rear margins) of the forewings. In some species the forewings are relatively wide, like in the genus Paranaphoidea which have forewings only {{two and a half times}} as long as they are wide. In other species, the forewings are extremely narrow, like in Cleruchus bicilliatus whose forewings are about thirty times as long as they are wide.|$|E
