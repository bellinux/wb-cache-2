50|$|It is {{also known}} as {{impression}} die forging. Impressions are made in a pair of dies. These impressions are transferred to the work piece during deformation. A small gap between the dies called flash gutter is provided so that the excess metal can flow into the gutter and form a flash. Flash has got a very important role during deformation of the work piece inside the die cavity. Due to high length to thickness ratio of the flash gutter, friction in the gap is very high. Due to this the material in the flash gap is subjected to high pressure. There is high resistance to flow. This in turn promotes effective filling of the die cavity. In hot forging, the flash cools faster as a result of it being smaller in size. This enhances the resistance of the flash material to <b>deformation</b> <b>resistance.</b> As a result of this, the bulk of work piece is forced to deform and fill the die cavity more effectively - even intricate parts of the die cavity is filled.|$|E

In this study, we evaluated the wear and creep <b>deformation</b> <b>resistances,</b> including backside damage, of different polyethylene (PE) materials, namely, conventional PE, cross-linked PE (CLPE), and poly(2 -methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) - (PMPC-) grafted CLPE, through wear tests and finite element analysis. The gravimetric and volumetric degrees of wear of disks (3 or 6 [*]mm in thickness) {{of these materials}} against a cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloy pin were examined using a multidirectional pin-on-disk tester. Cross-linking and PMPC grafting decreased the gravimetric wear of the PE disks significantly. The volumetric wear at the bearing surface and the volumetric penetration in the backside of the 3 -mm thick PE disk were {{higher than those of}} the 6 -mm thick PE disk, regardless of the bearing material. The geometrical changes induced in the PE disks consisted of creep, because the calculated internal von Mises stress at the bearing side of all disks and that at the backside of the 3 -mm thick disks exceeded their actual yield strengths.

The bias <b>deformation</b> <b>resistance</b> of multiaxial non-crimp fabrics {{is found to}} be substantially lower than conventional single layer woven fabric due to the unique deformation mechanisms of rotation, sliding and compaction of the fibre tows.
