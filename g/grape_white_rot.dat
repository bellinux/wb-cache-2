40|$|Abstract <b>White</b> <b>rot</b> fungi {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} degrade a wide range of {{xenobiotics}} due to their enzymatic systems. Therefore, the present investigation was aimed at screening ten different <b>white</b> <b>rot</b> fungi for degradation of phorbol esters from Jatropha seedcake (JSC).
