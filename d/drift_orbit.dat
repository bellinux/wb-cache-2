40|$|One {{feature of}} a magnetospheric {{substorm}} is the injection of energetic particles into closed <b>drift</b> <b>orbits.</b> Injections are routinely observed by geosynchronous satellites {{and have been}} used to identify the occurrence of substorms and the local time of particle energization. In this study we examine pitch angle distributions of ion injections in the 50 - 300 keV energy range observed by the Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer Explorers Charge Composition Explorer (AMPTE/CCE) satellite, hereinafter CCE. In a dipole field, all pitch angles follow the same drift shell, but the day-night asymmetry of the magnetospheric magnetic field introduces a pitch angle dependence in particle <b>drift</b> <b>orbits,</b> so that particles with different pitch angles disperse radially as they drift. The effect is known as drift shell splitting. For satellite observations near noon at a fixed geocentric distance, the guiding center orbits of ions detected at small pitch angles intersect the midnight meridian at larger geocentric distances than do ions with near- 90 pitch angles. The ion pitch angle distributions detected on the dayside therefore provide information about the radial distance of the nightside acceleration region. We apply this principle to study ion injection events observed on September 17, 1984, in association with pseudosubstorm onsets. CCE was at 13 hour local time near its apogee (8. 8 R E) and observed a series of ion flux enhancements. Energy dispersion of the timing of the flux increases assures that they are due to injections on the nightside. The flux increases were observed only at pitch angles from 0 to 60.

40|$|Variation of {{the plasma}} {{position}} {{relative to the}} centre of the helical coil winding is a very effective means of controlling the MHD stability and the trapped particle confinement in heliotron/torsatron systems, but improving one of these two characteristics with this parameter simultaneously has a detrimental effect on the other.

40|$|Beyond {{a certain}} heating power, {{measured}} and predicted distributions of {{neutral beam injection}} (NBI) driven currents deviate from each other {{even in the absence}} of MHD instabilities. The most reasonable explanation is a redistribution of fast NBI ions on a time scale smaller than the current redistribution time. The hypothesis of a redistribution of fast ions by background turbulence is discussed. Direct numerical simulation of fast test particles in a given field of electrostatic turbulence indicates that for reasonable parameters fast and thermal particle diffusion can indeed be similar. High quality plasma edge density profiles on ASDEX Upgrade and the recent extension of the reflectometry system allow for a direct comparison of observed TAE eigenfunctions with theoretical ones as obtained with the linear, gyrokinetic, global stability code LIGKA. These comparisons support the hypothesis of TAE-frequency crossing the continuum at the plasma edge in ASDEX Upgrade H-mode discharges. A new fast ion loss detector with 1 MHz time resolution allows frequency and phase resolved correlation between the observed losses and low frequency magnetic perturbations such as TAE modes and rotating magnetic islands.

40|$|Abstract. The {{generation}} of the toroidal rotation due to the radial current torque induced by the charge separation is studied by using one-dimensional multi-fluid transport code TASK/TX. Taking account {{of the effect of}} the <b>drift</b> <b>orbit,</b> the charge separation occurs as long as trapped ions are generated, typically by near-perpendicular NBI. Coupling the TASK/TX code with the Orbit-Following Monte Carlo code OFMC, we have reproduced the toroidal rotation driven by the radial current by the near-perpendicular NBI with varying its vertical injection (poloidal) angle and clarified that the horizontal NBI drives the toroidal rotation most efficiently. By utilizing the radial current torque, we have elucidated that in a steady state the toroidal rotation is determined by the balance among the torque, the viscosity, the friction with neutrals and the loss of momentum due to charge exchange. 1...|$|E

Test particle simulations solving the full Lorentz force show a quasi-trapped energetic particle population that gradient and curvature drift {{around the planet}} via "Shabansky" orbits, passing though high latitudes in the compressed dayside by equatorial latitudes on the nightside. Due to their large gyroradii, energetic H+ and Na+ ions will typically collide with the planet or the magnetopause {{and will not be}} able to complete a full <b>drift</b> <b>orbit.</b> These simulations provide direct comparison for recent spacecraft measurements from MESSENGER. Mercury's offset dipole results in an asymmetric loss cone and therefore an asymmetry in particle precipitation with more particles precipitating in the southern hemisphere.

40|$|Beam ion {{transport}} {{in the presence}} of low frequency MHD activity in National Spherical Tokamak Experiment (NSTX) plasma is modeled numerically and analyzed theoretically in order to understand basic underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed fast ion redistribution and losses. Numerical modeling of the beam ions flux into the NPA in NSTX shows that after the onset of low frequency MHD activity high energy part of beam ion distribution, E{sub b} > 40 keV, is redistributed radially due to stochastic diffusion. Such diffusion is caused by high order harmonics of the transit frequency resonance overlap in the phase space. Large <b>drift</b> <b>orbit</b> radial width induces such high order resonances. Characteristic confinement time is deduced from the measured NPA energy spectrum and is typically {approx} 4 msec.

The instrument heritage consists of GOME on ERS- 2, SCIAMACHY on Envisat and, especially, OMI on EOS-Aura. TROPOMI has even smaller ground pixels than OMI-Aura but still exceeds OMI's signal-to-noise performance. These improvements optimize {{the possibility to}} retrieve tropospheric trace gases. In addition, the SWIR capabilities of TROPOMI are far better than SCIAMACHY's {{both in terms of}} spatial resolution and signal to noise performance. TROPOMI is part of the TRAQ payload, a mission proposed in response to ESA's EOEP call. The TRAQ mission will fly in a non-sun synchronous <b>drifting</b> <b>orbit</b> at about 720 km altitude providing nearly global coverage. TROPOMI measures in the UV-visible wavelength region (270 - 490 nm), in a near-infrared channel (NIR) in the 710 - 775 nm range and has a shortwave infrared channel (SWIR) near 2. 3 μm. The wide swath angle, in combination with the <b>drifting</b> <b>orbit,</b> allows measuring a location up to 5 times a day at 1. 5 -hour intervals. The spectral resolution is about 0. 45 nm for UV-VIS-NIR and 0. 25 nm for SWIR. Radiometric calibration will be maintained via solar irradiance measurements using various diffusers. The instrument will carry on-board calibration sources like LEDs and a white light source. Innovative aspects include the use of improved detectors in order to improve the radiation hardness and the spatial sampling capabilities. Column densities of trace gases (NO 2, O 3, SO 2 and HCHO) will be derived using primarily the Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) method. The NIR channel serves to obtain information on clouds and the aerosol height distribution that is needed for tropospheric retrievals. A trade-off study will be conducted whether the SWIR channel, included to determine column densities of CO and CH 4, will be incorporated in TROPOMI or in the Fourier Transform Spectrometer SIFTI on TRAQ. The TROPI instrument is similar to the complete TROPOMI instrument (UV-VIS-NIR-SWIR) and is proposed for the CAMEO initiative, as described for the U. S.

40|$|Passing alpha {{particles}} in a Helias reactor (major radius 22 m, plasma radius 1. 8 m, magnetic field 5 T) are well confined if only Coulomb collisions perturb the particle orbits and neoclassical diffusion {{is the only}} transport process. In a turbulent plasma close to the beta limit particle orbits can become chaotic and enhanced losses of these particles may arise thus diminishing the alpha particle heating rate. The paper describes the guiding center orbits of passing {{particles in}} the magnetic field of the Helias reactor, where islands of the magnetic surfaces occur at the boundary. Drift surfaces also exhibit these islands, however, resonance surfaces with islands in drift surfaces can also exist inside the plasma. Numerically the rotational transform of the <b>drift</b> <b>orbits</b> has been computed verifying this feature. Using a mapping technique, the long term behaviour of the <b>drift</b> <b>orbits</b> is analysed {{taking into account the}} variation of energy due to plasma oscillations. This leads to two coupled area-preserving maps, which describe enhanced radial transport of particles satisfying the resonance condition. In phase space the anomalous transport occurs along the resonance lines of the Arnold web. The energy of the particles can vary in a chaotic manner if the amplitude of the oscillations is large enough. In model calculations it is shown that resonant alpha particles can be rapidly lost by Arnold diffusion If this loss of alpha particles only occurs at the beta limit, it may help to stabilize the operation point against thermal instability by reducing the heating power. If drift waves contribute to alpha particles losses way below the beta limit, the Arnold diffusion, this anomalous loss is threatening the ignition in the Helias reactor. (orig.)
