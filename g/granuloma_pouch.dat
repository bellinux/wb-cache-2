40|$|As a step to {{investigate}} the pathological physiology of joints, the author attemped to study the absorption of sodium salicylate and carbon black in <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> (Selye) of rats and artificial connective tissue pouch (Terazawa) of rabbits and obtained the following results: 1. The absorption of sodium salicylate in the <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> of rats and in the artificial connective tissue pouch of rabbits is very rapid. 2. The absorption of 20 %-polyvinyl pyrrolidon-sodium salicylate is slower than in the former. 3. In the pouch of the hydrocortisone-protected rat (Selye), the proliferation of the granuloma tissue and carbon absorption in the <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> are inhibited. 4. When the daily injection of 100 mg/kg sodium salicylate is administered intraperitoneally to rats, the proliferation of granuloma tissue and the carbon absorption are slightly inhibited. 5. After the injection of hydrocortisone into the rat <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch,</b> necrosis can be observed {{on the surface of}} the pouch wall, proving that there is a little carbon absorption. 6. Although the carbon absorption in the pouch having remarkable fibrosis is retarded, it can be accelerated by the scraping or washing of the pouch wall...|$|E

Its pharmacokinetic profile in pouch exudate was also examined. Cefpirome showed bactericidal effects and long-lasting bacterial growth-inhibitory effects in <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouches</b> infected in Escherichia coli Ec- 7, and its effects were almost equal to those of the other antibiotics. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa TM- 11 infection, cefpirome was more active than moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime and comparable to ceftazidime. Cefpirome had the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus Smith infection among the five antibiotics, showing bactericidal effects and long-lasting bacterial growth-inhibitory effects. The level of cefpirome in pouch exudate peaked at 1 h after administration, with a value of 16. 4 micrograms/ml, and declined in a pattern similar to that of ceftazidime. When compared in peak level, the exudate level of cefpirome was 1. 8 to 2. 6 times higher than the values of moxalactam, cefoperazone, and cefotaxime.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the role of mechanical tension in myofibroblast differentiation using two in vivo rat models. In the first model, granulation tissue was subjected {{to an increase in}} mechanical tension by splinting a full-thickness wound with a plastic frame. Myofibroblast features, such as stress fiber formation, expression of ED-A fibronectin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) appeared earlier in splinted than in unsplinted wounds. Myofibroblast marker expression decreased in control wounds starting at 10 days after wounding as expected, but persisted in splinted wounds. In the second model, <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouches</b> were induced by subcutaneous croton oil injection; pouches were either left intact or released from tension by evacuation of the exudate at 14 days. The expression of myofibroblast markers was reduced after tension release in the following sequence: F-actin (2 days), alpha-SMA (3 days), and ED-A fibronectin (5 days); cell density was not affected. In both models, isometric contraction of tissue strips was measured after stimulation with smooth muscle agonists. Contractility correlated always with the level of alpha-SMA expression, being high when granulation tissue had been subjected to tension and low when it had been relaxed. Our results support the assumption that mechanical tension is crucial for myofibroblast modulation and for the maintenance of their contractile activity...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} experiments, Selye's <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> {{technique}} {{was applied to}} the study of the effect of host nutritional state on inflammation and the local tissue response. The normal response of well-nourished laboratory rats fed a diet containing 28 % protein to the injection of 1 % croton oil into a preformed subcutaneous air sac involved the accumulation of hemorrhagic exudate in the pouch lumen and the progressive thickening of the pouch wall, with the proliferation and maturation of fibroblasts and the eventual laying-down of collagen. In malnourished animals, fed a diet containing only 3 – 4 % protein but adequate in all other nutrients, the above reactions were inhibited. This inhibitory effect was encountered after a relatively short period of deficiency and became more marked as the deficiency progressed. No consistent, clear-cut difference was seen in the leukocytic or neutrophilic response between the two dietary groups after the injection of 1 % croton oil. A significantly higher proportion of accidental bacterial infections was found in the pouches of malnourished animals than in those of well-nourished animals. This was considered to be a possible consequence of the depressed inflammatory response in malnourished rats. The advantages of the <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> as an experimental procedure for the study of local reactions to different noxae, and the influence of malnutrition on these reactions have been discussed and suggestions for future studies presented...|$|E

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{influence}} of inducible cephalosporinase on levels of secondarily administered beta-lactam antibiotics in exudates using experimentally infected rat <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouches.</b> Cefoperazone or cefmetazole was administered intramuscularly at a dose of 100 mg/kg of body weight to rats at 2 and 8 h after infection of rat pouches with Serratia marcescens W- 24, which possesses an inducible type I beta-lactamase (cephalosporinase). Subsequently, cefotaxime or cefbuperazone was administered at an intravenous dose of 100 mg/kg to rats at 24 h postinfection. Levels of cefotaxime in the pouch exudates of the cefmetazole-pretreated group were lower {{than those in the}} control group, which was infected but not pretreated with antibiotics. This was due to the inactivation of cefotaxime by extracellular cephalosporinase which was induced by cefmetazole and which remained in the rat pouches. However, cefotaxime concentrations were not reduced in the cefoperazone-pretreated group because of the low inducibility of cefoperazone against cephalosporinase production. On the other hand, cefbuperazone concentrations were similar in all groups (control, cefoperazone pretreated, and cefmetazole pretreated), because cefbuperazone is more stable against this enzyme than cefotaxime is. In conclusion, concentrations of secondarily administered beta-lactam antibiotics are affected by inducibly produced cephalosporinase at the infection site when a good inducer like cefmetazole is administered beforehand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Ardisia crispa (Myrsinaceae) {{is used in}} {{traditional}} Malay medicine to treat various ailments associated with inflammation, including rheumatism. The plant’s hexane fraction was previously shown to inhibit several diseases associated with inflammation. As {{there is a strong}} correlation between inflammation and angiogenesis, we conducted the present study to investigate the anti-angiogenic effects of the plant’s roots in animal models of inflammation-induced angiogenesis. Methods We first performed phytochemical screening and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) fingerprinting of the hexane fraction of Ardisia crispa roots ethanolic extract (ACRH) and its quinone-rich fraction (QRF). The anti-inflammatory properties of ACRH and QRF were tested using the Miles vascular permeability assay and the murine air <b>pouch</b> <b>granuloma</b> model following oral administration at various doses. Results Preliminary phytochemical screening of ACRH revealed the presence of flavonoids, triterpenes, and tannins. The QRF was separated from ACRH (38. 38 % w/w) by column chromatography, and was isolated to yield a benzoquinonoid compound. The ACRH and QRF were quantified by HPLC. The LD 50 value of ACRH was 617. 02 [*]mg/kg. In the Miles vascular permeability assay, the lowest dose of ACRH (10 [*]mg/kg) and all doses of QRF significantly reduced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) -induced hyperpermeability, when compared with the vehicle control. In the murine air <b>pouch</b> <b>granuloma</b> model, ACRH and QRF both displayed significant and dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effects, without granuloma weight.

When 35 S labeled ChS was injected into the <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch,</b> radioactivity of the organs per gram tissue was high in the kidney, liver, bone marrow and spleen, in descending order. The maximum activity was seen 12 to 24 hours after injection, which is slow compared to the results obtained by KISHIDA in intraperitoneal and oral administration. 2. The absorption of Ch S-Fe by pouch where the iron is enveloped by the large ChS molecule, is slower than that of ferric ammonium citrate, an inorganic compound. 3. The uptake of Fe from the blood by bone marrow is larger when the increase of blood Fe ion concentration is slow, rater than when the increase is rapid. 4.

Objectives: The present study was undertaken to compare the anti-inflammatory activity of 50 % ethanolic extract of LPG (LPGE) and LPE (LPEE) in rats and safety in mice. Materials and Methods: LPGE and LPEE were given orally, administered either just before or 60 min before experiment on mice and for 7 days to rats. Paw edema was induced by carrageenan (acute) and formalin (sub-acute), whereas <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> (sub-acute) was induced by turpentine in rats. Results: Both LPGE and LPEE (1. 0 g/kg) at 3 h after their administration showed inhibition of formalin-induced paw edema by 46. 2 % and 44. 3 % (P < 0. 001) and carrageenan-induced paw edema by 53. 9 % and 60. 4 % (P < 0. 001), respectively. After 7 days of treatment, both LPGE and LPEE showed 26. 3 % (P < 0. 01) and 32. 5 % (P < 0. 05) inhibition, respectively, against formalin-induced paw edema, and reduced weight of turpentine-induced <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> by 42. 8 % and 36. 1 % (P < 0. 001), and volume of exudates by 31. 2 % and 36. 2 % (P < 0. 001), respectively.

CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study indicate that PSE possesses anti-inflammatory activity and thus lend pharmacological credence to the suggested use of the plant as a natural remedy in the treatment, management and/or control of inflammatory conditions in some rural communities of Nigeria.

40|$|Two Bacteroides fragilis {{neuraminidase}}-deficient mutants {{were used}} to study the role of neuraminidase activity in growth of B. fragilis in tissue culture monolayers (CHO cells) and in the in vivo rat <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch.</b> The nanH structural gene for neuraminidase was cloned from B. fragilis TM 4000 and was used to create two isogenic strains with chromosomal disruptions at the nanH gene. B. fragilis VRC 404 contains an insertion flanked by disrupted copies of the nanH gene, and B. fragilis VRC 426 contains a deletion of {{a significant portion of}} nanH coding sequences. The insertion mutant VRC 404 is capable of reverting to nanH+. It grew as well as the wild type in CHO monolayers. However, between 48 and 72 h after infection, the bacterial population was enriched with nanH+ bacterial cells (10 to 20 %). In the rat pouch 48 h after infection, more than 90 % of the population sampled had become nanH+. The deletion mutant VRC 426 showed a severe growth defect in the rat pouch model. In addition, VRC 426 was efficiently outgrown by the wild type in competition experiments, even when the mutant was present at 10 times the number of wild-type cells at the time of infection. A common characteristic of both model systems is a drastic decrease in the free glucose concentration 16 to 24 h postinfection. We suggest that neuraminidase activity may be required for B. fragilis to grow to maximal levels in the tissue culture and rat pouch systems by making other carbon sources available after glucose levels are reduced...|$|E
40|$|Infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are an {{important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in hospital patients. Moreover, increased incidences of outpatient MRSA have been recently reported. This study investigated the bactericidal activity of dalbavancin, a novel, semisynthetic glycopeptide antibiotic, against methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) and MRSA in the rat <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> infection model. A single intravenous dose of 10 mg of dalbavancin/kg of body weight reduced the viable MRSA count in pouch exudates by more than 2 log CFU/ml, and regrowth was prevented for up to 120 h. Comparable results with vancomycin required four 100 -mg/kg intramuscular doses. With one or two doses of vancomycin, the bacterial load declined over proportionately shorter periods of time, followed by regrowth. Reduction of the bacterial load obtained with 100 - and 200 -mg/kg oral doses of linezolid was relatively transient, with regrowth starting at 48 h. A single 10 -mg/kg dose of dalbavancin reduced the MSSA count at 24 h to below the limit of detection, with no regrowth for at least 96 h. Dalbavancin demonstrated good exudate penetration; the ratio of the area under the curve (AUC) in plasma to the AUC in pouch exudate was 1. 01. The in vivo activity of dalbavancin in this model is consistent with the antibiotic concentrations that are reached and maintained for extended periods of time after a single 10 -mg/kg dose and with in vitro data showing that these concentrations are bactericidal for staphylococci. The pharmacokinetic and efficacy data seen in this relevant model of infection suggest that dalbavancin may be administered less frequently than vancomycin and linezolid...|$|E
40|$|Rats were {{depleted}} of skin histamine by {{more than}} 80 % by intraperitoneal injections of sinomenine with daily increasing doses for 6 days. In these rats, egg-white edema induced in the hind paws was inhibited by 68 % of control. The weight of the wall of <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> made by croton oil was also evidently smaller in the rat treated similarly with sinomenine than that of control. This suggests an important role of histamine participating in the inflammation. It has been observed {{that a variety of}} non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibited both degranulation and histamine release induced by compound 48 / 80 of mast cells isolated from rat peritoneal fluid. The degranulation inhibiting actions of anti-inflammatory drugs were markedly decreased in the presence of glucose as in cases of dinitrophenol, dicumarol and warfarin which are known uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation. Also, prevention of edema provoked by anti-rat serum is roughly correlated to a potency of degranulation inhibiting effect of anti-inflammatory agents. These observations suggest that there is a common mechanism between these two phenomena, and the prevention of mast cell degranulation by the anti-inflammatory agents is, at least, partially due to their uncoupling effects. A working hypothesis explaining the process of edema formation at the inflammatory site has. been made based on the data of the present experiment and other ob 3 ervations: a leakage of plasma into the tissue space from the gap between two adjacent endothelial cells which are contracted by released histamine may activate a kinin-forming system in the plasma, and kinin(s) may further aggravate a leakage. The mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory agents, which interfere with the histamine effect in inflammation, should be understood in twofold: one is prevention of histamine release from the tissue, mainly by inhibiting mast-cell degranulation, and the other is prevention of the contraction of endothial cells by their uncoupling activities. </p...|$|E
40|$|NAI- 107 {{is a novel}} lantibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria, {{including}} methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus (GISA), and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). The aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of NAI- 107 in animal models of severe infection. In acute lethal infections induced with a penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae strain in immunocompetent mice, or with MRSA, GISA, and VRE strains in neutropenic mice, the 50 % effective dose (ED 50) values of NAI- 107 were comparable or lower than those of reference compounds, irrespective of the strain and immune status (0. 51 to 14. 2 mg/kg of body weight for intravenous [i. v. ] NAI- 107, 5. 1 to 22. 4 for oral linezolid, and 22. 4 for subcutaneous [s. c. ] vancomycin). In the <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch</b> model induced in rats with a MRSA strain, intravenous NAI- 107 showed a dose-proportional bactericidal activity that, at a single 40 -mg/kg dose, compared with 2 20 -mg/kg doses at a 12 -h or 24 -h interval, caused a 3 -log 10 -CFU/ml reduction of viable MRSA in exudates that persisted for more than 72 h. Rat endocarditis was induced with a MRSA strain and treated for five consecutive days. In a first experiment, using 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg/day, and in a second experiment, when 10 mg/kg at 12 -h intervals was compared to 20 mg/kg/day, intravenous NAI- 107 was effective in reducing the bacterial load in heart vegetations in a dose-proportional manner. Trough plasma levels, as determined on days 2 and 5, were several times higher than the NAI- 107 minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). NAI- 107 binding to rat and human serum ranges between 93 % and 98. 6 %. The rapid bactericidal activity of NAI- 107 observed in vitro was thus confirmed by the efficacy in several models of experimental infection induced by Gram-positive pathogens, supporting further investigation of the compound...|$|E
40|$|Hitherto the {{majority}} {{of research on the}} synergistic activity of combined use of penicillins or penicillin and cephalosporin has been centered on in vitro studies rather than in vivo. In order to evaluate the efficacy of combined use of antibiotics, in vivo studies shoud be made. In this paper the synergistic activity of a one to one combination of ampicillin and cloxacillin was studied under varied experimental infection systems {{and at the same time}} some in vitro experiments were carried out. The results obtained are as follows. 1) In a systemic infection system in mice, the combined therapy showed an effective synergistic activity against E. coli infection. 2) In experimental urinary tract infection in rats, the combined use resulted in a marked decrease of viable cell counts in the kidneys. 3) In an infection system using rat <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch,</b> combined use showed a stronger bactericidal activity in the exudate as compared with the results of single use of two penicillins alone. 4) Viable cells counts in the kidneys of mice infected with E. coli showed a marked decrease after treatment with combined therapy, however the single use of each penicillin showed little or no effect. 5) The inhibitory effect of cloxacillin on penicillinase was enhanced by the co-existence of normal rat tissue homogenate. 6) Inactivation of ampicillin by homogenates of mouse kidney infected with E. coli was inhibited by an addition of cloxacillin. 7) The activity of phagocytosis of macrophage was enhanced by the co-existence of ampicillin and cloxacillin as compared with the effect of the existence of each penicillin alone. 8) The uptake of penicillins by E. coli cells was enhanced by the co-existence of other penicillins. The results obtained above showed that the synergistic activity in vivo of the combination use of ampicillin and cloxacillin was effective, and it was suremised that the mechanism of synergistic effect of the combiced therapy was not simple...|$|E
40|$|We have cloned the Bacteroides fragilis TAL 2480 {{neuraminidase}} (NANase) structural gene, nanH, in Escherichia coli. This {{was accomplished}} by using the cloning shuttle vector pJST 61 and a partial Sau 3 A library of TAL 2480 chromosomal inserts created in E. coli. The library was mobilized into the NANase-deficient B. fragilis TM 4000 derivative TC 2. NANase-producing colonies were enriched {{by taking advantage of}} the inability of TC 2, but not the wild-type of NANase+ revertant, to grow in vitro in fluid aspirated from the rat <b>granuloma</b> <b>pouch.</b> Plasmids pJST 61 -TCN 1 and pJST 61 -TCN 3, containing inserts of 9. 1 and 4. 5 kilobases (kb), respectively, were found in the TC 2 derivatives that grew in the rat pouch medium. In B. fragilis, NANase production from the two plasmids was inducible by free N-acetylneuraminic acid or sialic acid-containing substrates, just as in the parental TAL 2480 strain. However, when these plasmids were transferred back to E. coli, NANase activity was barely detectable. A 3. 5 -kb portion of the insert in pJST 61 -TCN 3 was subcloned in pJST 61 to give plasmid pJST 61 -SC 3 C; NANase was produced from this plasmid both in E. coli and in B. fragilis. In E. coli, NANase expression was {{under the control of the}} vector promoter lambda pR and was therefore completely abolished by the presence of a lambda prophage. In B. fragilis, NANase production was inducible by free N-acetylneuraminic acid or sialic acid-containing substrates. By using deletion analysis and Tn 1000 mutagenesis, the NANase structural gene and control region that functions in B. fragilis were localized to a 1. 5 - to 2. 0 -kb region of the insert. A partial nucleotide sequence of the NANase-deficient Tn 1000 insertion mutants allowed us to identify the nanH gene and deduce the amino acid sequence of a portion of the NANase protein. We identified five regions showing great similarity to the Asp boxes, -Ser-X-Asp-X-Gly-X-Thr-Trp-, of other bacterial and viral NANase proteins...|$|E
