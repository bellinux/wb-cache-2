Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher Ideal, and Törnqvist-Theil index number procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91. The data file also includes various <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> subaggregates (see table 1 from Acquaye, Alston, and Pardey, appended below, for details) and the value shares using prices from the current and past period that are required to reconstruct all these indexes for all the spatial units reported in the paper. Documentation of the primary data files constructed by Craig, Pardey, and Acquaye is also available in the file named Index Number Construction The Laspeyres and Paasche indexes are not chain-linked indexes—they use base-period and current prices and quantities, respectively in the calculation. The Laspeyres <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> quantity index uses base period <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> prices to weight both current and base-period <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> quantities, and was calculated as where Pi 0 is the price of <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> i in the base-period, and Qi 0 is the quantity of <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> i in the base-period.

30|$|As a conclusion, our {{proposed}} approach {{suggests an}} efficient alternative procedure to estimate predicted intervals for FR model with fuzzy <b>input</b> and <b>output.</b> As {{a limitation of}} our study, we only focused on fuzzy regression model in the case that <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> {{are assumed to be}} symmetric or nonsymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Therefore, we only considered FRBF Network when <b>input,</b> <b>output</b> and weights are triangular fuzzy numbers and we did not consider another types of fuzzy numbers in this study. Although the discussion of this study is confined to simple regression with one <b>input</b> and one <b>output,</b> it can be generalized to cope with cases of multiple <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> For future studies, more general fuzzy <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs</b> and weights such as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers could be handled with our FRBF Network approach and it could be applied to different FR models.|$|R

The interface provides enough bandwidth for the PCMCIA extension connector which {{was used for the}} network adapter with built-in P-ATA interface for faster data access and online functionality. An advantage of the high bandwidth was that it could be easily used to introduce hardware extensions like the Network Adapter with built-in IDE HDD support or other extensions to extend functionality and product lifecycle which {{can be seen as a}} competitive advantage. In newer variants (like the slim edition), the interface would however offer vastly more bandwidth than what is required by the PlayStation's <b>input</b> <b>output</b> devices as the HDD support was removed and the PCMCIA connector design was abandoned in favor of a slimmer design.|$|R
