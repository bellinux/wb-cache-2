5|$|The {{program was}} open to all {{women between the ages}} of 17 and 35, in good health, who had {{graduated}} from an accredited high school. Successful applicants were eligible for a government subsidy, paying <b>for</b> <b>tuition,</b> books, uniforms, and a stipend. In exchange, they were required to pledge to actively serve in essential civilian or federal government services for the duration of World War II. All state nursing schools were eligible to participate in the program. However, they needed to be accredited by the accrediting agency in their state, and connected with a hospital that had been approved by the American College of Surgeons.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{most likely}} degenerated in 1904, {{after the death}} of his aunt Lenci, when Ion Luca took over his son's inheritance, and aggravated by his father's decision to cease subsidizing him, which left the latter without a stable source of income. He was thus supposed to provide for his mother and sister, until Ion Luca transferred the inheritance resulting from the death of his other aunt Catinca Momuloaia, to his former lover. He also indicated that his father had made him attend the Frederick William University without advancing money <b>for</b> <b>tuition.</b> Some time after returning to Romania, he began attending the Symbolist literary circle formed around the poet and leftist political agitator Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești, who provided the young Caragiale with money and often invited him to supper.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{received}} her elementary school education at Ming De School, {{a school for}} girls founded by her father. She left her hometown in 1923 {{at the age of}} 11 to go to the Suzhou Women's Normal School No.2. This was a boarding school with classes for teacher training as well as for regular high school. Admission to teacher training was more competitive, as it did not charge <b>for</b> <b>tuition</b> or board, and guaranteed a job on graduation. Although her family could have afforded to pay, Wu chose the more competitive option, and was ranked ninth among around 10,000 applicants.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{passage of}} this law, states were {{restricted}} from offering in-state tuition at public institutions {{to students who}} were undocumented. Specifically, if a state allows undocumented students to be eligible <b>for</b> in-state <b>tuition,</b> then residents from other states must also be eligible <b>for</b> in-state <b>tuition.</b> Several states have passed tuition-equality laws by allowing anyone regardless of legal status to apply <b>for</b> in-state <b>tuition</b> if they meet the state's eligibility requirements.|$|R

5|$|After {{her first}} year of {{graduate}} school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and Drosophila, to earn money <b>for</b> <b>tuition.</b> After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate, but in 1934 Carson {{was forced to leave}} Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled Romance Under the Waters. The series of fifty-two seven minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and {{in the work of the}} bureau—a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.|$|E

The school was not terribly innovative in its education methods– it was merely a source of income for the Blackwell sisters. Blackwell's abolition work took a back seat during these years, most likely due to the academy.|$|E
