40|$|The preparation, {{type and}} {{stability}} of <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> solely by solid silica particles has been investigated in detail {{using a combination of}} conductivity, stability, light diffraction, optical microscopy and contact angle measurements. The wettability of the particles in situ at the oil-water interface {{plays a major role in}} such systems. The stability of aqueous colloidal dispersions in the presence of various electrolytes and over a range of pH is shown to be important in determining the stability of toluene-in-water emulsions formed from them. Partial flocculation of the silica dispersions enhances the emulsion stability whereas strong flocculation results in unstable emulsions. Inversion of emulsion type occurs via two mechanisms. Catastrophic inversion of water-in-oil <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by hydrophobic silica particles occurs upon increasing the volume fraction of water in the system. Transitional inversion of emulsions at fixed volume fraction of water has been achieved by varying the mass fraction of hydrophilic (or hydrophobic) particles in systems containing particle mixtures. Neither inversion mechanism exhibits hysteresis, in contrast to surfactant-stabilised systems. The energy of attachment of a particle to the oil-water interface is shown to be dependent on the contact angle and the interfacial tension. The contact angle was varied by changing the hydrophobicity of the silica particles. Particles of intermediate hydrophobicity were most effective at <b>stabilising</b> <b>emulsions</b> which is thought to be due to the contact angle at the oil-water interface being close to 90 °. The interfacial tension was affected by changing the nature of the oil phase or by'replacing water with various polar liquids. Undecanol-water <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by silica particles of intermediate hydrophobicity break down via gel formation followed by coalescence. The wettability of the silica surface was varied in situ by varying the pH of the aqueous phase. Increasing the pH causes dissociation of silanol groups, which increases the affinity of the particles for the aqueous phase. The type {{and stability of}} emulsions and the contact angle of an aqueous drop under toluene on hydrophobically modified glass slides were measured as a function of pH. The results are modelled using simple theory. The wettability of hydrophobic pigment surfaces is dependent on the type and concentration of added surfactant. The findings are discussed in terms of surfactant adsorption at the relevant interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Colloidal {{particles}} and surfactants are commonly used, either individually or combined, as stabilisers of emulsions and foams. While {{the properties of}} surfactants and particles under a range of conditions and concentrations are relatively well known, there are some areas that require further investigation. The wettability of colloidal particles {{is one of the}} main factors that determine how they behave in a given system but determining the wettability is difficult due to the small size of the particles. The Film Calliper Method (FCM) has been proposed as a simple technique for the direct measurement of the contact angles of micrometer and submicrometer particles in their natural environment. One of the main aims of this work was to develop the Film Calliper Method for measuring contact angles at oil -water interfaces. The FCM was therefore used to measure the contact angles at oil - water interfaces for a range of particles, such as latex and silica particles, in different systems. For the first time directly measured contact angles are linked to the types of <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by the particles. The FCM was also used to directly measure the contact angles of silica particles in cationic surfactant solutions at air and oil interfaces for the first time. The stability of foams and emulsions made with particle - surfactant mixtures were investigated and related to the particle contact angles. Janus particles are a special category of particles which have different properties on each hemisphere. A method for making Janus particles was developed using template silica particles masked with a polymerised Pickering emulsion. The portion of surface exposed for treating can be tuned by controlling the inherent wettability of the template particles as proven with fluorescence microscopy. <b>Emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by amphiphilic Janus particles made with the method are compared with <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by homogeneous particles with similar wettability.

The feed emulsions were characterised for stability, droplet size, ζ-potential and optical microscopy. The microparticles obtained after the drying process were characterised regarding encapsulation efficiency, moisture content, water activity, particle size distribution, microstructure, in vitro sun protection factor and lipid oxidation by Rancimat.

The microparticles produced with the modified starches showed spherical shape without cracks or holes and those produced with only corn syrup showed some holes and cracks that caused lower oxidative stability. Microparticles produced with Hi-Cap 100 and corn syrup/Hi-Cap 100 stabilised by lecithin–chitosan exhibited the highest oxidative stability among the microparticles.

40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} is a {{major issue}} for food manufacturers resulting in alteration of taste and appearance of product. In recent years, the food industry has been facing a tremendous pressure from consumers for using chemical agents to prevent lipid oxidation. In this study a novel approach to reduce lipid oxidation in oil-in-water emulsions has been taken and involves the manipulation of the emulsions' interfacial microstructure. Initially, oil-in-water emulsions were prepared with silica particles. The lipid oxidative stability was improved by up to 50 %, compared with the <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by surfactant. However, silica particles are not “label friendly” hence; Modified Starch and colloidal Microcrystalline Cellulose were used as the “food-grade” Pickering particles. These samples had great stability against coalescence and the oxidation rate was reduced by up to 75 %, compared with the <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by surfactant. The potential ability of fat crystal at the droplet interface to enhance the oxidative stability was also investigated. This {{was carried out by}} <b>stabilising</b> oil-in-water <b>emulsions</b> with saturated monoglyceride in the presence of xanthan gum. A bench scale scraped-surface heat exchanger was used to produce these emulsions. Solid fat crystals “shells” were created around the oil droplets by oscillating the temperature during emulsification.

40|$|The {{formation}} of multi-functional thiol materials for “click” reactions in synthetic chemistry has been significantly under-represented due to added {{practices that are}} typically required when working with sulfur-containing compounds. An efficient and facile approach to approach to introducing multiple masked thiols at the surface of polyester dendritic materials is presented, avoiding these difficulties, by utilising a xanthate protecting group. One-pot xanthate deprotection and thiol-acrylate Michael additions from the xanthate-functional dendrimers (generation zero to two) has been accomplished for the first time, using three different acrylate substrates of varying chemistry. The dendrimers were fully characterised by 1 H and 13 C NMR, SEC and either electrospray or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, depending upon the generation {{and nature of the}} end groups. In a similar fashion, this one-pot methodology was extended to prepare twenty different surface functional LDHs via the use of xanthate functional ATRP dendritic macroinitiators (generation one to four) and six different acrylate monomers. Model reactions and kinetics studies showed that the presence of xanthates within the initiator structure did not complicate the ATRP of tBuMA. The LDHs were fully characterised by 1 H NMR and SEC. In the final study, employing one-pot xanthate deprotection and thiol-acrylate Michael addition, four dendritic ATRP macroinitiators with hydrophobic and pH responsive peripheral functionalities were prepared. Polymeric surfactants comprised of LDHs and HPDs were synthesised, varying in end group composition using different dendritic macroinitiators, and through the use of mixed initiating system, using a non-dendritic component. O/w <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by surfactants comprised of linear polymers, LDHs, or mixed linear polymers/LDHs architectures showed coalescence over a long term stability study under neutral and acid conditions.

Neat BC was esterified with acetic (C 2 –), hexanoic (C 6 –) and dodecanoic (C 12 –) acids, respectively. We observed that C 6 – and C 12 –BC <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions</b> exhibited a pH-triggered reversible transitional phase separation. Water-in-toluene emulsions containing of 60 vol. % dispersed phase stabilised by C 6 – and C 12 –BC were produced at pH 5. Lowering the pH of the aqueous phase to 1 {{did not affect the}} emulsion type. Increasing the pH to 14, however, caused the emulsions to phase separate. This phase separation was caused by electrostatic repulsion between modified BC due to dissociable acidic surface groups at high pH, which lowered the surface coverage of the water droplets by modified BC. When the pH was re-adjusted to 1 again, w/o emulsions re-formed for C 6 – and C 12 –BC <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions.</b> C 2 –BC <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions,</b> on the other hand, underwent an irreversible pH-triggered transitional phase separation and inversion. This difference in phase behaviour between C 2 –BC and C 6 –/C 12 –BC was attributed to the hydrolysis of the ester bonds of C 2 –BC at high pH. This hypothesis is in good agreement with the measured degree of surface substitution (DSS) of modified BC after the pH-triggered experiments. The DSS of C 2 –BC decreased by 20 % whilst the DSS remained constant for C 6 – and C 12 –BC...|$|R

Because of these short time-scales, {{it is difficult to}} quantify adsorption and coalescence during processing. A microfluidic device can be used to measure coalescence shortly after droplet formation in laminar flow, and this device was used to assess coalescence of oil-in-water <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> with dairy proteins (β-lactoglobulin, whey protein isolate, and oxidised whey protein isolate). Different microfluidic designs were used to vary the protein adsorption time prior to droplet collision. Coalescence stability depended on protein concentration (0. 0002 – 0. 02 wt %) and adsorption time (11 – 173 ms) : emulsion droplets were stable at low protein concentrations (as low as 0. 005 wt % β-lactoglobulin), as long as the time allocated for protein adsorption was sufficient (in this case 31 ms). Protein type was also important for coalescence stability: <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> with whey protein isolate were less stable than those with β-lactoglobulin, and coalescence stability further decreased upon protein oxidation. Regarding the effect of pH (3. 0 – 8. 0), coalescence stability was lowest around the protein's isoelectric point. With the coalescence channel we demonstrated the importance of adsorption time and interface composition for coalescence stability at low protein concentrations. Coalescence can be measured at small time-scales and in high detail since coalescence measurements are decoupled from droplet formation. The microfluidic coalescence channel can be used as an analytical tool to gain better understanding of fluid interface stabilisation during emulsification, and to develop emulsion formulations ab initio. </p...|$|R

The sucrose concentration affected neither the polysaccharide concentration above which depletion flocculation occurred, nor the elastic modulus and maximum linear strain of the emulsion gels formed. Furthermore, only a minor change in size of dextran molecules was measured over the range of sucrose concentrations studied. From this we deduce that the depletion potential between the oil droplets was not significantly affected by addition of sucrose. However, the sucrose concentration did affect the rate of macroscopic phase separation, which could be attributed to a larger viscosity and density of the aqueous phase.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{utilization}} of physico-chemical interactions between natural polyphenols and biocompatible polymers to design novel materials and complex colloidal dispersions and emulsions. These usually unwanted interactions and the resulting insoluble complexes are important {{in the creation of}} structures that could potentially be used in the design of novel foodstuffs. The theme of this thesis is therefore the interactions of polyphenols with polymers and emulsion stability and properties. The results are as follows. Chapter 3 presents a study on the interaction of polymer-polyphenol and the fabrication of new colloidal particles using the self-association of polymer-polyphenol complexes. The phase diagram of the physical appearance of mixtures of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) with catechins and tannic acid has been explored and we have characterized the different structures by using a combination of light microscopy, UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering techniques. The molar ratio between polymers and polyphenols has been found {{to play an important role}} in defining the structure of the complexes and their stability. By further optimizing the reaction conditions it is possible to obtain various structures resulting in colloids, microgels, and macroscopically gelled interfaces, which find applications in emulsion stabilization as explored in the following chapters. In Chapter 4 emulsification techniques and consideration on emulsion stability and formulation are investigated. Novel biodegradable surfactant free emulsions stabilized by non-covalently associated micro-gel particles made from PVP and TA have been successfully prepared. The strong interaction between PVP and TA, driven by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonding between phenolic and pyrrolidinone rings, leads to formation of microgels during the emulsification process. The molar ratio between TA and PVP was found to play an important role in determining the mechanism of emulsion stabilisation. At low molar ratio a shell of PVP-TA microgels is formed and over time wrinkles have been observed on these shells, while at high molar ratio [TA]/[PVP] we observe Pickering <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by microgel particles and the continuous phase is a dispersion of microgel particles. The structure and stability of the systems have been investigated by light scattering, confocal and light transmission microscopy. The presence of TA leads to halochromism of the emulsions at high pH and the absence of surfactants makes these emulsions particularly desirable in terms of biodegradability. Chapter 5 focuses on the rheological properties of <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by gel particles and on the relationship between oil volume fraction and rheological behaviour. The rheological properties of emulsions and complex fluids are of pivotal importance in relation to their technical applications. These properties depend strongly on the emulsions composition, oil-phase volume fraction, microscopic droplet structure, and interfacial interactions. Our rheological tests showed that PVP-TA particles <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions</b> behave like flocculated dispersions and polymeric gels confirming the qualitative observation on emulsion gelation observed in the experiments carried out in the previous chapter. Chapter 6 introduces a new technique, microfluidics. Microfluidics devices were designed and built with the purpose of making monodisperse emulsions stabilized by PVP-TA complexes. The emulsions produced with microfluidics devices were found to be monodisperse rather than the polydisperse ones resulting from bulk emulsification processes. The basic theory behind the effect of microfluidic scaling affects the hydrodynamics is outlined. Experimental details on the design process and on how to use photo-lithography and soft-lithography to build microfluidics devices are given. Finally we have demonstrated how our microfluidics devices can be successfully used to make monodisperse <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by PVP-TA and double emulsions (oil in water in oil emulsions). </p...|$|R

The ASPI was {{isolated from the}} green microalgae Tetraselmis sp. by beadmilling and subsequent anion exchange adsorption. The isolate obtained contained 59 ± 7 % (w/w) protein and 20 ± 6 % (w/w) carbohydrates, the latter composed for approximately one fourth of uronic acids (4. 8 ± 0. 4 % [w/w]). In the pH range 5. 5 – 6. 5, in which currently used legumin seed protein isolates (e. g. soy) show low solubility, ASPI retained high solubility independent of ionic strength. In the soluble pH range, the foam stability of ASPI is superior to the foam stabilities of whey protein isolate (WPI) and egg white albumin (EWA). At pH 7, ASPI stabilized foams are 1. 7 times more stable than WPI stabilized foams. Further fractionation of APSI results in foams even 3 times more stable than WPI stabilized foams. In addition, <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> with ASPI are stable against droplet aggregation around pH 5 at low ionic strength, while <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by WPI are not stable at this pH. The stability of ASPI emulsions at this pH is attributed to the co-adsorption of the charged polysaccharide fraction present in ASPI. The role of the charged polysaccharides on stabilisation of the emulsions was confirmed by fractionating ASPI into protein-rich and charged polysaccharide-rich fractions. The combination of charged polysaccharides and proteins in ASPI results in good techno-functional properties that are between that of pure proteins {{and that of the}} naturally occurring protein-polysaccharide hybrid gum arabic (GA). It is concluded that ASPI represents an attractive substitute for currently used high-value food protein isolates. Due to the combination of the positive interfacial properties of its protein fraction with the broad pH stability of its charged polysaccharide fraction, ASPI possesses the positive attributes of two types of techno-functional ingredients...|$|R

Furthermore, the physicochemical properties of conjugates such as solubility, thermal stability, emulsifying activity, <b>emulsion</b> <b>stabilising</b> properties, gelling and foaming properties are also analysed. A novel processing technology, spinning disc reactor, could be an alternative process for the production of protein-polysaccharide conjugates, with desirable functionality in different food systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to examine the preparation and characterisation of hexane-in-water <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by clay particles. These emulsions, called Pickering emulsions, are characterised by the adsorption of solid particles at the oil/water (o/w) interface. The development of an elastic film at the o/w interface following the adsorption of colloidal particles helps to promote emulsion stability. Three different solid materials were used: silica sand, kaolin, and bentonite. Particles were added to the liquid mixtures in the range of 0. 5 – 10 g dm− 3. Emulsions were prepared using o/w ratios of 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, and 0. 4. The effect of sodium chloride, on the stability of the prepared emulsions, was assessed in the range of 0 – 0. 5 mol dm− 3. In addition the use of a cationic surfactant hexadecyl-trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as an aid to improving emulsion stability was assessed in the concentration range of 0 – 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cellulose}} ethers in oil-in-water emulsions on stability during storage and on texture, microstructure and lipid digestibility during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion was investigated. All the cellulose ether emulsions showed good physical and oxidative stability during storage. In particular, the methylcellulose with high methoxyl substituents (HMC) {{made it possible}} to obtain emulsions with high consistency which remained almost unchanged during gastric digestion, and thus could enhance fullness and satiety perceptions at gastric level. Moreover, the HMC emulsion slowed down lipid digestion {{to a greater extent than}} a conventional protein emulsion or the <b>emulsions</b> <b>stabilised</b> by the other cellulose ethers. Therefore, HMC emulsions could be used in weight management to increase satiation capacity and decrease lipid digestion.

40|$|In this {{research}} a microstructure approach to reduce sodium levels in emulsion based foods is presented. If successful, this strategy will enable reduction of sodium without affecting consumer satisfaction {{with regard to}} salty taste. The microstructure approach comprised of entrapment of sodium in the internal aqueous phase of water-in-oil-in-water emulsions. These were designed to destabilise during oral processing when {{in contact with the}} salivary enzyme amylase in combination with the mechanical manipulation of the emulsion between the tongue and palate. Oral destabilisation was achieved through breakdown of the <b>emulsion</b> that was <b>stabilised</b> with a commercially modified octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) -starch. Microstructure breakdown and salt release was evaluated utilising in vitro, in vivo and sensory methods. For control <b>emulsions,</b> <b>stabilised</b> with orally inert proteins, no loss of structure and no release of sodium from the internal aqueous phase was found. The OSA-starch microstructure breakdown took the initial form of oil droplet coalescence. It is hypothesised that during this coalescence process sodium from the internalised aqueous phase is partially released and is therefore available for perception. Indeed, programmed emulsions showed an enhancement in saltiness perception; a 23. 7 % reduction in sodium could be achieved without compromise in salty taste (p < 0. 05; 120 consumers). This study shows a promising new approach for sodium reduction in liquid and semi-liquid emulsion based foods...|$|R
40|$|The {{emulsion}} phase formed {{within the}} stomach and duodenum during digestion of a fatty meal has been modelled using two physiological surfactants, the phospholipid l-α-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and the bile salt sodium taurocholate (NaT). Upon dilution of the phospholipid <b>stabilised</b> <b>emulsions</b> with a solution of NaT the bile salt became incorporated into the oil/water interface imparting a negative charge to the droplet surface. The magnitude of the droplet microelectrophoretic mobility for the mixed PC and NaT system was 47 % of that found for <b>emulsion</b> droplets <b>stabilised</b> by NaT alone. But the electrostatic repulsion between droplets was not sufficient {{to account for the}} observed improvement in emulsion stability to coalescence. It is suggested that a residual liquid crystalline phospholipid interface is present imparting a significant steric component to the stabilisation of the emulsions droplets...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the effect of surfactant-polymer {{interactions}} on structure building in shear, rheological behaviour and the characteristics of corn oil in water <b>emulsions,</b> <b>stabilised</b> by triethanolamine oleat (TEAO) with and without addition of sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) have been investigated. Amphiphilic properties of carboxymethyl cellulose acquired by TEAO-CMC interactions and formation of their complex, could be supposed to have an important influence on the rheological behaviour and properties of the emulsions. Viscous characteristics of emulsion continuous phases (water solution of triethanolamine and water solution of triethanolamine and carboxymethyl cellulose) shown triethanolamine carboxymethyl cellulose interaction indicating conformation changes on CMC molecule. These interactions brought about formation of TEAO-CMC complex and its adsorption around oil droplets in the emulsion. The emulsions have shown pseudoplastic, thixotropic or antithixotropic behaviour depending on the oil and emulsifier (TEAO) concentration and addition of CMC. During the flow of emulsions with moderately high oil concentration and high emulsifier content certain rheological effects and building of internal structure by various interaction links were shear induced. Increasing shear action enhanced internal structuration. Resulting network was permanent. ...|$|R
