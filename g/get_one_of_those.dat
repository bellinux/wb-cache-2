500|$|A {{stopover}} in Bombay, India, {{during the}} band's Australian and Asian tour had led Davies {{to write the}} song [...] "See My Friends", released as a single in July 1965. This was an early example of crossover music, {{and one of the}} first pop songs of the period to display the direct influence of traditional music from the Indian Subcontinent. Davies had written [...] "See My Friends" [...] with a raga feel after hearing the early morning chants of local fishermen. Music historian Jonathan Bellman argues that the song was [...] "extremely influential" [...] on Davies' musical peers: [...] "And while much has been made of the Beatles' 'Norwegian Wood' because it was the first pop record to use a sitar, it was recorded well after the Kinks' clearly Indian 'See My Friends' was released." [...] Pete Townshend of the Who was particularly affected by the song: See My Friends' was the next time I pricked up my ears and thought, 'God, he's done it again. He's invented something new.' It was a European sound rather than an Eastern sound but with a strong, legitimate Eastern influence which had its roots in European folk music." [...] In a widely quoted statement by Barry Fantoni, 1960s celebrity and friend of the Kinks, the Beatles and the Who, he recalled that it was also an influence on The Beatles: [...] "I remember it vividly and still think it's a remarkable pop song. I was with the Beatles the evening that they actually sat around listening to it on a gramophone, saying 'You know this guitar thing sounds like a sitar. We must <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those.</b> The song's radical departure from popular music conventions proved unpopular with the band's American following—it hit number 11 in the UK, but stalled at number 111 in the US.|$|E

6000|$|... "We must <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> chaps up {{from below}} next," [...] said Gasper Pold. [...] "Baxter, you can go down and tell one of them his brother in the {{wheelhouse}} wants to see him. We'll catch him on the stairs." ...|$|E

5000|$|Sharron Angle: [...] "“You {{can make}} more money on {{unemployment}} than you can going down and <b>getting</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> jobs that is an honest job, but it doesn’t pay as much. And so that’s what’s happened to us {{is that we have}} put in so much entitlement into our government that we really have spoiled our citizenry and said you don’t want the jobs that are available.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Mr. Van Wyk. You {{would not}} believe it. I couldn't <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> wretches to take the ship out. Not {{a single one of}} the lazy beasts could be induced, and the law, you know, Mr. Van Wyk [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore it {{was that}} on the Saturday he left us after lunch, saying he would go round to that shop and <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> {{cushions}} for his aunt. He {{said he would not}} be long, and suggested our waiting for him.|$|E

"Laurie, my lad, if {{you ever}} want to indulge in this sort of thing, <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> little girls to help you, and I shall be {{perfectly}} satisfied," [...] said Mr. Laurence, settling himself in his easy chair to rest after the excitement of the morning.|$|E
60|$|He was <b>getting</b> into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> violent fits <b>of</b> self-reproach, at once {{genuine and}} theatrical, of which Guy had {{a sort of}} horror, and it was well Mr. Edmonstone broke in, like comedy into tragedy.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Dorothy, {{turning to}} Lady Aurex, [...] "you {{say there are}} other sub-sub-sinking boats. We can <b>get</b> in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those,</b> and shoot out {{to the top of}} the water, like Coo-ee-oh did, and so escape. And then we can help to rescue all the Skeezers down here." ...|$|R
6000|$|He didn't finish. Instead, {{he spread}} his broad wings and flew back towards the nest and Mrs. Hooty. His great wings made no noise, for they are made {{so that he can}} fly without making a sound. [...] "If I once <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Crows!" [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "If I once <b>get</b> hold <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Crows, I'll--" [...] He didn't say what he would do, but if you had been near enough to hear the snap of his bill, you could have guessed the rest.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I can {{understand}} the French position," [...] said the girl, reflectively. [...] "These Germans are very obstinate, and much as I admire Lieutenant Elbl I feel sure that were he able he would fight the French again to-morrow. After his recovery he might even <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> mechanical feet and {{be back on the}} firing line." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish very much, mother," [...] said he, [...] "that I could <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> pond lilies for you, but I cannot. I tried yesterday, {{but they}} are {{too far from the}} shore, and it is so finished, and smooth, and nice about here {{that there is no such}} thing as a pole or a stick to be found any where to reach with." ...|$|E
6000|$|The smile {{suddenly}} {{faded from}} his lips. He {{seemed to be}} listening to the calling of the newsboys down the street. [...] "I don't know what my instructions are going to be," [...] he continued, dropping his voice a little, [...] "but I'm sick of making war the way our chaps are doing it. If ever I'm lucky enough to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> murderous submarines, I can promise you one thing--there'll be no survivors." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Seal {{drew a deep}} breath, {{restrained}} herself, {{and then}} burst out, looking out, too, upon Russell Square and Southampton Row, and at the passers-by, [...] "Ah, if only <b>one</b> could <b>get</b> every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> people into this room, and make them understand for five minutes! But they MUST see the truth some day.... If only one could MAKE them see it...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Looks {{as if we}} were snowed in {{good and}} proper," [...] {{returned}} another man. [...] "I wanted to <b>get</b> to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> stores across the way, and I had about all I could do to make it. In one place I got into snow up to my waist, and it was all I could do to get out of it." ...|$|R

Indeed, the system exists not to provide social mobility but to prevent it and to perpetuate the prevailing social order. Essayist Neal Gabler in the Boston Globe, 2010 ...|$|R
60|$|Just before {{reaching}} the farm where the fat hens and Bowser the Hound were, Blacky waited for Reddy Fox to catch up. It was some time before Reddy appeared, for he wasn't traveling as fast now as when he had started out. You see, that farm really was {{a very long way}} from the Old Pasture where Reddy lives and Reddy had run very hard, because, you know, he was so anxious to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fat hens.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's of no use," [...] said Granny, as {{they started}} back home after the second try, [...] "to hope to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> hens at night. If {{we are going to}} get any at all, we will have to do it in broad daylight. It can be done, for I have done it before, but I don't like the idea. We are likely to be seen, and that means that Bowser the Hound will be set to hunting us." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{once they}} all began {{to fly over}} the top of the tree where they could look down into the nest and there, sure enough, was Mrs. Hooty, her great, round, yellow eyes glaring up at them angrily. Such a racket! Right away Hooty was forgotten, and the whole crowd at once began to torment Mrs. Hooty. Only Blacky sat watchful and silent, waiting for Mrs. Hooty to lose her temper and try to catch one of her tormentors. He had hope, a great hope, that he would <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> eggs.|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{a couple}} of gun-stations I know of not far from here," [...] he said. [...] "I tell you they've got {{armament}} there which will make our friends tear their hair' shells that burst in the air, mind, too, which you needn't mind letting 'em have as quick as we can fire 'em off. I shall try and <b>get</b> on to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> stations myself at midnight." ...|$|R
5000|$|... &#91;...&#93; {{because of}} its both {{political}} and potentially incendiary substance. I'm in a minority as well, as a woman. It {{took a lot of}} courage on their part to hire a woman. I think that right up until the end they were very dubious about it. It's one thing to cast a subordinate Black, Asian or woman, but to put them in leading role means the solid endorsement <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest studios in the world. And that goes for a gay character as well. It requires a terrific social conscience on their part and the pledge of some solidarity and unanimity, which I think is probably at the source of most of this problem to <b>get</b> every <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> executives on board regarding this decision.|$|R
60|$|I heard Bensington also once--in the old days--at an {{educational}} conference in Bloomsbury. Like most eminent chemists and botanists, Mr. Bensington was very authoritative upon teaching--though I am certain {{he would have}} been scared out of his wits by an average Board School class in half-an-hour--and so far as I can remember now, he was propounding an improvement of Professor Armstrong's Heuristic method, whereby at the cost of three or four hundred pounds' worth of apparatus, a total neglect of all other studies and the undivided attention of a teacher of exceptional gifts, an average child might with a peculiar sort of thumby thoroughness learn in the course of ten or twelve years almost as much chemistry as <b>one</b> could <b>get</b> in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> objectionable shilling text-books that were then so common....|$|R
60|$|It {{was just}} at dusk of the {{afternoon}} of the day when Granny and Reddy Fox had talked over a plan to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fat hens that Farmer Brown's boy collected the eggs and saw to it that the biddies had gone to roost for the night. He had just started to close the little sliding door across the hole through which the hens went in and out in the daytime when Bowser the Hound began to make a great racket, as if terribly excited about something.|$|E
6000|$|... "That Mr. Walkirk," [...] she said, [...] "is {{a man of}} a {{good deal}} of {{penetration}} and judgment, and if you could <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> sisters to come here and write for you I should like it very much; and if the first one did not suit, you could try another without trouble or expense. The fact that you had a good many strings to your bow would give you ease of mind and prevent your getting discouraged. I don't want you to give up {{the idea of having a}} secretary." ...|$|E
6000|$|Blacky the Crow {{sat in the}} top of a tall tree {{where he}} could see all that was going on. Blacky was as {{impatient}} as Reddy was patient. [...] "Why doesn't the red rascal rush in and <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fat hens?" [...] muttered Blacky. [...] "What is the matter with him, anyway? I wonder if he is afraid. He could catch one of them without half trying, and there he lies as if he expected them to run right into his mouth. I don't want to sit here all day. Yet I can't do a thing until he catches one of those hens." ...|$|E
50|$|Reub {{was born}} in Lakeview, Oregon on 26 January 1898. His parents bought a ranch in the Fort Rock Valley {{approximately}} one hundred and twenty miles north of Lakeview in 1900. The family’s ranch was so isolated that they only made the 200 mi round-trip to Prineville once a year to <b>get</b> supplies. On <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> trips, Reub bought his first saddle for $13.50 using money he had made trending livestock and selling coyote hides. At the time, he was seven years old.|$|R
5000|$|At {{least eight}} awards for Outstanding Individual Performance are also given out every year. Notable past winners include Michelle Federer, Andrea McArdle, Andy Mientus, Anthony Rapp, Linda Hart, J. Robert Spencer, Tony Sheldon, and Max von Essen. Starting in 2015, awards were also given out for {{performances}} in {{categories such as}} [...] "Outstanding Performance in a Lead Role" [...] and [...] "Outstanding Performance in a Supporting Role." [...] It is unclear how a performance <b>gets</b> entered in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> categories as opposed to Outstanding Individual Performance.|$|R
5000|$|Talman's {{principal}} work is recognised to be Chatsworth House, {{considered to}} be the first baroque private house in Britain, and he was possibly the architect of St Anne's Church, Soho. Talman was held by many to be surly, rude and difficult to <b>get</b> on with. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who felt so was Charles Howard, 3rd Earl of Carlisle, who thus chose John Vanbrugh, not Talman as his architect for Castle Howard; (Vanburgh had also been Talman's replacement as Comptroller of the Royal Works in May 1702.) ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place his plan was working beautifully. You {{know what he was}} after was to get Reddy Fox over to that farm where Bowser was. He hoped that if Reddy should catch one of those fat hens, the farmer would put Bowser on Reddy's trail. He knew that Reddy would {{probably}} return straight home, and Bowser, following Reddy's trail, would thus find his way back home to Farmer Brown's. Of course, it all depended on whether Reddy would catch one of those fat hens and whether Bowser would be allowed to hunt him. Blacky had a plan for making sure that if Reddy did <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> hens the folks in the farmhouse would know it.|$|E
60|$|So Reddy lay flat {{behind the}} old tree trunk, with just {{his nose and}} his eyes showing {{around the end of}} it, and studied what would be best to do. He was sure that he could <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> fat hens, but he wanted more. Early that morning Reddy would have been quite {{contented}} with one, but now that he was sure that he could get one, he wanted more. If he were too bold and frightened those hens while catching one, they would make such a racket that they would be sure to bring some one from the farmhouse. The thing to do was to be patient until he could catch one without alarming the others. Then perhaps {{he would be able to}} catch another. Reddy decided to be patient and wait.|$|E
60|$|Of course Happy Jack couldn't {{understand}} what he said. If he could have, he might have guessed {{that it was the}} mumps that had made Farmer Brown's boy look so like Striped Chipmunk when he has his cheeks stuffed with nuts. But if he couldn't {{understand what}} Farmer Brown's boy said, he had no difficulty in understanding that if he wanted those nuts he would have to go after them. So at last he screwed up his courage and put his head inside. Nothing happened, so he went wholly in and sat on the inside sill. Then by reaching out {{as far as he could}} without tumbling off, he managed to <b>get</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> nuts, and as soon as he had it, he dodged outside to eat it.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon, I presume, {{one would}} first ask, have we {{any chance of}} getting off this ball of ours, and <b>getting</b> on to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> finer <b>ones?</b> Wise people say we have, {{and that it is}} very wicked to think otherwise. So we will think no otherwise; but, with their permission, think nothing about the matter now, since it is certain that the more we make of our little rusty world, such as it is, the more chance we have <b>of</b> being <b>one</b> day {{promoted}} into a merrier one.|$|R
6000|$|... "I did once," [...] replied Peter. [...] "I {{happened}} to be over near where he lives when Farmer Brown's boy came along and surprised Digger some distance from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his holes. Digger didn't try to <b>get</b> to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> holes; he simply began to dig. My gracious, how the sand did fly! He {{was out of sight}} in the ground before Farmer Brown's boy could get to him. Johnny Chuck is pretty good at digging, but he simply isn't in the same class with Digger the Badger. No one is that I know of, unless it is Miner the Mole. I guess this is all I know about him, excepting that he is a great fighter. Once I saw him whip a dog almost twice his size. I never heard such hissing and snarling and growling. He wouldn't tell me anything about how he lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear! {{you have}} {{certainly}} {{got on the}} right side of me. Your aunt always said you had a very persuasive way with you. I'll tell you what we will do. It is now a quarter to ten--late enough, by Jingo! We'll <b>get</b> into <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> confounded taxis, and drive to Doctor Newington's. I'll see him. You shall stay in the cab; and if I can get his permission, we'll go and have a talk with old Rad--or rather I'll talk first and you shall pretend that our joint visit is only a coincidence. As a matter of fact he knew all about the murder before he got ill, and he won't think it at all unnatural that I have obtained special medical permission to question him myself on the subject. Then you must work in your questions about Luke as best you can afterward. Is that agreed now?" ...|$|R
