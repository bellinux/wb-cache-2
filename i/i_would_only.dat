500|$|Ramsey {{had made}} up his mind that he wanted to remain in {{football}} as a coach, but he had no relevant qualifications or managerial experience. While he spent the 1955 off-season coaching in Southern Rhodesia (today Zimbabwe), Ipswich Town of the Third Division South received permission from Anderson to speak to Ramsey about signing him as player-manager. When Ramsey met the Ipswich hierarchy on his return from Africa, he refused to combine management with playing. [...] "I told them <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> concentrate on one job," [...] Ramsey later said; [...] "it would be impossible to play with the players I would be coaching." [...] This settled, Ipswich announced Ramsey's appointment as manager on 9 August 1955.|$|E
500|$|Trump further {{increased}} speculation of {{a full-scale}} campaign when his publisher Renaissance Books announced a January 2000 release date for The America We Deserve. [...] The publisher's press release announced a book tour and teased, [...] "Donald Trump for President? Run or not, Donald Trump's ideas {{will have a}} major impact on the next presidential election." [...] Trump set January also as the month on which he would decide whether to run. [...] He expressed, [...] "I’m not interested in being the [...] candidate who gets the most votes in the history of the world outside of the Democratic and Republican parties, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> consider this if I thought I could win." [...] On September 30, Trump wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal titled, [...] "America Needs a President Like Me" [...] in which he argued that he would be [...] "the kind of president America needs in the new millennium." [...] He cited the [...] "repugnant" [...] comments of Buchanan and Ventura's personal encouragement as factors contributing to his decision. [...] In an October 6 interview on Dateline NBC, Trump affirmed that he was [...] "very serious" [...] about his run.|$|E

500|$|Johnny Loftus of Allmusic {{classified}} [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] as a nu metal song. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters {{concluded that}} the song [...] "take things to a more over-the-top, theatrical level." [...] Scott Juba of The Trades rated the song with A, and wrote: [...] "As far as the band's single, 'Everybody's Fool', is concerned, it is a song about the stinging betrayal of deception and the refusal to become blinded by deceit any longer. There is a defiance in Lee's voice that gives the track a bold edge, and the song's heavy drums and soaring guitars further enhance the strong sound. The band surely has another chart topping hit on their hands." [...] Simon Cusens of ABC Online gave the song 3 out of 5 stars calling it [...] "a cold, sad and angry song that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> like to listen to without it being repeated again." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "rolling acoustic guitar and billowing synthesizers {{pave the way for}} the harsh power chords that open the song" [...] adding that Lee's voice was [...] "disembodied" [...] in the opening lines [...] "Perfect by nature/ Icons of self-indulgence/ Just what we all need/ More lies about a world that/ Never was and never will be." ...|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{has long}} been {{considered}} a fashion icon and regularly appears on best dressed lists. Throughout her career, she has modelled for several high-profile designers, including Miu Miu, H, Louis Vuitton and Chloé. Prior to her career as an actress, she had achieved fame for her unique style. While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny's look. Her interest in fashion and clothing, {{as well as her}} career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer. She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: [...] "Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in one of those little nightcaps!", she told People in 2007. Her unorthodox style (which garnered her initial notoriety in the early '90s) has often been referred to as very eclectic. Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon.|$|E

2500|$|The {{character}} of Preston Burke was originally envisioned as a caucasian, {{to be played}} by Paul Adelstein, who starred in Grey's Anatomy spin-off Private Practice. However, due to his commitment to a film whose shooting dates changed, the actor had to drop out {{at the last moment}} and his character was rethought. Isaiah Washington was originally considered for the role of Derek Shepherd, which eventually went to Patrick Dempsey. Washington later received a callback from Rhimes to play Burke. He commented: [...] "I knew I could never be wrong in my heart about something so good and so genuine. Her writing just seemed very complex, very honest." [...] "I said that <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> do it if I didn't have to be like that guy on that other medical show who was always struggling with his anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Frustrated, {{she left}} Decca and signed with United Artists, where she teamed with the {{producer}} Allen Reynolds, who offered her the creative freedom she wanted {{and helped her}} develop her own style and phrasing. The first album, Crystal Gayle, was released in 1974 and produced her first top-ten country hit, [...] "Wrong Road Again" [...] (number 6). By 1976, she had the first of her 20 number one country singles with [...] "I'll Get Over You", which also became her first single on Billboard's Hot 100 (number 71) and adult contemporary chart (number 40). The following year, she had two more top-2 country hits, [...] "You Never Miss a Real Good Thing (Till He Says Goodbye)" [...] (number 1) and [...] "I'll Do It All Over Again" [...] (number 2), before achieving her greatest success. Gayle recalled what her sister Loretta Lynn had said: [...] "'You record what I couldn't record — you do MOR, middle of the road', [...] "and {{that was the best}} advice I could get. I don't think I ever would have made it if I went down the road and did the music my sister did. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> have been compared to her." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had never heard him speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E

2500|$|Davies felt {{pressure}} to remain true {{to the original}} character of Jo. In an interview with SFX he stated that he watched old episodes of the show [...] "for the first time ever" [...] in planning a story within the Doctor Who universe. He wanted to [...] "preserve the absolute beauty of what Barry Letts and Terrance Dicks did" [...] with Manning's last Doctor Who story, The Green Death. Manning was [...] "surprised at how it all came back" [...] and felt that Davies had [...] "done a wonderful job of showing how Jo has developed over the years". She felt that Jo was still [...] "the young and awestruck girl she was" [...] but [...] "tempered by experience and maturity." [...] Davies expressed his contention that the character had been left [...] "with the promise of happiness, of adventure, of love and joy" [...] {{and it would be}} wrong to interfere with that. At the official Doctor Who Convention 'Panopticon' organized by the Doctor Who Appreciation Society to celebrate the show's 30th anniversary in 1993, Manning was interviewed on stage with Jon Pertwee and insisted that Jo would have divorced Dr Jones, stating [...] "I tell you what, she's left him! The one she went.. no way! She definitely left him. She got half way up the Amazon and said 'this is not going to work'. So <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>only</b> come back if she wasn't still married". However, in the commentary for the DVD releases of both The Green Death (revised edition) and Death Of The Doctor, Manning contradicted this statement, stressing that Jo would never have divorced and would have remained with Jones.|$|E
