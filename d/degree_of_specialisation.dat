2500|$|Although {{deep water}} {{demersal}} fish species are not generally picky {{about what they}} eat, {{there is still some}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation.</b> For example, different fish have different mouth sizes, which determines the size of the prey they can handle. Some feed mostly on benthopelagic organisms. Others fed mostly on epifauna (invertebrates on top of the seafloor surface, also called [...] epibenthos), or alternatively on infauna (invertebrates that burrow into the seafloor substrate). Infauna feeders can have considerable sediment in their stomachs. Scavengers, such as snubnosed eels and hagfish, also eat infauna as a secondary food source.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of these}} wares were widely {{distributed}} and produced on an industrial scale (the largest kilns could fire up to 40,000 pieces {{at a time}} [...] ), and undoubtedly using a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> within the workshops. The names of many potters and factory-owners are known from the potters' marks frequently applied to fine wares, and can be highly informative. Cnaius Ateius was an especially prominent producer at Arezzo, but wares with his stamps can be shown by modern analysis of their clay to have been produced in Pisa in Tuscany, and at branch factories at both Lyon and La Graufesenque in modern France. However, the interpretation of name-stamps can be more complex than it appears at first sight. Bold name-stamps visible in decorated areas advertise {{the name of the}} factory, but the names of individual artisans working within the pottery, the bowl-makers, appear on plain vessels, while the moulds for decorated bowls were also sometimes signed freehand by the mould-makers, and their signatures also sometimes appear on finished vessels. Theoretically, a decorated vessel might bear the mould-maker's name, that of the bowl-maker or finisher (for example, on the rim), and the 'brand-name' of the factory in the decoration. The use of slave labour in the Italian workshops is unproven, though some names are certainly of [...] (freedmen, that is, freed former slaves). The site of La Graufesenque in South Gaul, near Millau, has been extensively studied and excavated. Its products had an immensely wide distribution in the later 1st century AD, and sherds have been found from India to the Sudan and Scotland.|$|E

6000|$|Such facts {{show us the}} {{wonderful}} delicacy of the balance of conditions which determine the existence of particular species in any locality. The spores of mosses and Hepaticæ are so minute {{that they must be}} continually carried through the air to great distances, and we can hardly doubt that, so far as its powers of diffusion are concerned, any species which fruits freely might soon spread itself over the whole world. That they do not do so must depend on peculiarities of habit and constitution, which fit the different species for restricted stations and special climatic conditions; and according as the adaptation is more general, or the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> extreme, species will have wide or restricted ranges. Although their fossil remains have been rarely detected, we can hardly doubt that mosses have as high an antiquity as ferns or Lycopods; and coupling this antiquity with their great powers of dispersal we may understand how many of the genera have come to occupy a number of detached areas scattered over the whole earth, but {369} always such as afford the peculiar conditions of climate and soil best suited to them. The repeated changes of temperature and other climatic conditions, which, as we have seen, occurred through all the later geological epochs, combined with those slower changes caused by geographical mutations, must have greatly affected the distribution of such ubiquitous yet delicately organised plants as mosses. Throughout countless ages they must have been {{in a constant state of}} comparatively rapid migration, driven to and fro by every physical and organic change, often subject to modification of structure or habit, but always seizing upon every available spot in which they could even temporarily maintain themselves.[86] ...|$|E

40|$|Summary: Habitat use of {{a forest}} bird {{community}} was studied in temperate rainforests in South Westland, New Zealand between 1983 and 1985. This paper examines foraging methods, feeding stations and seasonal variations in the availability and use of food types and provides {{a brief review of}} the subject. The forest bird community was comprised {{of a large number of}} apparently generalist feeders and few dietary specialists. However, the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> foraging <b>specialisation</b> should not be viewed only in relation to the food types consumed. The 18 species studied differed from each other in the number of plant species used, their preferred feeding stations and method of feeding. Most importantly, the omnivorous birds exhibited varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> sequential <b>specialisation</b> in their diets as they switched between specific food sources from season to season. The information on foraging provides the first step towards predicting the impacts of logging important food trees...|$|R
40|$|Sharks are {{traditionally}} classified as generalists that use a {{diverse range of}} habitats and prey. While this is an accurate description of some species, sharks exhibit a range of resource use strategies that affect their influence on communities. These strategies also influence resilience {{in the face of}} environmental and anthropogenic effects. Identifying resource use patterns is critical to understanding sharks in aquatic environments. However, despite the rapid increase in studies focused on measuring the dietary and habitat selection patterns of sharks, discussion on how to define the ecological <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> sharks has been limited. This is an impediment to communication and research as definitions <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> and how to measure it vary based on context. This review presents a conceptual framework within which to define the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> sharks that can be applied to different environmental scales and goals. We present examples of species with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> at large and small scales within the proposed context. The effects <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> on population stability are also briefly discussed. Specialists are more sensitive to environmental fluctuations and thus more susceptible to population depletion following environmental changes. Therefore identifying specialised species is key to understanding species vulnerabilities and advancing ecological discussions...|$|R

40|$|My {{research}} study {{aimed to explore}} the pedagogic shifts between working with concrete to more abstract conceptions of number. By using a case study approach focused on a grade 2 (G 2) Foundation Phase (FP) teacher who retained her class into grade 3 (G 3), I gathered data on her teaching over two years (2012 - 13) {{in the context of}} the ‘Lesson Starters Project’ (LSP). In addition, the teacher also participated in another project within the Wits Maths Connect Primary project (WMC-P) which was focused on developing content knowledge related to primary mathematics during 2013. Whilst content knowledge course assessment indicated gains through this year, the teacher’s results indicated gaps in mathematical content knowledge - a feature that literature has highlighted as quite common amongst primary teachers in South Africa and internationally. My focus in this study is on the extent to which this teacher in the LSP professional development project specialised content and modes of representation and showed connections between these aspects. The findings showed that there were varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> content and <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> representations. In other words, the teacher is seen to make the mathematics more sophisticated in conjunction with the use of a variety of representations or strategies.

40|$|The Yellow River, one of {{the very}} few in the Earth, {{originated}} from many dispersive palaeolakes. Taking this unique advantage, we examined the roles of palaeolake isolation vs. geological processes vs. climate in determining current fish biogeographic pattern. We reviewed available data on fish species and their geographical distribution in the river, as well as palaeolake development, geological and climatic parameters. The 138 fish species recorded in the river could be divided into 8 biogeographic regions, corresponding to the distribution of palaeolakes and respective endemic species. Through variation partitioning analysis, palaeolake isolation was the most influential factor explaining 43. 6 % of the total variance on the current fish distribution. The Quaternary Ice Age produced a transitional distribution for fishes from the glacier to warm water, especially for the subfamily Schizothoracinae, which showed various <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> along altitudes. We suggested that fish biogeography in the Yellow river was basically shaped by palaeolake isolation, and further carved under serials of geologic events and contemporary climate change...|$|R
40|$|This Master’s thesis {{examines}} the optimal {{form of a}} firm’s organisation. Specifically, it discusses the efficient <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>specialisation</b> in a firm. <b>Specialisation</b> <b>of</b> labour improves labour productivity through learning-by-doing. The problem of organisation arises, however, {{from the fact that}} the actions of specialised workers need to be coordinated in order to achieve gains from cooperation. Therefore, coordination costs may limit returns to specialisation. Moreover, changes in technology or workers’ human capital may change the returns to learning in favour <b>of</b> less <b>specialisation.</b> The thesis compares theoretically the relative efficiency of organisations, which feature different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>specialisation.</b> The comparison is made by showing how learning and communication take place in different organisational structures, and how the costs and returns to these activities vary. The optimal <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>specialisation</b> under different conditions is then derived. The model of Lindbeck and Snower (2000) addresses the efficient form of work organisation in terms <b>of</b> the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> labour <b>specialisation</b> by work task. It examines when it is worthwhile to have workers specialising by task and when they should perform multiple tasks. It finds that it is optimal for workers to perform multiple tasks only if performing different tasks is sufficiently complementary to each other. As a result, the returns to task integration outweigh the returns to specialisation. Moreover, exogenous changes in technology or human capital may change the relationship of these returns in favour of one or the other type of organisation. The second model from Greenan and Guellec (1994) compares a centralised and a decentralised organisation focusing on the coordination of learning-by-doing among workers. It takes communication costs into account because learning requires information sharing among workers. A decentralised organisation is associated with low costs of producing knowledge and high communication costs, whereas the opposite holds for the centralised organisation. It turns out that the optimal organisational form depends on the size of the labour force. Furthermore, the relative efficiency of the two organisation styles may change in favour of decentralisation when the differentiation of products in the economy grows. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{it is argued}} that the risk-pooling role of {{unemployment}} benefits affects the irreversible choices of future labour market entrants. One such ex ante choice is education. Some types of education lead to general human capital that lead to almost certain employment. Other types of education are more specialised and lead to less secure employment. We address this issue in OLG search models that allow for riskaversion, heterogeneity in talents, endogenous price formation <b>of</b> different <b>specialisations,</b> and competitive wage formation. We find that in the absence of unemployment benefits, the percentage of individuals taking high-risk specialised education is inefficiently low. Those with higher innate abilities are typically found to take lower <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation,</b> implying that the relation between wages and risks at the individual level is the reverse from what it is at the aggregate level. We find that an unemployment benefit (UB) system raises efficiency and welfare because it promotes efficient specialisation. Because education takes time, {{it takes a long time}} before the composition of the workforce has adapted to changing incentives. With a calibrated model we explore such lags between unexpected changes in circumstances and outcomes. Child Allowances, Altruism, Exchange, Inter-Household, Intra-Household...|$|R

40|$|Impact {{assessment}} {{has been}} in place for over 40 years and is now practised in some form in all but two of the world's nations. In this paper we reflect {{on the state of the}} art of impact assessment theory and practice, focusing on six well-established forms: EIA, SEA, policy assessment, SIA, HIA and sustainability assessment. We note that although the fundamentals of impact assessment have their roots in the US National Environmental Policy Act 1969 (NEPA) each branch of the field is distinct in also drawing on other theoretical and conceptual bases that in turn shape the prevailing discourse in each case, generating increasing <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> within each sub-field. Against this backdrop, we consider the strengths and weaknesses of collective impact assessment practice, concluding that although there are substantial strengths, the plethora of specialist branches is generating a somewhat confusing picture and lack of clarity regarding how the pieces of the impact assessment jigsaw puzzle fit together. We use this review to suggest an overarching research agenda that will enable impact assessment to evolve in line with changing expectations for what it should deliver. [URL]...|$|R

50|$|It was {{not long}} before the {{winnings}} of silver ore fell {{in many parts of the}} mountains and numerous pits had to close. This hardship forced its inhabitants to look for other work and, thanks to abundance of timber in the region, the manufacture of wooden toys became an important secondary source of income. Entire families were engaged in wooden toymaking, especially in the harsh winters. Child labour in conditions of poor lighting and equipment was the rule rather than the exception. The children often had to work more than 12 hours a day. Families developed a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation.</b> For example, an experienced turner would be working on turning animal shapes (Reifendrehen), another man carved the animal figures out of it and another family took over the painting and the manufacture of small boxes. Earnings from the individual steps in the process were very low. Production was usually bought by travelling merchants who used their position without mercy, to force down the prices. The majority of these products was taken to the toy markets of Nuremberg and redistributed from there. The formation of associations and cooperatives (such as Dregeno) was in order to ensure a minimum level of income.|$|E
5000|$|Bernstein's 'code theory' in the {{sociology}} of education has undergone considerable development since the early 1970s and now enjoys a growing influence in both education and linguistics, especially among systemic functional linguistics. Maton & Muller (2007) describe how Bernstein argued that different positions within society, {{understood in terms of}} their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation,</b> have different language use patterns that influence the ability of these groups to succeed in schools. These social positions create, as he later put it, 'different modalities of communication differentially valued by the school, and differentially effective in it, because of the school's values, modes of practice and relations with its different communities' (1996: 91). The notion was codified first in terms of [...] "classification" [...] and [...] "framing", where classification conceptualises relations of power that regulate relations between contexts or categories, and framing conceptualises relations of control within these contexts or categories (1975). These concepts have been widely used to analyse educational contexts and practices and their relations to the dispositions (or coding orientation) brought to education by different social groups. uThese concepts raised the question of how different forms of educational knowledge are constructed. Bernstein pointed to the pedagogic device as the cause (see Maton & Muller 2007). This forms the basis of his account of: ...|$|E

40|$|Often a General Practitioner (GP) - {{representing}} {{the group of}} familiy doctors - referred patients diagnosed with rheumatic diseases. The referral figures of other first consulting specialists were distinctly lower. This proves that GPs functioned as distributors. They very clearly differentiated when referring people and adapted their procedures to each patients and his complaints. This was especially proven {{by the fact that}} a) 	patients suffering from infectious or metabolic rheumatic diseases were only referred to internists; b) 	patients suffering from degenerative deformation of the joints or backpain were only referred to orthopedists or surgeons. Very few medical examinations such as radiologic or laboratory diagnoses already performed were repeated after the referral. This fact indicates that the doctors involved in the treatment were well coordinated. However, the therapeutic care may not have been sufficient as other researchers have already demonstrated. This is proven considering the few prescriptions of physiotherapy and the lack of prescriptve therapy. It is important to mention the use of diagnostic methods for rheumatic diseases, especially radiologic examinations which are conducted far more often than laboratory diagnoses. Moreover, the method of treatment chosen by both groups of doctors - the doctors treating the patient first and those treating him subsequently - is open to criticism. This is rather surprising as a sufficient therapy after a referral would be expected. This study cannot differentiate, however, between the respective <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> different medical fields. Thus, there is no definitive answer to the question whether the internists and orthopedists who participated in this study already brought a certain <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> rheumatologist knowledge with them.
