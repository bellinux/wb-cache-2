2500|$|In 2007, Lowenthal {{was cast}} as Jinnosuke, aka [...] "Kuma", a teddy-bear-headed warrior, in the anime feature Afro Samurai which starred Samuel L. Jackson {{as the title}} character. In an {{interview}} with Eastern Kicks, Lowenthal said that what he liked about Jinno was that he [...] "starts off as one guy and ends {{up in a very}} different, very very dark place. Plus I got to kick Sam Jackson's ass. And they keep bringing him back from the dead for me to play again. And he's a twin-sword-wielding insane cyborg death machine with a giant teddy bear head. What's not to like?" [...] He also said that they recorded the voicing for Afro Samurai separately so he did not <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> Jackson personally until a release party for the related video game years later. Luke Carroll of Anime News Network described Lowenthal's voicing as a [...] "good performance" [...] but [...] "not enough to make it more than an average dub at best". Dennis Amith of J-ENT! thought the voice acting was well done. Lowenthal would reprise the role in the 2009 feature [...] Steve Fritz of Newsarama wrote [...] "The action sequencing is still top notch, and the vocal performances from Jackson, [...] Liu, Lowenthal and company is on the money." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "...while I can’t say I LOVED “The Bear King”, I {{can at least}} say I {{respected}} what it was going for: It’s clear that Merida (Amy Manson) {{is going to be}} important to the endgame of this King Arthur (Liam Garrigan) storyline, so we needed to establish why and to what degree. And this is easier said than done, considering Merida is a character who, up until this point, hasn’t even been particularly likable. I like Amy Manson in the role of Merida, but she hasn’t always been given the best material, often coming across as unnecessarily combative and standoffish. And so this episode was necessary to soften the character and illustrate why she’s as hard-nosed as she is. This episode also gave Manson the opportunity to really shine, while also bringing back some OUAT alums I didn’t realize I’d missed, such as Mulan (Jamie Chung) and Ruby (Meghan Ory). We also <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> more of Merida’s family, such as Queen Elinor (Caroline Morahan), and — through flashbacks — the late King Fergus (Glenn Keogh). It’s a story that details how Merida is shaped into a warrior and a ruler who inspires leadership in her people, and from that standpoint, it’s one of the season’s more effective character studies." ...|$|E
