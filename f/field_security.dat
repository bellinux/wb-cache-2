25|$|The sergeants were of {{interest}} to SHAI since they belonged to the <b>field</b> <b>security</b> unit and worked with the Tulkarm police, which {{was in charge of}} the Sharon district. Their mission was to circulate within the local population and pick up information on the Irgun and Lehi and their supporters. They often operated in civilian clothes and were not subject to standing orders intended to prevent abduction attempts. Notably, they did not have to leave camp in groups of four, and sometimes went unarmed. Weinberg was very successful in his task, and occasionally got the sergeants to go out to the Netanya beach.|$|E

Her [...] "fist", or style of tapping the keys, was somewhat heavy, apparently owing to her fingers being swollen by chilblains, but her speed was improving every day. Like many talented musicians–she played the harp–Inayat Khan was a natural signaller. Furthermore, Vera Atkins (the intelligence officer for F Section) insisted, her commitment was unquestioned, as another training report had readily confirmed: [...] "She felt {{she had come to}} a dead end in the WAAF, and was longing to do something more active in the prosecution of the war, something that would demand more sacrifice." [...] So when Suttill's request first came, Vera saw Inayat Khan as a natural choice, and although her final training in <b>field</b> <b>security</b> and encoding had to be cut short, she judged her ready to go.|$|E
