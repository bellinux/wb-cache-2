40|$|Social organisms face a {{high risk}} of epidemics, and respond to this threat by {{combining}} efficient individual and collective defences against pathogens. An intriguing and little studied feature of social animals is that individual pathogen resistance may depend not only on genetic or maternal factors, but also on the social environment during development. Here, we used a cross-fostering experiment to investigate whether the pathogen resistance of individual ant workers was shaped by their own colony of origin or by the colony of origin of their carers. The origin of care-giving workers significantly influenced the ability of newly eclosed cross-fostered Formica selysi workers to resist the <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> Beauveria bassiana. In particular, carers that were more resistant to the <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> reared more resistant workers. This effect occurred in the absence of post-infection social interactions, such as trophallaxis and allogrooming. The colony of origin of eggs significantly influenced the survival of the resulting individuals in both control and pathogen treatments. There was no significant effect of the social organization (i. e. whether colonies contain a single or multiple queens) of the colony of origin of either carers or eggs. Our experiment reveals that social interactions during development {{play a central role in}} moulding the resistance of emerging workers...|$|E
40|$|Beauveria bassiana is a <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> {{with the}} ability to colonize plants endophytically. As an endophyte, B. bassiana {{may play a role in}} {{protecting}} plants from herbivory and disease. This protocol demonstrates two inoculation methods to establish B. bassiana endophytically in the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), in preparation for subsequent evaluations of endophytic biological control. Plants are grown from surface-sterilized seeds for two weeks before receiving a B. bassiana treatment of 108 conidia/ml (or water) applied either as a foliar spray or a soil drench. Two weeks later, the plants are harvested and their leaves, stems and roots are sampled to evaluate endophytic fungal colonization. For this, samples are individually surface sterilized, cut into multiple sections, and incubated in potato dextrose agar media for 20 days. The media is inspected every 2 - 3 days to observe fungal growth associated with plant sections and record the occurrence of B. bassiana to estimate the extent of its endophytic colonization. Analyses of inoculation success compare the occurrence of B. bassiana within a given plant part (i. e. leaves, stems or roots) across treatments and controls. In addition to the inoculation method, the specific outcome of the experiment may depend on the target crop species or variety, the <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> species strain or isolate used, and the plant's growing conditions...|$|E

40|$|The <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> Beauveria bassiana is {{ubiquitous}} in below-ground systems; however, {{there is a}} dearth {{of information on the}} above-ground diversity, temporal and spatial distribution of this fungus. Therefore, we assessed its occurrence in a conifer forest (Pseudotsuga monziesii and Pinus nigra var. maritima) using selective media to isolate B. bassiana from soil, branch and bark samples collected in October 2005, March and June 2006. Fungal density was the highest at all locations in October, declining in March and June, and absent from conifer branches in June. This above-ground decline most likely resulted from more extreme environmental conditions compared with those below ground. Molecular analyses (ISSR-PCR) indicated that B. bassiana is genetically diverse, comprising both distinct microhabitat-specific and seasonal isolates.

We detected eight fungal species known to be entomopathogenic in soil sampled from the habitat of ants. Six of these entomopathogens were found in active nests, abandoned nests, and corpses from dump piles or live ants. A systematic search {{for the presence of}} three generalist <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens</b> in ant colonies revealed a large variation in their prevalence. The most common of the three pathogens, Paecilomyces lilacinus, was detected in 44 % of the colonies.

The three fungal species caused significant mortality to experimentally challenged ants, but varied in their degree of virulence. There was a high level of genetic diversity within B. bassiana isolates, which delineated three genetic strains that also differed significantly in their virulence. Overall, our study indicates that the ants encounter a diversity of <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens</b> in their natural habitat.

40|$|Conservation {{biological}} control (CBC) is a pest management strategy in which farming management practices are adopted {{to enhance the}} living conditions for specific natural enemies of pests with the specific objective to suppress pest populations. Research in CBC strategies have mostly focused on provisioning of good living conditions for arthropod predators and parasitoids, usually ignoring entomopathogens as regulators of pest populations. <b>Fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens</b> are widespread in agro-ecosystems and infect a range of arthropod pests, and these fungi should therefore also be included in CBC. Knowledge of the ecology of indigenous populations of <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens</b> {{is a prerequisite for}} the evaluation of their contributions to pest control and for predicting consequences of agricultural practices. The anamorphic entomopathogenic fungi Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium anisopliae (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) are among the most abundant fungi infecting insects and arachnids in temperate regions. Much focus has been on the development of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae as {{biological control}} agents (for inundation and inoculation biological control) to be applied in agriculture and forestry.

40|$|Abstract. 1. Many ectothermic {{species have}} evolved {{the ability to}} invoke a ‘behavioural fever ’ when {{infected}} with a pathogen. The relative {{costs and benefits of}} this response, however, have rarely been quantified. 2. The aim of this study was investigate the nature and consequences of behavioural fever in the house fly, Musca domestica L., in response to infection with a possible biocontrol agent, the <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen,</b> Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin. 3. It was found that infected flies preferred higher temperatures and allocated more effort to thermoregulation than uninfected flies. Flies could not overcome infection but the altered thermal behaviour allowed infected flies to extend their survival and to lay more eggs relative to infected flies maintained under constant conditions. However, flies allowed to fever had lower egg viability suggesting a possible cost. 4. Under the present experimental conditions, the putative costs and benefits fever balanced one another resulting in no net change in fitness. Fever did not, therefore, limit the control potential of the fungus. We discuss whether {{the costs and benefits of}} behavioural fever might differ in other ecological contexts. Key words.

40|$|Parasites {{can cause}} {{extensive}} damage to animal societies {{in which many}} related individuals frequently interact. In response, social animals have evolved diverse individual and collective defences. Here, we measured the expression and efficiency of self-grooming and allo-grooming when workers of the ant Formica selysi were contaminated with spores of the <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> Metarhizium anisopliae. The amount of self-grooming increased {{in the presence of}} fungal spores, which shows that the ants are able to detect the risk of infection. In contrast, the amount of allo-grooming did not depend on fungal contamination. Workers groomed all nestmate workers that were re-introduced into their groups. The amount of allo-grooming towards noncontaminated individuals was higher when the group had been previously exposed to the pathogen. Allo-grooming decreased the number of fungal spores on the surface of contaminated workers, but did not prevent infection in the conditions tested (high dose of spores and late allo-grooming). The rate of disease transmission to groomers and other nestmates was extremely low. The systematic allo-grooming of all individuals returning to the colony, be they contaminated or not, is probably a simple but robust prophylactic defence preventing the spread of fungal diseases in insect societies...|$|E

40|$|<b>Fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens</b> {{have been}} used more {{frequently}} than other types of pathogens for classical biological control. Among 136 programs using different groups of arthropod pathogens, 49. 3 % have introduced fungal pathogens (including both the traditional fungi and microsporidia). The most commonly introduced species was Metarhizium anisopliae (Metschnikoff) Sorokin, with 13 introductions, followed by Entomophaga maimaiga Humber, Shimazu & Soper, which was released seven times. The majority of introduction programs have focused on controlling invasive species of insects or mites (70. 7 %) rather than on native hosts (29. 4 %). Almost half of the introductions of traditional fungi targeted species of Hemiptera and 75 % of the microsporidia introduced have been introduced against lepidopteran species. The United States was the country where most introductions of fungi took place (n = 24). From 1993 to 2007, no arthropod pathogens were released in the US due to the rigorous regulatory structure, but in 2008 two species of microsporidia were introduced against the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.). Establishment of entomopathogenic fungi in programs introducing traditional fungi was 32. 1 % and establishment was 50. 0 % for programs introducing microsporidia.

A survey of fungal endophytes in coffee plants from Hawaii, Colombia, Mexico, and Puerto Rico has revealed the presence of various genera of <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens,</b> including Acremonium, Beauveria, Cladosporium, Clonostachys, and Paecilomyces. Two of these, B. bassiana and Clonostachys rosea, were tested against the coffee berry borer and were shown to be pathogenic. This paper reviews the possible mode of action of entomopathogenic fungal endophytes...|$|R
40|$|The below- and {{aboveground}} {{communities of}} fungal entomopathogens (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) were investigated in an experimental conventional and organic vegetable cropping system over two seasons in Denmark. The experimental design allowed for evaluating differences between farming {{practices in the}} occurrence of soil-borne fungal entomopathogens and as natural infections aboveground in arthropod hosts. Belowground, Metarhizium anisopliae dominated the agricultural field with Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium flavoviride and Isaria fumosorosea being present at lower frequencies. Abundances of M. anisopliae were not different between conventional and organic soils. Aboveground, B. bassiana {{was the most common}} <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> in arthropod host cadavers. Infections of M. flavoviride, Isaria farinosa and Gibellula spp. were also recorded. Most mycosed cadavers were recovered in August and September from conventionally farmed plots. Cadaver sizes ranged from 1. 9 mm to 23. 6 mm with means of 3. 7 mm to 4. 1 mm. Among host functional groups, predators dominated (47 % - 63 %) over herbivores, parasitoids and nectar-feeders. No occurrence of M. anisopliae was recorded among > 200 mycosed cadavers aboveground. The results therefore suggest that M. anisopliae is not involved in direct below- and aboveground interactions in the investigated agroecosystem. Conservation biological control strategies targeting M. anisopliae should thus be solely for controlling soil-dwelling pests in temperate regions as this fungus is unlikely naturally to infect aboveground hosts in the agroecosytem...|$|E
40|$|Lymantria dispar larvae were {{collected}} in 20 oak stands in Sardinia to evaluate mortality factors. Collected larvae were reared in the laboratory on artificial diet until they died or pupated. Larval mortality ranged from 17, 5 % to 100 %. Parasitoids that killed larvae were identified and the remaining larvae were evaluated for presence of pathogens. The tachinid Blepharipa pratensis was the most frequently observed and caused up to 57 % mortality. The viral pathogen LdNPV caused mortality up to 37, 5 %. We recorded the presence of Beauveria bassiana {{as well as the}} microsporidium Nosema portugal, which was previously identified as Nosema lymantriae. The <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> Entomophaga maimaiga was not collected from the host populations surveyed. This fungus is a virulent and very host specific pathogen of the gypsy moth. We started bioassays to verify the effectiveness against gypsy moth larvae from Sardinia and other parts of Italy. Two methodologies were followed: larvae were exposed to contaminated soil containing E. maimaiga azygospores; larvae were sunk in a water suspension containing the fungus azygospores. Mortality caused by fungus was 4, 16 % in 2012, 3 % in 2013 and 2, 06 % in 2014 for the first method and 4. 70 % for the second method. In order to exclude negative effects for the environment and lay the foundations for the introduction of E. maimaiga in Sardinia we verified the action of the fungus against other lepidopteran larvae: none of them were killed by the fungus...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{regulatory}} importance of H. postica natural enemies, relatively few {{efforts have been}} made to integrate natural enemies and management tactics into holistic management programs. This is primarily {{due to the lack of}} quantitative information on the interactions between H. postica natural enemies and management tactics. The objectives of this study were to (1) initiate local epizootics of the <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogen</b> Zoophthora phytonomi Arthur (Zygomycetes: Entomophthoraceae) through inoculative host releases; (2) quantify the effects of reduced insecticide rates, or strip harvesting, on H. postica larval populations and transmission of Z. phytonomi; (3) determine the effects of reduced insecticide rates, or strip harvesting, on the larval parasitoids Bathyplectes curculionis Thomson (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) and B. anurus; and (4) determine the effects of reduced insecticide rates, or strip harvesting, on selected arthropod predators. These studies provide a basis for the development of a holistic integrated pest management program for H. postica. We have demonstrated that: (1) transmission and development of Z. phytonomi occurs in H. postica larvae exposed to low rates of Lorsban 4 E°ler (chlorpyrofos); (2) combined mortality between reduced rates of insecticide and Z. phytonomi is additive in alfalfa fields when timed with the development of Z. phytonomi; and (3) high levels of H. postica mortality can be achieved while conserving larval parasitoid species and arthropod predator abundance through the use of reduced rates of insecticides applied in selected areas of an alfalfa field...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} {{mechanism for}} {{insect pest control}} should be the use of <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens.</b> Even though these organisms have been studied for more than 100 y, their effective use in the field remains elusive. Recently, however, it has been discovered {{that many of these}} entomopathogenic fungi play additional roles in nature. They are endophytes, antagonists of plant pathogens, associates with the rhizosphere, and possibly even plant growth promoting agents. These findings indicate that the ecological role of these fungi in the environment is not fully understood and limits our ability to employ them successfully for pest management. In this paper, we review the recently discovered roles played by many entomopathogenic fungi and propose new research strategies focused on alternate uses for these fungi. It seems likely that these agents can be used in multiple roles in protecting plants from pests and diseases {{and at the same time}} promoting plant growth...|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} three inoculation methods (foliar spray, seed immersion and root immersion) in establishing <b>fungal</b> the <b>entomopathogen</b> Beauveria bassiana as an endophyte in tobacco, corn, wheat and soybean. Colonisation of leaves by B. bassiana was assessed 7, 14, 21 and 28 days postinoculation. There were significant differences (p < 0. 001) in endophytic colonisation among the different inoculation techniques...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Entomopathogenic fungi, such as Metarhizium anisopliae and Beauveria bassiana, {{are being}} {{researched}} as alternatives to chemical adulticides to control mosquito vectors of malaria and dengue. Two cited concerns of fungal con-trol include conidial viability and risks <b>fungal</b> <b>entomopathogens</b> pose to human health. We measured spore viability of 10 fungal isolates over 26 weeks {{and found a}} range of persistence. Three B. bassiana isolates maintained ≥ 50 % viability 14 weeks after application. No M. anisopliae isolate persisted longer than 1 week. To help assess risk of conidia as poten-tial human allergens, we measured airborne conidia in enclosed environments after simulated biopesticide treatment of M. anisopliae. Conidia were detectable immediately after treatment, with concentrations of ~ 7000 /m 3, decreasing over 48 hours to 500 conidia/m 3. At most, Metarhizium conidia comprised 2 % of total visible particulate matter, falling to 0. 1 % by 2 days. The implications for viability of biological control of adult mosquitoes are discussed...|$|R
