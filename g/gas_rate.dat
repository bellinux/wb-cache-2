The Memphis Light, Gas, and Water Division (MLGW), a distribution system in Memphis, Tennessee, purchased gas from Texas Gas under a contract in which MLGW was required to reimburse Texas Gas for any increases {{in the cost of}} gas provided by United Gas. Each of these contracts had a clause which specified that the rate for the gas was that on the United <b>Gas</b> <b>rate</b> schedule on file with the FPC or any effective rate schedule. On September 30, 1955, United Gas filed a new rate schedule with the FPC which proposed to increase the contract rates. The FPC suspended the rates as provided in the NGA and initiated an administrative proceeding to determine the lawfulness of the new rate schedule. The distribution companies and MLG&W intervened in the proceeding. After the Supreme Court issued its Mobile Gas decision which held that the unilateral filing of a new rate schedule could not abrogate a gas contract with a specified rate on February 27, 1956, the distribution companies and MLGW moved to dismiss the new rate schedule. The FPC upheld the new rate schedule on the basis that the distribution companies had contracted to essentially pay the [...] "going" [...] rate on the effective United <b>Gas</b> <b>rate</b> schedule, and distinguished Mobile Gas as applying to gas contracts with a fixed rate.|$|E
50|$|Most modern meters {{combine a}} venturi flow rate meter, with a gamma densitometer, and some meters have addictional {{measurements}} for water salinity. The meter measures the flow rates at line pressures, which are typically {{orders of magnitude}} greater than atmospheric pressure, but the meter must report {{the oil and gas}} volumes at standard (atmospheric) pressure and temperature.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Eq. (3) that the value of the {{dimensionless}} <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> is also between 0 and 1. According to the value of dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate,</b> the CBM production process can be divided into four stages. In drainage stage, there is only water produced until the gas starts coming out. If we set η_ 1 as dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> of the time point at which gas begins to produce, then the dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> ranges from 0 to η_ 1 at this stage. It is worthy to note that each production well has different η_ 1 due to the various durations of the drainage stage. In the unstable gas production stage, the production of gas increases gradually from zero, and water production tends to decrease. The corresponding dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> also increases gradually during this stage. If we set η_ 2 as dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> at the time point when gas production begins to stabilize, then the dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> ranges from η_ 1 to η_ 2 in this stage. Generally, the dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> of this stage is larger than 0.5. In stable gas production stage, the production of gas remains at a high level with slight fluctuations. And the corresponding water production remains at a low level. If we set η_ 3 as dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> at the point when gas production begins to decline, then the dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> varies from η_ 2 to η_ 3 in this stage. In gas production decline stage, gas production tends to decline and water production decreases gradually from a very low level to 0. The dimensionless <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> ranges from η_ 3 to 1 in this stage.|$|E

Two hundred numerical models with different reservoir properties which are generated by a Monte Carlo method are numerically simulated using a compositional simulator. Empirical equations are built to estimate the gas recovery, peak <b>gas</b> <b>rate,</b> time to peak <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> and gas production decline rates by analysing the relationships between reservoir properties and gas production rates. The peak <b>gas</b> <b>rate,</b> time to peak <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> and gas production decline rates {{are used in the}} rate-time fit equation to predict the gas production rate.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the factors which influence the <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> (volume of gas produced per unit arc energy) in insulating oil. Such data are fundamental to the design of oil circuit breakers. It is found that the <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> varies with electrode length, location of arc on the surface, duration of current and material of arcing surface. The <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> is higher for the longer gap length (3 / 4 inch) than for the shorter gap length (1 / 4 inch). An arc on the center of the surface generally gives a lower <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> while that on the edge a higher <b>gas</b> <b>rate.</b> For arcs occurring on the center, copper surface has a higher <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> while steel and silver elkalite (alloy used in practice) surfaces have approximately the same lower rate. A high <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> results in the short duration arc of 1 / 2 cycle and nearly equal low gas rates are obtained for durations of 2 cycles and 3 1 / 2 cycles. No appreciable change in <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> is observed as the magnitude of current peak varies from 400 to 800 amperes. With the method used in this research, steel surfaces have the desired character that arcs always occur on the center. For 600 amperes and 2 cycle duration, the <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> of flat steel surfaces referred to 760 mm and 25 [degrees]C is 74, 133 and 175 cubic centimeters per kilowatt second at 1 / 4, 1 / 2 and 3 / 4 inch gap lengths respectively. Because the <b>gas</b> <b>rate</b> for silver elkalite and steel surfaces are about the same with arcs on the center, the effect of current magnitude is small and the arc duration in most circuit breaker operation about 2 cycles, the total volume of gas produced in actual operation of a circuit breaker can be calculated approximately by correlating the above figures with field test records of arc energy and electrode travel...|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{extend our}} {{previous}} {{efforts on the}} effect of surfactants on air-water flow in a vertical pipe by also considering pipe inclinations between 20 ° (with respect to horizontal) and vertical. For air-water flow, independent of the inclination, there is a regular annular flow at large <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates,</b> and an irregular churn or slug flow at low <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates.</b> Closely related to the transition between regular and irregular flow, although not necessarily coinciding with it, there is a minimum in the pressure gradient {{as a function of the}} <b>gas</b> flow <b>rate.</b> In <b>gas</b> wells, surfactants are used to shift this minimum to lower <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates,</b> which allows a stable gas production up to lower reservoir pressures. In this work, we investigate how the pipe inclination affects air-water flow without and with surfactants. Surfactants generate foam, which decreases the density and increases the thickness of the film at the pipe wall. For vertical flow, we previously established that surfactants increase the pressure gradient at high <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates,</b> decrease the pressure gradient at low <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates,</b> shift the minimum in the pressure gradient to lower <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates,</b> and shift the transition between regular and irregular flow to lower <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates.</b> The new results described in this paper show that for large <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates,</b> both the flow with and without surfactants is unaffected by the inclination. At low gas velocities, however, in inclined pipes the surfactants are much less effective at shifting the transition between irregular flow and regular flow and at shifting the minimum in the pressure gradient than in vertical pipes. The foam causes a regular film morphology at the top wall of the pipe, but is unable to make the morphology of the bottom liquid film regular. As a result, at low <b>gas</b> flow <b>rates</b> the relative decrease of the pressure gradient due to surfactants is smaller for smaller inclinations from horizontal. This larger relative decrease for vertical flow compared to inclined flow is related to an increased foam formation and therefore a smaller mass density of the film in vertical flow. </p...|$|R
