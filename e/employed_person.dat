25|$|Federal {{tax policy}} was highly {{contentious}} during the war, with President Franklin D. Roosevelt battling a conservative Congress. However, both sides {{agreed on the}} need for high taxes (along with heavy borrowing) to pay for the war: top marginal tax rates ranged from 81%-94% {{for the duration of the}} war, and the income level subject to the highest rate was lowered from $5,000,000 to $200,000. Roosevelt tried unsuccessfully, by executive order 9250, to impose a 100% surtax on after-tax incomes over $25,000 (equal to roughly $ today). However, Roosevelt did manage to impose this cap on executive pay in corporations with government contracts. Congress also enlarged the tax base by lowering the minimum income to pay taxes, and by reducing personal exemptions and deductions. By 1944 nearly every <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> was paying federal income taxes (compared to 10% in 1940).|$|E

It was $62.70 a week, {{which was the}} disposable income required to support the basic needs {{of a family of}} two adults and two dependent children at the time. This poverty line has been updated regularly by the Melbourne Institute according to increases in average incomes; for a single <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> it was $391.85 per week (including housing costs) in March 2009. In Australia the OECD poverty would equate to a [...] "disposable income of less than $358 per week for a single adult (higher for larger households to take account of their greater costs). in 2015 Australia implemented the Individual Deprivation Measure which address gender disparities in poverty.|$|E

Whatever notion there is, there is no notion whatever of protecting the <b>employed</b> <b>person</b> from his employer. Much less is there any idea of his ever being anywhere except under an employer. Whatever the Capitalist wants he gets. He may have the sense to want washed and well-fed labourers rather than dirty and feeble ones, and the restrictions may happen {{to exist in the}} form of laws from the Kaiser or by-laws from the Krupps. But the Kaiser will not offend the Krupps, and the Krupps will not offend the Kaiser. Laws of this kind, then, do not attempt to protect workmen against the injustice of the Capitalist as the English Trade Unions did. They do not attempt to protect workmen against the injustice of the State as the mediaeval guilds did. Obviously they cannot protect workmen against the foreign invader--especially when (as in the comic case of Belgium) they are imposed by the foreign invader. What then are such laws designed to protect workmen against? Tigers, rattlesnakes, hyenas? ...|$|E

30|$|To {{calculate}} the average actual hours worked and {{the volume of}} work, the number of gainfully <b>employed</b> <b>persons</b> is calculated and their structure is considered.

The quarterly and annual figures stem from the Employment Accounts (cf. Lüken 2012). As there is no specific subdivision in the Employment Accounts according to working time, one fundamental element of the AZR is the allocation of employees into part-time or full-time employees. For calculating the part-time rate, different statistics are combined in the AZR.|$|R
