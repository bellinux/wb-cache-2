40|$|Light <b>emitting</b> <b>field</b> effect {{transistors}} (LEFETs) {{are emerging}} as a multi-functional class of optoelectronic devices. LEFETs can simultaneously execute light emission and the standard logic functions of a transistor in a single architecture. However, current LEFET architectures deliver either high brightness or high efficiency but not both concurrently, thus limiting their use in technological applications. Here we show an LEFET device strategy that simultaneously improves brightness and efficiency. The key step change in LEFET performance arises from the bottom gate top-contact device architecture in which the source/drain electrodes are semitransparent and the active channel contains a bi-layer comprising of a high mobility charge-transporting polymer, and a yellow-green emissive polymer. A record external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 2. 1 % at 1000 cd/m 2 is demonstrated for polymer based bilayer LEFETs...|$|E
40|$|Two entwined {{problems}} have remained unresolved since pulsars were discovered nearly 50 years ago: {{the orientation of}} their polarized emission relative to the emitting magnetic field and the direction of putative supernova "kicks' relative to their rotation axes. The rotational orientation of most pulsars can be inferred only from the ("fiducial') polarization angle of their radiation, when their beam points directly at the Earth and the emitting polar fluxtube field is ∥ to the rotation axis. Earlier studies have been unrevealing owing to the admixture {{of different types of}} radiation (core and conal, two polarization modes), producing both ∥ or alignments. In this paper we analyze the some 50 pulsars having three characteristics: core radiation beams, reliable absolute polarimetry, and accurate proper motions. The "fiducial' polarization angle of the core emission, we then find, is usually oriented to the proper-motion direction on the sky. As the primary core emission is polarized to the projected magnetic field in Vela and other pulsars where X-ray imaging reveals the orientation, this shows that the proper motions usually lie ∥ to the rotation axes on the sky. Two key physical consequences then follow: first, to the extent that supernova "kicks' are responsible for pulsar proper motions, they are mostly ∥ to the rotation axis; and second that most pulsar radiation is heavily processed by the magnetospheric plasma such that the lowest altitude "parent' core emission is polarized to the <b>emitting</b> <b>field,</b> propagating as the extraordinary (X) mode.

40|$|We present new {{results on}} the spectrally {{resolved}} Lyman-alpha (LyA) emission of three LyA <b>emitting</b> <b>field</b> galaxies at z~ 2. 4 with high LyA equivalent width (> 100 Angstroms) and LyA luminosity (~ 10 ^ 43 erg/s). At 120 km/s (FWHM) spectral resolution, the prominent double-peaked LyA profile straddles the systemic velocity, where the velocity zero-point is determined from spectroscopy of the galaxies' rest-frame optical nebular emission lines. The average velocity offset from systemic of the stronger redshifted emission component for our sample is 176 km/s while the average total separation between the redshifted and main blueshifted emission components is 380 km/s. These measurements are a factor of ~ 2 smaller than for UV continuum-selected galaxies that show LyA in emission with lower LyA equivalent width. We compare our LyA spectra to the predicted line profiles of a spherical "expanding shell" LyA radiative transfer grid that models large-scale galaxy outflows. Specifically blueward of the systemic velocity where two galaxies show a weak, highly blueshifted (by ~ 1000 km/s) tertiary emission peak, the model line profiles are a relatively poor representation of the observed spectra. Since the neutral gas column density has a dominant influence over {{the shape of the}} LyA line profile, we caution against equating the observed LyA velocity offset with a physical outflow velocity, especially at lower spectral resolution where the unresolved LyA velocity offset is a convoluted function of several degenerate parameters. Referring to rest-frame ultraviolet and optical Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we find that galaxy-galaxy interactions may {{play an important role in}} inducing a starburst that results in copious LyA emission, as well as perturbing the gas distribution and velocity field which have strong influence over the LyA emission line profile.

40|$|The Io-controlled radio arcs are {{emissions}} in the decametric radio range which appear arc shaped in the time-frequency plane. Their occurrence is controlled by Io's position, so {{it has been for}} long inferred that they are powered by the Io-Jupiter electrodynamic interaction. Their frequency ranges correspond to the electron cyclotron frequencies along the Io Flux tube, so they are expected to be generated by cyclotron maser instability (CMI). The arc shape was proposed to be a consequence of the strong anisotropy of the decametric radio emissions beaming, combined with the topology of the magnetic field in the source and the observation geometry. Recent papers succeeded at reproducing the morphologies of a few typical radio arcs by modeling in three dimensions the observation geometry, using the best available magnetic field model and a beaming angle variation consistent with a loss-cone driven CMI. In the continuation of these studies, we present here the systematic modeling of a larger number of observations of the radio arcs emitted in Jupiter's southern hemisphere (including multiple arcs or arcs exhibiting abrupt changes of shape), which permits to obtain a statistical determination of the <b>emitting</b> <b>field</b> line localization (lead angle) relative to the instantaneous Io field line, and of the emitting particle velocities or energies. Variations of these parameters relative to Io's longitude are also measured and compared to the location of the UV footprints of the Io-Jupiter interaction. It is shown that the data are better organized in a reference frame attached to the UV spot resulting from the main Alfven wing resulting from the Io-Jupiter interaction. It is proposed that the radio arcs are related to the first reflected Alfven wing rather than to the main one. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Here {{we study}} {{a simple way}} of {{controlling}} the <b>emitted</b> <b>fields</b> of sub-wavelength nanometric sources. The system consists of arrays of nanoparticles (NPs) embedded in optical active media. The key concept is the careful tuning of NP's damping factors, which changes the eigenmode's decay rates of the whole array. This, at long time, leads to a locking of relative phases and frequencies of individual localized-surfaces-plasmons (LSPs) and, thus, controlls the <b>emitted</b> <b>field.</b> The amplitude of the LSP's oscillations can be kept constant by embedding the system in optical active media. In the case of full loss compensation, this implies that, not only the relative phases, but also the amplitudes of the LSPs remain fixed, leading us, additionally, to interpret the process as a new example of synchronization. The proposed approach {{can be used as}} a general way of controlling and designing the electromagnetic <b>fields</b> <b>emitted</b> by nanometric sources, which can find applications in optoelectronic, nanoscale lithography and probing microscopy...|$|R

40|$|A {{method by}} which the {{apparent}} microwave temperature characteristic of a flat scene is estimated from dual polarized measurements is derived and interpreted. Approximate linear relationships between antenna and apparent temperatures are established by weighting emission components in spherical bands {{under the assumption that}} the surface is isotropic. The weighting factors are formed by integrating the antenna pattern functions over these bands. The vector aspect of the formulation is retained to account for the difference between the definition of the antenna polarizations and the polarizations of the <b>emitted</b> <b>fields.</b> The method is largely applicable to the measurement of smooth temperature distributions by an antenna having good spatial resolution of the distributions and is considered efficient for inverting large volumes of measurements. Sample cases are presented and the implications of these cases on remote radiometer observations are discussed. It is shown that cross-coupling occurs between the polarizations of the <b>emitted</b> <b>fields</b> and the polarizations of the antenna. For this reason and because practical antennas have cross-polarized patterns associated with them, it is necessary to conduct measurements at both horizontal and vertical polarizations to realize the inversion.
