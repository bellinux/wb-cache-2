5|$|Sexual <b>dimorphism</b> {{occurs in}} many rodent species. In some rodents, males {{are larger than}} females, while in others the reverse is true. Male-bias sexual <b>dimorphism</b> is typical for ground squirrels, {{kangaroo}} rats, solitary mole rats, and pocket gophers; it likely developed due to sexual selection and greater male-male combat. Female-bias sexual <b>dimorphism</b> exists among chipmunks and jumping mice. It is not understood why this pattern occurs, {{but in the case}} of yellow-pine chipmunks, males may have selected larger females due to their greater reproductive success. In some species, such as voles, sexual <b>dimorphism</b> can vary from population to population. In bank voles, females are typically larger than males, but male-bias sexual <b>dimorphism</b> occurs in alpine populations, possibly because of the lack of predators and greater competition between males.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from its}} long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back {{differentiate}} the hartebeest from other antelopes. The hartebeest shares several physical traits with the sassabies (genus Damaliscus), {{such as an}} elongated and narrow face, {{the shape of the}} horns, the pelage texture and colour, and the terminal tuft of the tail. The wildebeest have more specialised skull and horn features than the hartebeest. The hartebeest exhibits sexual <b>dimorphism,</b> but only slightly, as both sexes bear horns and have similar body masses. The degree of sexual <b>dimorphism</b> varies by subspecies. Males are 8% heavier than females in Swayne's and Lichtenstein's hartebeest, and 23% heavier in the red hartebeest. In one study, the highest <b>dimorphism</b> was found in skull weight. Another study concluded that the length of the breeding season is a good predictor of <b>dimorphism</b> in pedicle (the bony structures from which the horns grow) height and skull weight, and the best predictor of the horn circumference.|$|E

40|$|SummarySexual <b>dimorphisms</b> in {{the brain}} {{underlie}} behavioral sex differences, but the function of individual sexually dimorphic neuronal populations is poorly understood. Neuronal sexual <b>dimorphisms</b> typically represent quantitative differences in cell number, gene expression, or other features, and it is unknown whether these <b>dimorphisms</b> control sex-typical behavior exclusively in one sex or in both sexes. The progesterone receptor (PR) controls female sexual behavior, and we find many sex differences in number, distribution, or projections of PR-expressing neurons in the adult mouse brain. Using a genetic strategy we developed, we have ablated one such dimorphic PR-expressing neuronal population located in the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH). Ablation of these neurons in females greatly diminishes sexual receptivity. Strikingly, the corresponding ablation in males reduces mating and aggression. Our findings reveal the functions of a molecularly defined, sexually dimorphic neuronal population {{in the brain}}. Moreover, we show that sexually dimorphic neurons can control distinct sex-typical behaviors in both sexes...|$|R

5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} for sexual <b>dimorphism</b> has been weakened. A 2005 {{study reported that}} previous claims of sexual <b>dimorphism</b> in crocodile chevron anatomy were in error, casting doubt {{on the existence of}} similar <b>dimorphism</b> between Tyrannosaurus rex sexes. A full-sized chevron was discovered on the first tail vertebra of Sue, an extremely robust individual, indicating that this feature could not be used to differentiate the two morphs anyway. As Tyrannosaurus rex specimens have been found from Saskatchewan to New Mexico, differences between individuals may be indicative of geographic variation rather than sexual <b>dimorphism.</b> The differences could also be age-related, with 'robust' individuals being older animals.|$|E
5|$|All bovids {{have the}} similar basic form - a snout with a blunt end, {{one or more}} pairs of horns (generally present on males) {{immediately}} after the oval or pointed ears, a distinct neck and limbs, and a tail varying in length and bushiness among the species. Most bovids exhibit sexual <b>dimorphism,</b> with males usually larger as well as heavier than females. Sexual <b>dimorphism</b> is more prominent in medium- to large-sized bovids. All bovids have four toes on each foot – they walk on the central two (the hooves), while the outer two (the dewclaws) are much smaller and rarely touch the ground.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSexually dimorphic {{behaviors}} {{are likely to}} involve neural pathways that express the androgen receptor (AR). We have genetically modified the AR locus to visualize <b>dimorphisms</b> in neuronal populations that express AR. Analysis of AR-positive neurons reveals both known <b>dimorphisms</b> in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis as well as novel dimorphic islands in the basal forebrain with a clarity unencumbered by the vast population of AR-negative neurons. This genetic approach allows the visualization of dimorphic subpopulations of AR-positive neurons along with their projections and may ultimately permit an association between neural circuits and specific dimorphic behaviors...|$|R
40|$|SummaryDifferences {{between males}} and females are {{normally}} attributed to developmental and hormonal differences between the sexes. Here, we demonstrate differences {{between males and}} females in gene silencing using a heterochromatin-sensitive reporter gene. Using “sex-reversal” mouse models with varying sex chromosome complements, we found that this differential gene silencing was determined by X chromosome complement, rather than sex. Genome-wide transcription profiling showed that the expression of hundreds of autosomal genes was also sensitive to sex chromosome complement. These genome-wide analyses also uncovered a role for Sry in modulating autosomal gene expression in a sex chromosome complement-specific manner. The identification of this additional layer in the establishment of sexual <b>dimorphisms</b> has implications for understanding sexual <b>dimorphisms</b> in physiology and disease. PaperCli...|$|R
25|$|Other {{striking}} functional <b>dimorphisms</b> are in {{the behavioral}} responses to ovarian steroids of the adult. Males and females respond to ovarian steroids in different ways, partly because the expression of estrogen-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus is sexually dimorphic; i.e., estrogen receptors are expressed in different sets of neurons.|$|R
5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual <b>dimorphism,</b> parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the number of sets of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual <b>dimorphism,</b> in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual <b>dimorphism</b> in insects.|$|E
5|$|Sexual dichromatism (different {{coloration}} patterns {{between males}} and females) {{can be seen in}} most brown lemur species, but otherwise lemurs show very little if any difference in body size or weight between sexes. This lack of sexual <b>dimorphism</b> is not characteristic of all strepsirrhines. Some adapiforms were sexually dimorphic, with males bearing a larger sagittal crest (a ridge of bone {{on the top of the}} skull to which jaw muscles attach) and canine teeth. Lorisoids exhibit some sexual <b>dimorphism,</b> but males are typically no more than 20percent larger than females.|$|E
5|$|Sexual <b>dimorphism</b> in beak size {{may have}} {{affected}} behaviour. Such <b>dimorphism</b> is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference {{between male and female}} head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though it is impossible to determine how.|$|E

40|$|Some insect species exhibit polymorphisms {{in flight}} muscles or wings, which provide {{opportunities}} for studying the factors that drive dispersal polymorphisms {{and the evolution of}} flightlessness in insects. We investigated the macroscale evolutionary pattern of flightlessness in the widespread Japanese beetle Necrophila japonica (Coleoptera: Silphidae), which exhibits flight muscle <b>dimorphisms</b> using phylogeographic approaches. N. japonica lives in both stable and unstable habitats, and the flight muscle <b>dimorphisms</b> may have been maintained through the use of these diverse habitats. We studied the distribution pattern of the proportion of individuals lacking flight muscles in relation to the genetic differentiation among geographic populations using an 842 -base pair sequence of the COI-II gene. Both flight-capable and flightless individuals occurred over the distribution area, and the flight muscle condition showed no significant phylogeographic pattern. Several populations comprised flight-capable individuals only, whereas few comprised flightless ones only. Demographic expansion was suggested for major clades of COI-II haplotypes, and the genetic differentiation showed an isolation-by-distance pattern among the populations in Japan. The proportion of flightless individuals was higher in a population with a higher annual mean temperature and with higher genetic diversity among individuals. These results indicate that geographic expansion occurred recently while flight muscle <b>dimorphisms</b> have been maintained, that flight-capable individuals have colonized cooler (peripheral) habitats, and that flightlessness has increased in long-persisting populations as suggested by high genetic diversity...|$|R
5|$|The common {{phenomenon}} amongst {{birds in}} which {{males and females}} {{of the same species}} exhibit different characteristics beyond the differences in their sexual organs. It can manifest in size or plumage differences. Sexual size <b>dimorphism</b> varies among taxa with males typically being larger, though this is not always the case i.e. in birds of prey, hummingbirds, and some species of flightless birds. Plumage <b>dimorphism,</b> in the form of ornamentation or colouration, also varies, though males are typically the more ornamented or brightly coloured sex. Such differences have been attributed to the unequal reproductive contributions of the sexes.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other whales (and {{most other}} mammals), the females {{are larger than}} the males.

Male right whales have bigger callosities than female right whales. The males are generally more scarred than females which {{is thought to be}} because of aggression during mating season.|$|E
5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward.

Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual <b>dimorphism,</b> {{there would have been}} evolutionary selection for competition between males.

5000|$|Ideas of {{differences}} in {{the male and female}} brain circulated during the time of ancient Greek philosophers around 850 B.C.

The developmental independence of alternative phenotypes is key to evolutionary theories of phenotypic plasticity and the origins of diversity. Male <b>dimorphisms</b> associated with alternative reproductive tactics are widely cited examples of such facultative expression of divergent fitness optima. Current models {{for the evolution of}} male <b>dimorphisms</b> invoke a size-dependent threshold at which the phenotype is reprogrammed. We use predictions derived from allometric modeling to test for the existence of reprogramming thresholds in two species of beetle, Onthophagus taurus and Onthophagus binodis, and the European earwig Forficula auricularia. We also compare the allometry of a number of morphological traits to determine whether minor males suppress their secondary sexual traits. The intercept of the horn allometry was suppressed, but {{there was no evidence of}} reprogramming of horn growth in either beetle species. There was reprogramming in the earwig. In the beetles, the horn length in all males can be explained largely in terms of exponential horn growth following an extraordinarily steep power function. The asymptote in O. taurus can be explained by exponential growth meeting the constraint of resource exhaustion. These findings question the currently held view that beetle horn <b>dimorphisms</b> showcase the importance of developmental independence in the evolution of diversity.

40|$|Sexual <b>dimorphisms</b> {{are well}} {{recognized}} in various cardiac {{diseases such as}} ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Thorough understanding of the underlying genetic programs is crucial to optimize treatment strategies specified for each gender. By performing meta-analysis and microarray analysis, we sought to comprehensively characterize the sexual <b>dimorphisms</b> in the healthy and diseased heart {{at the level of}} both mRNA and miRNA transcriptome. Existing mRNA microarray data of both mouse and human heart were integrated, identifying dozens/ hundreds of sexually dimorphic genes in healthy heart, ICM, HCM, and DCM. These sexually dimorphic genes overrepresented gene ontologies (GOs) important for cardiac homeostasis. Further, microarray of miRNA, isolated from mouse sham left ventricle (LV) (n = 6 & n = 5 for male & female) and chronic MI LV (n = 19 & n = 19) and from human normal LV (n = 6 & n = 6) and ICM LV (n = 4 & n = 5), was conducted. This revealed that 13 mouse miRNAs are sexually dimorphic in MI and 6 in normal heart. In human, 3 miRNAs were sexually dimorphic in ICM and 15 in normal heart. These data revealed miRNA-mRNA networks that operate in a sexually-biased fashion. mRNA and miRNA transcriptome of normal and disease heart show significant sex differences, which might impact the cardiac homeostasis. Together this study provides the first comprehensive picture of the genome-wide program underlying the heart sexual <b>dimorphisms,</b> laying the foundation for gender specific treatment strategies...|$|R
5|$|A {{study from}} 2008 {{indicates}} that sexual <b>dimorphism</b> occurs early during this species' ontogeny. L.canarium males reach sexual maturity at a shorter shell length {{when compared to}} females. Individuals {{are considered to be}} adult by the time the outer lip of their shell is noticeably thickened and flared; growth to adult size takes about a year. The maximum life span of the dog conch differs between sexes; it is estimated at 2 and 2.5 years for females and males, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{differences}} in morphology and development are seen. In the desert locust and the migratory locust, for example, the gregaria nymphs become darker with strongly contrasting yellow and black markings, they grow larger, and have longer developmental periods.

They mature more rapidly and start reproducing earlier, but have {{lower levels of}} fecundity.|$|E
5|$|Banded sea kraits {{primarily}} feed on {{varieties of}} eels, but also eat small fish.

In addition, females hunt {{for only one}} prey item per foraging bout, while males often hunt for multiple items. After hunting, the banded sea kraits return to land in order to digest their prey.|$|E
50|$|Several {{hypothesized}} {{explanations are}} {{given for the}} evolution of sexual size <b>dimorphisms</b> in the Thomisidae and other sister taxa.

40|$|In most taxa {{with male}} <b>dimorphisms,</b> some males are large in body size with exaggerated {{secondary}} sexual characters (exaggerated morph), whereas other {{males in the}} same population are small and have reduced secondary sexual characters (reduced morph). What selective pressures cause male <b>dimorphisms?</b> Reduced morphologies may result when a) some males develop a morphology that, {{in the absence of}} sexual selection pressures for an exaggerated morphology, reduces energetic and developmental costs and/or b) some males opt for an alternative morphology that does well at an alternative behavioral tactic such as cuckoldry. The 2 mechanisms could act together, but each alone is theoretically sufficient to drive <b>dimorphisms.</b> Here, we tested hypothesis "b" (sexual selection for reduced characters) in the plainfin midshipman fish, Porichthys notatus. Behavioral plasticity between territoriality and cuckoldry in an exaggerated male morph (type I) allows for a direct comparison of cuckoldry by exaggerated morph males to cuckoldry by reduced morph (type II) males. Compared with type I cuckolders, type II cuckolders were able to remain near the nest for longer periods before being chased by the territorial type I male, suggesting that the reduced type II morphology allows type II males to prolong the time before attack by territorial males. Combined with other studies showing a role of sexual selection in maintaining the exaggerated morph, the data support the "sexual selection for reduced characters" hypothesis and elucidate how sexual selection can act in different ways on different males to maintain 2 male morphologies within a single species.
