40|$|Although Structured Treatment Interruptions (STI) are {{currently}} not considered an alternative strategy <b>for</b> antiretroviral treatment, <b>their</b> <b>true</b> <b>benefits</b> and limitations {{have not been}} fully established. Some studies suggest the possibility of {{improving the quality of}} life of patients with this strategy; however, the information that has been obtained corresponds mostly to studies conducted in adults, with a lack of knowledge about its impact on children. Furthermore, mutations associated with antiretroviral resistance could be selected due to sub-therapeutic levels of HAART at each interruption period. Genotyping methods to determine the resistance profiles of the infecting viruses have become increasingly important for the management of patients under STI, thus low-abundance antiretroviral drug-resistant mutations (DRM's) at levels under limit of detection of conventional genotyping (< 20 % of quasispecies) could increase the risk of virologic failure. In this work, we analyzed the protease and reverse transcriptase regions of the pol gene by ultra-deep sequencing in pediatric patients under STI with the aim of determining the presence of high- and low-abundance DRM's in the viral rebounds generated by the STI. High-abundance mutations in protease and high- and low-abundance mutations in reverse transcriptase were detected but no one of these are directly associated with resistance to antiretroviral drugs. The results could suggest that the evaluated STI program is virologically safe, but strict and carefully planned studies, with greater numbers of patients and interruption/restart cycles, are still needed to evaluate the selection of DRM's during STI...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Herbs {{and spices}} {{have been used}} for both culinary and {{medicinal}} purposes for centuries. Over the last decade, research into their role as contributors of dietary polyphenols, known to possess a number of properties associated with reducing the risk of developing chronic non-communicable diseases, has increased. However, bearing in mind how these foods are consumed, normally in small quantities and in combination with other foods, it is unclear what <b>their</b> <b>true</b> <b>benefit</b> is from a health perspective. The aim of this review is to use the literature to discuss how preparative and digestive processes, bioavailability and interactions between foods may influence the bioactive properties of these foods, and whether or not polyphenols are responsible for these properties. Furthermore, this review aims to highlight the challenges {{that need to be addressed}} so as to determine the <b>true</b> <b>benefits</b> of these foods and the mechanisms of action that underpin their purported efficacy...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{implications}} of heterogeneously informed consumers in a market for expert services. Our main question is to investigate whether uninformed consumers {{are the most likely}} victims of expert cheating. We show that when consumers are heterogeneously informed on <b>their</b> <b>true</b> <b>benefit</b> from an expensive treatment, there is no equilibrium where the expert only cheats uninformed consumers. In fact, informed high-value consumers are the most frequent victims of cheating. Surprisingly, more information on the consumer side increases the inefficiency of the market outcome in terms of the foregone, but required, treatments. When some consumers receive noisy information signals on whether their problem is serious or minor, while others remain uninformed, in the unique equilibrium the expert is truthful to all types of consumers, regardless of their information status.

40|$|The {{contractor}} prequalification topic has {{had much}} {{written on it}} {{over the last two}} decades. In the past it has been primarily viewed in terms of the appropriate selection of contractors for construction projects. There has been extensive research interest into the functional and process driven aspects of contractor prequalification. However, there has been little research taking a more holistic view of contractor prequalification in terms of the human aspects that surround it. Hence, gaining a wider appreciation on how prequalification systems affect the major stakeholders seems warranted. The use of soft systems thinking allowed for an in-depth and contextual analysis of prequalification issues. This necessitated unstructured in-depth interviews to be carried out with senior industry practitioners. Sifting through their respective experiences allowed for an alternative view of contractor prequalification systems. It allowed a very human perspective of prequalification to emerge. The research suggests that viewing prequalification systems from a human perspective provides a fuller picture of <b>their</b> <b>true</b> <b>benefits</b> and limitations. </p...|$|R

40|$|To {{provide insight}} {{as to how}} cells receive {{information}} from their external surroundings, synthetic hydrogels have emerged as systems for assaying cell function in well-defined microenvironments where single cues can be introduced and subsequent effects individually elucidated. However, as the field seeks to answer more complex biological questions, advanced material systems are needed that allow dynamic alteration of the 3 D cellular environment with orthogonal reactions that enable multiple levels of control of biochemical and biomechanical signals. Here, we sought to synthesize one such 3 D culture system using cytocompatible and wavelength-specific photochemical reactions to create hydrogels that allow orthogonal and dynamic control of the material properties through independent spatiotemporally-regulated photocleavage of crosslinks and photoconjugation of pendant functionalities. Results demonstrate the versatile nature of the chemistry to create programmable niches to study and direct cell function by modifying the local hydrogel environment. Since its conception by Sharpless in 20011, the concept of click chemistry has been rapidly adopted in many disciplines, perhaps most notably in material science, with annual publication numbers continuing to increase exponentially 2 – 5. The click philosophy idealizes reactions that enable researchers to link covalently two reactants in a straightforward, modular, high-yielding manner. The copper(I) -catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) is frequently billed as the quintessential example in meeting these criteria. Though each of the click reactions {{has a variety of}} desirable properties, <b>their</b> <b>true</b> <b>benefit</b> lies in the orthogonality of these reactions with respect to many common reactive groups (e. g., amines, Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data- mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use...|$|R
