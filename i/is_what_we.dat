5|$|Two {{weeks before}} {{starting}} a tour {{to promote the}} album, John Hembree joined the band to replace bassist Jeremy Davis, though Davis ended up rejoining the group after five months away from the band. In February, the group went on Midwest and east coast tour with Halifax, My American Heart, and So They Say. Through the spring of 2006, Paramore was an opening act on tours for both Bayside and The Rocket Summer. The band was initially planned {{to appear on the}} 2006 edition of the Take Action Tour in early March 2006, but Williams came down with flu, which resulted in the band being replaced by Sullivan. The band went on the 2006 edition of the Warped Tour, which took place in Nashville, near the group's hometown. In August and September, the band headlined a tour in the United States with support from Hit the Lights, Cute <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>We</b> Aim For and This Providence, followed by some dates in the United Kingdom in October.|$|E

No; nature made us— nature did it all— not the gods of the religions.|$|E
25|$|At {{absolute}} zero temperature, {{a crystal lattice}} lies in its ground state, and contains no phonons. A lattice at a nonzero temperature has an energy that is not constant, but fluctuates randomly about some mean value. These energy fluctuations are caused by random lattice vibrations, which {{can be viewed as}} a gas of phonons. (The random motion of the atoms in the lattice <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> usually think of as heat.) Because these phonons are generated by the temperature of the lattice, they are sometimes designated thermal phonons.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary with Hume, but {{critical}} of Hume's scepticism, a so-called Scottish school of Common Sense formed, whose basic principle was enunciated by its founder and greatest figure, Thomas Reid:If {{there are certain}} principles, as I think there are, which the constitution of our nature leads us to believe, and which we are under a necessity {{to take for granted}} in the common concerns of life, without being able to give a reason for them — these are what we call the principles of common sense; and what is manifestly contrary to them, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> call absurd.|$|E

25|$|In 1860, Italy {{lacked a}} single {{national}} language: toscano (Tuscan), which <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> now know as Italian, was only {{used as a}} literary language and in Tuscany, while outside other languages were dominant. Even the kingdom's first king, Victor Emmanuel II, was known to speak almost entirely in Piedmontese and French, even to his cabinet ministers. Illiteracy was high, with the 1871 census indicating that 61.9 % of Italian men were illiterate and 75.7 % of Italian women were illiterate. This illiteracy rate was far {{higher than that of}} western European countries in the same time period and also no national popular press was possible due to the multiplicity of regional languages.|$|E
25|$|All Time Low {{released}} {{their debut}} album The Party Scene in July 2005 through independent label Emerald Moon Records. In December, {{it was announced}} that the band was unsigned, but were attracting attention from a number of record labels. In winter 2006, the band performed a showcase for John Janick the founder of record label Fueled by Ramen. They were not signed because Cute <b>Is</b> <b>What</b> <b>We</b> Aim For had recently been taken on by the label, which was {{not in a position to}} sign another band at the time. On March 28, 2006, {{it was announced that}} All Time Low had signed with Hopeless Records. The band was brought to the label's attention by fellow touring band Amber Pacific. Following high school graduation, the members focused on the group full-time, and released the Put Up or Shut Up EP in July.|$|E

25|$|In general The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a {{considerable}} achievement for a first-off author. The country-house-party murder is a stereotype in the detective-story genre, which Christie makes no great use of. Not her sort of occasion, at least later in life, and perhaps not really her class. The family party is much more in her line, and this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have here. This {{is one of the}} few Christies anchored in time and space: we are in Essex, during the First World War. The family is kept together under one roof by the exigencies of war and of a matriarch demanding rather than tyrannical – not one of her later splendid monsters, but a sympathetic and lightly shaded characterisation. If the lifestyle of the family still seems to us lavish, even wasteful, nevertheless we have the half sense that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the Edwardian summer, that the era of country-house living has entered its final phase. Christie takes advantage of this end-of-an-era feeling in several ways: while she uses the full range of servants and their testimony, a sense of decline, of break-up is evident; feudal attitudes exist, but they crack easily. The marriage of the matriarch with a mysterious nobody is the central out-of-joint event in an intricate web of subtle changes. The family is lightly but effectively characterised, and on the outskirts of the story are the villagers, the small businessmen, and the surrounding farmers – the nucleus of Mayhem Parva. It is, too, a very clever story, with clues and red herrings falling thick and fast. We are entering the age when plans of the house were an indispensable aid to the aspirant solver of detective stories, and when cleverness was more important than suspense. But here we come to a problem that Agatha Christie has not yet solved, for cleverness over the long length easily becomes exhausting, and too many clues tend to cancel each other out, as far as reader interest is concerned. These were problems which Conan Doyle never satisfactorily overcame, but which Christie would.".|$|E
