40|$|The {{ability to}} {{dynamically}} calculate and allocate credit risk Economic Capital (EC) at loan level {{is crucial for}} portfolio steering through risk-based pricing. The industry standard credit risk model is the multi-factor normal copula model, which is able to account for portfolio dynamics such as specific risk and overexposure in clusters of assets. Estimating this model's portfolio credit EC and asset-level marginal contributions using simulations is computationally involved. Analytical methods acquire these estimates in a much shorter time span {{at the cost of}} reduced accuracy. We correct and implement one such published analytical method which uses Hermite polynomials to calculate portfolio EC for credit risk. Within this framework we mathematically derive an analytical algorithm for asset-level marginal <b>EC</b> <b>contributions.</b> We benchmark the portfolio <b>EC</b> and marginal <b>contributions</b> given by the corrected analytical method to estimates given by simulations on several portfolios. This benchmark yields the accuracy of the analytical estimates increases with the granularity of the portfolio. Analytically computed risk contributions are more accurate than those generated by simulation when the simulation's running time is restricted to a couple of hours. These improved marginal contribution estimates enable more accurate asset-level risk-based performance measurement, taking into account all diversification benefits present in a credit portfolio...|$|R

40|$|Spontaneous teratocarcinomas are ovarian or {{testicular}} tumors {{which have}} their origins in germ cells. The tumors contain a disorganized array of benign differentiated cells {{as well as}} an undifferentiated population of malignant stem cells, the embryonal carcinoma or EC cells. These pluripotent stem cells in tissue culture share many properties with the transient pluripotent cells of the early embryo, and might therefore serve as models for the investigation of developmental events ill vitro. The property of EC cells of prime interest in this study is an in vivo phenomenon. Certain EC cell lines are known to be regulated ill vivo and to differentiate normally in association with normal embryonic cells, resulting in chimeric mice. These mice have two genetically distinct cell populations, one of which is derived from the originally malignant EC cells. This has usually been accomplished by injection of the EC cells into the Day 3 blastocyst. In this study, the interactions between earlier stage embryos and EC cells have been tested by aggregating clumps of EC cells with Day 2 embryos. The few previous aggregation studies produced a high degree of abnormality in chimeric embryos, but the EC cells employed had known chromosomal abnormalities. In this study, two diploid EC cell lines (P 19 and Pi 0) were aggregated with 2. 5 day mouse embryos, and were found to behave quite differently in the embryonic environment. P 19 containing aggregates generally resorbed early, and the few embryos recovered at midgestation were normal and non-chimeric. Pi 0 containing aggregates survived in high numbers to midgestation, and the Pi 0 cells were very successful in colonizing the embryo. All these embryos were chimeric, and the <b>contribution</b> by the <b>EC</b> cells to each chimera was very high. However, these heavily chimeric embryos were all abnormal. Blastocyst injection had previously produced some abnormal embryos with high Pl 0 contributions in addition to the live born mice, which had lower <b>EC</b> <b>contributions.</b> This study now adds more support to the hypothesis that high <b>EC</b> <b>contributions</b> may be incompatible with normal development. The possibility that the abnormalities were due to the mixing of temporally asynchronous embryonic cell types in the aggregates was tested by aggregating normal pluripotent cells taken from 3. 5 day embryos with 2. 5 day embryos. Early embryo loss was very high, and histological studies showed that the majority of these embryos died by 6. 5 days development. Some embryos escaped this early death such that some healthy chimeras were recovered, in contrast to recovery of abnormal chimeric embryos following Pl 0 -morula aggregations, and non-chimeric embryos following P 19 -morula aggregations. This somewhat surprising adverse effect on development following aggregation of normal cell types suggests that there are developmental difficulties associated with the mixing of asynchronous cell types in aggregates. However, the greater magnitude of the adverse effects when the aggregates contained tumor derived cells suggests that EC cells should not be considered the complete equivalent of the pluripotent cells of the early embryo...|$|R

Co-injection of mannan strongly inhibited ricin uptake by the EC, showing that it was mediated by mannose receptors. On the other hand, co-injection of lactose, which inhibits the galactose-specific association of ricin with cells, enhanced ricin uptake by the EC. The carbohydrate-dependency of the <b>EC</b> <b>contribution</b> to the uptake of ricin in vivo {{was reflected in the}} carbohydrate-dependency of the uptake in vivo by whole liver.

Western blotting showed that the mannose receptors of liver non-parenchymal cells are identical with the mannose receptor previously isolated from alveolar macrophages. The mannose receptors are expressed at a higher level in EC than in KC.

40|$|Blazars are {{classified}} into high, intermediate and low energy peaked sources {{based on the}} location of their synchrotron peak. This lies in infra-red/optical to ultra-violet bands for low and intermediate peaked blazars. The transition from synchrotron to inverse Compton emission falls in the X-ray bands for such sources. We present the spectral and timing analysis of 14 low and intermediate energy peaked blazars ob- served with XMMNewton spanning 31 epochs. Parametric fits to X-ray spectra helps constrain the possible location of transition from the high energy end of the syn- chrotron to the low energy end of the inverse Compton emission. In seven sources in our sample, we infer such a transition and constrain the break energy in the range 0. 6 10 keV. The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is used to estimate the power spectral density (PSD) shape. It is well described by a power law in a majority of light curves, the index being flatter compared to general expectation from AGN, ranging here between 0. 01 and 1. 12, possibly due to short observation durations resulting in an absence of long term trends.

Additional {{samples were collected}} at a rural site for the winter period.

Elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), water-insoluble OC (WINSOC), and water-soluble OC (WSOC) were analyzed for 14 C in order to distin-guish fossil from non-fossil emissions. As wood burning is the single major source of non-fossil <b>EC,</b> its <b>contribution</b> can be quantified directly.

40|$|The Particulate Matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) is used {{together}} with PMCAMx, a regional chemical transport model, {{to estimate how}} local emissions and pollutant transport affect primary and secondary particulate matter mass concentration levels in Paris. During the summer and the winter periods examined, only 13 % of the PM 2. 5 is predicted {{to be due to}} local Paris emissions, with 36 % coming from mid range (50 – 500 km {{from the center of the}} Paris) sources and 51 % from long range transport (more than 500 km from Paris). The local emissions contribution to predicted elemental carbon (EC) is significant, with almost 60 % of the EC originating from local sources during both summer and winter. Approximately 50 % of the predicted fresh primary organic aerosol (POA) originated from local sources and another 45 % from areas 100 – 500 km from the receptor region during summer. Regional sources dominated the secondary PM components. During summer more than 70 % of the predicted sulfate originated from SO 2 emitted more than 500 km away from the center of the Paris. Also more than 45 % of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was due to the oxidation of VOC precursors that were emitted 100 – 500 km from the center of the Paris. The model predicts more contribution from long range secondary PM sources during winter because the timescale for its production is longer due to the slower photochemical activity. PSAT results for contributions of local and regional sources were compared with observation-based estimates from field campaigns that took place during the MEGAPOLI project. PSAT predictions are in general consistent (within 20 %) with these estimates for OA and sulfate. The only exception is that PSAT predicts higher local <b>EC</b> <b>contribution</b> during the summer compared to that estimated from observations...|$|E

The composition of these {{primary and secondary}} fine and ultra fine particles is principally elemental carbon (EC) with adsorbed organic compounds, sulfate, nitrate, ammonia, metals, and other trace elements. The {{purpose of this study}} was to use an advanced air quality modeling technique to predict and analyze the emissions and the primary and secondary aerosols concentrations that come from diesel-fueled sources (DFS). The National Emissions Inventory for 1999 and a severe southeast ozone episode that occurred between August and September 1999 were used as reference. Five urban areas and one rural area in the Southeastern US were selected to compare the main results. For urban emissions, results showed that DFS contributed (77. 9 % ± 8. 0) of EC, (16. 8 % ± 8. 2) of organic aerosols, (14. 3 % ± 6. 2) of nitrate, and (8. 3 % ± 6. 6) of sulfate during the selected episodes. For the rural site, these contributions were lower. The highest DFS contribution on EC emissions was allocated in Memphis, due mainly to diesel non-road sources (60. 9 %). For ambient concentrations, DFS contributed (69. 5 % ± 6. 5) of EC and (10. 8 % ± 2. 4) of primary anthropogenic organic aerosols, where the highest DFS contributions on EC were allocated in Nashville and Memphis on that episode. The DFS contributed (8. 3 % ± 1. 2) of the total ambient PM 2. 5 at the analyzed sites.

40|$|Introduction: The {{self-concept}} on fractured-patient {{is the way}} of {{the patient}} views himself as a whole. The view may cause the patient to feel less confident and may lead the patient to experience anxiety. Such condition requires serious attention in the form of social support. The objective of this research was to identify the association of the self-concept, social support, and anxiety in dealing with fracturedpatient. Method: This research employed correlational design. The samples of this research were in-patients who suffered from femur fractures, underwent treatments for at least three days, aged 25 – 45 and were conscious and, willing {{to be involved in the}} research. The technique used in this research was purposive sampling. Result: Results of the research, when analyzed statistically using the regression analysis, revealed that the correlation between the self-concept and anxiety generated rx 1 y = – 0. 476 with p = 0. 007 (p < 0. 01). Furthermore, the correlation between social support and anxiety generated rx 2 y = – 0. 531 with p = 0. 003 (p < 0. 01) while the correlation among self-concept, social support, and anxiety generated F = 4, 758 at p = 0. 009 (p < 0. 01).

This is particularly true at the remotes sites, where the <b>EC</b> <b>contribution</b> to total particulate carbon is < 6. 5 %, consistent with a negligible impact of anthropogenic combustions locally. The EC and WIOC scavenging ratios were estimated and compared with those of sulfate, also evaluated at the same sampling sites.

40|$|Partitioning and Transmutation (P&T) of {{long-lived}} radionuclides {{in nuclear}} waste {{is one of}} the most notable research areas of the EURATOM Fifth (1998 - 2002) as well as the sixth (2002 - 2006) Framework Programmes (FP). The objective of research work in this area is to provide a basis for evaluating the practicability of P&T, on an industrial scale, for reducing the amount of long lived radionuclides to be disposed of thus easing the waste management problem. In FP 5, there are 15 projects in the area of P&T with a total budget of about 69 M € of which the EU contribution is about 28 M€. A network ADOPT co-ordinates the activities of the accelerator driven system (ADS) design project with those of the four clusters, one on chemical separation (i) PARTITION and three on transmutation, (i) Basic studies (BASTRA), (ii) Technological studies (TESTRA) and (iii) Fuel studies (FUETRA). Each of these clusters is formed by 3 - 4 projects, which are briefly described. Eleven projects have been completed and the remaining ones are due to be completed at the latest in about 2 years. The FP 6 is geared towards creating “European Research Area ” (ERA) by strongly increasing the collaborative research and innovation efforts across Europe. An element in achieving ERA is the organisation of sizeable European “Networks of Excellence ” and “Integrated Projects”. The EC budget of the P&T research in FP 6 is only marginally higher but the emphasis is on organising fewer but fairly large coherent projects. There are two Integrated Projects, one on partitioning “EUROPART ” (started in 2004) and the other on transmutation “EUROTRANS ” (as yet under negotiations) and there is a Specific Targeted Research Project on the impact of P&T on waste management “Red-IMPACT ” (started in 2004). The total funding of these three projects, of 3 - 4 year duration, is approximately 56 M € whereas the <b>EC</b> <b>contribution</b> is about 31 M€. A brief outline of these projects is given. A further call for proposals is planned in Spring 2005. International co-operation in the area of P&T with non-EU countries including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is also outlined. 10...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversitySystemic Sclerosis (SSc) is a {{progressive}} autoimmune disease characterized by vasculopathy, immune dysfunction and fibrosis {{of skin and}} internal organs. Pulmonary fibrosis is the most severe complication. Although pathogenesis of SSc is not completely understood, it {{is believed to be}} initiated by early and persistent damage to endothelial cells (ECs), which may initiate inflammation and activation of fibroblasts. In this study we used subcutaneous instillation of bleomycin (BLM), which induces skin and lung fibrosis similar to SSC. ECs are targeted by BLM, however, the extent of <b>EC</b> <b>contribution</b> to pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis, and the degree of vasculopathy in this model are not fully understood. The core hypothesis of this work is that BLM induced injury to ECs contributes to pathogenic processes, resulting in pulmonary fibrosis. Through a unique method of cell sorting and gene expression analysis, we demonstrated EC injury (Matrix Metalloproteinase 12, von Willebrand Factor) and activation in response to BLM. Activation of ECs was demonstrated by expression of selectins, chemokines, and cytokines, contributing to inflammation and macrophage recruitment. Direct contribution of ECs to fibrosis was demonstrated by up-regulation of pro-fibrotic cytokines (Osteopontin, Connective Tissue Growth Factor, Plasminogen Activation Inhibitor- 1), activation of collagen production by fibroblasts, and expression of Endothelial to Mesenchymal Transition (EndoMT) markers (Fibronectin, Fibroblast Specific Protein- 1). Importantly, responses were sustained, suggesting that ECs perpetuate damage and repair mechanisms that promote fibrosis. Previous work from our lab has shown that transcription factor Friend Leukemia Virus Integration- 1 (Fli 1) is down-regulated in fibroblasts and ECs in SSc, contributing to fibrosis and vasculopathy in the skin. Intriguingly, Fli 1 is also down-regulated in the lung during BLM induced fibrosis, but not in ECs. Further studies demonstrated that Fli 1 was down-regulated in macrophages, where it is regulated by inflammatory signals. Fli 1 was also down-regulated in mesenchymal cells, which includes fibroblasts. Previous in vitro studies have shown that Fli 1 regulates fibrosis through regulation of collagen and other extracellular matrix proteins. In this study, we identified Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase- 3, an important molecule in collagen degradation, as a novel Fli 1 target, revealing another mechanism by which Fli 1 contributes to development of fibrosis...|$|E
30|$|Fine EC content varies {{independently}} from coarse EC content (Fig. 5 a), {{which suggests}} a remote origin of fine EC. The fine particles of EC might be transported {{out of a}} fire site by wind, which is different from coarse EC (Scott 2010). In particular, canopy fires can produce fine EC particles that are susceptible to wind dispersal. Taking into account {{the fact that the}} fine particles could be transported over long distances as aerosols, unusually high contents of fine <b>EC</b> suggest <b>contributions</b> from remote fires. Wildfires occur mainly in spring and autumn in East Asia because fires are mostly triggered by a sudden change in environment. Usually autumn and late winter or early spring experience numerous wildfires. Therefore, fine EC and Asian Dust could have similar transport processes. Based on modern aerosol research (Huang et al. 2014) and high-resolution variations in eolian dust research (Irino and Tada 2003), eastern and northwest China and Mongolia could be sources of fine EC. Strong westerly winds can carry large amounts of fine particulate matter over long distances and could finally deposit them in the Japan Sea.|$|R

40|$|Engagement of {{intercellular}} adhesion molecule- 1 (ICAM- 1) on endothelial cells (ECs) by anti-ICAM coated beads generates vesiculization via {{cell adhesion}} molecule (CAM) -mediated endocytosis, a clathrin-/caveolae-independent pathway involving Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE 1).

Results show that the ICAM- 1 /NHE 1 -dependent CAM-mediated pathway associates with acid sphingomyelinase and ceramide.

Sampling was performed on an event basis and the particulate carbon (elemental carbon, EC, and water insoluble organic carbon, WIOC) content was concentrated on quartz filters for the subsequent analysis by a thermal optical method in order to separate the EC and WIOC fractions. The average EC concentrations range from low values at the Azores (2. 8 ± 4. 3 μg C L− 1) and at the high mountain site of Sonnblick (5. 2 ± 3. 7 μg C L− 1) to high values at the more inland sites of Schauinsland (28 ± 38 μg C L− 1) and K-Puszta (24 ± 24 μg C L− 1). The average WIOC concentrations range from 98 ± 56 μg C L− 1 at the coastal site of Aveiro and 113 ± 78 μg C L− 1 at the Azores to 358 ± 194 μg C L− 1 at the continental site of K-Puszta.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{presented in}} this thesis is aimed {{to provide a more}} detailed understanding of the relation between flux density outbursts seen at radio, optical, and gamma-ray frequencies and the subsequent structural variability as seen by VLBI. Setting tighter observational constraints on parameters required for the synchrotron self-Compton and inverse-Compton modeling of the high-energy radiation is the prime target. A special attention is given to the parsec scale jet kinematics of the BL Lac object S 5 0716 + 714 using mm-VLBI with an angular resolution up to 50 microarcseconds. The aim of the broad-band variability study reported in this thesis is to provide a general physical scenario, which allows to put the observed variation of the source across several decades of frequencies in a coherent context. The densely sampled multi-frequency observations of S 5 0716 + 714 over the past 5 years allow us to study its broad-band flaring behavior from radio to gamma-rays and probe into the physical processes, location and size of the emission regions for the source, which is ultra-compact and known {{to be one of the}} fastest variable blazars. The combination of the broad-band variability characteristics with the VLBI measurements provides new insights into the core region and at the jet base, a view which was not possible in earlier studies at lower VLBI observing frequencies. More explicitly, the correlation of the gamma-ray flaring activity with the emission at optical to radio frequencies is investigated focusing on some prominent flares observed between April 2007 and April 2012. The time evolution of radio (cm and mm) spectra is tested in the context of a standard shock-in-jet model. The broad-band spectral energy distribution (SED) of the source is investigated using a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) model and also with a hybrid model, which involves a SSC and an external Compton (EC) component. The intense optical monitoring of the source reveals fast quasi-periodic variations superimposed on a long-term variability trend at a time scale of 360 days. Episodes of fast variability recur on time scales of 60 -to- 70 days. The prominent and simultaneous flaring activity at optical and gamma-ray frequencies favors the SSC mechanism for the production of the high-energy emission. The high-energy (gamma-ray - optical) flares propagate down to radio frequencies with a time delay of 65 days following a power-law dependence in frequency with a slope 0. 3. This indicates that the internal opacity effects play a key role in producing time delays among light curves at optically thin and thick wavelengths. The evolution of the radio flares agrees with the formation of a shock and its propagation with a contribution of geometrical variation in addition to intrinsic variations in the jet. The broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the source during different flaring episodes can not be well described by a pure one-zone SSC model, and require an additional <b>EC</b> <b>contribution</b> from the external radiation field, which is dominated by Ly-alpha emission from the broad-line region (BLR). A detailed investigation of the high-energy spectrum supports the view that the BLR has a significant impact on the observed gamma-ray spectral breaks at a few GeVs, due to pair production. The energy density of this external radiation field varies between 10 ^- 6 to 10 ^- 5 erg cm^- 3, which is a factor of 1000 lower than what is expected for a typical quasar, and is a reasonable value for a gas poor (emission line-free) BL Lac object like S 5 0716 + 714. High-frequency VLBI observations revealed a standing feature observed at 0. 1 milli-arcsecond separation from the core. Further downstream, the individual component motion indicates jet acceleration. Curved trajectories in the component motion, variations in the jet ridge line, and a position angle swing at the base of the jet are all consistent with the helical jet model, in which the ejected components transport angular momentum away from the central engine. The observed correlation of the core flux with the single dish radio flux light curves and the concurrent variations in the inner jet position angle with high-energy (optical/gamma-ray) flux suggests that the high-energy emission is coming from a region, which is located inside the mm-VLBI core, so upstream to the tau= 1 surface on scales < 0. 27 parsec towards the central black hole. ...|$|E
30|$|Biofuels {{production}} has significantly increased {{during the last}} decade due to a favourable framework and the support of several policies. Nowadays biofuels represent 11 % of the total biomass produced in EU- 27, being biodiesel the highest contributor to the total production, 60 % (<b>EC</b> 2011). The <b>contribution</b> of Europe to biofuels production is expected to increase due to its high potential. Nevertheless, this affirmation could be misleading because of two reasons: i) According to many studies the potential for European biofuels production is clearly limited, and ii) Currently (2013), a substantial share of biofuels used in Europe is based on imported feedstock. In case of increasing, rapeseed oil seems {{to be one of the}} raw materials expected to contribute the most in the share of biodiesel. So, in order to cover this potential fuel in the analysis, biodiesel from rapeseed oil was included as dataset.|$|R

40|$|Particulate {{matter was}} {{collected}} at an urban site in Göteborg (Sweden) in February/March 2005 and in June/July 2006. Additional {{samples were collected}} at a rural site for the winter period. Elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), water-insoluble OC (WINSOC), and water-soluble OC (WSOC) were analyzed for 14 C in order to distinguish fossil from non-fossil emissions. As wood burning is the single major source of non-fossil <b>EC,</b> its <b>contribution</b> can be quantified directly. For non-fossil OC, the wood burning fraction was determined independently by levoglucosan and 14 C analysis and combined using Latin-hypercube sampling (LHS). For the winter period, the relative <b>contribution</b> of <b>EC</b> from wood burning to the total EC was &gt; 3 times higher at the rural site compared to the urban site, whereas the absolute concentrations of EC from wood burning were comparable at both sites. Thus, the urban site is substantially more influenced by fossil EC emissions. For summer, biogenic emissions dominated OC concentrations most likely due to secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. During both seasons, a more pronounced fossil signal was observed for Göteborg than has previously been reported for Zurich, Switzerland. Analysis of air mass origin using back trajectories suggests that the fossil impact was larger when local sources dominated, whereas long-range transport caused an enhanced non-fossil signal. In comparison to other European locations, concentrations of levoglucosan and other monosaccharide anhydrides were low for the urban and the rural site {{in the area of}} Göteborg during winter.

EC is emitted from biomass and/or fossil fuel, incomplete combustion processes as fine particles (Salma et al. 2004). The abundant carbonaceous aerosols in Saraikela Kharsawan are largely caused by the regional winter time coal-burning emission due to house heating. This is also mainly due to the far distance from EC sources (e.g. traffic and industrial emissions). Higher concentrations of <b>EC</b> imply that <b>contributions</b> from anthropogenic sources are higher in winter than in summer season. When the concentrations of OC are comparing between summer, monsoon and winter, it may be concluded that the organic aerosols have an additional sources for ex. Biogenic emissions in summer because the production of secondary aerosol is equally significant in both the seasons due to high existing solar radiations, and temperature over the region, which are adequate to endorse a photochemical process and due to elevated humidity in the monsoon season the OC and WSOC concentration has been recorded higher (Youn et al. 2013).|$|R
