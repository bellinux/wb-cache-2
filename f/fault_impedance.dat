40|$|Abstract:- This paper investigates {{and compares}} {{the effects of}} dynamic fault impendence {{variation}} on the accuracy of estimating location of faults on series compensated transmission lines, using a novel fault location algorithm based on the measurement of instantaneous signals, derived from both ends of high voltage transmission lines. In order to estimate fault location accurately, {{it is necessary to}} compute precisely the voltage drops in series compensation units during the fault. However, the methods available for such computations induce considerable errors in fault location estimation algorithms, due to the complexity of the series compensation units. Furthermore, in these methods, <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> has been assumed fixed during the fault. In this paper, the <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> used in the models has been considered variable and its dynamic inclusion in the fault estimation algorithm has been investigated. The developed algorithm has been tested using the ATP software with 400 KV, 300 km long transmission line interconnecting two equivalent power systems. The algorithm performed well with fixed <b>fault</b> <b>impedance.</b> However, by representing the <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> in its dynamic form, the accuracy of the algorithm has not changed. Such simulation of the <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> is more accurate than the assumption of fixed values. The presented results show that the new algorithm is capable to estimate accurately the location of faults under different conditions, including dynamic <b>fault</b> <b>impedance.</b> The paper will discuss the results obtained and conclusion will be made on the novel scheme for fault location estimation on series compensated high voltage transmission lines...|$|E

30|$|According to its fault character, DC microgrids fault {{types are}} pole-to-pole fault and pole-to-ground fault. The pole-to-ground faults {{are the most}} common in {{industrial}} systems [23]. Generally, the <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> of pole-to-pole faults is low. However, the <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> of pole-to-ground faults can be either low or high. On the other hand, the fault types can be bus fault and feeder fault based on the fault location. As mentioned, the electronic equipment is vulnerable and the tolerance of the over current is finite. The fault would be much severer when the fault location is closer to the energy sources; therefore the bus fault is critical for the whole system. Faults inside VSCs and batteries may cause a pole-to-pole short-circuit fault and these are terminal faults that generally cannot be quickly cleared. In these cases, the devices have to be replaced and using fuses could be a proper choice.|$|E
40|$|Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of <b>fault</b> <b>impedance</b> {{measurement}} algorithms {{that are}} used in Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs) is presented in this seminar. The proposed methodology is useful when evaluating the characteristic of the algorithm for distance protection of a transmission line as affected by additional parallel line. The methodology is useful when parameters are uncertain. The computation in GSA relies on Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) technique to calculate variance of the measurement error as well as parts of this variance that are contributed by uncertainty of individual parameters. Different conditions will affect variation of parameters in this problem, e. g. load flow angles, geometry of towers, non-homogeneous system, transmission line parameters, error in relay setting as well as fault resistance which cannot be measured.
