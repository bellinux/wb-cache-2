Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic print or an IMAX one." ...|$|E

I was smiling and I was dancing, and I was living through this music." [...] As with her earlier recordings and many of her performances, Bear donates a portion of all proceeds to charity. In July 2013 {{she was part of}} a few Quincy Jones 80th birthday concerts in Montreux, Switzerland, Seoul, South Korea and in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|... 1935: Film {{director}} King Vidor {{was born}} in Galveston and survived the great Galveston Hurricane of 1900. [...] Based on that experience, he published a fictionalized account of that cyclone, titled [...] "Southern Storm", for the May 1935 issue of Esquire magazine. Erik Larson excerpts a passage from that article in his 1999 book, Isaac's Storm:I remember now that {{it seemed as if}} we were in a bowl looking up toward the level of the sea. [...] As we stood there in the sandy street, my mother and I, I wanted to take my mother's hand and hurry her away. [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the sea was going to break {{over the edge of the}} bowl and come puring down upon us.|$|E

60|$|Certainly my offer {{does not}} sound very magnificent, {{but it was}} great to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept over my heart, and <b>I</b> almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the seventy-nine camels that were left were nothing in comparison.|$|R
2500|$|... "I am most {{surprised}} by {{those moments when}} <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the sentences, dreams, and pages that have made me so ecstatically happy have not come from my own imagination– that another power has found them and generously presented them to me." ...|$|R
2500|$|The album {{did receive}} {{some level of}} criticism, though. thenewreview.net stated [...] "With songs like 'Ride Insane' 'Here and Now' and 'Nowhere', I became a little bored. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were {{listening}} to songs I had already heard before by the band, or perhaps even elsewhere, and wasn’t completely blown away by what was there." [...] Guitarinternational.com stated [...] "Cold Day Memory is a killer release, and one that should act to propel the band into the new decade with {{a renewed sense of}} confidence, hopefully forgetting, at least somewhat, the events that haunted them {{for the majority of the}} past decade. If this record is any indication of things to come, then we could be hearing great things from a band that has more than paid their dues, and come screaming back onto the scene, leaving no doubt that they deserve to be included next to the biggest names in Metal today." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Kanins {{rented a}} house in Malibu for their honeymoon, and after buying an A. J. Liebling New Yorker short story about a {{boarding}} house for boxers, they spent [...] {{the next six months}} writing the adaptation, Sunday Punch (1942). They knew they were on the track to a partnership when MGM bought the screenplay. [...] "We would make a story outline together with rather detailed descriptions of the scenes. Then we divided up the writing, each taking the scenes we felt strongly about. Then [...] {{one or the other of}} us would put it all together into a single draft. We did find a common voice, though we had different strengths. As an artist, Michael brought a great visual sense to the process. I was a people person who loved the characters and the dialogue. Through the collaboration, we learned a lot from each other and about each other. But the time came when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we were together 48 hours a day. Writing with someone else always requires some degree of compromise, as does marriage. When it came down to the question of which would survive, the marriage or the writing partnership, it was a pretty easy decision. But I [...] remember that it was a challenge convincing the powers that be that we had been successful writers individually and would be again. We were hyphenated in people's minds: Fay-and-Michael Kanin. To again become Fay Kanin and Michael Kanin took some doing." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{was posted}} on {{attachment}} to the 3rd The King's Own Hussars, which was serving in the North African Campaign at the time, and joined the regiment {{just in time for}} the beginning of Operation Compass. This was a British offensive against Italian forces in North Africa, which began in December, 1940, and participated in the Battle of Sidi Barrani. In the aftermath of one battle, he was detailed to supervise a burial party and came across a damaged Italian tank, its entire crew dead; unable to recover the bodies, Farran set the tank's petrol tank on fire. After Operation Compass came to an end, the Hussars were transferred to the island of Crete, to reinforce the British and Commonwealth forces that were stationed there after their retreat from Greece. Farran was attached to the regiment's 'C' Squadron, which was located several miles west of Canea when the Germans began their invasion of Crete on 20 May 1941. Farran was ordered to take a troop of tanks and block a road that led from the village of Galatas, and shortly afterwards sighted and killed a number of German troops escorting a group of 40 captured hospital patients. The troop came under attack from Stukas and well hidden ground forces. Returning from this mission Farran's troop encountered several Germans who attempted to surrender; he ordered them shot, later writing that the incident occurred in the heat of the moment. [...] On 21 May, the 10th Infantry Brigade launched a successful assault on Cemetery Hill, in which Farran participated. German forces were eventually able to break through the British and Commonwealth positions around Galatas, and Farran was part of a counter-attack in an attempt to retake the village. He protested about the unsuitability of his light tanks for the task but was told that no heavy tanks were left. Farran later wrote of his guilt at allowing the dangerous lead position to be taken by a subordinate -"I did not care for orders when it suited me, but this time I had chosen to obey them because I knew that I would be killed if I did not. I should have been in that leading tank. Instead, there was Skedgewell dead and his pretty young wife waiting at home. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I had murdered him." [...] During the action he was wounded in the right arm and both of his legs, and as a result he was captured by German forces. It was at this time that he was awarded the Military Cross, for gallantry during his service in Crete.|$|E

60|$|There {{have been}} one or two seasons in my life during which <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the {{darkness}} of sorrow and desolation that crushed my inmost heart could never pass away until death should make me cease to feel. The present was such a season.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite abashed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> myself {{had done}} {{something}} to rouse it.|$|R
60|$|After {{that his}} voice grew faint, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I were walking in a dream.|$|E
60|$|Still I {{could not}} speak. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{the whole affair}} were a dream, and looked on and listened with a vacant smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "No indeed!" [...] I exclaimed earnestly. And indeed <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{one could}} not easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. When Sibyl came in {{this morning}} with an {{imperative}} demand {{to be allowed to}} go off and do good with flowers in the homes of virtuous poverty, as well as the hospitals and prisons, <b>I</b> certainly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there had been an interposition, if you will allow me to say so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep it, John, {{and it may}} {{be useful}} yet. I have no fears. Ever since we prayed <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> our {{guardian}} angels had their wings round us." [...] She was like a guardian angel herself as she turned to the shrinking Sadie, and coaxed some little hope back into her despairing heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "I soon {{realized}} that Miriam was in some mysterious fashion different from other people. I think everyone who met her felt the same way. Yet it was a feeling hard to define. For my own part <b>I</b> simply <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she belonged to another world, and {{that part of the}} time she--her soul, you know--was back there again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just the same, both one {{and other}} of us," [...] he replied. [...] "Before you spoke six words <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we'd parted only yesterday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I should so {{much like}} to.' <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> indeed it would relieve {{me to be able}} to confide in somebody, I wanted sympathy so badly.|$|E
60|$|From that moment, {{whenever}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it {{was impossible}} to take another step, I looked at Darius, and forced myself to forget weariness or hunger.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not so}} now," [...] he replied. [...] "God forbid! But where better {{men have}} been led astray, I have been bewildered; till, Ethel, <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the ground were {{slipping}} from beneath my feet, and I have only been able to hide my eyes, and entreat that I might know the truth." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{it really}} did me good, for though nobody but Charley and I knew {{anything}} about it, <b>I</b> somehow <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it had diminished the separation between Ada and me and had brought us together again for those moments. I went back, not quite accustomed yet to the change, but all the better for that hovering about my darling.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{begin with}} 'The Prisoners of Poverty,' {{and perhaps it}} will show us {{something}} to do," [...] said Lizzie. [...] "But I must say <b>I</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> shop-girls needed much help; they generally seem so contented with themselves, and so pert or patronizing to us, that I don't pity them a bit, though {{it must be a}} hard life." ...|$|R
60|$|In a word, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were my {{duty and}} {{obligation}} {{to go with}} them. My guardian did not seek to dissuade me, and I went.|$|E
60|$|He {{stopped to}} kiss me on the forehead, and I sobbed and wept afresh. For <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I could not bear the painful delight of his praise.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I couldn't help it,' again {{said the}} girl. 'The river noise was so like everything--and I knew the way--and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I must go before any one was up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was {{so hungry}} <b>I</b> just <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> had to chew something," [...] she protested. [...] "You know well enough what breakfast was like, Jerry Meredith. I COULDN'T eat {{scorched}} porridge and my stomach just felt so queer and empty. The gum helped a lot--and I didn't chew VERY hard. I didn't make any noise and I never cracked the gum once." ...|$|R
6000|$|Large {{tears came}} {{dropping}} from Leonard's eyes, as he undid the paper, {{and looked at}} the work, then said, 'Last time I saw that pattern, my mother was working it! Dear child!

6000|$|Margaret, {{in words}} more {{adequate}} {{to express the}} possession the project had gained of Ethel's ardent mind, explained {{the whole history of}} it. [...] "I do believe she looks on it as a sort of call," [...] said she, [...] "and <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> ought not to hinder her, and yet I did not know whether it was right, at her age, to let her undertake so much." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{an awful}} charm was framing round and {{gathering}} over me: I trembled {{to hear some}} fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.|$|E
60|$|So slow, so eager, so bloodless and gaunt, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Richard were wasting away {{beneath the}} eyes of this adviser and there were {{something}} of the vampire in him.|$|E
60|$|For {{a reason}} that I had, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> my eyes would start out of my head. I {{acknowledged}} his attention incoherently, and began to {{think this was a}} dream.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have sailed under false colors."

6000|$|...

6000|$|... "I {{know who}} she is!" [...] cried Mary by a sudden inspiration. [...] "Is not your name Harvey!

Dear creature, <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you were my own sister. He--Mr. Thurnall-- wrote often about all your heroism." ...|$|R
