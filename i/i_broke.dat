5|$|Little {{was born}} on 19 July 1895 at Hawthorn, a suburb of Melbourne, to Canadian James Little, a seller of medical and {{surgical}} books, and his Victorian-born wife Susan. His family heritage was Scottish, and he was educated at Camberwell Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne, {{where he was a}} swimming medallist. He entered his father's business as a travelling salesman, and was living with his family at Windsor when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out in August 1914.|$|E
5|$|Somervell {{traveled}} to Europe for his two months' graduation leave {{and was in}} Paris when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out. Reporting to the U.S. Embassy in Paris for volunteer duty, he became an assistant to the military attaché. He took charge of refugee funds and dispensed $1,000,000 to help American citizens to get back home.|$|E
5|$|When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out in 1914, Khrushchev was {{exempt from}} {{conscription}} {{because he was}} a skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter of the elevator operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.|$|E

5|$|When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out {{in summer}} of 1914, the French {{military}} put Schweitzer and Albert, Germans in a French colony, under supervision at Lambaréné, where they continued their work. In 1917, exhausted by over four years' work and by tropical anaemia, {{they were taken}} to Bordeaux and interned first in Garaison and then from March 1918 in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence.|$|E
5|$|When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out, Cobby {{attempted}} to {{enlist in the}} Australian Imperial Force but his employer, the Commonwealth Bank, refused to release him as his position of clerk was considered an essential occupation. He eventually managed to join the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 23December 1916, despite a professed {{lack of interest in}} flying. He became a founding member of No.4 Squadron AFC, and embarked for England aboard RMS Omrah on 17January 1917.|$|E
5|$|When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out, the United States {{maintained}} {{a policy of}} isolationism, avoiding conflict while trying to negotiate peace between the warring nations. However, when a German U-boat sank the British liner Lusitania in 1915, with 128 Americans aboard, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied and Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. He repeatedly warned that the U.S. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the oldest}} of Britain's battleships at the time, Magnificent was a guard ship on the Humber when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out. She was then, {{together}} with her sister ship , assigned to Scapa Flow as a guard ship. In 1915, she was stripped of her main armament, and later in that year was converted to a troopship {{for use in the}} Dardanelles Campaign. Returning to England in 1916, she was inactive until late 1917, at which time she was converted to an ammunition ship. She continued to serve in this role until 1921, at which time she was decommissioned before being scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{ordered the}} ship in 1911 as Rio de Janeiro from the British company Armstrong Whitworth. However, the {{collapse}} of Brazil's rubber boom and a warming in relations with Argentina, the country's chief rival, led to the ship's sale while under construction to the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans renamed her Sultan Osman I, after the empire's founder, and the ship was nearly complete when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out. The British government seized her {{for use by the}} Royal Navy, together with another Ottoman dreadnought being constructed in Britain. This act caused resentment in the Ottoman Empire, as the payments for both ships were complete, and contributed to the decision of the Ottoman government to join the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|Early in his {{political}} career, Piłsudski became {{a leader of}} the Polish Socialist Party. Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won by force of arms, he created the Polish Legions. In 1914 he anticipated the outbreak of a European war, the Russian Empire's defeat by the Central Powers, and the Central Powers' defeat by the western powers. When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out, he and his Legions fought under Austrian army control against Russia. In 1917, with Russia faring badly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was arrested by the Germans.|$|E

5|$|Illustrious was {{assigned}} to the Mediterranean Fleet until 1904. Transferred to the Channel Fleet (which was subsequently reorganised to the Atlantic Fleet) she underwent a refit which was duly completed in early 1906. Rendered obsolete by the emergence of the new dreadnoughts, she served with the Home Fleet from 1908. One of the oldest battleships in the Royal Navy when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out, she served as a guard ship at various regions around Northern England until late 1915. Her main armament was removed and she then served as a store ship {{for the remainder of the}} war. She was decommissioned in 1919 and scrapped the following year.|$|E
5|$|In June 1911, Charlotte {{attended}} {{her cousin}} George V's coronation in England, but the country's summer heat left her bed-ridden with a swollen face and {{pain in her}} limbs. On 25 June 1914, her husband inherited his father's dukedom and became Bernhard III, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out on 28 July; Bernhard left for the front while Charlotte remained behind to oversee the duchy, serving mainly as a figurehead. During the war, Charlotte increasingly experienced various pains including chronic aches, swollen legs, and kidney problems. The degree of the pain became so severe that she took opium as her only comfortable treatment.|$|E
5|$|Kelly's {{maternal}} {{grandfather was}} an Argentine-born, Italian-speaking opera singer, Count Ercole Filippini, a leading baritone for the La Scala Opera Company in Milan. Filippini was touring Australia in 1914 with a Spanish opera company when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out; Filippini stayed and later married Anne McPharland, {{one of his}} students. As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia's first female symphony orchestra conductor. She sang the role of Marguerite in Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) Radio Perth's performance of Faust in 1928. Kelly's grandparents started the Italo-Australian Opera Company, which toured {{the country in the}} 1920s.|$|E

5|$|The first {{gendarmerie}} members {{arrived in}} Albania on November 10, 1913. They were soon {{faced with a}} peasant revolt. One International Gendarmerie officer was killed and many were imprisoned after the revolt erupted in June 1914. Dutch officers were gradually replaced by officers from Austria-Hungary and Germany, who arrived in Durrës on July 4. Soon, World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out and by August 4, most of the Dutch officers {{had returned to the}} Netherlands. By September 19, 1914, the last two imprisoned officers were released.|$|E
5|$|When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out Majestic, {{together}} {{with the rest of}} the squadron, was attached to the Channel Fleet during the early stages of the war before being detached for escort duties with Canadian troop convoys. She then had spells as a guard ship at the Nore and the Humber. In early 1915, she was dispatched to the Mediterranean for service in the Dardanelles Campaign. She participated in bombardments of Turkish forts and supported the Allied landings at Gallipoli. On 27 May 1915, she was torpedoed by a U-boat at Cape Helles, sinking with the loss of 49 men.|$|E
5|$|When World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out, the British cut {{the transatlantic}} {{telegraph}} cable linking the US to Germany {{in order to}} control the flow of information between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicist Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.|$|E

5|$|Hannover and {{her sisters}} saw {{extensive}} service with the fleet. The ship took part in all major training maneuvers until World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out in July 1914. Hannover {{and her sisters}} were immediately pressed into guard duties {{in the mouth of}} the Elbe River {{while the rest of the}} fleet mobilized. The ship took part in a number of fleet advances, which culminated in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May– 1 June 1916. During the battle, Hannover served as the flagship for the IV Division of the II Battle Squadron. After Jutland, Hannover and her three surviving sisters were removed from active duty with the fleet to serve as guard ships. In 1917, Hannover was briefly used as a target ship before being returned to guard duties in the Baltic Sea. The ship was decommissioned in December 1918, shortly after the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|He later {{enlisted in}} the Ottoman army when World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out, where he {{received}} military training and was attached as a chaplain to a base near Damascus. Returning to Jableh before the war's end, al-Qassam used funds from his planned expedition to Libya to organize a local defense force to fight the French occupation. His principal role in the local resistance was financing the acquisition of weapons for Jableh's militia. By 1919, French forces moved into the coastal area of northern Syria while Faisal I established the Kingdom of Syria in Damascus as an independent Arab state. During this period, al-Qassam's Jableh militia fought against local French-backed Alawite militiamen who occupied areas around the city. The Alawites were eventually repelled, but French forces moved in soon after to consolidate their control. Consequently, al-Qassam {{and many of his}} disciples left Jableh for Mount Sahyun where he established a base near the village of Zanqufeh to launch guerrilla raids against the French Army.|$|E
5|$|In July 1914, World War <b>I</b> <b>broke</b> out in Europe; the United States {{remained}} neutral for {{the first}} three years of the war. Tensions with Germany came to a head in early 1917 following the German unrestricted submarine warfare campaign, which sank several American merchant ships in European waters. On 6 April 1917, the United States declared war on Germany. The Connecticut-class ships initially were used for training gunners and engine room personnel that would be necessary for the rapidly expanding wartime fleet. In June 1918, New Hampshire and Louisiana were involved in a serious gunnery accident, where gunners aboard the former accidentally hit the latter, killing one and injuring several other men. The following month, Louisiana was used to test Arthur Pollen's Argo Clock, the first fire control system to use an analog computer to calculate firing solutions.|$|E
