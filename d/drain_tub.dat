50|$|The kolibri 560 is a Dutch cabin {{sailing boat}} {{designed}} in 1963 by G.A. Pfeiffer and built by Antoon van den Brink and his sons. The boats {{were a great}} success because they were sold as a self building package which made them affordable {{for a lot of}} people. The building packages were sold until the early 1980s and delivery periods of one year were the norm. The kolibri 560 is a 5.60 m long, 2.00 m wide with a depth of 1.00 m, sailing boat which is unsinkable, has a self <b>draining</b> <b>tub</b> and is sea worthy. Four people can sleep in this boat and it was presented at the HISWA exposition (a Dutch boat exposition) in 1964. Over a thousand were sold. In 2007 a polyester version was developed and was nicknamed Polybri.|$|R
50|$|Sibulkin {{was also}} once {{involved}} in an experiment trying to investigate if the coriolis force due to {{the rotation of the}} Earth could be seen in the form of spiraling water around the outlet when <b>draining</b> a bath <b>tub.</b> He was, however, usuccessful.|$|R
50|$|During {{a normal}} cycle, most Whirlpool-built wig-wag {{equipped}} washers will fill, start the motor, then engage the wash solenoid. Upon {{completion of the}} wash mode, the wash (agitate) solenoid will be turned off, which will allow the pump to <b>drain</b> the <b>tub.</b> After a minute or two, the timer will then engage the spin wig-wag which will cause {{the rotation of the}} tub. This is in contrast to most other top-load washing machines which start spinning and draining simultaneously. There are no pauses between cycles in these machines.|$|R
50|$|The To-Do List - The contestants, {{in their}} final challenge, must {{complete}} all of their incomplete challenges so their rooms are presentable. As with previous years, each task on the to-do list must {{be done in the}} order prescribed therein (roughly corresponding to the order in which they are introduced). Dan hits a snag on the first item (the soundproof headboard), but eventually finishes to work on getting the dug-in spacers out of his bathtub tiles. Matt chews through the first three items easily, though his towel rack returns to frustrate him. He soon completes it to work on grouting his tiles. Rob has time to assist Charlene in her <b>tub</b> <b>drains,</b> though her <b>tub's</b> water intakes still leak. Ajay is doing his tasks out of order (grouting before his cold water pipes are installed), which isn't helping him go any faster; most of his time is focused on the tub's plumbing. By the time Ajay's tub is complete, Matt's entire room is complete, and only decorations remain. Rob's room and Dan's room both finish soon after, while Charlene and Ajay end up cutting corners to meet the deadline.|$|R
40|$|Dishwashing machine cleans eating {{utensils}} {{in either}} Earth gravity or zero gravity of outer space. Cycle {{consists of three}} phases: filling, washing, and <b>draining.</b> Rotation of <b>tub</b> creates artificial gravity aiding recirculation of water during washing phase in absence of true gravity. Centrifugal air/water separator helps system function in zero gravity. Self-cleaning filter contains interdigitating blades catching solid debris when water flows between them. Later, blades moved {{back and forth in}} scissor-like manner to dislodge debris, removed by backflow of water...|$|R
50|$|The film is {{centered}} on two men in a bathtub; it is implied that they are veterans of some past conflict but revealed that they are currently in a mental institution. The first man is paranoid about the <b>drain</b> of the <b>tub,</b> the second indifferent to it. After the conversation {{between the two men}} progresses, a vine-like tendril emerges from the drain to strangle the first man. The second shows no emotion to this sudden turn of events and the film ends.|$|R
5000|$|Born in the Bronx to a Jewish {{family and}} raised in Colorado, Glatman {{exhibited}} antisocial behavior and sadomasochistic sexual tendencies from an early age. At the age of 12, his parents noticed he had a red, swollen neck. He described being in the bathtub, placing a rope around his neck, running it through the <b>tub</b> <b>drain,</b> and pulling it tight against his neck, [...] "achieving some kind of sexual pleasure from this act." [...] His mother {{took him to the}} family physician and was told he [...] "would grow out of it." ...|$|R

50|$|But the Cat lets {{himself into}} their {{house to get}} out of the snow, and when the brother follows him in, he finds the Cat eating a cake in the tub with the hot water on and the cold water too. He yells at the Cat, turns off the water, and <b>drains</b> the <b>tub</b> only to find that a long pink ring has formed around the sides of the bath tub. The Cat offers to help, but his {{preliminary}} attempts to remove the pink spot fail as he only transfers the mess to a succession of other objects: their mother's white dress, the wall, their father's pair of $10 shoes, a rug, and their father's bed. Unsure of how to remove the stain from the bed, the Cat calls on the help of Little Cat A, who lives inside his hat, who lifts his hat to reveal Little Cat B, who reveals Little Cat C. The three Little Cats go to work, sending the stain to the television, then a pan, and finally outside.|$|R
5000|$|A {{match cut}} {{occurs at the}} end of Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest. As Cary Grant pulls Eva Marie Saint up from Mount Rushmore, the cut then goes to him pulling her up to his bunk on the train. The match cut here skips over the courting, the {{marriage}} proposal, and the actual marriage of the two characters who had for much of the film been adversaries. Another Hitchcock film to employ the use of a match cut is Psycho. Right after Marion Crane is murdered in the famous [...] "shower scene", the camera shows blood flowing down the <b>drain</b> of the <b>tub,</b> then cuts (dissolves) to a shot of Marion's eye.|$|R
5000|$|In June 2002, Graeme {{was stuck}} to a hot <b>tub</b> <b>drain</b> by suction. Efforts {{by her mother}} to free her were {{unsuccessful}} and when two men eventually were able to free her (postmortem), the drain broke from the force. Although Graeme drowned, her official {{cause of death was}} [...] "suction entrapment due to a faulty drain cover". Following Graeme's death in June 2002, her mother, Nancy Baker, began work to advocate pool and spa safety. She began lobbying Congress to pass legislation to require anti-entrapment drain covers as well as other pool and spa safety devices. Sponsored by U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, The Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act was included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 as Title XIV. [...] EISA was introduced to Congress on January 12, 2007 and signed into law on December 19, 2007 by President George W. Bush.|$|R
60|$|I seated {{myself on}} a barrel by the fire, and {{stretched}} my limbs, which were cramped and stiffened by their confinement, {{while one of}} the seamen bathed the cut on my head with a wet kerchief, and another laid out some food on a case in front of me. The rest of the gang had trooped away {{to the mouth of}} the cave to prepare the lugger, save only two or three who stood on guard round the ill-fated gauger. He lay with his back resting {{against the wall of the}} cave, and his arms crossed over his breast, glancing round from time to time at the smugglers with menacing eyes, as a staunch old hound might gaze at a pack of wolves who had overmatched him. I was turning it over in my own mind whether aught could be done to help him, when Murgatroyd came over, and dipping a tin pannikin into the open rum <b>tub,</b> <b>drained</b> it to the success of my mission.|$|R
5000|$|A drain {{is defined}} as {{plumbing}} fitting installed on the suction side of a pump in a pool, spa or hot <b>tub.</b> <b>Drains</b> are now required to be [...] "unblockable." [...] This term has previously been defined in the [...] "definitions" [...] section. Four main ways of keeping a drain from being blockable are outlined as: large aspect covers, long channels, large outlet grates and circulation designs that do not include fully submerged suction outlets. In the United States, if a pool or spa does not employ an unblockable drain, it must include, at a minimum, {{one of the following}} safety systems: a safety vacuum release system (SVRS) as defined in [...] "definitions,' a suction limiting vent system with a tamper resistant atmospheric opening, a gravity drainage system that utilizes a collector tank, an automatic pump shut-off system, a device or system that disables the drain or any other system certified by the consumer product safety commission.|$|R
5000|$|Troy Dean Prater (September 28, 1958 - March 14, 1996) was a {{professional}} American football player who played defensive end for seven seasons for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Buffalo Bills. He {{is survived by his}} wife Barbara Prater who passed shortly after his death from cancer on July 26th, 1996, and his two daughter's Regan and Jessica Prater. His passing came as a shock to the entire family, to the sudden and distressing way he was found while relocating his wife and daughter's to upstate New York. He was en route from his former home in Denver, Pa., to Hamburg, a Buffalo suburb, where he had accepted a management job with Wal-Mart of Western New York. Authorities said Prater slipped in the bath tub, suffered a severe blow to the head and was knocked unconscious. His body apparently plugged the <b>drain,</b> causing the <b>tub</b> to fill with water. He most likely suffered from epilepsy, had a seizure and was knocked unconscious. His daughter has epilepsy [...]|$|R

Many merchant and visitors influence the need for public toilets. public toilets in Indonesia is inadequate, especially sanitation of public toilet is still far from expected. The bacteria most commonly found in all places in the toilet is a bacteria that normally exist in human skin. Poor sanitation in the toilet will facilitate growth of bacteria, viruses, fungi such as Candida albicans. This study aimed to find a public toilet sanitation management {{and the existence of}} Candida albicans in the tub water of public toilet in traditional markets. This studies was descriptive, to describe the {{management of}} sanitary toilet in traditional markets and Candida albicans in the tub water in public toilets. Object of this study is sanitary public toilets in traditional markets. In this study, a survey was also conducted on the fungus Candida albicans tubs toilets that are common in some traditional markets. The results showed the Pasar 3 toilet almost all variables meet health requirements established Pasar 1 toilet while the least meet the variable requirements. Management traditional markets toilet all have the operational and financial resources have toilet cleaners. Some traditional market toilet <b>tub</b> <b>drain</b> and clean the toilet at regular intervals in accordance with predetermined. Not found the fungus Candida albicans in the tub water at the four public toilets traditional markets. To the managers should further enhance efforts to manage and improve the behavior of officers by providing training on sanitation sanitation especially in toilets and sanitation facilities complete according to the sanitary standards of public toilets...|$|R
40|$|Background: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) {{is one of}} {{the main}} public health {{problems}} in Indonesia. It canaffect all age groups and may lead to death especially in children. The data shows that DHF cases in KecamatanMantrijeron between January-June 2010 have reached the highest number of cases in past seven years, about 94 cases. Kecamatan Mantrijeron has an increasing trend of DHF which make it possible for the occurrence ofan outbreak of DHF when no preventions are done. RW 17 Kelurahan Suryodiningratan and RW 02 KelurahanGedongkiwo are areas with highest prevalence. There are 8 and 9 cases in each area respectively. Objective: To compare community behavior in preventing the existence of mosquitoes that is a DHF vector in theenvironment of Kelurahan Suryodiningratan and Gedongkiwo, Kecamatan Mantrijeron. Method: This research was a descriptive observational study, with cross-sectional retrospective study designin July-August 2010 in RW 17 Kelurahan Suryodiningratan and RW 02 Gedongkiwo, Kecamatan Mantrijeron,Kotamadya Yogyakarta. The research target population was 379 head of family (HF) from RW 17 KelurahanSuryodiningratan and 360 HF from RW 02 Kelurahan Gedongkiwo. Samples used was 60 HF from RW 17 Kelurahan Suryodiningratan and 66 HF from RW 02 Kelurahan Gedongkiwo (minimal sampling with P= 0. 5 were 58 HF for RW 17 and 57 HF for RW 02). Sampling was done by random sampling with milestone technique, thebehavior questionnaire, and observational checklist of mosquito existence as the instrument. Independentvariables were six behavioral criteria; dependent variable was the existence of mosquitoes. Data analysis wasdone with bivariate analysis using relative risk (RR) and odds-ratio (OR). Results: Analysis result of correlation between behavior to existence of mosquitoes in RW 17 with RR andOR> 1 are: 1. Not routinely inspecting larvae in water reservoir (RR= 1. 38 and OR= 1. 89) and 2. Not cleaning thebathtub once a week (RR= 1. 32 and OR= 1. 74). Analysis result of correlation between behavior to existence ofmosquitoes in RW 02 with RR and OR> 1 are: 1. Not getting rid of bottles and cans (RR= 1. 66 and OR= 3. 89); 2. Notclosing all water reservoir (RR= 3. 21 and OR= 17. 55); 3. Not routinely inspecting larvae in water reservoir(RR= 2. 36 and OR=-); 4. The behavior of not cleaning the bathtub once a week (RR= 2. 07 and OR=-); 5. Thebehavior of not draining-up the bath tub when cleaning (RR= 2. 03 and OR=-); 6. The behavior of not brushingwater reservoir when cleaning (RR= 1. 94 and OR=-). The difference between both districts is the characteristicof RW 17 Kelurahan Suryodingratan that is abundant in trees as the rest area for mosquitoes and the riverbanksof RW 02 Kelurahan Gedungkiwo are filled with household wastes. Conclusion: There are differences in behavior in preventing mosquito existence in both RW 17 KelurahanSuryodiningratan and RW 02 Kelurahan Gedongkiwo. The population of Kelurahan Gedongkiwo regularly disposesbottles and cans, <b>drains</b> the bath <b>tub</b> when cleaning, brushes water reservoir when cleaning, closes all waterreservoir, inspects larvae in water reservoir and cleans the bathtub once a week to prevent mosquitoes. Thepopulation of Kelurahan Suryodiningratan inspects larvae in water reservoir and cleans the bathtub once aweek to prevent mosquitoes...|$|R
