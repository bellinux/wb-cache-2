25|$|Western Australia Police {{supported}} {{the fight against}} take-away liquor and a strategic partnership was formed. The campaign was strengthened by this partnership, though it didn’t effect how it was managed. Western Australian Police Commissioner Karl O’Callaghan said, “When I first went up to Fitzroy Crossing, looking down from the air <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> looked like green emeralds on the ground”, “They {{turned out to be}} thousands and thousands of cans of VB beer, where people had sat around drunk”. Fitzroy Crossing Police were spending much of their time on alcohol-related crime. When Oscar received threats and slander while running the campaign, commissioner O’Callaghan gave her his personal phone number and said “ring me anytime”.|$|E

Series star Kyle Chandler said: [...] "When I look back at my life, I'm going to say, 'Wow, [...] Peter Berg really changed my life.'" [...] Executive producer and head writer Jason Katims echoed this sentiment, saying: [...] "When I first came on [...] set, I thought, it’s interesting – this is what I imagined filmmaking would be, before <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> filmmaking was." ...|$|E

(1967). After the film's release, Crawford guest-starred as herself on The Lucy Show. The episode, [...] "Lucy and the Lost Star", first aired on February 26, 1968. Crawford {{struggled}} during rehearsals and drank heavily on-set, leading series star Lucille Ball to suggest replacing her with Gloria Swanson. However, Crawford was letter-perfect {{the day of}} the show, which included dancing the Charleston, and received two standing ovations from the studio audience.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{critics have}} assumed that the years Maugham spent {{studying}} medicine were a creative dead end, but Maugham did not feel this way about this time. He {{was living in the}} great city of London, meeting people of a [...] "low" [...] sort whom he would never have met otherwise, and seeing them at a time of heightened anxiety and meaning in their lives. In maturity, he recalled the value of his experience as a medical student: [...] "I saw how men died. I saw how they bore pain. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> hope looked like, fear and relief..." ...|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time, the Israeli Prime Minister (Levi Eshkol), the Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff, and Knesset members came to games. Demand for tickets to {{games in the}} team's 5,000-seat stadium was so high that they became {{exceedingly}} difficult to obtain. [...] In his down time, Brody coached Israeli soldiers when they were off duty from guarding Israel's border against its Arab neighbors. [...] The experience, and the excitement Brody generated, made a deep impression on him. [...] He {{had a vision of}} what he could accomplish, and saw the positive impact on the Israeli people's morale whenever Maccabi Tel Aviv beat a team in Europe. As he put it: [...] "I felt it was bigger than me, and had to be continued, because <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> the results were." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1944, well known {{choreographer}} George Balanchine was hired by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo {{to work on a}} new production called Song of Norway. The move would mark a turning point in Tallchief's and Balanchine's careers. She was drawn to Balanchine from the start. Describing one of her first experiences with him, she wrote [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> he had done, I was astonished. Everything seemed so simple yet perfect: An elegant ballet fell into place before my eyes." [...] At first, she was not sure if he was paying much attention to her, but she quickly found out he was. Balanchine [...] assigned Tallchief a solo in Song of Norway and on the night before the premiere also informed her that she would be Danilova's understudy. The ballet was a success and Balanchine was offered a contract {{for the rest of the}} season. [...] He was glad to get back into ballet after years on Broadway and in Hollywood and accepted the offer. Sensing Tallchief's star was on the rise, her mother demanded a raise for her daughter. Tallchief was [...] "mortified" [...] by the move, but Denham gave into the demands and increased her salary to $50 per week and promoted her to [...] "soloist." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, Jones met Nancy Sepulvado, a 34-year-old divorcée from Mansfield, Louisiana. [...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him." [...] Jones managed to quit cocaine but went on a drunken rampage in Alabama in fall 1983 and was once again straitjacketed and committed to Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital suffering from malnutrition and delusions. [...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did want to quit drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction. [...] But I always seem to end up going the other way." [...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Renowned {{throughout}} his career for his capacity to provide very specific technical details about the performance of his cars and track conditions long {{before the advent of}} telemetry, this characteristic [...] led Senna's first F1 race engineer, Pat Symonds, to regard the US Grand Prix in Dallas as the initial highlight of Senna's debut season, instead of the more popular Monaco, where Senna and Toleman scored their first podium finish. This is by reference to the following recollection given by Symonds in an interview in 2014, to mark the 20th anniversary of Senna's death:The car was reasonably competitive there, so we expected to have a good race but Ayrton spun early in the race. He then found his way back through the field in a quite effective way and we were looking for a pretty good finish but then he hit the wall, damaged the rear wheel and the driveshaft and retired, which was a real shame. The real significance of that was that when he came back to the pits he told me what happened and said [...] "I'm sure that the wall moved!" [...] and even though I've heard every excuse every driver has ever made, I certainly hadn't heard of that one! But Ayrton being Ayrton, with his incredible belief in himself, the absolute conviction, he then talked me into going with him, after the race, {{to have a look at}} the place where he had crashed. And he was absolutely right, which was the amazing thing! Dallas being a street circuit the track was surrounded by concrete blocks and what had happened – we could see it from the tyre marks – was that someone had hit at the far end of the concrete block and that made it swivel slightly, so that the leading edge of the block was standing out by a few millimetres. And he was driving with such precision that those few millimetres were the difference between hitting the wall and not hitting the wall. While I had been, at first, annoyed that we had retired from the race through a driver error, when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>what</b> had happened, when I saw how he had been driving, that increased my respect for the guy by quite a lot.|$|E
