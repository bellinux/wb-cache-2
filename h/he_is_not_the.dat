5|$|Peribsen's royal name is {{a subject}} of curiosity for Egyptologists because it is {{connected}} to the deity Seth rather than Horus, as was traditional for the name of a pharaoh. Traditionally, the Horus name of the king was written within a serekh: the image of the facade of the royal palace beneath a falcon representing the god Horus (see Hieroglyphics). Instead, Peribsen chose to have the Set animal, representing Seth, on his serekh. Although Peribsen is the only known pharaoh to have the Set animal preside alone over his serekh, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> only king to associate himself with Seth. Examples include the 13th dynasty pharaoh Seth Meribre, the 19th dynasty rulers Seti I and Seti II and the 20th dynasty king Setnakhte.|$|E

However, as Wild's tenure covered {{the entire length of the}} Second World War, in which no {{competitive}} football was played, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> man with the most games served as manager. Les McDowall, {{who was in charge}} from 1950 to 1963, a period of 13 years, managed the club for the most competitive games, a total of 592 games - a full 240 games more than Wild, who recorded the second most.
