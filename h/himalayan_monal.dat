5|$|His {{expedition}} completed after a {{total of}} 17 months, Beebe and Blair crossed the Pacific to San Francisco, then crossed the United States {{to return to their}} home in New York. Their expedition had obtained live or stuffed specimens of nearly all the pheasants he had sought, and also produced extensive notes about their behavior. Some of these pheasants, such as Sclater's impeyan or <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal,</b> had never before been seen in the wild by Americans or Europeans. Beebe's observations of sexual dimorphism in pheasants during this expedition led him to become the first biologist to correctly understand the mechanism by which this aspect of sexual selection operates. On the basis of his observations he also proposed a new evolutionary model of pheasant ancestry, involving a period of rapid diversification followed by more typical and gradual changes. Although this evolutionary model is now taken for granted, in William Beebe's time it was a novel idea.|$|E

500|$|Docter made Venezuela the film's setting after Ralph Eggleston {{gave him}} a video of the tepui {{mountains}} of Canaima National Park; and tepuis were already featured in a previous Disney film, Dinosaur. In 2004, Docter and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days reaching Monte Roraima by airplane, jeep, and helicopter. They spent three nights there painting and sketching, and encountering ants, mosquitoes, scorpions, frogs, and snakes. They also flew to Matawi Tepui and climbed to Angel Falls. Docter felt [...] "we couldn't use [...] Reality is so far out, if we {{put it in the}} movie you wouldn't believe it." [...] The film's creatures were also challenging to design because they had to fit in the surreal environment of the tepuis, but also be realistic because those mountains exist in real life. The filmmakers visited Sacramento Zoo to observe a <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> for Kevin's animation. The animators designed Russell as an Asian-American, and modeled Russell after similar looking Peter Sohn, a Pixar storyboarder who voiced Emile in Ratatouille and directed the short Partly Cloudy, because of his energetic nature.|$|E

2500|$|In {{generally}} warmer {{areas of}} the Eurasian continent, the diverse pheasant family replaces the grouse as the significant group of birds in the golden eagle's diet. Across the range, pheasants make up 5.7% of the diet of this species. Unlike grouse, pheasants are not known to comprise {{more than half of}} the nest remains in any study, but they can be important nonetheless. This is especially true in Spain, where most studies show that the pheasants at 22.8-28.7% of the diet, mainly the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), are the second most prominent prey species after the European rabbit, with the red-legged partridge and the rabbit collectively making up to more than 90% of the prey remains in several nests there. The red-legged species, along with the rock partridge (Alectoris graeca) and grey partridge (Perdix perdix), are the leading prey group in the French Pyrenees at 15.8% of a sampling of 114 from 10 nests. In Hungary, the common pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) appears to be the favored prey species, making up 26.6% of the prey of a sampling of 49 from 4 nests there. In Japan, the copper pheasant (Syrmaticus soemmerringii) is the second most common single prey species, making up 17.8% of the remains (sample size of 967 from 5 nests). In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, the most common bird species (and third most common overall prey species) is the chukar (Alectoris chukar), representing 19.5% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Chukar and Caspian snowcock (Tetraogallus caspius) are reportedly the primary avian prey species in Armenia. In the Himalayan region, two very large pheasants, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus impejanus) and the Himalayan snowcock (Tetraogallus himalayensis), are reportedly among the most significant prey for eagles. Moorland francolin (Scleroptila psilolaemus) were reportedly the most common bird prey species in Ethiopia's Bale Mountains, comprising 10% among a sample size of 49 at 4 nests. North America has fewer native pheasants species but introduced species such as grey partridge, ring-necked pheasant and, especially, chukar are readily hunted (native quail seem to be largely or entirely ignored as prey by golden eagle, perhaps because of their small size or dense thicket-dwelling habits). The chukar is the most significant bird species in the diet in Nevada (at 5.4%) and the second most significant bird species in Washington state (at 11.8%). One native North American “pheasant” known to be occasionally hunted is the wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo), the largest species of galliform. The golden eagle is the only major avian predator of adult turkeys. The hunting techniques used on pheasants are probably similar to those used for grouse. Pheasants hunted by golden eagles are also similar in size in grouse. Alectoris sp. weigh around [...] and medium-sized species weighing around [...] Snowcock will often weigh , whereas the female and male adult turkey weigh around [...] and , respectively. On a wildlife monitoring camera in Tennessee, a golden eagle was filmed assaulting an adult turkey, appearing to use a “contour flight with short glide attack” but the quarry in this case appears to successfully avoid the strikes by running and then ultimately flying away. Breeding pairs of eagles have been known to hunt turkeys cooperatively.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus impejanus), {{also known}} as the Impeyan monal, Impeyan {{pheasant}}, is a bird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae. It is the national bird of Nepal, where it is known as the danphe, and state bird of Uttarakhand India, where it is known as the monal. It was also the state bird of Himachal Pradesh until 2007.Traditionally, the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> has been classified as monophyletic. However, {{studies have shown that the}} male <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> of northwestern India lacks the white rump of other Himalayan monals, and it has more green on the breast, indicating the possibility of a second subspecies.|$|E
50|$|Bird species {{richness}} is low. Common birds include Guldenstadt's redstart, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal,</b> rosefinches, raptors, and vultures.|$|E
50|$|The {{gardens are}} {{also home to}} a small {{collection}} of exotic birds {{from around the world}} including the white-cheeked turaco, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monals,</b> azure-winged magpies and quaker parakeets. Most birds are located in the white-domed lawn aviary building that provides a focal point on the main lawn. There is also a wetlands enclosure that contains ornamental waterfowl including different species of ducks. Some of the birds have been at the gardens a very long time including a sulphur-crested cockatoo called Jenny that has been entertaining visitors with her chatter for over 30 years. There is always at least one peacock roaming wild in the grounds. There is also a seasonal butterfly house.|$|R
50|$|Larger mammals {{found in}} this region include the Marco Polo sheep (Ovis ammon polii), the markhor (Capra falconeri), the ibex (Capra ibex) and the urial (Ovis orientalis vignei). The snow leopard (Panthera uncia) preys on these, and also on the pikas, hares and gamebirds found here. Other predators include the {{mountain}} weasel (Mustela altaica), the beech marten (Martes foina), the brown bear (Ursos arctos), the Asian black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus), the Turkestan lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus), the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and the Tibetan wolf (Canis lupus filchneri). The number of bird species present is low. The robin accentor (Prunella rubeuloides) and black-throated thrush (Turdus ruficollis) overwinter here, and vultures, birds of prey, rosefinches (Carpodacus spp.), <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monals</b> (Lophophorus impejanus) and Güldenstädt's redstarts (Phoenicurus erythrogaster) remain throughout the year, though they may move to somewhat lower elevations in winter.

The <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> (Lophophorus impejanus) has been observed digging in the rotting wood of deadfall in a similar manner to woodpeckers to extract invertebrates, even bracing itself with aid of its squared tail. The cheer pheasant (Catreus wallichi), crested argus (Rheinardia ocellata), the crested partridge (Rollulus roulroul) and the crested guineafowl (Guttera pucherani) are similar ecologically to the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal</b> in that they too forage in rotting wood for termites, ant and beetle larvae, molluscs, crustaceans and young rodents.|$|E

50|$|Manali has {{witnessed}} {{a flurry of}} activity related to hydroelectric power and tourism. Unplanned and rampant construction has led to severe depletion of forests and pollution of river bodies, along with garbage being disposed {{on the side of}} the mountains. There has been a loss of habitat to various species of fauna, not limited to the <b>Himalayan</b> <b>Monal,</b> incidentally the state bird of Himachal Pradesh. This prompted the National Green Tribunal to intervene and limit vehicular movement on the popular Manali - Rohtang Pass highway, as well as Solang Valley. This has somewhat arrested the damage, however a lot still needs to be done.|$|E
50|$|The zoo {{includes}} an off-display breeding center for snow leopards and red pandas. Captive breeding of snow leopards {{was started in}} 1983, with leopards which {{were brought to the}} zoo from Zurich, the United States, and Leh-Ladakh. The red panda program was started in 1994 with individuals from the Cologne Zoo, the Madrid Zoo, Belgium, and the Rotterdam Zoo. In addition to these species, the zoo is breeding the Himalayan tahr, blue sheep, <b>Himalayan</b> <b>monal,</b> grey peacock pheasant, Himalayan salamander, blood pheasant and satyr tragopan.
