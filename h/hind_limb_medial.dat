40|$|A {{longitudinal}} study was undertaken in a swine herd with a continuous problem of foot abscess in unweaned pigs reared on a woven-wire floor. Of 3322, 4 -day-old pigs, 199 (6 %) developed abscess lesions involving claws and accessory digits before weaning. Lesions were first detected in 4 -day-old pigs; median and mean ages at onset were 10 and 11. 3 days, respectively. At first detection, most pigs {{had only a}} single claw affected, but 39 pigs had at least 2 claws with abscesses. <b>Hind</b> <b>limbs</b> had more affected claws (140) than forelimbs (96). In the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs,</b> <b>medial</b> claws {{were most likely to}} have lesions, whereas the reverse was true for the forelimbs. Gross and microscopic examinations of affected claws indicated necrotic pododermatitis, with severe osteomyelitis, arthritis, and tenosynovitis.

The following clinical and radiological patterns were observed in the malformed animals: <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> amputated, the right amputated off the second tarsus bones and the left amputated off the proximal epiphysis metatarsus, and the right thoracic limb hypoplasic (1 female); left <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> amputated off the proximal epiphysis metatarsus (2 females and 1 male); left <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> amputated off the third tarsus bones (1 female); left <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> amputated off the tibia (1 female and 1 male); left <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> amputated off the distal epiphysis metatarsus (1 female); left <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> amputated off the first phalanx (1 male); right <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> amputated off the proximal epiphysis metatarsus (1 male).

40|$|In {{my earlier}} {{experiments}} with spinal cats (1962) I {{established that the}} isolated lumbosacral cord is able to co-ordinate walking movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> In cats {{this part of the}} cord possesses a high degree of autonomy. It seemed interesting to know whether in rabbits the isolated lumbosacral cord is also able to maintain these functions. It was especially important to establish whether the spinal rabbit can carry out the typical jumping movements with <b>hind</b> <b>limbs,</b> which serve, as is well known, in the act of progression in normal conditions. According to Laughton (1924) the synchronous bilateral jumping movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> seen in normal rabbits should be replaced by alternate rhythmical move-ments in spinal rabbits. After decerebration Laughton made a transection of the spinal cord in rabbits at the limit of the thoracic cord. The dorsal cutaneous nerves, which innervate the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs,</b> were isolated and prepared for stimulation. Reflex-movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> were observed in response to electrical stimulation with faradic currents and mechanical stimulation by pinching one toe of the hind feet. Such reflexes consist of ipsilateral flexion and crossed extension of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> He could not provoke any synchronous bilateral movement of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> in his rabbits after transection of the cord. Laughton concludes that in rabbits the nervous mechanism in the lumbosacral cord is so arranged that it can innervate only the alternate rhythmical movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> The synchronous bilateral move-ments of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> are only possible when the cord is in connexion with the supraspinal centres of the brain-stem, which lies probably in the pontine region. Whereas Laughton made a transection of the spinal cord in decerebrated rabbits and then examined the reflex-movements of the <b>hind</b> <b>limbs</b> by excitation of the sensory nerves, I carried out chronic experiments in which I studied the walking movements of the spinal animal, as I had already done in my investigations of spinal pigeons and spinal cats...|$|R

The secondary adaptation of tree-kangaroos to an arboreal lifestyle from a terrestrial heritage offers {{an excellent opportunity}} to study the adaptation of the musculoskeletal system for arboreal locomotion, particularly from a template well adapted to terrestrial bipedal saltation. We present a detailed descriptive study of the <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> musculature of Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo (D. lumholtzi) in comparison to other macropodines to test whether the <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> musculature of tree-kangaroos is functionally adapted to the different mechanical demands of locomotion in the uneven three-dimensional arboreal environment. The <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> musculature of Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo (Dendrolagus lumholtzi), the western brush wallaby (Macropus irma), the western grey kangaroo (Macropus fuliginosus) and the quokka (Setonix brachyurus) are described.

40|$|AbstractLungeing is an {{important}} part of lameness examinations, since the circular path enforced during lungeing is thought to accentuate low grade lameness. However, during lungeing the movement of sound horses becomes naturally asymmetric, which may mimic lameness. Also, compensatory movements in the opposite half of the body may mimic lameness. The aim of this study was to objectively study the presence of circle-dependent and compensatory movement asymmetries in horses with induced lameness. Ten horses were trotted in a straight line and lunged in both directions on a hard surface. Lameness was induced (reversible hoof pressure) in each limb, one at a time, in random order. Vertical head and pelvic movements were measured with body-mounted, uni-axial accelerometers. Differences between maximum and minimum height observed during/after left and right stance phases for the head (HDmax, HDmin) and pelvis (PDmax, PDmin) were measured. Mixed models were constructed to study the effect of lungeing direction and induction, and to quantify secondary compensatory asymmetry mechanisms in the forelimbs and <b>hind</b> <b>limbs.</b> Head and pelvic movement symmetries were affected by lungeing. Minimum pelvic height difference (PDmin) changed markedly, increasing significantly during lungeing, giving the impression of inner <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> lameness. Primary <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> lameness induced compensatory head movement, which mimicked an ipsilateral forelimb lameness of almost equal magnitude to the primary <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> lameness. This could contribute to difficulty in correctly detecting <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> lameness. Induced forelimb lameness caused both a compensatory contralateral (change in PDmax) and an ipsilateral (change in PDmin) <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> asymmetry, potentially mimicking <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> lameness, but of smaller magnitude.

30|$|Numerous ischemic <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> {{models have}} been {{developed}} in mice [1 – 10], rats [11, 12], and rabbits [1] in order to study post-ligation perfusion recovery through neovascularization. Most <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> ischemia {{studies have been conducted}} in mice and rats and regardless of the studied mode of neovascularization (i.e., arteriogenesis or angiogenesis), and follow-up of post-ligation perfusion recovery is often performed by laser Doppler perfusion imaging (LDPI) [2 – 6, 9, 10, 13, 14]. Other methods frequently used in pre-clinical research for the assessment of post-ligation perfusion recovery are angiography [3, 4, 9 – 11, 14, 15], microsphere injections [2, 4, 11, 12, 15], contrast-enhanced ultrasound [16], micro CT [10], and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [14]. However, despite the variety in methods to monitor perfusion recovery in the ischemic <b>hind</b> <b>limb,</b> LDPI remains the most frequently used. The main reasons are that LDPI is a fast, efficient, and non-invasive technique to document extremity blood-flow [17]. However, since LDPI is limited by the penetration depth of the laser light [8, 18], allowing measurement of superficial skin perfusion only, the question arises whether LDPI scanning is accurately reflecting the incremental perfusion improvement of skeletal muscles through arteriogenesis in the upper <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> or angiogenesis in the lower <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> of the animal.|$|R

Among infected animals, however, the intensity of infection and the extent of <b>hind</b> <b>limb</b> asymmetry were not correlated, suggesting that asymmetry did not arise following infection, but rather that newts having greater FA may have been more susceptible to infection {{as a result of the}} same stresses that produced the increase in FA.
