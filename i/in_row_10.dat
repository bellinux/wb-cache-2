In order to get individual information about gait features from cows passing a corridor <b>in</b> <b>row</b> e. g. after leaving the milking parlour an automatic separation of cows in a sequence is necessary. The presented results are based on video recordings done on farm, where cows walk from the milking parlour after milking through a corridor <b>in</b> <b>row</b> of <b>10</b> to 20 animals. To cope with problems such as stopping for a while in front of the camera, overlap of cows, non-uniform time interval between cows, etc. an algorithm for cow separation is proposed based on local image filtering and statistical analysis of binary images frame by frame. Filters to enhance horizontal and vertical edges in an image are utilized for shadow and background reduction. Binarization on filtered images is made by using statistical analysis.

Our results demonstrated that planting spacing did not influence the essential oil yield or diameter at breast height in the clones. However, higher density plantings were shown to result in higher fresh weight of branches and leaves per plant. MA 2001 grew taller, produced higher quantity of fresh biomass of branches and leaves per plant and volume of wood per hectare, and yielded more essential oil yield than the other clones. We concluded that MA 2001 is the most suitable of the clones tested here for cultivation in water deficit conditions...|$|R
