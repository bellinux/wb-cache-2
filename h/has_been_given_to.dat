5|$|Many of the {{original}} Maine Coon cats that inhabited the New England area possessed a trait known as polydactylism (having one or more extra toes on the feet). While some sources claim that trait {{is thought to have}} occurred in approximately 40% of the Maine Coon population in Maine at one time, little evidence <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> substantiate this claim. Polydactylism is rarely, if ever, seen in Maine Coons in the show ring since it is unacceptable by competition standards. The gene for polydactylism is a simple autosomal dominant gene, which has shown to pose no threat to the cat's health. The trait was almost eradicated from the breed {{due to the fact that}} it was an automatic disqualifier in show rings. Private organizations and breeders were created in order to keep polydactylism in Maine Coons from disappearing.|$|E
