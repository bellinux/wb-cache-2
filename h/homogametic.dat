5|$|Many {{butterflies}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males <b>homogametic</b> (ZZ).|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{common for}} achieving equal X-related genetic expression {{between males and}} females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome. Thus, heterogametic male organisms with one X chromosome may match the level of expression achieved in <b>homogametic</b> females with two active X chromosomes. This mechanism is observed in Drosophila.|$|E
25|$|One logical way to {{equalize}} gene expression amongst {{males and females}} that follow a XX/XY sex differentiation scheme would be to decrease or altogether eliminate the expression {{of one of the}} X chromosomes in an XX, or female, <b>homogametic</b> individual, such that both males and females then express only one X chromosome. This is the case in many mammalian organisms, including humans and mice.|$|E
25|$|Regardless {{of their}} {{ambiguous}} evolutionary history, platypuses have been empirically determined to follow an XY sex-determination system, with females possessing five pairs of X chromosomes as the <b>homogametic</b> sex, and males possessing five X and five Y chromosomes as the heterogametic sex. Because the entire genome of the platypus {{has yet to}} be completely sequenced (including one of the X chromosomes), there is still continued investigation as to the definitive mechanism of dosage compensation that Platypuses follow. Research from the laboratory of Jennifer Graves used qPCR and SNP analysis of BACs containing various genes from X chromosomes in order to find whether multiple alleles for particular X-linked genes were being expressed at once, or were otherwise being dosage compensated. Her group found that in female platypuses, some X-linked genes only expressed an allele from one X chromosomes, while other genes expressed multiple alleles. This appears to be a system similar to the selective silencing method of dosage compensation observed in birds. However, about half of all X-linked genes also seemed to stochastically express only one active copy of said gene, alluding to the system of random X-inactivation observed in humans. These findings suggest that platypuses may employ a hybrid form of dosage compensation that combines feature from mammals as well as birds. Understanding the evolution of such a system may have implications for solidifying the true ancestral lineage of monotremes.|$|E
25|$|In {{spite of}} the {{induction}} of breast development, transwomen who undergo HRT {{do not have an}} increased risk of breast cancer, as cissexual women do. Only a handful of cases of breast cancer have ever been described in transsexual women who have undergone male-to-female HRT. This is in accordance with research in cissexual men in which gynecomastia has been found not to be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, suggesting a protective role of the male sex-determination chromosome. On the other hand, men with Klinefelter's syndrome (two X chromosomes and one Y chromosome), which causes hypoandrogenism, hyperestrogenism, and a very high incidence of gynecomastia (80%), have a dramatically (20- to 58-fold) increased risk of breast cancer compared to men with one X chromosome, closer to the rate of <b>homogametic</b> females. The incidences of breast cancer in karyotypical men (46,XY karyotype), men with Klinefelter's syndrome (47,XXY karyotype), and karyotypical women (46,XX karyotype) are approximately 0.1%, 3%, and 12.5%, respectively. Individuals with the 46,XY karyotype affected by complete androgen insensitivity syndrome never develop male sex characteristics and have normal and complete female morphology, and accelerated breast growth during puberty, but appear to have little (or possibly even no) incidence of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer in women with Turner syndrome (45,XO karyotype) also appears to be significantly decreased, though this may be related to ovarian failure/hypogonadism rather necessarily than to genetics.|$|E
50|$|Where the A gene is sex linked, the {{heterogametic}} sex (e.g., mammalian males; avian females) {{have only}} one copy of the gene (and are termed hemizygous), while the <b>homogametic</b> sex (e.g., human females) have two copies. The genotype frequencies at equilibrium are p and q for the heterogametic sex but p2, 2pq and q2 for the <b>homogametic</b> sex.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, {{the female}} is <b>homogametic,</b> with two X {{chromosomes}} (XX), while the male is the heterogametic sex, with one X and one Y chromosome (XY). Genes on the X or Y chromosome are called sex-linked. In ZW sex-determination system used by birds {{the opposite is}} true: the male is the <b>homogametic</b> sex (ZZ), and the female is heterogametic (ZW).|$|E
5000|$|Dominance: Heterogametic hybrids are {{affected}} by all X-linked alleles (be they recessive or dominant) causing incompatibilities due to divergent alleles being brought together. However, <b>homogametic</b> hybrids are only affected by dominant deleterious X-linked alleles. Heterogametic hybrids, which carry only a single copy of a given X-linked gene, {{will be affected by}} mutations regardless of dominance. Thus, an X-linked incompatibility between diverging populations {{is more likely to be}} expressed in the heterogametic sex than in the <b>homogametic</b> sex.|$|E
50|$|Many {{butterflies}} {{are sexually}} dimorphic. Most butterflies have the ZW sex-determination system where females are the heterogametic sex (ZW) and males <b>homogametic</b> (ZZ).|$|E
5000|$|Differential selection: Hybrid {{incompatibilities}} {{affecting the}} heterogametic sex and <b>homogametic</b> sex are fundamentally different isolating mechanisms, which makes heterogametic inferiority (sterility/inviability) more visible or preserved in nature.|$|E
50|$|Birds {{and many}} insects {{have a similar}} system of sex {{determination}} (ZW sex-determination system), {{in which it is}} the females that are heterogametic (ZW), while males are <b>homogametic</b> (ZZ).|$|E
50|$|There are notable {{exceptions}} to Haldane's rule, where the <b>homogametic</b> sex {{turns out to}} be inviable while the heterogametic sex is viable and fertile. This is seen in Drosophila fruit flies.|$|E
50|$|In birds, female is the {{heterogametic}} sex, that is, {{it has one}} Z and one W {{sexual chromosome}} (genotype ZW), while male (the <b>homogametic</b> sex) carries two Z chromosomes (genotype ZZ). Thus, reciprocal crosses between normal and dwarf specimens may give rather different results.|$|E
50|$|However, in birds, {{and some}} reptiles, males have two Z sex {{chromosomes}} {{and so are}} the <b>homogametic</b> sex, while females, with one Z and one W chromosome, are the heterogametic sex. Among the insects, Lepidopterans (butterflies and moths) have heterogametic females, but in Drosophila, males are the heterogametic sex.|$|E
50|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{common for}} achieving equal X-related genetic expression {{between males and}} females involves two-fold increased transcription of a single male X chromosome.

This mechanism is observed in Drosophila.|$|E
50|$|Heterogametic sex (digametic sex) {{refers to}} the sex of a species in which the sex {{chromosomes}} are not the same. For example, in humans, males, with an X and a Y sex chromosome, would {{be referred to as}} the heterogametic sex, and females having two X sex chromosomes would be referred to as the <b>homogametic</b> sex.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the XY sex-determination system and the X0 sex-determination system, where the sperm determines the sex, in the ZW system, the ovum determines {{the sex of the}} offspring. Males are the <b>homogametic</b> sex (ZZ), while females are the heterogametic sex (ZW). The Z chromosome is larger and has more genes, like the X chromosome in the XY system.|$|E
50|$|Here, A and D {{represent}} {{the number of}} matings in heterogameticity where B and C represent <b>homogametic</b> matings. A and B is one population and D and C is the second population. A negative value of Y denotes negative assortive mating, a positive value denotes positive assortive mating (i. e. expressing reproductive isolation), and a null value (of zero) means the populations are experiencing random mating.|$|E
50|$|One logical way to {{equalize}} gene expression amongst {{males and females}} that follow a XX/XY sex differentiation scheme would be to decrease or altogether eliminate the expression {{of one of the}} X chromosomes in an XX, or female, <b>homogametic</b> individual, such that both males and females then express only one X chromosome. This is the case in many mammalian organisms, including humans and mice.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "faster male": Male {{genes are}} thought to evolve faster due to sexual selection. As a result, male {{sterility}} becomes more evident in male heterogametic taxa (XY sex determination). This hypothesis conflicts with Haldane's rule in male <b>homogametic</b> taxa, in which females are more affected by hybrid inferiority. It therefore only applies to male sterility in taxa with XY sex determination, according to the composite theory.|$|E
50|$|The XY sex-determination {{system is}} the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila), and some plants (Ginkgo). In this system, the sex of an {{individual}} is determined {{by a pair of}} sex chromosomes (gonosomes). Females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the <b>homogametic</b> sex. Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex.|$|E

In this system, the sex of an {{individual}} is determined {{by a pair of}} sex chromosomes (gonosomes). Females typically have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the <b>homogametic</b> sex. Males typically have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex. Exceptions to these generalisations happen in the cases of XX males or XY females, or other syndromes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{possible}} cause of sterility among species in which {{presence or absence}} of one or the other sex chromosome determines gender, is if one sex chromosome of one species has recessive alleles interacting with autosomal alleles of the mating species. This could cause the heterogametic sex chromosome in the hybrid to be inviable or sterile, but <b>homogametic</b> sex chromosome will be fertile (Futuyma 1997). Consequently, in species where {{presence or absence of}} a Y chromosome determines gender, for instance, individuals carrying XY chromosomes (males) will be sterile and those carrying XX (females) will be fertile. This is closely related to Haldane's rule.|$|E
5000|$|If {{in either}} {{monoecious}} or dioecious organisms, either the allele or genotype proportions are initially unequal in either sex, {{it can be}} shown that constant proportions are obtained after one generation of random mating. If dioecious organisms are heterogametic and the gene locus {{is located on the}} X chromosome, it can be shown that if the allele frequencies are initially unequal in the two sexes XX females and XY males, as in humans, [...] in the heterogametic sex ‘chases’ [...] in the <b>homogametic</b> sex of the previous generation, until an equilibrium is reached at the weighted average of the two initial frequencies.|$|E
50|$|Schistosoma mansoni has 8 {{pairs of}} {{chromosomes}} (2n = 16)—7 autosomal pairs and 1 sex pair. The female schistosome is heterogametic, or ZW, {{and the male}} is <b>homogametic,</b> or ZZ. Sex is determined in the zygote by a chromosomal mechanism. The Schistosoma genome is approximately 270 MB with a GC content of 34%, 4-8% highly repetitive sequence, 32-36% middle repetitive sequence and 60% single copy sequence. Numerous highly or moderately repetitive elements have been identified, and their frequency in genomic sequence data also suggests at least 30% repetitive DNA. Chromosomes {{range in size from}} 18 to 73 MB and can be distinguished by size, shape, and C banding. There are estimated to be 15-20 thousand expressed genes.|$|E
50|$|Normally, two {{recessive}} alleles {{need to be}} inherited (one {{from each}} parent) for the recessive trait to be expressed but recessive merely means that the trait is only expressed {{in the absence of}} the dominant alleles. The pattern of inheritance in which a single recessive allele is inherited but is still expressed is known as pseudodominance. This mainly occurs with sex-linked genes (i.e., those on the sex chromosomes). The <b>homogametic</b> sex (females in humans) receive two of each sex chromosome and therefore need to be homozygous to show a recessive trait. The heterogametic sex (males in humans) only receives one of each sex chromosome and will therefore show recessive trait even if they have only inherited one copy of a recessive allele.|$|E
5000|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that a DM domain gene, DMRT1, is involved in sexual development. This gene is located on chromosome 9. Its location {{suggests that}} it’s required {{for the development of}} testis. XY humans hemizygous for the chromosome 9p, where DMRT1 is located, are often feminized. This feminization can range from ambiguous genitalia to XY sex reversal.The Dmrt1 homolog from chicken has been localized on the Z chromosome. Birds have heterogametic females (ZW) and <b>homogametic</b> males (ZZ). The avian Z chromosome is conserved synteny with chromosome 9 of humans. ZZ embryos have a higher dose of Dmrt1 and therefore have the potential to have a higher expression. It’s been suggested that embryos with a higher expression of Dmrt1 expression develop into males while embryos with a lower expression are led to female development. (Raymond 1999) ...|$|E
50|$|Sex-linked barring {{has been}} {{established}} as the dominant locus B by traditional mendelian genetics {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century. The responsible gene was predicted to be located on the Z chromosome and since male birds are <b>homogametic</b> (ZZ), they can be either hetero- or homozygous for sex-linked barring. Females are always hemizygous at this locus (ZW).In 2010 Swedish scientist have identified four mutations located in or around the tumor suppressor locus CDKN2A, which appear to be associated with sex-linked barring. The four mutations are organized in 3 different alleles named B0, B1 and B2. All alleles carry two non-coding mutation located in regulatory regions of the gene (the promoter and intron) but only B1 and B2 carry two additional missense mutations in a functional important domain of the protein. The B1 allele is causing the typical sex-linked barring phenotype/ appearance and is present in most modern sex-linked barred chicken breeds. Females or male chickens carrying the B2 allele in the heterozygous condition show a defined barring pattern but in the homozygous condition, males are essentially white with very little pigmentation. This phenotype has been initially described as a distinct but closely related mutation, however, it was later assigned to the same gene and termed ‘Sex-linked Dilution'.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Some genes carry {{a record}} of the sex of the gene’s carrier in the {{previous}} generation that influences the gene’s expression in this generation. This additional information can result in intragenomic conflicts between an individual’s maternally and paternally derived alleles over behaviors that affect relatives with whom the individual has different degrees of maternal and paternal relatedness. Asymmetries of relatedness can arise because of sex-biased dispersal. For example, if females remain in their natal group and males disperse, female members of a group will all be matrilineal relatives, but may have unrelated fathers. Sex-linked inheritance creates an evolutionary bias in favor of social groups that trace descent through the <b>homogametic</b> sex. This bias has a positive and negative aspect. The positive aspect is increased relatedness among siblings of the <b>homogametic</b> sex. The negative aspect is the lack of sexlinked relatedness between parents and offspring of the heterogametic sex...|$|E

40|$|HALDANE's rule'' states that, if species hybrids of one sex {{only are}} inviable or sterile, the afflicted sex {{is much more}} likely to be {{heterogametic}} (XY) than <b>homogametic</b> (XX). We show that most or all of the phenomena associated with HALDANE's rule can be explained by the simple hypothesis that alleles decreasing hybrid fitness are partially recessive. Under this hypothesis, the XY sex suffers more than the XX because X-linked alleles causing postzygotic isolation tend to have greater cumulative effects when hemizygous than when heterozygous, even though the XX sex carries twice as many such alleles. The dominance hypothesis can also account for the ``large X effect,'' the disproportionate effect of the X chromosome on hybrid inviability/sterility. In addition, the dominance theory is consistent with: the long temporal lag between the evolution of heterogametic and <b>homogametic</b> postzygotic isolation, the frequency of exceptions to HALDANE's rule, puzzling Drosophila experiments in which ``unbalanced'' hybrid females, who carry two X chromosomes from the same species, remain fertile whereas F(1) hybrid males are sterile, and the absence of cases of HALDANE's rule for hybrid inviability in mammals. We discuss several novel predictions that could lead to rejection of the dominance theory...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{maintenance}} of anisogamous sex is addressed by considering the effect of fertilization on the fitness of parthenogenetic females when such fertilization yields inviable triploid progeny. We consider four types of parthenogenesis: (i) apomixis, (ii) <b>homogametic</b> amphimixis, (iii) heterogametic amphimixis, and (iv) <b>homogametic</b> automixis. Homozygous sexual populations are genetically stable if males or selection eliminate the excess females produced by heterozygous parthenogenetic genotypes. Homozygous parthenogenetic populations are stable if the parthenogenetic output of homozygotes exceeds that of heterozygotes. In turn, sex can only invade heterozygous parthenogenetic populations when sexual output of parthenogens is larger than their parthenogenetic output. The existence of interior stable equilibria generally requires the instability {{of at least one}} boundary and some degree of heterosis. In a two-locus model, we study the evolution of mechanisms protecting either sex or parthenogenesis in reproductively polymorphic populations. We find that males do not respond to the presence of parthenogenesis {{in such a way as}} to eliminate it, but parthenogenesis is subject to selective pressures increasing reproductive isolation, and thus the success of parthenogenesis. The results suggest that reproductively polymorphic populations are ephemeral. 1...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may lead}} to reproductive isolation between populations through divergence in female mate choice, and population differentiation driven by female mate choice is expected to produce pre- but not post-mating isolation. We tested these hypotheses by looking at whether allopatric populations of the Amarillo (Girardinichthys multiradiatus), a sexually dimorphic viviparous fish with effective female choice, (i) have undergone phenotypical differentiation that {{may be attributed to}} divergence in female mate choice, and (ii) are already separated by pre- and/or post-mating reproductive barriers. We found substantial divergence in morphological traits which are the target of female mate choice, and in male courtship behaviour. Strong female preferences for <b>homogametic</b> males indicate substantial and symmetric pre-copulatory isolation, but the few successful heterogametic crosses produced in confinement yielded litters of the same size as those produced in <b>homogametic</b> matings, suggesting that post-copulatory isolation between populations is non-existent or weak. It appears that the studied populations have undergone incipient speciation with a pattern that is consistent with speciation driven by sexual selection, yet further work should assess whether divergence in female preferences has promoted male phenotypic differentiation or whether variation in male attributes has driven divergence in female preferences...|$|E
40|$|Dosage {{compensation}} {{refers to}} the equalization of X-linked gene transcription among heterogametic and <b>homogametic</b> sexes. In Drosophila, the dosage compensation complex (DCC) mediates the twofold hypertranscription of the single male X chromosome. Loss-of-function mutations at any DCC protein-coding gene are male lethal. Here we report a population genetic analysis suggesting that {{four of the five}} core DCC proteins—MSL 1, MSL 2, MSL 3, and MOF—are evolving under positive selection in D. melanogaster.
