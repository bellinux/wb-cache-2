500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Spears revealed that her idea initially was to make an album that was [...] "fresh-sounding [...] for the clubs or something that you play <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> when you're going out at night that gets you excited, but I wanted it to sound different from everything else out right now." [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] is a party song with a heavy club beat. The elements used on the song's background were compared to similar used on songs by The Black Eyed Peas, Usher, Rihanna, and Lady Gaga, while its bass line {{was said to be}} [...] "a cousin of the ground" [...] for the Eurythmics' 1983 single [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)".|$|E
500|$|Confessions on a Dance Floor is a full-on dance, {{electronic}} and disco record, which is structured like a nightly set composed by a DJ. The music starts out light and happy, {{and as it}} progresses, it becomes intense, with the lyrics dealing more about personal feelings, hence [...] "Confessions". According to Madonna, [...] "his is the direction of my record. That's what we intended, to make a record that you can play at a party or <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>car,</b> where you don't have to skip past a ballad. It's nonstop." [...] Madonna used samples and references of music by other disco artists. In the album's first song, [...] "Hung Up", she sampled ABBA's 1979 hit [...] "Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)", for which she wrote a personal letter to songwriters Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus, who gave Madonna {{permission to use the}} track. References of other disco-influenced acts, including Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, and Daft Punk, were also used on the album, as were the disco hits of Parisian DJ Cerrone. The album has a song called [...] "Forbidden Love", which is different from the same titled song from Madonna's sixth studio album Bedtime Stories. Regarding sampling herself and her own song names, Madonna commented: ...|$|E
500|$|... "Lift Off" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Before {{the song was}} released, MTV News' Alvin Blanco heard {{a preview of the}} song and described it as [...] "resounding... sounds like it was tailor-made to be performed in large stadiums." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is rescued by Beyoncé, who whips the chorus with a belt so powerful you'd think it insulted her mother." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole also praised the song writing, [...] "'Lift Off' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess, with West's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that will sound awesome <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>car</b> stereo provided it doesn't cause your subwoofers to bust your windows." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin found a [...] "hook so ridiculous ('We gon take it to the moon / Take it to the stars!') that only Beyoncé could sell it." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The Guardian praised the song calling it [...] "bombastic". Digital Spys Robert Copsey put [...] "Lift Off" [...] on his list of [...] "Tracks to download" [...] from the album. Evening Standards John Aizlewood called the song [...] "rocket-propelled". Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua commented: [...] "Beyoncé joins the boys for a synth-heavy banger that takes off like a rocket and eventually arrives at a spacey, blissful resolution. It all but demands a sci-fi music video featuring Beyoncé as a sexy astronaut." ...|$|E

[...] Spears also stated {{that she wanted to}} make sure Femme Fatale was completely different from her previous studio album Circus (2008). After [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] was written, originally, Luke and Martin wanted to give the track to Katy Perry, but they later decided that it wasn't the right fit for her. They continued to work on the song with Billboard, and Luke commented that before giving the song to Spears {{he wanted to make sure}} it sounded different from his previous recordings. Darkchild stated that while working with him, Spears was very [...] "hands-on" [...] and [...] "had a lot of ideas for [...]" [...] He later commented he had produced two songs for the album, with one of them featuring Travis Barker. Darkchild added that the song [...] " [...] this rock feel which is out of the box, out of my norm, and I think it's out of her norm as well." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{difficulty}} level can be set, {{the race}} track selected {{and the number}} of laps is variable. The field includes ready made and custom made cars (the player can select engine, tires, suspension). Avoiding the slower cars the player come up to lap can be crucial. During a race, you can bump into other cars and into the side boards and other obstacles. This will damage <b>your</b> <b>car.</b> <b>In</b> every track, there is a pit lane (labeled with the letters [...] "PIT") where you can fuel up and repair <b>your</b> <b>car.</b> Top speed will decrease if the engine is damaged. This will make you lose time in every lap. When you are in the PIT STOP you can hold down the DOWN key to speed up car repairs. Fuel intake will be slower, though. The fuel consumption is determined by the RPM meter (as <b>in</b> real <b>cars).</b> <b>Your</b> <b>car</b> only consumes fuel when you accelerate. F1 tracks cannot be won at the first race unless you are an ace driver. To win an F1 race, try to memorize each curve and play each race several times to know where to brake and where to accelerate.|$|R
