5|$|By 1944, the SS-TV {{had been}} {{organized}} into three divisions: {{staff of the}} concentration camps in Germany and Austria, in the occupied territories, and of the extermination camps in Poland. By 1944, it became standard practice to rotate SS members {{in and out of}} the camps, partly based on manpower needs, but also to provide easier assignments to wounded Waffen-SS members. This rotation of personnel meant that nearly the entire SS <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on inside the concentration camps, making the entire organization liable for war crimes and crimes against humanity.|$|E
5|$|The {{abolition}} of papal authority made way not for orderly change, but for dissension and violence. Iconoclasm, destruction, disputes within communities {{that led to}} violence, and radical challenge to all forms of faith were reported daily to Cromwell—developments he tried {{to hide from the}} King. Once Henry <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> afoot, he acted. Thus at the end of 1538, a proclamation was issued forbidding free discussion of the Sacrament and forbidding clerical marriage, on pain of death.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} liberty {{was one of}} the {{defining}} features of Ba'athism, however, liberty not in the sense used by liberal democracies. Aflaq was a strong believer in pluralism of thought, but paradoxically, against pluralism in the form of votes. In theory, the Ba'ath Party would rule, and guide the people, in a transitional period of time without consulting the people because the party <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> right.|$|E

5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> {{going to happen in the}} story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Gloria confides in Lewis {{that she}} is dying and he {{provides}} her with support. When she asks him to run away with her, he turns her down and tells her he loves Audrey. Lewis then learns that Gloria is not ill and she and Gail were testing his loyalty to Audrey. Lewis is outraged when he realises Audrey <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going on and breaks up with her. He then gets revenge on Gloria by revealing that she has cheated in the local pub of the year competition. Lewis gets his job back at The Bistro and he moves into a flat on Victoria Street. Lewis begins to formulate a plan {{to get back at}} Gail for ruining his relationship with Audrey. He decides to use her guilt against her. One night at the Bistro, he pretends to slip and hurt his back. Gail takes pity on Lewis and allows him to stay with her, while she cares for him. During his time with Gail, Lewis offers her his support and advice about her problems. Lewis is not happy when he sees Audrey on a date with another man.|$|E

25|$|The {{most radical}} {{innovation}} of 1976 was the 6-wheeled Tyrrell P34. The P34 {{was a good}} car, often finishing third or fourth and winning the Swedish Grand Prix, {{but it was not}} superior to the best 4-wheeled cars. 1976 also saw the Lotus team fitting brushes or plastic skirts under its rather uncompetitive 77; McLaren and Brabham also experimented with air-dams and splitters in an attempt to cause low-pressure areas under the car but found no significant effect on performance, in fact nobody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in Chapman's mind.|$|E
25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got too close to a wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{there are}} a number of stories {{sloshing}} around the news now that have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an acrid level. The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> going to happen but did nothing about it, or were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E

25|$|The OECD {{reported}} on Irish schools {{and levels of}} education in 1962-68, as {{an essential part of}} the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967-70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of thousands of children had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late to this country.|$|E
25|$|The bandit's {{most famous}} exploit {{occurred}} {{early in his}} career in 1944—the robbery of the Duchess of Pratameno. He and his men sneaked into her estate unnoticed, and Giuliano was in her salon before she <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> occurring. He kissed her hand and showed respect for her noble status, but then demanded all of her jewelry. When she refused, Giuliano threatened to kidnap her children. After she handed the loot over, he took a diamond ring from her hand, which he wore {{for the rest of his}} life, and borrowed John Steinbeck's “In Dubious Battle” from her library before leaving (which was returned with a respectful note a week later). By mid-1945, Giuliano's daring, good looks, and theatrical flair were the talk of Sicily, and soon beyond.|$|E
25|$|The {{version of}} Livy and Polybius is {{supported}} by other ancient historians, such as Florus and Frontinus. In “The Punic Wars”, {{a part of his}} “Roman History”, Appian relates another story of the events. According to Appian, Scipio detached only Massinissa and his horsemen to prevent Syphax from rendering help to Hasdrubal. With the bulk of his legionaries the Roman commander attacked suddenly the camp of Hasdrubal and slaughtered almost all of his soldiers, because those who initially made their escape were rounded up by the Roman cavalry. When Syphax <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening, he sent a cavalry detachment to assist Hasdrubal, but these horsemen were met and routed by Massinissa. Fearing that Scipio would turn on him after dealing with Hasdrubal’s army, Syphax abandoned his camp and retreated to safety with his army.|$|E

25|$|Another {{allegation}} {{is that in}} 2011, the Prime Minister's office {{facilitated the}} release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake – after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours – long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in Dirty Politics suggest he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only {{have come from the}} SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.|$|E
25|$|The Wings {{were quickly}} {{selected}} as favorites {{to win the}} Stanley Cup and they were right. With so much talent on one team, including the first time three 500-goal scorers {{were on the same}} team, they quickly got off to a great start, winning 22 of their first 27 games. After finishing with 116 points and {{the best record in the}} NHL (by 15 points), the Wings had earned the first seed in the Western Conference and met the Vancouver Canucks in the first round. After the Canucks took the first 2 games, it looked like the Canucks were going to sweep the Red Wings and the Red Wings were going to have their 2nd straight early exit. Their Captain, Steve Yzerman gave a closed-door speech to the team. Only the players in the locker room <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> said, but the Wings headed to Vancouver and won four straight games to take the series.|$|E
25|$|To {{support the}} Irish Rebellion of 1798 the French sent a naval {{expedition}} to Ireland that landed 1,099 soldiers under Jean Joseph Amable Humbert in August 1798. Unaware that Humbert {{was forced to}} surrender on 8 September, a second force of 2,844 troops under Hardy left for Ireland on 16 September. The naval squadron led by Jean-Baptiste-François Bompart was intercepted in the Battle of Tory Island {{and almost all of}} its ships captured, Hardy and most of his men becoming prisoners. He was exchanged in time to join the Army of the Danube in March 1799, but he was ill at the time and did not stay with the army long. Hardy assumed the rank of general of division on 30 July 1799. He was a friend of André Masséna and <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> happening at his headquarters even though Hardy was not there. During the summer, the French Directory planned to replace Masséna as leader of the Army of the Danube but later decided to confirm him as commander. On 9 September Hardy wrote that Masséna was surprised at the decision.|$|E
