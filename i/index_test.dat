40|$|Research {{into the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of clinical tests is often hampered by single or double partial verification mechanisms, that is, not all patients have their disease status verified by a reference test, neither do all patients receive all <b>tests</b> under evaluation (<b>index</b> <b>tests).</b> We show methods that reduce verification bias introduced when omitting data from partially tested patients. Adjustment techniques are well established {{when there are}} no missing <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> and when the reference test is missing at random. However, in practice, <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> tend to be omitted, and the choice of applying a reference test may depend on unobserved variables related to disease status, that is, verification may be missing not at random (MNAR). We study double partial verification in a clinical example from reproductive medicine in which we analyse the diagnostic values of the chlamydia antibody test and the hysterosalpingography in relation to a diagnostic laparoscopy. First, we plot all possible combinations of sensitivity and specificity of both <b>index</b> <b>tests</b> in two test ignorance regions. Then, we construct models in which we impose different assumptions for the verification process. We allow for missing <b>index</b> <b>tests,</b> study the influence of patient characteristics and study the accuracy estimates if an MNAR mechanism would operate. It is shown that data on tests used in the diagnostic process of the same population are preferably studied jointly and that the influence of an MNAR verification process was limited in a clinical study where {{more than half of the}} patients did not have the reference test.

50|$|The Foam <b>Index</b> <b>Test</b> is a {{laboratory}} titration procedure which determines the AEA absorption on fly ash or fly ash and cement mixtures. An AEA is titrated into a fly ash and cement suspension and the suspension is shaken. The added AEA leads to foam formation {{on top of}} the liquid surface, which initially behaves in an unstable manner. At the endpoint of the test, the AEA absorption sites are “saturated” and the AEA contributes to foam formation {{on the top of the}} mixture. The amount of AEA required to obtain stable foam depends on fly ash quality, fly ash-cement interactions, and characteristics of the AEA. Some fly ashes, typically those with high unburned carbon contents, tend to adsorb high amounts of AEA, i.e. more AEA is needed to obtain stable foam.|$|E
50|$|The {{program is}} divided into two parts: the pre-clerkship {{curriculum}} and the clerkship curriculum, each spanning half of the three years. The pre-clerkship curriculum {{is divided into}} five medical foundations, where students meet with a faculty member twice a week in a small group setting for teaching. Learning is done using the problem-based learning approach, where students set objectives, complete independent research, and then use their small group sessions to teach others, ask questions, and challenge one another with the guidance of their tutor. Students also complete clinical skills and professional competencies training at this time. Students are not graded during pre-clerkship.

Feedback from the students' tutors is given on tests and the PPI (personal progress <b>index</b> <b>test)</b> provides the student with a sense of his progress during pre-clerkship.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{reference}} standards (CRSs) {{have been}} advocated in diagnostic accuracy {{studies in the}} absence of a perfect reference standard. The rationale is that combining results of multiple imperfect tests leads to a more accurate reference than any one test in isolation. Focusing on a CRS that classifies subjects as disease positive if at least one component test is positive, we derive algebraic expressions for sensitivity and specificity of this CRS, sensitivity and specificity of a new (<b>index)</b> <b>test</b> compared with this CRS, as well as the CRS-based prevalence. We use as a motivating example the problem of evaluating a new test for Chlamydia trachomatis, an asymptomatic disease for which no gold-standard test exists. As the number of component tests increases, sensitivity of this CRS increases at the expense specificity, unless all tests have perfect specificity. Therefore, such a CRS can lead to significantly biased accuracy estimates of the <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> The bias depends on disease prevalence and accuracy of the CRS. Further, conditional dependence between the CRS and <b>index</b> <b>test</b> can lead to over-estimation of <b>index</b> <b>test</b> accuracy estimates. This commonly-used CRS combines results from multiple imperfect tests in a way that ignores information and therefore is not guaranteed to improve over a single imperfect reference unless each component test has perfect specificity, and the CRS is conditionally independent of the <b>index</b> <b>test.</b> When these conditions are not met, as in the case of C. trachomatis testing, more realistic statistical models should be researched instead of relying on such CRSs.

To determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for the detection of nodal metastases in the staging of cutaneous invasive melanoma. To determine the diagnostic accuracy of imaging tests for the detection of distant metastases in the staging of cutaneous invasive melanoma.

40|$|The {{classical}} {{paradigm for}} evaluating test performance compares {{the results of}} an <b>index</b> <b>test</b> with a reference test. When the reference test does not mirror the “truth ” adequately well (e. g. is an “imperfect ” reference standard), the typical (“naïve”) estimates of sensitivity and specificity are biased. One has at least four options when performing a systematic review of test performance when the reference standard is “imper-fect”: (a) to forgo the classical paradigm and assess the index test’s ability to predict patient relevant outcomes instead of test accuracy (i. e., treat the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> as a predictive instrument); (b) to assess whether the results of the two tests (index and reference) agree or disagree (i. e., treat them as two alternative measure-ment methods); (c) to calculate “naïve ” estimates of the index test’s sensitivity and specificity from each study included in the review and discuss in which direction they are biased; (d) mathematically adjust the “naïve” estimates of sensitivity and specificity of the <b>index</b> <b>test</b> to account for the imperfect reference standard.

Five (5) commercially available repair materials were studied viz:- two special coatings of masonry and carbothane aliphatic paints, and three repair mortars consisting of general purpose, cement-based, and epoxy resin. The oxygen permeability and the water sorptivity test methods {{were used to determine}} and compare the performances of the various repair materials. In addition, three types of substrate surface preparation methods were investigated namely chiseling, cutting and brushing of the substrate. The results of the tests show that repair materials do have significant effect on increasing the durability of concrete. It was found that substrate preparation {{is an important factor in}} making a durable repair with wire brushed surface preparation giving best performance and chiseling giving least improvement in results. The epoxy resin repair material uniquely showed water-repellant properties in the sorptivity test, not typical of common concrete material behaviour.

40|$|Estimating near-surface {{moisture}} conditions {{from the}} reflectance spectra (400 – 2500 nm) of Sphagnum moss offers great {{opportunities for the}} use of remote sensing as a tool for large-scale detailed monitoring of near-surface peatland hydrological conditions. This article investigates the effects of changes in near-surface and surface moisture upon the spectral characteristics of Sphagnum moss. Laboratory-based canopy reflectance data were collected from two common species of Sphagnum subjected to drying and subsequent rewetting. Several spectral indices developed from the near infra-red (NIR) and shortwave infra-red (SWIR) liquid water absorption bands and two biophysical indices (REIP and the chlorophyll index) were correlated with measures of near-surface moisture. All spectral <b>indices</b> <b>tested</b> were significantly correlated with near-surface moisture (with r between 0. 27 and 0. 94). The strongest correlations were observed using indices developed from the NIR liquid water absorption features (fWBI 980 and fWBI 1200). However, a hysteretic response was observed in both NIR indices when the canopies were re-hydrated, a finding which may have implications for the timing of remote sensing image acquisition. The Moisture Stress Index (MSI), developed from the SWIR liquid water absorption feature also showed strong correlations with near-surface wetness although the range of moisture conditions over which the index was able to detect change was highly dependent on Sphagnum species. Of the biophysical spectral <b>indices</b> <b>tested</b> (REIP and the chlorophyll index), the most significant relationships were observed between the chlorophyll index and near-surface wetness. All spectral <b>indices</b> <b>tested</b> were species specific, and this is attributed to differences in canopy morphology between Sphagnum species. The potential for developing estimations of surface and near-surface hydrological conditions across northern peatlands using remote sensing technology is discussed. <br/...|$|R
