25|$|In 1829 Clayton {{was elected}} to the United States Senate as its {{youngest}} member. Six years later he declined re-election, but the General Assembly elected <b>him</b> <b>anyway,</b> only to have him resign. He served from March 4, 1829 until December 29, 1836. He distinguished himself in the Senate by a speech during the debate on the Foote resolution, which, though merely relating to the survey of the public lands, introduced into the discussion the whole question of nullification. Clayton favored the extension of the charter for the Second Bank of the United States and his investigation of the Post Office Department led to its reorganization. At various times he served on the Military Affairs, Militia, District of Columbia and Post Office Committees, but his most important position was the Chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee in the 23rd and 24th Congress.|$|E

According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, [...] "Trumpiness" [...] does not even have to feel true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a Washington Post column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his [...] "wildest promises" [...] but supported <b>him</b> <b>anyway.</b>|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{received}} {{praise for}} the tariff, but in July 1842 he announced he would not seek re-election. [...] The Whigs nominated <b>him</b> <b>anyway,</b> but he refused it. Tired of Washington life and the conflict that had revolved around President Tyler, Fillmore sought {{to return to his}} life and law practice in Buffalo. Fillmore continued to be active in the lame duck session of Congress that followed the 1842 elections and returned to Buffalo in April 1843. According to his biographer, Scarry: [...] "Fillmore concluded his Congressional career at a point when he had become a powerful figure, an able statesman {{at the height of his}} popularity". Thurlow Weed deemed Congressman Fillmore [...] "able in debate, wise in council, and inflexible in his political sentiments".|$|E

500|$|Historian R. Hal Williams, in {{his book}} about the 1896 campaign, {{believes}} that the Populist nomination did Bryan little good; most Populists would have voted for <b>him</b> <b>anyway</b> and the endorsement allowed his opponents to paint him and his supporters as extremists. [...] The vice presidential squabble, Williams argues, worried voters who feared that instability would follow a Bryan victory, and drove them towards McKinley. Populist leader Henry Demarest Lloyd described silver as the [...] "cow-bird" [...] of the Populist Party, which had pushed aside all other issues. The National Silver Party, mostly former Republicans, met {{at the same time}} as the Populists; both conventions were in St. Louis.

The voters of his district elected <b>him</b> <b>anyway,</b> but he was not allowed to take his seat until the Congress' second session, after he was of legal age to serve. After moving to Henderson, Kentucky, Brown was elected from that district in 1866. On this occasion, he was denied his seat because of alleged disloyalty to the Union during the Civil War. Voters in his district refused to elect another representative, and the seat remained vacant throughout the term to which Brown was elected. [...] After an unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in 1871, Brown was again elected to the House in 1872 and served three consecutive terms.

But don't be jealous...it would cost me too dearly to play the gallant." [...] Napoleon's attempts to destroy Louise's reputation failed however, and they only made her more beloved in Prussia.

500|$|Returning to Trinidad, Roach {{scored two}} fifties in three {{first-class}} matches in 1929. In 1930 the MCC undertook {{a tour of}} the West Indies which included four Test matches—the first Tests to be played in the West Indies. The MCC side was not at full international strength; it included players who were either just beginning or just ending their international careers, and several star English bowlers were missing. Roach played in the first Test and, opening the batting, scored 122 in the first innings, the first Test century for West Indies and Roach's maiden century in first-class cricket. He hit the English bowler Wilfred Rhodes for successive fours to reach three figures. In his second innings, he scored 77 runs and the match was drawn. After the Test, Roach played twice for Trinidad against the MCC team without much success. When he failed to score in either innings of the second Test, played in Trinidad, he had scored just 24 runs in his last six innings. Disappointed with his form, he intended to miss the next Test, but the selectors picked <b>him</b> <b>anyway,</b> and he scored 209, the first double-century for the West Indies in Test matches. He shared partnerships of 144 for the first wicket with Errol Hunte, and 192 with George Headley for the second wicket. His second hundred runs were scored in 74 minutes. In his history of West Indies cricket, Michael Manley describes Roach's innings as [...] "dashing" [...] but containing an element of luck which contrasted with the safe play of Headley. West Indies eventually won the match comfortably to record their first win in Test matches. Roach did little during the final Test, but finished the series with 467 runs at 58.37, placing him third in the team batting averages. Only Roach and Headley from the home team played in every Test match. Inter-island politics meant that selectors tended to pick players from the island hosting the Test. In the series, 29 players represented the West Indies and the team had a different captain in each match.|$|E
