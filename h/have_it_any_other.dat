500|$|Some reviewers were {{critical}} of The Astonishings concept, including Consequence of Sound, who {{described it as}} [...] "very silly", but ultimately gave the album an overall positive review. By contrast, Record Collector described the storytelling as [...] "seamless". In their write-up, RTÉ.ie advised, [...] "park the snootiness before pressing the play button because while The Astonishing makes Iron Maiden's recent 92-minute double The Book of Souls look like a Ramones record, it's great fun ... Mental elbow grease is required, and the quintet wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{split from}} Paul, Naomi {{learned that she}} had secured her dream job in the United States. She left Erinsborough after saying goodbye to her family and friends. The storyline served as a {{permanent}} exit for Naomi, as O'Reilly {{decided to leave the}} show to pursue new career opportunities. She had been expected to take a temporary break following the birth of her first child. Of her exit, Herbison commented [...] "The Neighbours audience fell in love with Naomi instantly and we have certainly left the door wide open for her to rejoin the Cannings in the future – Sheila wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." ...|$|E
500|$|... 1UP.com gave Warhawk a {{positive}} review, but said, [...] "It's just not quite $40 worth," [...] {{referring to the}} price of the downloadable version on the U.S. PlayStation Store. It was given the IGN Editors' Choice Award, calling it [...] "a AAA experience that is an adrenaline rush for online fans." [...] Game Informer described Warhawk as [...] "better than they'd hoped for". GamePro stated that although Warhawk offers an intense online combat experience, being dropped immediately into the action leaves you [...] "somewhat bewildered" [...] and doesn't give you that [...] "feeling of connection" [...] to the game. GameTrailers described Warhawk as [...] "simply fun, easy to compete, but challenging to shine." [...] Adam Sessler from X-Play complimented the game's multiplayer only style saying [...] "...I wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." [...] Gaming Target selected Warhawk as one of their [...] "52 Games We'll Still Be Playing From 2007" [...] and awarded it [...] "PlayStation 3-Exclusive Game of the Year".|$|E

500|$|On his {{reliance}} on PayPal donations, Adams {{says he is}} content since he feels that people really like his work or they would not pay. Adams said that donations remain stable except during a new version update, {{where there is a}} sudden increase. Their expenses being low, he has maintained that he is happy as long as the game is self-sustaining and will not charge for it. In 2011, Adams refused a job offer from an unspecified major game developer and a $300,000 deal to license the name Dwarf Fortress from another company. Adams felt that this amount would not equate to long-term donations and that he prefers working on his own—not being part of the gaming industry. Adams said, [...] "Barely in the black one month, a little in the red another month. ... It's a risk I'm willing to take, and really I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." [...] He has spent no money on advertising and was happy when bloggers, reviewers like former game journalist Kieron Gillen from PC Gamer and Games for Windows, wrote about his game. In 2015, Bay 12 Games set up a Patreon account to help fund it.|$|E

[...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "It's kind of depressing that {{at this point in the}} show's run, an episode... is run of the mill, but that's the point we've reached with American Horror Story, and I'm not sure I'd <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." ...|$|E

Poor Benny, she kept up the best she could, and me and Tom tried to keep things cheerful there at the house, but it kind of went for nothing, as you may say. It was the same up at the jail. We went up every day to see the old people, but it was awful dreary, because the old man warn't {{sleeping}} much, and was walking in his sleep considerable and so he got to looking fagged and miserable, and his mind got shaky, and we all got afraid his troubles would break him down and kill him. And whenever we tried {{to persuade him to}} feel cheerfuler, he only {{shook his head and said}} if we only knowed what it was to carry around a murderer's load in your heart we wouldn't talk that way. Tom and all of us kept telling him it WASN'T murder, but just accidental killing! but it never made any difference--it was murder, and he wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way. He actu'ly begun to come out plain and square towards trial time and acknowledge that he TRIED to kill the man. Why, {{that was a}}wful, you know.

But he promised he wouldn't say a word about his murder when others was around, and we was glad of that.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to recording at I.D. Sound, Rundgren took an 8-track recorder and some studio equipment, installing {{it at his}} rented home on Astral Drive, Nichols Canyon. 'Intro' and 'Breathless' were recorded here, along with various guitar and keyboard overdubs. A version of 'Torch Song' was also recorded, but was scrapped due to excessive background noise. Rundgren recalled that recording at home meant he could spend time working on pieces of technology or production, such as programming a VCS3 synthesizer, at his leisure without wasting anyone else's time. The artwork on the original gatefold sleeve was also shot in this apartment. Despite working long hours each day in both I.D and at home, with minimum breaks for sleeping and eating, Rundgren said he enjoyed the recording experience, and [...] "wouldn't <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> <b>any</b> <b>other</b> way." ...|$|R
