40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to {{construct}} locally robust semiparametric GMM estimators, meaning equivalently moment conditions have zero derivative {{with respect to}} the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> and the <b>first</b> <b>step</b> does not affect the asymptotic variance. They are constructed by adding to the moment functions the adjustment term for <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimation. Locally robust estimators have several advantages. They are vital for valid inference with machine learning in the <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> see Belloni et. al. (2012, 2014), and are less sensitive to the specification of the <b>first</b> <b>step.</b> They are doubly robust for affine moment functions, so moment conditions continue to hold when one <b>first</b> <b>step</b> component is incorrect. Locally robust moment conditions also have smaller bias that is flatter as a function of <b>first</b> <b>step</b> smoothing leading to improved small sample properties. Series <b>first</b> <b>step</b> estimators confer local robustness on any moment conditions and are doubly robust for affine moments, {{in the direction of the}} series approximation. Many new locally and doubly robust estimators are given here, including for economic structural models. We give simple asymptotic theory for estimators that use cross-fitting in the <b>first</b> <b>step,</b> including machine learning. Comment: 42 page...|$|R

5|$|Ashmole {{was born}} in Breadmarket Street, Lichfield, Staffordshire. His family had been prominent, but its {{fortunes}} had declined {{by the time of}} Ashmole's birth. His mother, Anne, was the daughter of a wealthy Coventry draper, Anthony Bowyer, and a relative of James Paget, a Baron of the Exchequer. His father, Simon Ashmole (1589–1634), was a saddler, who had served as a soldier in Ireland and Europe. Elias Ashmole attended Lichfield Grammar School (now King Edward VI School) and became a chorister at Lichfield Cathedral. In 1633, he went to live in London as mentor to Paget's sons, and in 1638, with James Paget's help, he qualified as a solicitor. He enjoyed a successful legal practice in London, and married Eleanor Mainwaring (1603–1641), a member of a déclassé Cheshire aristocratic family, who died, while pregnant, only three years later on 6 December 1641. Still in his early twenties, Ashmole had taken the <b>first</b> <b>steps</b> towards status and wealth. He also became allied with Major-General Charles Worsley (who died 12 June 1656 and was buried at Westminster Abbey), brother-in-law of his sister, Mary Ashmole, who married John Booth, of Salford.|$|E
5|$|From the 16th century, the landowners {{were the}} Carre family, who {{operated}} tight {{control over the}} town, and it grew little in the early modern period. The manor passed from the Carre family to the Hervey family by the marriage of Isabella Carre to John Hervey, 1st Earl of Bristol, in 1688. The town's common land and fields were legally enclosed by 1794, giving ownership mostly to the Hervey family; this coincided with making the Slea into a canal, and heralded the <b>first</b> <b>steps</b> towards modern industry. The Sleaford Navigation brought economic growth until it was superseded by the railways in the mid-1850s. In the 20th century, the sale of farmland around Sleaford by Bristol Estates {{led to the development}} of large housing estates. The subsequent availability of affordable housing combined with the town's educational facilities and low crime rates made it an attractive destination for home-buyers. As a result, the town's population underwent the fastest growth of any town in the county in the 1990s.|$|E
