40|$|Current {{modeling}} {{of infectious diseases}} allows {{for the study of}} complex and realistic scenarios that go from the population to the individual level of description. However, most epidemic models assume that the spreading process takes place on a single level (be it a single population, a meta-population system or a network of contacts). In particular, interdependent contagion phenomena can only be addressed if we go beyond the scheme one pathogen-one network. In this paper, we propose a framework that allows describing the spreading dynamics of two concurrent diseases. Specifically, we characterize analytically the <b>epidemic</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the two diseases for different scenarios and also compute the temporal evolution characterizing the unfolding dynamics. Results show that there are regions of the parameter space in which the onset of a disease's outbreak is conditioned to the prevalence levels of the other disease. Moreover, we show, for the SIS scheme, that under certain circumstances, finite and not vanishing <b>epidemic</b> <b>thresholds</b> are found even at the thermodynamic limit for scale-free networks. For the SIR scenario, the phenomenology is richer and additional interdependencies show up. We also find that the secondary thresholds for the SIS and SIR models are different, which results directly from the interaction between both diseases. Our work thus solve an important problem and pave the way towards a more comprehensive description of the dynamics of interacting diseases. Comment: 24 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 3 appendices.

40|$|Studies on how {{to model}} the interplay between {{diseases}} and behavioral responses (so-called coupled disease-behavior interaction) have attracted increasing attention. Owing {{to the lack of}} obvious clinical evidence of diseases, or the incomplete information related to the disease, the risks of infection cannot be perceived and may lead to inappropriate behavioral responses. Therefore, how to quantitatively analyze the impacts of asymptomatic infection on the interplay between diseases and behavioral responses is of particular importance. In this Letter, under the complex network framework, we study the coupled disease-behavior interaction model by dividing infectious individuals into two states: U-state (without evident clinical symptoms, labelled as U) and I-state (with evident clinical symptoms, labelled as I). A susceptible individual can be infected by U- or I-nodes, however, since the U-nodes cannot be easily observed, susceptible individuals take behavioral responses only when they contact I-nodes. The mechanism is considered in the improved Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model and the improved Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, respectively. Then, one of the most concerned problems in spreading dynamics: the <b>epidemic</b> <b>thresholds</b> for the two models are given by two methods. The analytic results quantitatively describe the influence of different factors, such as asymptomatic infection, the awareness rate, the network structure, and so forth, on the <b>epidemic</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Moreover, because of the irreversible process of the SIR model, the suppression effect of the improved SIR model is weaker than the improved SIS model.

40|$|It is {{now well}} {{appreciated}} that population structure {{can have a}} major impact on disease dynamics, outbreak sizes and <b>epidemic</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Indeed, on some networks, epidemics occur only for sufﬁciently high transmissibility, whereas in others (e. g. scale-free networks), no such threshold effect exists.

We develop a simple and intuitive model for calculating the reproductive number R 0 on clustered networks with arbitrary degree distribution. The model clearly shows that in general, clustering impedes epidemic spread; however, its effects are usually small and/or coupled with other topological properties of the network.
