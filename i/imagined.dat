40|$|Abstract: This entry {{elucidates}} causal and constitutive {{roles that}} {{various forms of}} <b>imagining</b> play in human action. Imagination influences more kinds of action than just pretend play. I distinguish different senses of the terms “imagining” and “imagination”: imagistic <b>imagining,</b> propositional <b>imagining,</b> and constructive <b>imagining.</b> Each variety of <b>imagining</b> makes its own characteristic contributions to action. Imagistic <b>imagining</b> can structure bodily movement. Propositional <b>imagining</b> interacts with desires to motivate pretend play and mimetic expressive action. And constructive imagination generates representations of possibilities and actions {{on the basis of}} which we choose what to do. [Version archived here is a penultimate draft. ...|$|R

5|$|Imaginative space {{also serves}} an {{important}} function within the poem. Part one contains a rose garden that allegorically represents potential within human existence. Although the garden does not exist, it {{is described in}} realistic manner and is portrayed as an <b>imagined</b> reality. Also, the narrator's statement that words exist in the mind allows this <b>imagined</b> reality to be shared between the narrator and the reader. This is then destroyed by the narrator claiming that such a place has no purpose. The garden image has other uses within the poem beyond creating a shared imaginative space; it serves to invoke memories within the poem, and it functions {{in a similar manner}} in other works by Eliot, including The Family Reunion.|$|E

40|$|Although Gregory Currie {{is often}} {{presented}} as a strong defender of empathic simulation as part of spectator engagement, this paper questions the importance of empathy in Currie's philosophy of film. Currie's account of the imagination is too propositional, and his account of a more sensuous and experiential kind of <b>imagining</b> is found wanting. While giving a convincing account of impersonal <b>imagining</b> in relation to fiction film, Currie does not sufficiently explain what empathy is, and what relation it has {{to other forms of}} <b>imagining.</b> Simulation is primarily defined as impersonal, and perhaps more importantly, as conceptual and propositional in Currie's writings. This is perhaps most evident in his critique of personal <b>imagining,</b> where <b>imagining</b> seeing or <b>imagining</b> being becomes a self-reflexive form of <b>imagining</b> where the spectator also conceptualizes ‘I’ and ‘see’. This paper discusses the relation between personal <b>imagining</b> and empathy in Currie's account, and argues that he fails to show how empathy is of secondary importance for engagement in fiction film...|$|R
