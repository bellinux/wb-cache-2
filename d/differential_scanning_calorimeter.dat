40|$|The {{procedure}} for the calibration of <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimeters</b> (DSC) has been addressed by several authors. Most {{of the work}} published on this subject dealt mainly with the calibration on heating. For calibration on cooling, Menczel and Leslie suggested the use of thermally stable liquid crystals, for which the isotropic to nematic or cholesteric to isotropic transitions do not exhibit hysteresis on cooling. In this work, a new method is proposed to calibrate <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimeters</b> on cooling. It is suggested that the calibration on heating, with standard metals, may {{also be used to}} perform the calibration on cooling. The onset of the nematic to isotropic transition on heating (and vice-versa on cooling) will be used to support the method and to quantify the errors, which are of similar magnitude to those obtained by Menczel and Leslie with thermally stable high purity liquid crystals. Results of the change in the indium and lead crystallisation onset temperatures with the cooling rate are presented. Using as an example the non-isothermal crystallisation of polyethylene, the errors obtained with the standard calibration of the DSC and the new calibration on cooling are discussed. # 1999 Elsevier Science B.

In some circumstances (e. g. start of crystallization during cooling to the crystallization temperature, crystallization in emulsion) this straightforward approach is not applicable. This paper describes an indirect DSC method for determination of the crystallization kinetics under these 'difficult' circumstances. The principle is to stop the crystallization at different moments during the isothermal crystallization and raise the sample temperature. The amount of heat released is then used as a measure {{for the amount of}} crystallization and plotted as function of time. Combination of the stop-and-return method with the direct method may sometimes be used to save on measurement time. Stop-and-return experiments can furthermore be used to gain more insight in the crystallization mechanism {{based on the fact that}} different polymorphic forms and fractions have different melting temperatures.

Techniques have been developed for measurement of heat capacities using <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimeters,</b> but routine measurements with a precision better than 3 % are rare. For thermodynamic model development, excess enthalpies or enthalpies of mixing of binary and ternary systems are generally required.

25|$|The basic {{principle}} underlying {{this technique is}} that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as phase transitions, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is exothermic or endothermic. For example, as a solid sample melts to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature {{at the same rate as}} the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the endothermic phase transition from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as crystallization) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, <b>differential</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>calorimeters</b> are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions.
