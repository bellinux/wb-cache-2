40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) ability to effectively implement its mission of protecting {{public health and the}} environment relies largely on the integrity and transparency of (1) its assessments of the potential human health effects of exposure to chemicals and (2) its federal advisory committees, which are to provide independent, expert reviews of EPA's scientific work, among other functions. EPA's Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) program is critical in developing the agency's scientific positions on the potential health effects of exposure to toxic chemicals. These positions, used as a basis for environmental risk management decisions by EPA and others, are maintained in IRIS' database of more than 540 chemical assessments. Since 2001, GAO has issued a number of reports addressing the importance of integrity and transparency to EPA's chemical assessments and to <b>EPA's</b> federal advisory <b>committees.</b> GAO work on <b>EPA's</b> advisory <b>committees</b> has focused on its Science Advisory Board [...] 1 of 24 <b>EPA</b> federal advisory <b>committees</b> [...] which convenes panels to review many of the agency's scientific assessments and proposals. This testimony highlights scientific integrity and transparency issues GAO has reported on and relevant EPA reform efforts regarding (1) the IRIS assessment process and (2) federal advisory committee policies and procedures and appointment mechanisms. GAO has supplemented information from its prior reports with a preliminary review of the IRIS assessment process EPA issued on May 21, 2009, and the current appointment mechanisms for members of <b>EPA's</b> federal advisory <b>committees.</b> ...|$|R

Traditional locomotives largely utilize diesel combustion engines, resulting in emissions of NOx, diesel PM, hydrocarbons, and greenhouse gases (e. g. CO 2). These emissions are sometimes concentrated in areas exceeding National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Inventory development methods for locomotive emissions estimates vary dramatically {{from state to state}} and, in general, lack the spatial or temporal resolution needed to support air quality modeling. The ERTAC Rail Subcommittee was established with active representatives from twelve member states, three regional planning offices, and the US <b>EPA.</b> The <b>committee’s</b> goals are to (1) standardize agencies’ inventory development methods through a collaborative effort, (2) improve the quality of data received and the resulting emission inventories, and (3) reduce the administrative burden on railroad companies of providing data. The ERTAC Rail Subcommittee has identified five major rail-related source categories of interest and is working with the railroad industry to establish the methodology, collect the supporting data for a 2008 regional or nationwide emissions inventory, and to prepare a protocol for future inventory development.

40|$|A key {{determinant}} of {{the fate of}} the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) 1997 ozone standard is how the Agency responds to a Court of Appeals' decision that it must consider not only harmful respiratory effects, but also ozone's beneficial ability to reduce exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation (UV-B). In January 2001, EPA Administrator Browner signed a proposed response to the Court of Appeals' decision, but it has several problems. <b>EPA's</b> Scientific Advisory <b>Committee</b> did not review the scientific basis for Browner's proposed response, although such review is required by statute and EPA's internal procedures. The proposed response also ignores earlier EPA analysis suggesting that the health benefits of ozone are not negligible. Finally, it has significant conceptual flaws that the Advisory Committee could have corrected. The existence of a tradeoff between respiratory effects and UV-B related risks means that careful science is essential to ensure that air quality standards improve public health. Before publishing a proposed response to the Court's decision, EPA should submit its assessments of UV-B related risks to its Scientific Advisory Committee. It should also seek the Committee's advice about how to set standards. ...|$|R

40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses highlights of GAO's report about the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) efforts to institutionalize the protection of children's health. EPA's mission is to protect {{human health and the}} environment. As a result of mounting evidence about the special vulnerabilities of the developing fetus and child, the federal government and EPA took several bold steps to make children's environmental health a priority in the late 1990 s. In 1996, EPA issued the National Agenda to Protect Children's Health from Environmental Threats (National Agenda) and expanded the agency's activities to specifically address risks for children, documenting EPA's plans to achieve seven goals, such as (1) ensuring that all standards set by EPA are protective of any heightened risks faced by children; (2) developing new, comprehensive policies to address cumulative and simultaneous exposures faced by children; and (3) expanding community right-to-know to allow families to make informed choices concerning environmental exposures to their children. <b>EPA's</b> Advisory <b>Committee</b> has raised concerns about whether the agency has continued to maintain its earlier focus on protecting children or capitalized on opportunities to tackle some significant and emerging environmental health challenges. For example, the Advisory Committee wrote to the Administrator in April 2007 to reflect on EPA's achievements in the 10 years since the Executive Order was signed. The committee cited successes, such as increased margins of safety for pesticides mandated under the Food Quality Protection Act and the creation of the National Children's Study. However, the Advisory Committee also expressed serious concerns about EPA's continued lack of focus on children's environmental health issues and the lack of progress in addressing the committee's many recommendations. In the intervening years, children's environmental health has become no less pressing. In fact, 66 percent of children lived in counties where air exceeded {{one or more of the}} six principal pollutants. Two of them [...] ozone and particulate matter [...] are known to cause or aggravate respiratory diseases such as asthma. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), asthma is the third most common cause of hospitalizations for children, resulting in $ 3. 2 billion for treatment and 14 million days of school lost annually. In light of concerns about EPA's focus on children, Congress asked that GAO assess the agency's consideration of children's environmental health. This statement summarizes highlights from GAO's report being released today that addresses the extent to which EPA has institutionalized the protection of children's health from environmental risks through (1) agency priorities, strategies, and rulemakings, including implementation of Executive Order 13045; (2) the use of key offices and other child-focused resources, such as the Office of Children's Health and the Advisory Committee; and (3) involvement in federal interagency efforts to protect children from current and emerging environmental threats. To perform this work we, among other things, interviewed officials from multiple EPA program offices most directly involved with children's health issues; reviewed key EPA children's health-related policies, strategic and performance plans, and guidance documents; analyzed regulations subject to the regulatory requirements of the Executive Order; and identified the accomplishments of the Task Force. ...|$|R
