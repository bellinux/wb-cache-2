5|$|Carr Hill House was {{the largest}} estate in the village; a {{freehold}} mansion house on Carr Hill Lane. The date of building is unknown, {{but it does not}} appear on an enclosure map of 1766, suggesting it was built after that date. There is strong evidence that it was once a lunatic asylum; in 1770 an advertisement in a local newspaper declared:LUNATICKSCarr's Hill House on Gateshead Fell To The Public We beg Leave to inform the Public that we <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> above HOUSE pleasantly situated about a mile distant from Newcastle, which we have fitted up in an elegant manner, with every Accommodation for the reception of LUNATICKS in genteel or opulent circumstances: in this House Persons entrusted to our Care shall be treated with the utmost Attention and Humanity. The terms are reasonable. R. Lambert, W. Keenlyside, H Gibson, R. Stoddard (surgeons to the Infirmary), Newcastle 1767.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} medieval period, with its many {{competing}} kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship was not inherited {{in a direct}} line from the previous king. A candidate for kingship usually needed {{to be a member}} of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have received rewards in return. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.|$|E
5|$|On May 31, as McClellan planned an assault, {{his army}} was {{surprised}} by a Confederate attack. Johnston saw that the Union army was split in half by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River and hoped to defeat it in detail at Seven Pines and Fair Oaks. McClellan was unable to command the army personally because of a recurrence of malarial fever, but his subordinates were able to repel the attacks. Nevertheless, McClellan received criticism from Washington for not counterattacking, which some believed could <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> city of Richmond to capture. Johnston {{was wounded in the}} battle, and General Robert E. Lee assumed command of the Army of Northern Virginia. McClellan spent the next three weeks repositioning his troops and waiting for promised reinforcements, losing valuable time as Lee continued to strengthen Richmond's defenses.|$|E

5|$|The fungus kingdom {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} diversity of taxa with varied ecologies, life cycle strategies, and morphologies ranging from unicellular aquatic chytrids to large mushrooms. However, {{little is known}} of the true biodiversity of Kingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at 2.2 million to 3.8 million species, of which only 120,000 have been described. Ever since the pioneering 18th and 19th century taxonomical works of Carl Linnaeus, Christian Hendrik Persoon, and Elias Magnus Fries, fungi have been classified according to their morphology (e.g., characteristics such as spore color or microscopic features) or physiology. Advances in molecular genetics <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> way for DNA analysis to be incorporated into taxonomy, which has sometimes challenged the historical groupings based on morphology and other traits. Phylogenetic studies published {{in the last decade}} have helped reshape the classification within Kingdom Fungi, which is divided into one subkingdom, seven phyla, and ten subphyla.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Medieval period, British kingship was not {{inherited}} {{in a direct}} line from previous kings, as {{would be the case}} in the late Middle Ages. There were instead a number of candidates for kingship, who usually needed {{to be a member of}} a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but occasionally themselves had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have placed obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. After a victory, sub-kings may have received rewards in return for this service. Interaction with and intermarriage into the ruling families of subject kingdoms may <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of these mergers, it is likely that a complex process by which kingship was gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties was taking place.|$|E

25|$|Development of {{a modern}} rail network for Greece {{has been a major}} goal since the 1990s. In 1996, {{construction}} of what is currently known as the P.A.Th.E./P. was given the go-ahead. The line, which should have opened by 2004, will link Patras, Athens, Thessaloniki and the Greece–Republic of Macedonia and Greece–Bulgaria borders in Idomeni and Promachonas respectively.

25|$|In {{the last}} years of the century, the company {{continued}} to stage Shakespeare's new plays, including Julius Caesar and Henry V, which may <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> Globe, and Hamlet, which may well have appeared first at the Curtain. Among non-Shakespearean drama, A Warning for Fair Women was certainly performed, as was the Tudor history Thomas Lord Cromwell, sometimes seen as a salvo in a theatrical feud with the Admiral's Men, whose lost plays on Wolsey date from the same year.|$|E

25|$|Sesame {{seeds are}} {{protected}} by a capsule which only bursts when the seeds are completely ripe. This is called dehiscence. The dehiscence time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules <b>have</b> <b>opened.</b> <b>The</b> discovery of an indehiscent mutant (analogous to nonshattering domestic grains) by Langham in 1943 began the work towards development of a high-yielding, dehiscence-resistant variety. Although researchers have made significant progress in sesame breeding, harvest losses due to dehiscence continue to limit domestic US production.|$|E

The shopping centre was sold in 2001 by Great Portland Estates to Sapphire Retail Fund, which was 50% owned by the Reuben Brothers.

25|$|India's gross {{domestic}} savings in 2006–07 {{as a percentage}} of GDP stood at a high 32.8%. More than half of personal savings are invested in physical assets such as land, houses, cattle, and gold. The government-owned public-sector banks hold over 75% of total assets of the banking industry, with the private and foreign banks holding 18.2% and 6.5% respectively. Since liberalisation, the government has approved significant banking reforms. While some of these relate to nationalised banks – such as reforms encouraging mergers, reducing government interference and increasing profitability and competitiveness – other reforms <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> banking and insurance sectors to private and foreign companies.|$|E
25|$|Since ancient times, people <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> rainforest, {{altered the}} ecosystem, shaped the landscapes and created rice paddy and {{terraces}} {{to support the}} growing population. Javan rice terraces have existed {{for more than a}} millennium, and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms. The growing human population has put severe pressure on Java's wildlife, as rainforests were diminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas. Some of Java's endemic species are now critically endangered, with some already extinct; Java used to have Javan tigers and Javan elephants, but both have been rendered extinct. Today, several national parks exist in Java that protect the remnants of its fragile wildlife, such as Ujung Kulon, Mount Halimun-Salak, Gede Pangrango, Baluran, Meru Betiri and Alas Purwo.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, the Cotton Bowl Classic {{moved to}} the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, {{as part of a}} bid by bowl {{officials}} to make it part of the BCS in 2011. Although the Cotton Bowl had recently been remodeled, Dallas' cold January weather had been a longstanding concern, and was thought to have hampered any prospect of upgrading the game to the BCS. In contrast, the new stadium would offer top amenities and a retractable roof. A new four-year agreement between the BCS and ESPN had forestalled any possibility of the Cotton Bowl Classic joining the BCS until 2015 at the earliest. Later findings that the Fiesta Bowl reimbursed employees more than $46,000 for political contributions could <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> door for the Cotton Bowl to replace the Fiesta in the BCS bowl rotation; however, the Fiesta Bowl did not lose its BCS rotation.|$|E

25|$|Awer Mabil had {{the first}} chance of the match. The Adelaide United forward could <b>have</b> <b>opened</b> <b>the</b> scoring inside the opening five minutes but he failed to latch on to Sergio Cirio's square pass through the penalty area. As the match progressed, Adelaide playmaker Marcelo Carrusca was next to test Perth Glory keeper Danny Vukovic, {{stinging}} the keeper's fingers from long range. Perth's shouts for a penalty on the 25th minutes were waved away by the referee, when Adelaide's keeper Eugene Galekovic and Richard Garcia tangled just outside the area but replays showed Galekovic won the ball. The visiting team racked up the fouls with Garcia and Joshua Risdon earning bookings on the 32nd and 42nd minutes respectively before Mabil squandered an opportunity to break the deadlock in first half injury time. After Carrusca won back possession on halfway, he released Bruce Djite who in turn teed up Mabil who blasted high and wide from eight metres with just the keeper to beat.|$|E

500|$|In {{his early}} years, Escher sketched landscapes and nature. He also sketched insects such as ants, bees, {{grasshoppers}} and mantises, which appeared frequently {{in his later}} work.
