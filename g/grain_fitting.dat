50|$|Some {{discussion}} {{has taken place}} regarding {{the cause of the}} flexibility. At one time it was ascribed to the presence of thin scales of mica which were believed to permit a certain amount of motion between adjacent grains of quartz. More probably, however, it is due to the porous character of the rock together with the interlocking junctions between the sand grains. The porosity allows interstitial movement, while the hinge-like joints by which the particles are connected hold them together in spite of the displacement. These features are dependent to some extent on weathering, as the rocks contain perishable constituents which are removed and leave open cavities in their place, {{while at the same time}} additional silica may have been deposited on the quartz <b>grains</b> <b>fitting</b> their irregular surfaces more perfectly together. Most of the known flexible rocks are also fine-grained; in some cases they are said to lose their flexibility after being dried for some time, probably because of the hardening of some interstitial substance, but many specimens kept in a dry atmosphere for years retain this property in a high degree.|$|R
40|$|Analysis of grain-size {{distributions}} of coastal sands {{reveals that the}} distributions may be considered as composed of two (or more) lognormal components. It is tempting to infer that these components are derived from different depositional mechanisms. More faith could be placed in this inference if other characteristics of the deposit were describable {{in terms of the}} mixing of a similar number of components. Attention has been directed to the shape characteristics of the deposits. Feature extraction was achieved by digitizing the perimeter of the silhouettes of about 700 <b>grains</b> and <b>fitting</b> a truncated Fourier series to the outlines. The first eight harmonic amplitudes of these series were analyzed to detect naturally occurring clusters.

40|$|The aim in {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} {{numerical}} model capable of predicting the grain density in the Mg-based matrix phase of an AZ 91 /SiC composite, {{as a function of the}} diameter and total mass fraction of the embedded SiC particles. Based on earlier work in a range of alloy systems, we assume an exponential relationship between the grain density and the maximum supercooling during solidification. Analysis of data from cast samples with different thicknesses, and mass fractions and particle diameters of added SiC, permits conclusions to be drawn on the role of SiC in increasing <b>grain</b> density. By <b>fitting</b> the data, an empirical nucleation law is derived that can be used in a micro-macro model. Numerical simulations based on the model can predict the grain density of magnesium alloys containing SiC particles, using the diameter and mass fraction of the particles as inputs.

40|$|We {{present the}} Spitzer IRS spectra for 33 young stars in Tr 37 and NGC 7160. The sample {{includes}} the high- and intermediate-mass stars with MIPS 24 µm excess, {{the only known}} active accretor in the 12 Myr-old cluster NGC 7160, and 19 low-mass stars with disks in the 4 Myr-old cluster Tr 37. We examine the 10 µm silicate feature, present in the whole sample of low-mass star and in 3 of the high- and intermediate-mass targets, and we find that PAH emission is detectable only in the Herbig Be star. We analyze the composition {{and size of the}} warm photospheric silicate <b>grains</b> by <b>fitting</b> the 10 µm silicate feature, and study the possible correlations between the silicate characteristics and the stellar and disk properties (age, SED slope, accretion rate, spectral type). We find indications of dust settling with age and of the effect of turbulent enrichment of the disk atmosphere with large grains. Crystalline grains are only small contributors to the total silicate mass in all disks, and do not seem to correlate with any other property, except maybe binarity. We also observe that spectra with very weak silicate emission are at least 3 times more frequent among M stars than among earlier spectral types, which may be an evidence of inner disk evolution. Finally, we find that 5 of the highand intermediate-mass stars have SEDs and IRS spectra consistent with debris disk models involving planet formation, which could indicate debris disk formation at ages as early as 4 Myr.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{combined}} effects of {{size and shape}} of small solid state particles on the absorption, emission and scattering characteristics. We use the statistical approach to calculate these optical properties. In this approach the average optical properties of an ensemble of particles in random orientation are represented by the average optical properties of an ensemble of simple shapes. The validity of this approach is studied in detail for a uniform distribution of hollow spheres where the fractional volume of the central inclusion is varied. We apply the results to two different areas of interest, i) infrared spectroscopy and ii) polarization of scattered light. The effects of particle size and shape on the optical characteristics are discussed. We compare the results using the distribution of hollow spheres with those obtained by using randomly oriented spheroids. Also we compare the results with observations and laboratory measurements. The distribution of hollow spheres is very successful in reproducing laboratory measurements of the scattering angle distribution of the degree of linear polarization for incident unpolarized light of randomly oriented irregular quartz particles. Furthermore, we show that we are able to derive the size distribution of dust <b>grains</b> by <b>fitting</b> the measured degree of linear polarization using computational result for hollow spheres. It is shown that the distribution of hollow spheres is a powerful tool for studying light scattering, absorption and emission by cosmic dust grains and in particular when large numbers of particle parameters need to be considered since the computational demand of the distribution of hollow spheres is small.

40|$|There {{have been}} {{substantial}} advances in {{modeling and simulation}} of microstructure in 3 D. These have been accompanied by equally significant advances in characterization techniques, with serial sectioning, synthetic microstructure generation, and synchrotron radiation all contributing strongly. Image-based methods for solving elastic, viscoplastic and elasto-viscoplastic problems are now available to complement finite element methods. The image-based methods sidestep the difficulty of generating meshes that conform to 3 D microstructures while preserving mesh quality. The resolution available permits many aspects of heterogeneity in deformation to be investigated. Materials can also be orientation mapped nondestructively in 3 D thanks to penetrating radiation at synchrotrons, which permits microstructural evolution to be characterized. Synthetic microstructure generation now accounts for distributions of orientation, grain boundary character, and <b>grain</b> morphology, even <b>fitting</b> the tails of distributions. Software packages such as Dream 3 D substantially facilitate the exchange of 3 D data between experimental systems and simulation programs.

40|$|In {{this work}} several geometries, each {{representing}} a different porous medium, {{are considered to}} perform detailed computational fluid dynamics simulation for fluid flow, particle transport and deposition. Only Brownian motions and steric interception are accounted for as deposition mechanisms. Firstly pressure drop in each porous medium is analyzed {{in order to determine}} an effective <b>grain</b> size, by <b>fitting</b> the results with the Ergun law. Then grid independence is assessed. Lastly, particle transport in the system is investigated via Eulerian steady-state simulations, where particle concentration is solved for, not following explicitly particles' trajectories, but solving the corresponding advection-diffusion equation. An assumption was made in considering favourable collector-particle interactions, resulting in a perfect sink" boundary condition for the collectors. The gathered simulation data are used to calculate the deposition efficiency due to Brownian motions and steric interception. The original Levich law for one simple circular collector is verified; subsequently porous media constituted by a packing of collectors are scrutinized. Results show that the interactions between the different collectors result in behaviours which are not in line with the theory developed by Happel and co-workers, highlighting a different dependency of the deposition efficiency on the dimensionless groups involved in the relevant correlations...|$|R

Plastic deformation and cracking resistance of SiC ceramics measured by indentation. Ceramic Engineering and Science Proceedings. Mechanical Properties and Performance of Engineering Ceramics and Composites IX, 35 (2), pp. 91 - 100, which has been published in final form at [URL] This article {{may be used for}} non-commercial purposes in accordance with Wiley Terms and Conditions for Self-Archiving. Presented at the 38 th International Conference and Expo on Advanced Ceramics and Composites (ICACC' 14) Daytona Beach, Florida. Hardness is deemed as a measurement of resistance to plastic deformation of materials, but cracking, accompanying the deformation of ceramics, has recently been reasonably interpreted as one of the essential contributors to the widely known size effect of hardness, also called the indentation size effect. On the basis of the physical activities behind the indentation size effect, we intend to have the indentation size effect measurement adapted as a means to quantitatively measure the plastic deformation and the cracking damage of ceramics. We studied three types silicon carbide ceramics that were manufactured from same chemical formulation and processing route. Two of the three were given a post-sintering annealing at different dwell times, giving a distinctive microstructure from homogeneous equiaxial grains to highly heterogeneous elongated <b>grains.</b> By <b>fitting</b> the indentation size effect data with proportional specimen resistance model, the a 1 and a 2 parameters are extracted with good confidence. The a 2 value is interpreted as the “true hardness”, the determined values of which were found to be similar for all samples. However, the a 1, relatable to the indentation size effect, increased dramatically together with the indentation-induced cracking around Vickers indents observed under SEM. Considering that the cracking resistances of all three samples showed limited variance, we discuss, using a simple illustrative model, the possible microstructural factors which may contribute to the cracking damage exhibited under a defined loading condition...|$|R
40|$|The {{strength}} and ductility of bulk nanostructured and ultrafine-grained iron containing 0. 39 % oxygen by weight was determined by tensile tests. Samples were obtained by consolidation of milled iron powder at 500 degrees C. Heat treatments were designed to cover {{a wide range of}} grain sizes spanning from 100 to 2000 nm with different percentages of coarse and nanostructured grain areas, which was defined as a bimodal grain size distribution. Transmission electron microscopy was used to determine the diameter, volume fraction and location of oxides in the microstructure. The strength was analysed following two approaches. The first one was based on the strong effect of oxides and involved the use of a mixed particle-grain boundary strengthening model, and the second one was based on simple grain boundary strengthening. The mixed model underestimated the strength of nanostructured samples, whereas the simple grain boundary model worked better. However, for specimens with a bimodal <b>grain</b> size, the <b>fitting</b> of the mixed model was better. In this case, the more effective particle strengthening was related to the dispersion of oxides inside the large ferrite grains. In addition, the bimodal samples showed an acceptable combination of {{strength and}} ductility. Again, the ferrite grains containing oxides promoted strain hardening due to the increase in dislocation activity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|We {{have used}} the coronagraphic mode of the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope {{to make the first}} {{polarization}} maps of the debris disk surrounding the nearby M star AU Microscopii (GJ 803). The linear polarization of the scattered light from the disk is unambiguously detected. We find that the degree of polarization for the disk rises monotonically from about 0. 05 to 0. 35 between projected radii of 20 and 50 AU. Polarized light is detectable out to about 80 AU, where the fractional polarization reaches a maximum observed value of 0. 41 ± 0. 02. Polarization vectors are oriented perpendicular to the disk mid-plane, indicating that polarization originates from single scattering in an optically thin dust disk where the albedo is dominated by small (x = 2 πa/λ � 1) particles. We use simple, optically thin disk models to infer the spatial structure of the disk and the scattering properties of the constituent <b>grains</b> by simultaneously <b>fitting</b> the surface brightness profile and the degree of linear polarization. The best fit models require that the dust grains exhibit high maximum linear polarization and strong forward scattering. The inner disk (< 40 – 50 AU) is depleted of micron-sized dust by a factor of more than 300, which means that the disk is collision dominated, i. e., grains that are dragged inward by corpuscular and Poynting-Robertson drag undergo a destructiv...|$|R
40|$|We present Spitzer and submm {{observations}} of a Crab-like supernova remnant, G 54. 1 + 0. 3. We serendipitously discovered a dust feature peaking at 21 micron from G 54. 1 + 0. 3, and the 21 -micron dust is {{remarkably similar to}} that of Cas A from Rho et al. (2008). The IRS spectrum from the western shell shows the 21 -micron dust feature and strong [Ar II] and weak [Ne II], [S III] and [Si II] lines. Strong correlation between 21 -micron dust and Ar ejecta has been observed in Cas A. IRAC 8 -micron emission mostly from Ar ejecta shows shell-like morphology and MIPS 24 and 70 micron emission from continuum also show shell-like morphology, suggesting that dust has been formed in ejecta. The shell-like ejecta distribution around pulsar wind nebula is analogy with that of the Crab Nebula. We detected submm emission from G 54. 1 + 0. 3 using SHARCII (at 350 micron) and LABOCA (at 870 micron).

40|$|Lead {{zirconate}} titanate (PZT) {{has been}} widely applied in actuators and sensors due to its excellent piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. However, impurities, {{one of the major}} problems involved in the mass production of PZT ceramics, have not attracted enough attention. In this thesis, investigations on the effects of impurities from the raw materials on the sintering and properties of lead zirconate titanate with a composition of PbZr 0. 53 Tit. 47 O 3 were conducted. The impact of starting materials, lead nonstoichiometry, and dopants was examined. The sintering behavior was monitored in a thermo-optical dilatometer and a kinetic-field approach was employed to obtain the activation energy for sintering of PZT ceramics with different compositions. The bulk ceramics were characterized in terms of microstructure, dielectric, piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. At first, a comparison in sintering between the PZT samples prepared from industrially used (IM) and highly pure raw materials (HM) was made. Reduced sintering temperatures and higher densification rate were observed on the IM sample owing to the secondary phase on the grain boundary. Different electric properties of these two samples were also evidenced. To evaluate their contributions to the observed difference of IM and HM samples, various impurities, which were identified in the IM raw materials, were added in the highly pure samples. It was shown that the sintering was changed through the formation of charged vacancies (impurity Na, Fe, Al, Y) or melt phase (Si) with low melting point. The most important impurity species was identified as Na, Y and Si and their effect on the ceramics properties was investigated as a function of dopant concentration. They showed grain growth inhibition effect on PZT ceramics. The strongest effect was achieved by doping with Na. The grain size was reduced from 13 µm of undoped PZT to 2 µm at a doping level of 1 mol%. The dielectric constant was increased with Na doping, which was attributed to the decreasing grain size. In addition, because of the oxygen vacancies caused by the Na doping, “hard” piezoelectric behavior and ferroelectric properties were observed. Rare earth impurity, such as Y, with a valence and ion radius between A site and B site elements in PZT lattice, results in a combination of “soft” and “hard” characteristics. Melt phase formed from Si showed deteriorated effect on the properties of PZT ceramics. Deviations from the stoichiometric composition could result when the impurities were not considered in the weight fractions of the raw materials. The lead content in the system was affected by the crystalline phase of starting components as well. PbO concentration was changed during calcination depending on the formation kinetics of intermediate lead titanate. Sintering temperatures were dramatically reduced and densification rates were strongly enhanced by the introduction of lead oxide excess. The reason was believed {{to be associated with the}} liquid phase formed by PbO during sintering because of its low melting point. Rapid densification was observed at low level of PbO excess. However, a sluggish rearrangement process with low densification rate occurred in the PZT with 3. 0 % PbO excess at a temperature below the melting point of PbO. A small force (as small as 0. 1 MPa) on the sample could result in rapid densification and an additional densification maximum was evidenced. The tetragonal lattice distortion in the lead deficient samples was verified by Rietveld refinement, from which internal stress was introduced and attributed to the high dielectric constant. Moreover, the increasing amount of lead deficiency could result in the segregation of ZrO 2. It shifts the Zr/Ti ratio to the Ti-rich side, which may be attributed to a higher dielectric constant as well. The lead excess is favorable in improving both the microstructure and electrical properties of PZT ceramics. However, deteriorated properties were found in the samples in which the lead oxide excess is beyond a certain level (1. 5 mol% PbO). The kinetic field diagram was constructed using the shrinkage data from the optical dilatometry. Different dependence of activation energy on the fractional density was observed. It is attributed to the variation in the activation energies in densification and <b>grain</b> growth. By <b>fitting</b> the iso-strain lines, activation energy between 350 - 360 kJ/mol was obtained for densification of pure HM PZT sample and samples doped with 0. 5 % Na or Si. Smaller values were acquired for grain growth. Although liquid phase was present in Si-doped samples and the ones with PbO excess, a better match can be achieved using a solid state sintering model. The enhanced inhomogeneity and the rapid densification were suggested to explain the difficulty in fitting the sintering curves of 1. 5 wt%PbO added sample...|$|R
