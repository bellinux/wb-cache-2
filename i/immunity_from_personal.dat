25|$|Immunity from {{suits for}} acts or {{omissions}} in {{the discharge of}} judicial duties can promote the independence of judges in their decision-making. The State Courts Act ("SCA") provides that a judicial officer of the State Courts – that is, a district judge, magistrate, coroner or registrar – may not be sued for any act done by him in the discharge of his judicial duty, {{whether or not the}} judge is acting within the limits of his jurisdiction, so long as at the time he in good faith believed himself to have jurisdiction to do or order the act complained of. There is no corresponding statutory provision applicable to Supreme Court judges, but at common law a superior court judge enjoys absolute <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> civil liability in respect of any judicial act which he does in his capacity as a judge. The immunity extends to acts done outside the judge's jurisdiction, so long as he has acted reasonably and believing in good faith that the act was within his powers. Like judicial officers of the State Courts, the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, Assistant Registrars and other persons acting judicially in the Supreme Court are given statutory immunity from civil suit.|$|E

40|$|Professor Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s {{critique}} {{centers around}} {{a conflict between}} the 2 ̆ 2 moral certainty 2 ̆ 2 behind civil rights laws and doubts about their economic efficacy. It is a critique that would not impress Ms. Rosa Parks. After all, {{the back of a}} bus is only {{a few feet from the}} front. It arrives at the same time and performs the same function of delivering the worker to the job. Why then should Ms. Parks have put herself and her neighbors to the expense and discomfort involved in the Montgomery boycott of 1955 ? Only, according to Epstein, if she was challenging the combination of bigotry and the coercive power of the state. If she was challenging private custom standing alone, she was in error because market forces would make private discrimination unimportant. Epstein 2 ̆ 7 s distinction is illusory. The state was implicated in the bus operation. Legislation that granted limited liability and permitted concentration of capital cut off the personal responsibility the common law recognized. The power of the state to grant <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> <b>personal</b> liability is implicated in every corporate transaction. Our 2 ̆ 2 free market 2 ̆ 2 is a creature of this exercise of state power...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> {{execution of}} state property in execution proceedings of arbitral awards. In this study, I aim {{to consider the}} extent of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution in these execution proceedings. This includes considerations of current rules in public international law on <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution {{and the application of}} these rules on national execution proceedings of arbitral awards. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution protects state property <b>from</b> execution measures. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution is based on equality of states and the upholding of friendly relations between states. States have in the 20 th century started to participate in commercial transactions and dealings with individuals. This has led to the revision of the traditionally absolute notion of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution has been limited in certain instances. The view on the extent of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution is not always coherent in the international community. There is no universal international convention in force that regulates the matter. National courts interpret the rules on <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution, which means that there can be quite incoherent and unexpected decisions in this area of public international law. The certainty of execution is of crucial importance in relation to arbitral proceedings. <b>Immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution is a factor that compromises this certainty. As arbitration is time-consuming and costly, uncertainty relating to the execution of arbitral awards can mean that individuals refrain from arbitrating against states. This, again, can impact trade and investment involving states. The Sedelmayer saga is an excellent illustration of the implications that <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution can have on execution of mixed arbitral awards. Sedelmayer is an investor whose investment was expropriated by the Russian Federation. An arbitral award was subsequently rendered against Russia. Sedelmayer has sought execution against Russian property in both Germany and Sweden over the last 13 years, without fully succeeding to satisfy the award. He also appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on the ground of the German proceedings. In this thesis, I will critically consider the implications that <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution can have on execution of arbitral awards. Regard will be taken to sources of public international law, especially treaties and customary international law. I will also examine domestic legislation and case law in order to accurately consider national perceptions and tendencies of <b>immunity</b> <b>from</b> execution. I will especially use the Sedelmayer saga as an illustrating and exemplifying series of case law...|$|R
