40|$|Every year, {{federal and}} state courts put in place orders that {{regulate}} the prospective operations of certainly hundreds and probably thousands of large government and private enterprises. Injunctions and injunction-like settlement agreements-whether styled consent decrees, settlements, conditional dismissals, or some other more creative title-bind the activities of employers, polluters, competitors, lenders, creditors, property holders, schools, housing authorities, police departments, jails, prisons, nursing homes, and many others. The types of law underlying these cases multiply just as readily: consumer lending, environmental, employment, anti-discrimination, education, constitutional, and so on. <b>Injunctive</b> <b>orders,</b> whether reached by litigation or on consent, suffuse the regulatory environment, instructing the covered entities not only what they may not do, but also what they must do and how they must do it. Moreover, the reach of injunctions can extend well past their explicit scope because <b>injunctive</b> <b>orders</b> can serve as models for broader regulation or legislation and can set the boundaries of a regulatory agency 2 ̆ 7 s enforcement efforts.

50|$|Stationery Stores {{would win}} the Nigerian league in 1992, only to be relegated the {{following}} year for failing to complete its fixtures, not because the Club finished in the relegation spot. The team continued the next five seasons in the second division. However, in March 1998, the NFA was compelled to cancel all outstanding Pro League Second Division games involving Stationery Stores following an <b>injunctive</b> <b>order</b> issued by a Lagos High Court restraining Stationery Stores from playing any Pro League games pending the resolution of a lawsuit filed before the court to determine the ownership {{and control of the}} club. This action constituted the culmination of a long-festering ownership dispute involving two of the Adebajo siblings (each of whom was a director of The Nigeria Office Stationery Supply Stores Limited). The ownership tussle was thus laid to rest by the subsequent ruling of the court. However, while it lasted, that court process had a negative effect on the much-celebrated clubside. Its net effect was that throughout the course of the 1998 football season, its players were compelled to campaign without the benefit of formal contracts, sign-on fees, bonuses or club-supplied playing equipment.2 The team however continued to compete for honours up until the 1998 season but could not continue thereafter.|$|E

Herbalife responded to the probe by saying it “welcomes the inquiry given the tremendous amount of misinformation in the marketplace, and will co-operate fully with the FTC. We are confident that Herbalife is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The investigation process that is required for alleged pyramid schemes takes 12 to 18 months. In cases like the Herbalife investigation, the FTC often seeks to impose changes to a company’s practices—known as <b>injunctive</b> relief—in <b>order</b> to stop misconduct that it sees as harming consumers. In May 2016 a spokesperson from the FTC told Bloomberg that “Injunctive relief can be just as significant as the money obtained for consumers and even more influential on a company’s future operations”, in response to speculation that Herbalife was close to a resolution with the FTC.|$|R
5000|$|Many of the {{lawsuits}} [...] filed against Trump ask for declaratory relief. This remedy differs from <b>injunctive</b> relief (an <b>order</b> {{to do something}} or stop) and damages.

A declaration {{that the president has}} accepted emoluments would make the work of House Managers easier in an impeachment. [...] Blumenthal v. Trump asks for declaratory relief as to emoluments. In CREW and National Security Archive v. Trump and EOP, a declaratory finding that the administration willfully failed to retain records would support a charge of obstruction of justice.

5000|$|In {{this case}} I think an {{exercise}} of pendent-party jurisdiction over Symm would be demonstrably wrong under Aldinger, supra, and Owen, supra. The civil action created by § 1973bb is plainly limited to suits brought against States and political subdivisions. Accordingly, the special grant of three-judge-court jurisdiction contained in the statute is similarly limited. The other jurisdictional statutes invoked by the United States provide no independent basis of three-judge-court jurisdiction over Symm. Since the District Court could, in my opinion, have quite readily attributed Symm's actions as voting registrar to Waller County, a party statutorily authorized to be named and in fact named as a defendant, I would reverse the judgment against Symm and remand {{the case to the}} District Court for further proceedings against the county. While the <b>injunctive</b> relief <b>ordered</b> against Symm is contrary to Aldinger, supra, and Owen, supra, injunctive relief against Waller County, if the District Court decides such relief is appropriate, would be fully authorized and equally efficacious in vindicating the right of Prairie View students. In the absence of such relief, I would think that any student could bring an action against Symm under 28 U. S. C. § 1343. This analysis may all seem very [...] "legalistic" [...] and [...] "technical," [...] but since the case is here on direct appeal, {{we have no choice but}} to examine the question of federal jurisdiction. Upon such examination, I believe Aldinger, supra, and Owen, supra, require reversal of the judgment entered by the District Court.|$|R
40|$|Online {{copyright}} infringement {{is one of}} {{the toughest}} challenges the content industry has faced in the twenty first century. Article 8 (3) of the Information Society Directive, implemented under section 97 A of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, 1988, provides an injunctive remedy in response to such online infringement. Given the elusive nature of the website operators and the sheer number of their users, rights owners have turned to the Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to implement the injunctions granted under section 97 A to block websites with infringing content. In their battle to keep pace with online infringers, the UK courts have permitted significant compromises to the procedures while granting these <b>injunctive</b> blocking <b>orders.</b> One of the pioneers in this line of cases in the UK is the Pirate Bay case (TPB case), which ruled {{as a matter of law}} that the procedure under Section 97 A does not require the alleged infringers to be made parties to those proceedings. TPB case also marks the trend of the ISPs consenting to an order of injunction, and not defending the proceedings. This has resulted in the absence of any adverse party in the proceedings under section 97 A. This threatens the basic tenets of procedural fairness and propriety, having adverse consequences on both the substantive and procedural aspects, evident in the cases that followed TPB case. This article examines the aspects of the judgment in TPB case that led to these procedural compromises, whether it had any basis in the pre-existing case law, what the nature of an injunction under section 97 A is and how the subsequent line of cases have followed TPB case as a precedent. It further explores the adverse consequences of the procedural compromises and whether any safeguards are available against such compromises...|$|R

40|$|In {{response}} to the Government’s public discussion document on the way forward for competition policy in Hong Kong, we are pleased to submit this paper for consideration. In summary, our response is as follows. 1. We have no hesitation {{to say that a}} competition law for Hong Kong is necessary, if not long overdue. Our analysis is based on the economic efficiency that a competition law will promote and the market distortion that it will cure. Contrary to what some may believe, small market economies are more prone to anti-competitive conduct, due to their unique features of high industry concentration, substantial entry barriers, and high level of aggregate concentration. 2. Laissez-faire does not guarantee fair competition. Given their tremendous costs to society, a reasonable amount of evidence of anti-competitive behaviours will justify a law. A competition law will also protect Hong Kong consumers from international cartels originated from other countries, whose damages are estimated to far outweigh the costs of setting up and enforcing a law. 3. An unbiased competition regime should be extended to all sectors of the economy, in light of the deficiency of a sector-specific approach. We see two main drawbacks of the latter approach: misallocation of resources of the economy in the long run due to the different rules set for different sectors; and a credibility problem that arises when the very same agency acts as both the traditional industry regulator and competition policy enforcer. Nor is it fair to target certain industries of the economy. 4. On the scope of the proposed competition law, we recommend a broad approach covering anti-competitive conduct as well as market structure. In terms of market structure, we do not mean anti-monopoly, as monopoly per se is not anti-competitive. It is only the abuse of monopoly (via predatory pricing, tying and bundling etc) that would be scrutinized. We argue that mergers and acquisitions (M 2 ̆ 6 As) need to be regulated, as they can be motivated by market power considerations as well as efficiency gains. Reduced competition {{as a result of a}} merger cannot be reversed by regulating the behaviour of the merged firm ex post. We recommend a light-touched merger control regime with the adoption of large safe harbours, on the justifications that the importance of scale economy in Hong Kong sometimes necessitates a certain degree of rationalization. 5. On the enforcement front, we recommend the set-up of a competition authority empowered with investigative function (plus the power to issue civil <b>injunctive</b> <b>orders)</b> and a specialist tribunal with adjudicative function (the Canada model). It combines the benefits of expertise (of the competition authority) and the safeguards from bias (with independent adjudication), and leads to a high degree of transparency. 6. In terms of sanctions, we propose that punitive fines and director disqualifications be imposed on offenders of hardcore cartels (price fixing, market sharing and bid rigging), and monetary fines, civil or administrative, on all other competition infringements. This is to balance the severity of sanctions against the gravity of harm, and to achieve the necessary deterrent effect against blatant behaviour. 7. We strongly recommend that a leniency program be included in the competition law to encourage whistle-blowing. Whistle-blowing is more effective (if not the only possible means) to detect and lead to successful prosecution of hardcore cartels, as demonstrated clearly by the recent experiences in the US and the EU. 8. We recommend “partial exemption” of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) from the new law, similar to the US approach. In our view, exemptions of SMEs from regulations of M 2 ̆ 6 As and abuse of dominant position can be justified on economic efficiency grounds. However, price-fixing (market sharing and bid rigging as well) benefits the sellers more than it hurts consumers and hence should be prohibited by law. 9. The safety zone provided by the partial exemption scheme would help reduce SME’s compliance costs and protect them from excessive litigation. At the same time, the law would enable SMEs to sue other players, an option not feasible absent the law, thereby making them better off. 10. No adverse presumption in law should be construed against any type of enterprises, small or big, domestic or foreign. A competition law should neither penalize big players if they are efficient, nor protect small players if they are inefficient. The law is to protect the competition process, not competitors. The government is recommended to do more to educate the public about the nature and essence of competition law...|$|R
40|$|People {{often do}} not walk the talk {{when it comes to}} pro-environmental behaviour. From a Norm Focus theory {{perspective}} what may be happening is that people are experiencing conflicting norms, that is, although pro-environmental behaviour is approved of (i. e., positive injunctive norms), a majority of people are not engaging in pro-environmental behaviour (negative descriptive norms). People therefore perceive inconsistencies in norms and this undermines motivation to engage in pro-environmental actions. The current study aims to investigate whether providing comparative outgroup information (i. e., positive injunctive and descriptive norms) can help overcome the demotivating effect of this type of norm conflict. The logic is that status threat is induced when ingroup members perceive that the outgroup is acting more positively than the ingroup. As such, ingroup members will align their behaviour with the <b>injunctive</b> norm in <b>order</b> to improve group status. To investigate this idea 106 first year psychology students took part in 2 (Norm: Norms aligned, norm conflict) x 2 (Comparative outgroup information: Presented, not presented) experiment and their pro-environmental intentions and energy conservation behaviour were measured following the manipulations. Consistent with hypotheses, results showed that comparative information and norm conflict increased engagement in energy conservation behaviour. The same effect was not found on pro-environmental intentions, however, pro-environmental attitudes was found to moderate the effect of norm conflict and comparative information such that participants with less positive environmental attitudes had higher intentions when faced with norm conflict and comparative information...|$|R
