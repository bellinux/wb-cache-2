5|$|Justice Simpson's {{report was}} tabled in the House of Representatives on 28 June 1951 {{by the new}} Minister for Civil Aviation, Larry Anthony. The Inquiry found that the Amana {{suffered}} total loss of engine power {{on at least one}} occasion, followed by rapid loss of height until it struck the ground. However, the evidence did not allow the court to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the total loss of engine power. Consequently, the court was unable to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident. Simpson stated he was satisfied water had not been introduced into the Amana's fuel system in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide or Perth.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became the}} subject of an Inquiry chaired by a Supreme Court judge. In the absence of evidence indicating the source of any water in the fuel, the Inquiry dismissed the submission that water was responsible for the accident. The Inquiry did not <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the accident but it made recommendations to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen's crash {{remains a}} mystery because it had no close witnesses. Although it was caught on tape by a spectator further down the stage, {{it proved to be}} {{impossible}} to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the crash from the footage. No race marshalls were close to the scene to notice the black smoke and no-one at the race finish knew about the crash. Toivonen's team only started to fear something might have happened after he failed to arrive from the stage on schedule. The next rally crew through the stage then mentioned they had seen some black smoke. By the time the emergency vehicles arrived on the crash scene, they could only put down the flames, which had been fanned by breezes. Lancia engineers and technicians could not <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the crash because the remains of the car were so charred.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} tests {{that can be used}} to test the {{function}} of the thyroid, for the presence of diseases, and for the success or failure of treatment. Blood tests in general aim to measure thyroid function or <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of thyroid dysfunction. Thyroid function tests include a battery of blood tests including the measurement of the thyroid hormones T3 and T4, as well as the measurement of TSH. They may reveal hyperthyroidism (high T3 and T4), hypothyroidism (low T3, T4), or subclinical hyperthyroidism (normal T3 and T4 with a low TSH).|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} {{under the}} PRC State Council was announced on 16 November, {{the day after}} the fire, to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the blaze. A preliminary finding by investigators concluded that sparks from welding work being done on the building, undertaken by unlicensed welders, ignited scaffolding around the structure, which led to the apartments' destruction. The municipal government also placed the blame on illegal multi-layered subcontracting, and detained four managers from several construction companies. In all, sixteen individuals have been arrested in connection to the fire, as well as four others accused of being unlicensed welders.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the fire, and {{both houses of}} the United States Congress {{conducted}} their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The ignition source of the fire {{was determined to be}} electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E

5|$|Nine days later, {{he checked}} into Methodist Hospital in Houston {{for a series}} of {{physical}} and psychological tests to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of his mysterious arm problems. An angiogram revealed an obstruction in the distal subclavian and axillary arteries of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.|$|E
5|$|The Toronto Magnetic and Meteorological Observatory is a {{historical}} observatory located {{on the grounds of}} the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of fluctuations in magnetic declination. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that sunspots were responsible for this effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official timekeeper for over fifty years. The observatory is considered the birthplace of Canadian astronomy.|$|E
5|$|Toivonen, {{driving a}} Lancia Delta S4, {{died in a}} crash on 2 May 1986 while leading the Tour de Corse rally in Corsica. His American co-driver, Sergio Cresto, also died when the Lancia plunged down a ravine and exploded. The fatal crash had no close {{witnesses}} and the only remains of the car were the blackened spaceframe, {{making it impossible to}} <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the crash. Within hours of the crash, Jean-Marie Balestre, then President of the FISA, had banned the powerful Group B rally cars from competing the following season, ending rallying's popular supercar era.|$|E

5|$|When {{a person}} dies, a doctor will certify {{the cause of}} death if it is known and due to natural causes. He or she will then fill up a {{certificate}} of cause of death (CCOD) which will be given to the family of the deceased. If the doctor is unable to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of death, or the death is due to non-natural causes, the Criminal Procedure Code requires him to refer the case to the police. The police will provide a hearse to send the body to the Centre for Forensic Medicine (CFM) Mortuary at Block 9 of the Singapore General Hospital, which will then inform the family when to visit the mortuary.|$|E
5|$|When an {{outbreak}} of noma (a gangrenous bacterial disease of the mouth and face) struck the Romani camp in 1943, Mengele initiated a study to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> {{of the disease and}} develop a treatment. He enlisted the aid of prisoner Dr. Berthold Epstein, a Jewish pediatrician and professor at Prague University. Mengele isolated the patients in a separate barrack and had several afflicted children killed so that their preserved heads and organs could be sent to the SS Medical Academy in Graz and other facilities for study. The research was still ongoing when the Romani camp was liquidated and its remaining occupants killed in 1944.|$|E
5|$|In general, in adults, {{investigations}} are not needed in mild cases. There {{is a very}} low risk of pneumonia if all vital signs and auscultation are normal. In persons requiring hospitalization, pulse oximetry, chest radiography and blood tests—including a complete blood count, serum electrolytes, C-reactive protein level, and possibly liver function tests—are recommended. Procalcitonin may help <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> and support who should receive antibiotics. Countries with the greatest burden of disease include India (43million), China (21million) and Pakistan (10million). It {{is the leading cause}} of death among children in low income countries. Many of these deaths occur in the newborn period. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths is due to pneumonia. Approximately half of these deaths can be prevented, as they are caused by the bacteria for which an effective vaccine is available. In 2011, pneumonia was the most common reason for admission to the hospital after an emergency department visit in the U.S. for infants and children.|$|E
50|$|When {{acidosis}} {{is present}} on blood tests, {{the first step}} in <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> is <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> anion gap. If the anion gap is high (>12 mEq/L), there are several potential causes.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of echocardiography in <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of aortic regurgitation M mode and cross sectional echocardiography were compared with angiography in 43 patients with predominant aortic regurgitation. Each patient had all three investigations performed during the same admission to hospital. In each instance, <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of aortic regurgitation was confirmed at surgery or necropsy. Seventeen patients had rheumatic aortic valve disease, 13 bacterial endocarditis with a perforated or partially destroyed cusp, five a bicuspid aortic valve (four {{with a history of}} endocarditis), and eight aortic regurgitation secondary to aortic root dilatation or aneurysm. Overall sensitivity of echocardiography and aortography was 84 % in <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of aortic regurgitation. Thus, rheumatic valve disease and endocarditis appear to be <b>the</b> most common <b>causes</b> of severe aortic regurgitation in this hospital based population. Furthermore, echocardiography is a sensitive non-invasive technique for <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of aortic regurgitation and allows differentiation of valvular from root causes of aortic regurgitation...|$|R

5|$|The Japanese Army and Navy {{had their}} own {{independent}} atomic-bomb programs and therefore the Japanese understood enough to know how very difficult building it would be. Therefore, many Japanese {{and in particular the}} military members of the government refused to believe the United States had built an atomic bomb, and the Japanese military ordered their own independent tests to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of Hiroshima's destruction. Admiral Soemu Toyoda, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, argued that even if the United States had made one, they could not have many more. American strategists, having anticipated a reaction like Toyoda's, planned to drop a second bomb shortly after the first, to convince the Japanese that the U.S. had a large supply.|$|E
5|$|Page and MacLachlan flew to No. 96 Squadron RAF {{which was}} then flying de Havilland Mosquito night fighters. He {{requested}} his old gunner, Les Davies, who now piloted Mosquitos to join them. Davies accepted but MacLachlan was killed before he could take up the offer. MacLachlan and Page flew to Tangmere on 15 July. On his next mission on 18 July 1943 MacLachlan's Mustang FD442 was probably hit by ground fire when crossing the French coast near Dieppe. Page noticed MacLachlan's Mustang suddenly pull up sharply from their tree-top height by about 1,000 feet. He saw MacLachlan pull back the canopy but apparently {{changed his mind about}} bailing out as the aircraft leveled out and descended. The Mustang then headed towards a small field. MacLachaln touched down three-quarters the way across and the Mustang ploughed into an orchard at the field's edge which ripped off the wings. Page orbited the crash site several times and considered landing to rescue him but the space was too confined. Page dived at the wreck and took gun-camera footage but could see no signs of life and then headed home. The Operations Record was unable to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the crash. MacLachlan made no radio broadcast. It was possibly the result of enemy small-arms fire or mechanical failure. On 30 July MacLachlan was awarded a second Bar to his DFC.|$|E
5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated first and then ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to <b>determine</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of the magazine explosion.|$|E
