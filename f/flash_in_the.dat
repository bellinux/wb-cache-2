After {{recovering}} from a shoulder injury suffered earlier in the year, Lloyd made her debut for the Flash on May 12, 2013 during the team's 2–1 defeat of FC Kansas City. She scored her first goal in a match against her former club, Sky Blue FC, helping the Flash win 3–0. During a match against the Washington Spirit on June 28, Lloyd scored a hat trick leading the Flash to a 4–0 win. She was subsequently named NWSL Player of the Week for her performance.|$|E
5|$|In December 2010, the Western New York Flash, {{previously}} {{part of the}} W-League, {{joined the}} WPS for the 2011 season. Shortly after, the Flash announced they had signed Harris. She appeared in the team's debut in the league on April 17, 2011 against the Boston Breakers. She made eighteen appearances for the <b>Flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regular season, allowing eighteen goals and helping the Flash rank number one {{at the end of}} the season. Harris made the start in the 2011 WPS Championship on August 27, 2011 against the Philadelphia Independence. The game was tied 1–1 after regulation and extra time, leaving the outcome of the match to be decided by penalty kicks. Both the Independence and the Flash made their first four shots. However, Harris blocked the shot by Philadelphia's Laura del Rio, clinching the championship for the Flash. She was named the 2011 Coast Guard Goalkeeper of the Year following a successful 2011 season.|$|E

25|$|Previous {{accounts}} {{of a bright}} <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky were dismissed as occurring {{too late in the}} evening to have caused the crash. The UN report speculated that these flashes may have been caused by secondary explosions after the crash.

The official inquiry found that the statements of witnesses who talked with Julien before he died in hospital five days after the crash were inconsistent.|$|E
25|$|The {{attack was}} {{witnessed}} by numerous people. One of two Belgian {{officers in the}} garden of a house in Kanombe, the district in which the airport is located, saw and heard the first missile climb into the sky, saw a red <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sky and heard an aircraft engine stopping, followed by another missile. He immediately called Major de Saint-Quentin, part of the French team attached to the Rwandan para-commando battalion Commandos de recherche et d'action en profondeur, who advised him to organize protection for his Belgian comrades. Similarly, another Belgian officer stationed in an unused airport control tower saw the lights of an approaching aircraft, a light traveling upward from the ground and the aircraft lights going out. This was followed by a second light rising from the same place as the first and the plane turning into a falling ball of fire. This officer immediately radioed his company commander, who confirmed with the operational control tower that the plane was the presidential aircraft.|$|E
25|$|In the helium cores {{of stars}} in the 0.8 to 2.0 solar mass range, which are largely {{supported}} by electron degeneracy pressure, helium fusion will ignite on a timescale of days in a helium <b>flash.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> nondegenerate cores of more massive stars, the ignition of helium fusion occurs relatively slowly with no flash. The nuclear power released during the helium flash is very large, {{on the order of}} 108 times the luminosity of the Sun for a few days and 1011 times the luminosity of the Sun (roughly the luminosity of the Milky Way Galaxy) for a few seconds. However, the energy is consumed by the thermal expansion of the initially degenerate core and thus cannot be seen from outside the star. Due to the expansion of the core, the hydrogen fusion in the overlying layers slows and total energy generation decreases. The star contracts, although not {{all the way to the}} main sequence, and it migrates to the horizontal branch on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, gradually shrinking in radius and increasing its surface temperature.|$|E

500|$|Eve's {{character}} and storylines initially elicited {{a positive response}} from Passions cast members. Johnson praised the show for its use of its African American characters like Eve. He appreciated the show's representation of [...] "a full African American family" [...] on daytime television with serious storylines, not [...] "just a <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan". According to Johnson, the Russell family was also well-received by African American viewers. He said {{the chance to work}} with Tracey Ross, who he called the it girl for the African American community following her appearance on Star Search, influenced his acceptance of the role. Marshall commented on the absurdity of her character's rivalry with Eve, particularly their fight in the Crane mansion. She went on to praise Ross' acting, and said: [...] "t's a gift as an actor to have a good relationship with your scene partner when you're always the aggressor because you can go where you need to go and not be afraid." ...|$|E
500|$|Kennedy {{said that}} during this period, {{with all the}} changes on the team and with players {{returning}} from the war he had to [...] "re-establish myself as an NHLer." [...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy {{was going to turn}} out to be just a [...] "wartime <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!" [...] was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, a howl that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with the}} Bennetts, the Cranes, and the Lopez-Fitzgeralds, the Russells {{are one of}} the four core {{families}} conceived by the Passions creator James E. Reilly. [...] They have featured prominently on the soap opera since its premiere on July 5, 1999. Sheraton Kalouria, senior vice president of NBC's daytime programming, said the decision to create and cast two minority families—the African-American Russells and the Hispanic Lopez-Fitzgeralds—was a conscious effort to simulate the diversity of the United States, and that the cast reflected the show's [...] "truly color–blind storytelling". Rodney Van Johnson, who played T. C. Russell, expressed an appreciation for the show's representation of [...] "a full African-American family" [...] that was involved in serious stories on daytime television rather than [...] "just a <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan", and also said that the Russell family received a considerable response from African-American viewers. An article in Jet described each member of the Russell family as having an [...] "integral part [...] the show" [...] rather than appearing as token characters.|$|E

500|$|The writer Michael Steinberg {{described}} the symphony's success as essentially {{a phenomenon of}} the compact disc, and while live performances are still given, they do not always sell out. Some critics, wondering at the sudden success of the piece nearly two decades after its composition, suggest that it resonated with a particular mood in the popular culture at the time. Stephen Johnson, writing in A guide to the symphony, wondered whether the commercial success of the work was [...] "a <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan" [...] or {{would turn out to}} have lasting significance. In 1998, the critic Michael Steinberg asked, [...] " [...] really listening to this symphony? How many CD buyers discover that fifty-four minutes of very slow music with a little singing in a language they don't understand is more than they want? Is it being played as background music to Chardonnay and brie?" [...] Steinberg compared the success of Górecki's symphony to the Doctor Zhivago phenomenon of 1958: [...] "Everybody rushed to buy the book; few managed actually to read it. The appearance of the movie in 1965 rescued us all from the necessity." [...] Górecki was as surprised as anyone else at the recording's success, and later speculated that [...] "perhaps people find something they need in this piece of music…. Somehow I hit the right note, something they were missing. Something, somewhere had been lost to them. I feel that I instinctively knew what they needed." ...|$|E

[...] According to the special correspondent writing in The Manchester Guardian, [...] "a sea awaited them". [...] Both crews took on water in the difficult conditions but the Dark Blues prevailed. [...] Oxford won by two lengths in a time of 20 minutes 30 seconds, their second consecutive win. [...] It was the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race and the fastest since the 1935 race. [...] The victory took the overall record in the event to 47–42 in Cambridge's favour. [...] The correspondent for The Manchester Guardian described it as [...] "excellent", and [...] "a great race in the best traditions" [...] The Observer correspondent suggested that [...] "the race will rank as one of the closest and most exciting in which the two Universities have ever engaged." [...] The former Oxford rower, G. I. F. Thomson, writing in The Observer, claimed [...] "one can scarcely have hoped for a more interesting or thrilling race". [...] Oxford's number seven and boat club president Cherry said [...] "I hope this will show that last year's victory was not a <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan". [...] His counterpart, T. B.

500|$|In {{his first}} full season in 1938, he batted [...]343 – behind only batting {{champion}} Jimmie Foxx's [...]349 – while leading the league with 18 triples. Upon {{the conclusion of the}} season, Heath joined fellow American League (AL) players, and Indians teammate Bob Feller, in exhibition games played around the country (also known as barnstorming), mostly in cities which did not have a major league team. He had 21 home runs and 112 RBIs, collected 58 hits in August alone, and was among the league leaders in slugging average and total bases for the 1938 season. In January 1939, he married Theabelle Callard. He finished with a [...]292 batting average in 1939. The season also included a late-season punch to a fan from Heath during a home game in Cleveland. [...] "It was just another blunder in a bad season that has been full of mistakes", Heath said of the incident. Before the 1940 season, Heath said, [...] "I'm going to show 'em I'm no <b>flash</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> pan. Last year I was overswinging and taking my eye of the ball. I'm {{not going to do that}} this season." [...] During the season, Heath was one of 12 reported players who presented a list of grievances against Vitt to Indians President Alva Bradley. Bradley called a meeting with the players and by the end of it, a statement of support from the players for Vitt was released. Twenty-one Indians signed the document, while Heath was one of four who did not, as he was one of two in the hospital at the time of the meeting. Instances between Vitt and his players, including Heath, continued past June, however. Heath was suspended by Vitt after a game in August after the two exchanged words following a strikeout by Heath, who was put in the game as a pinch-hitter. Indians Vice President C.C. Slapnicka withdrew the suspension. The Indians finished the regular season with an 89–65 record in Vitt's last season as manager and Heath a career-low [...]219 average. The Indians lost the AL pennant by one game to the Detroit Tigers and Heath received much of the blame, although Vitt was released as the team's manager and replaced by Roger Peckinpaugh.|$|E
