5|$|On April 13, 2013, during at the 2013's Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pusha T {{announced}} that he would be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> later this week, just to put on some final touches on the album, afterwards he would announce a release date. In June 2013, Pusha T had been set to turn in the album to Def Jam for mastering, however, Kanye West presented Pusha with some additional beats. This resulted in Pusha going back to the studio to continue the recording. In early stages in the recording process, he began working on the album with Kanye West, Symbolyc One, The Neptunes, Bangladesh, and Ryan Leslie. Since then, he has confirmed that he was working with The-Dream, Just Blaze, No I.D., Nottz, Don Cannon, Nashiem Myrick, Carlos Brody (of The Hitmen), DJ Mano, Swizz Beatz, Rico Beats, Travi$ Scott, Hudson Mohawke, Young Chop, and Sham, amongst others on the album's production. On August 4, 2013 he {{announced that}} the song he wants to be the album's intro is produced by Joaquin Phoenix. On August 22, 2013, Pusha T appeared on MTV's RapFix and told Sway Calloway that the bulk of the album's production would be handled by Kanye West, while confirming production by Pharrell, Swizz Beatz, The-Dream, Nottz, and Don Cannon to be featured on the album.|$|E
5|$|Stansfield {{had long}} felt {{uncomfortable with the}} idea of medical {{officers}} marrying. Louise Hind, in Gender and Class in English Asylums, 1890–1914, hints that this might have been the result of misogynist tendencies, although Hubert Bond, his obituary-writer and former colleague, preemptively defended him against these claims. Stansfield nevertheless married twice; firstly, in 1908 to Mary Caroline (died 1926), a daughter of the Hon. James Dever, a Canadian senator from St John's, Newfoundland. After her death, he married (in 1929) Marie, second daughter of Alexander Effremoff, of Moscow; he had met her in Paris, where she had been living in exile after the Russian Revolution. There were no children from either marriage, but he worked with the scouting movement, and served as President of the North Central Kent Boys' Scouts Association. He was a fond rose-grower and it was the gardens at Southmead in Wimbledon which attracted him and his first wife to the house; they lived there for many years. He retired to Castello Devachan in Sanremo, Italy, with his second wife, before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> to seek treatment for an illness; he died there on 19 February 1939. His widow remained at the Castello in Sanremo until her death in 1973, spending her last 21 years as starosta of the Russian Orthodox parish community there.|$|E

25|$|Later that year, Sade was tricked into <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris</b> {{to visit}} his {{supposedly}} ill mother, who in fact had recently died.

He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner Comte de Mirabeau, who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came to dislike each other intensely.|$|E
25|$|After {{the mansion}} was completed, Spreckels began {{throwing}} opulent parties befitting {{a woman of}} her status. Although attended by local celebrities such as author Jack London and sculptor Earl Cummings, {{there were a number}} of people who were disdainful of her earlier infamy and snubbed her invitations. This motivated her to gain some respectability for herself, which she did by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris.</b> There, she met entertainer Loie Fuller and through Fuller, other artists, most notably Auguste Rodin. With Fuller's encouragement and contacts, Alma Spreckels eventually became one of the more influential art collectors in the U.S.|$|E

2500|$|He was at {{the papal}} court in Avignon in 1344/5 with his uncle Richard de Pilmuir, {{attempting}} to gain favours. He received provision to the church of [...] "Blair", that is, Blairgowrie, on 25 January 1345, with Pope Clement VI commanding the Abbot of Coupar Angus, the Abbot of Scone and the Prior of St Andrews {{to put him in}} possession, although {{it is not clear that}} he managed to possess full control of this church until 1349 or later. He received a canonry in the diocese of Aberdeen on 18 May 1347, and in the diocese of Moray on 10 May 1349, neither of which he seems to have taken up permanently. He had been at Avignon again in 1349, regarding the Moray canonry, either before or after <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>Paris,</b> when he presented petitions for his brother John and his cousin Thomas de Pilmuir. He was recorded at Avignon again in 1350, when he is described as the secretary of Queen Joan; there he was provided to a canonry in the diocese of Glasgow, though once more it is unclear if this provision ever actualised.|$|E
