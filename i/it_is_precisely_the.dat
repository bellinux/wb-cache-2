25|$|The entire {{capitalist}} system thus {{appears as a}} hierarchical structure of different levels of productivity, and as {{the outcome of the}} uneven and combined development of states, regions, branches of industry and firms, unleashed by the quest for surplus-profit. It forms an integrated unity, but it is an integrated unity of non-homogeneous parts, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> unity that here determines the lack of homogeneity. In this whole system development and underdevelopment reciprocally determine each other, for while the quest for surplus-profits constitutes the prime motive power behind the mechanisms of growth, surplus-profit can only be achieved at the expense of less productive regions and branches of production.|$|E
500|$|For three years, from 1787 to 1790, Dissenters {{had been}} {{attempting}} to convince Parliament {{to repeal the}} Test and Corporation Acts which limited {{the civil rights of}} Dissenters. After the repeal was voted down for the third time, Barbauld burst onto the public stage after [...] "nine years of silence." [...] Her highly charged pamphlet is written in a biting and sarcastic tone; it opens, [...] "we thank you for the compliment paid the Dissenters, when you suppose that the moment they are eligible to places of power and profit, all such places will at once be filled with them." [...] She argues that Dissenters deserve the same rights as any other men: [...] "We claim it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim it as good subjects." [...] Moreover, she contends that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> isolation forced on Dissenters by others that marks them out, not anything inherent in their form of worship. Finally, appealing to British patriotism, she maintains that the French cannot be allowed to outstrip the English in liberty.|$|E
2500|$|The {{brothers}} were directly influenced by Brentano and von Arnim, who edited and adapted the folk songs of [...] (The Boy's Magic Horn or cornucopia). They began the collection {{with the purpose}} of creating a scholarly treatise of traditional stories and of preserving the stories as they had been handed from generation to generation—a practice that was threatened by increased industrialization. Maria Tatar, professor of German studies at Harvard University, explains that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> handing from generation to generation and the genesis in the oral tradition that gives folk tales an important mutability. Versions of tales differ from region to region, [...] "picking up bits and pieces of local culture and lore, drawing a turn of phrase from a song or another story and fleshing out characters with features taken from the audience witnessing their performance." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the bull}} of excommunication issued against Patriarch Michael by the papal legates, {{one of the}} reasons cited was the Eastern Church's {{deletion}} of the [...] "Filioque" [...] from the original Nicene Creed.

2500|$|At {{the passage}} through the two slits of the second screen S2, the wave aspects of the process become essential. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> {{interference}} between the two terms of the quantum superposition corresponding to states in which the particle is localized {{in one of the}} two slits which implies that the particle is [...] "guided" [...] preferably into the zones of constructive interference and cannot end up in a point in the zones of destructive interference (in which the wave function is nullified). It is also important to note that any experiment designed to evidence the [...] "corpuscular" [...] aspects of the process at the passage of the screen S2 (which, in this case, reduces to the determination of which slit the particle has passed through) inevitably destroys the wave aspects, implies the disappearance of the interference figure and the emergence of two concentrated spots of diffraction which confirm our knowledge of the trajectory followed by the particle.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to having taken part in counter-terrorist operations during his service in the military, Netanyahu has published three {{books on the subject}} of fighting terrorism. He identifies terrorism as a form of totalitarianism, writing: [...] "The more far removed the target of the attack from any connection to the grievance enunciated by the terrorists, the greater the terror ... Yet for terrorism to have any impact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> lack of connection, the lack of any possible involvement or [...] "complicity" [...] of the chosen victims in the cause the terrorists seek to attack, that produces the desired fear. For terrorism's underlying message is that every member of society is [...] "guilty", that anyone can be a victim, and that therefore no one is safe ... In fact, the methods reveal the totalitarian strain that runs through all terrorist groups ... It is not only that the ends of the terrorists do not succeed in justifying the means they choose; their choice of means indicate what their true ends are. Far from being fighters for freedom, terrorists are the forerunners of tyranny. Terrorists use the techniques of violent coercion in order to achieve a regime of violent coercion." ...|$|E
2500|$|One element {{which is}} crucial {{to the success of the}} GRR model is the notion related to 'instructional scaffolding', which is {{grounded}} in Vygotsky's concept of the [...] "zone of proximal development" [...] (ZPD). [...] This is described as the distance between the actual developmental level of a learner as determined by their independent problem solving abilities and the level of potential development through problem-solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. That is, the distance between what the children can do without assistance and what they can accomplish with the assistance of more capable peers. The zone of proximal development can be applied as an umbrella over the entire GRR model. Students are given support in the form of scaffolding and differentiate instruction throughout all four phases of the process. Teachers may offer more challenging material to high-achieving students, and assist lower-achieving students in needs-based groups. Teachers will support students as needed throughout all four steps finally allowing for the eventual independence of each student. The GRR model [...] "...assumes that [...] will need some guidance in reaching that stage of independence and that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> teacher's role to provide such guidance".|$|E

2500|$|The Spanish Civil war {{produced}} {{a spate of}} bad literature. Homage to Catalonia {{is one of the}} few exceptions and the reason is simple. Orwell was determined to set down the truth as he saw it. This was something that many writers of the Left in 1936–39 could not bring themselves to do. Orwell comes back time and time again in his writings on Spain to those political conditions in the late thirties which fostered intellectual dishonesty: the subservience of the intellectuals of the European Left to the Communist 'line', especially in the case of the Popular Front in Spain where, in his view, the party line could not conceivably be supported by an honest man. Only a few strong souls, Victor Serge and Orwell among them, could summon up the courage to fight the whole tone of the literary establishment and the influence of Communists within it. Arthur Koestler quoted to an audience of Communist sympathizers Thomas Mann's phrase, 'In the long run a harmful truth is better than a useful lie'. The non-Communists applauded; the Communists and their sympathizers remained icily silent ... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>precisely</b> <b>the</b> immediacy of Orwell's reaction that gives the early sections of Homage its value for the historian. Kaminski, Borkenau, Koestler came with a fixed framework, the ready-made contacts of journalist intellectuals. Orwell came with his eyes alone.|$|E
