40|$|<b>Joint</b> <b>sealant</b> {{materials}} {{for use in}} concrete pavements have been developed over the last 30 years from bitumen and coal products to corks and, more recently, high performance polymeric materials. There are many products available with a vast price range, and many foreign specifications and standards exist for their assessment. The lack of an Australian specific standard, or the endorsement of a single foreign standard, makes the selection of these materials very difficult, as the common products have not been assessed using a uniform or comparable testing regime.

The NTPEP program provided a protocol for evaluation of the joints and a scoring criterion primarily for the condition of the sealers. The NTPEP monitoring was done for 7 years but at this stage the condition of the joints was reported as merely the performance of the joint sealers, evident in adhesion failure, cohesion failure or lack of these.

40|$|INDOT (as well {{as several}} {{surrounding}} states) have observed that certain concrete pavements may show a susceptibility to joint deterioration. Unfortunately, {{by the time that}} this joint deterioration is observed it is often too late and costly partial depth repairs are needed. The deterioration is generally occurring in the joint behind the backer rod and joint sealant; as such, it is difficult to detect even if one is standing directly above the joint. This project investigated the use of electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar as two techniques to detect premature joint deterioration. The thought process was that if the joint deterioration is determined at an early stage, low cost corrective actions can be taken to extend the life of the concrete. The electrical response was measured for mortars subjected to a temperature cycle from 23 °C to - 35 °C, with varying degrees of saturation, and varying salt concentrations. The resistivity increased as the degree of saturation was reduced due to the reduction in the volume of the conductive medium and increase in tortuosity. Changes in resistivity were detected when cracking occurred in the sample. The magnitude of these changes was similar to that detected using changes in the ultrasonic wave speed. Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used effectively to detect fluid accumulation in the saw-cut joint behind the <b>joint</b> <b>sealant.</b> The typical GPR waveforms are however difficult and time consuming to interpret. A signal processing approach called, referred to as the CID, was used to obtain a single number that reflects the potential for fluid in the joint.

40|$|Experiments {{with early}} entry light sawing of Portland cement {{concrete}} (PCC) contraction joints began in Iowa in 1989. Since that time, changes in early sawing equipment have occurred {{as well as}} changes in specifications for sawing. The option to use early sawing for transverse contraction joints was specified in 1992. A problem happening occasionally with early sawing was the break out {{of some of the}} concrete around the end of the joint as the saw blade approached the edge of the slab. To prevent this, it was proposed that the sawing would terminate approximately 1 / 2 " to 3 / 4 " before the edge of the slab, creating a "short joint". This procedure would also leave a concrete "dam" to prevent the run-out and waste of the hot liquid <b>joint</b> <b>sealant</b> onto the shoulder. It would also eliminate the need for the labor and material for applying a duct tape dam at the open ends of each sawed joint to stop hot liquid sealant run-out Agreements were made with the contractor to apply the "short joint" technique for 1 day of paving. The evaluation and results are compared with an adjoining control section. The research found no negative aspects from sawing the "short joint". Three specific findings were noted. They are the following: 1) No joint end "blow-out" spalls of concrete occurred. 2) The need for the duct tape dam to stop liquid sealant overflow was eliminated. 3) Joint end corner spalls appear to be caused mainly by construction shouldering operations equipment. The "short joint" sawing technique can be routinely applied to early entry sawed transverse contraction joints with expectations of only positive results...|$|E
40|$|Some of the Indiana {{concrete}} pavements {{that have been}} constructed within the last 10 years have shown signs of premature deterioration, especially in the areas adjacent to the longitudinal joints. This deterioration typically manifests itself as cracking and spalling of concrete combined {{with the loss of}} <b>joint</b> <b>sealant.</b> These processes create a cavity in the joint area that traps water and, as a consequence, accelerates further deterioration of concrete during the freezing and thawing cycles. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine in details the microstructural and chemical changes in concrete extracted form the affected areas in an attempt to determine the cause of this premature deterioration. ^ The investigation started with a detailed inventory of selected areas of affected pavements in order to identify and classify the existing types of distresses and select locations for collection of the cores. The cores have been collected from the following four locations: NB lines of I- 65 near downtown Indianapolis, SR 933 near South Bend, Intersection of 86 th Street and Payne Rd. in Indianapolis and a ramp from US 67 to I- 465 E, also in Indianapolis. A total of thirty six 6 -in. diameter cores were removed from pavements at these locations and transported to the laboratory where they were subjected to eighth different tests: air-void system determination, Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, sorptivity test, freeze-thaw 2 ̆ 6 resonance frequency test, resistance to chloride ion penetration (RCP) test and chloride profile (concentration) determination. ^ The test results identified several cases of in-filling of the air voids (especially smaller air bubbles) with secondary deposits. These deposits were most likely the result of the repetitive saturation of air voids with water and substantially reduced the effectiveness of the air voids system with respect to providing an adequate level of freeze-thaw protection. In addition, the affected concrete often developed an extensive network of microcracks, showed higher rates of absorption and reduced ability to resist chloride ions penetration. ...|$|E

2500|$|Also called {{joint and}} crack repair, this method's {{purpose is to}} {{minimize}} infiltration of surface water and incompressible material into the <b>joint</b> system. <b>Joint</b> <b>sealants</b> are also used to reduce dowel bar corrosion in Concrete Pavement Restoration (CPR) [...] techniques. Successful resealing consists of old sealant removal, shaping and cleaning the reservoir, installing the backer rod and installing the sealant. Sawing, manual removal, plowing and cutting are methods used to remove the old sealant. Saws are used to shape the reservoir. When cleaning the reservoir, no dust, dirt or traces of old sealant should remain. Thus, it is recommended to water wash, sand-blast and then air blow to remove any sand, dirt or dust. The backer rod installation requires a double-wheeled, steel roller to insert the rod to the desired depth. After inserting the backer rod, the sealant is placed into the joint. There are various materials to choose for this method including hot pour bituminous liquid, silicone and preformed compression seals.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to evaluate factors influencing the durability of the joints in portland cement concrete pavement {{in the state of}} Indiana. Specifically this work evaluated the absorption of water, the absorption of deicing solutions, the relationship between the degree of saturation and concrete deterioration, and the role of Soy Mehyl Esters as a potential concrete sealant. The aforementioned items were studied in conjunction with the observation of premature joint deterioration in concrete pavements. Previous work by the PI identified that deteriorating joints were observed to frequently have standing water and damaged <b>joint</b> <b>sealant.</b> To better understand the potential mechanisms responsible for joint deterioration, a series of mortars were tested that are consistent with the mortar fraction of concrete paving mixtures. The first portion of the work examined the role of deicing salt solutions on the wetting and drying behavior of concrete elements (this was a joint series of experiments with SPR 3093). It was observed that salts altered the equilibrium relative humidity of the solution, as such concrete containing deicing solutions dried less frequently than concrete containing only pore solution. Further, it was observed that the rate of water absorption was related to the square root of ratio of surface tension and viscosity. Salt solutions have a slower rate of absorption than plain water. It was also observed that concrete previously exposed to deicing salts also exhibited an altered rate of water absorption. The second portion of the work examined the concept of the degree of saturation and its relationship with freeze-thaw damage. Specifically mortars with different air contents were examined. Fagerlund developed a model that proposed a critical degree of saturation could be correlated with the onset of freeze-thaw damage. The work suggests that absorption testing should be used to determine the degree of saturation which can be used to estimate the time to reach a critical degree of saturation. Once this critical degree of saturation was reached freeze-thaw damage was inevitable. While entrained air was observed to slow the time to reach a critical degree of saturation, this critical degree of saturation could not be avoided. The final portion of the work examined the potential use of penetrating concrete sealers (like soy methyl esters) to reduce water absorption and the corresponding freeze-thaw damage. While absorption testing was able to show the benefits of sealers, differences were observed regarding the influence of sealer composition on freeze-thaw damage...|$|E

It is well accepted that the presence of moisture in a pavement structure is a contributor to a variety of governing distress types that eventually deteriorates the pavement structure and decreases the pavement service life. Effectiveness of <b>joint</b> <b>sealants</b> to protect jointed concrete pavement against water related distresses has been a focus of great interest recently. An experimental program was carried out on the Riverside Campus of Texas A&M University to study the effectiveness of different sealant types to limit drainage related infiltration of the joint under different joint openings and bonding conditions. Results confirmed that if joint seals are properly installed, they can be very effective in preventing moisture infiltration. Unsealed joints had significantly higher flow rates compared to <b>joints</b> with damaged <b>sealants.</b> The test results in this study have also demonstrated the effect of sealant proper installation on performance. Using experimental data the actual number of wet days was defined and analyzed. A faulting prediction model was developed. The erosion resistance of materials, number of wet days and traffic load were precisely defined and considered in this model. The mechanistic empirical model presented in this dissertation can effectively analyze the faulting and erosion in jointed concrete pavements. The model is capable to be calibrated for local conditions as a distinct advantage over other faulting models. The model was successfully implemented and calibrated into a computerized format. Results show that the model fits well with the field data and can be implemented for design and maintenance management purposes. By using the model the effectiveness of sealant in pavement sustainability can be determined. The most valuable outcome of this study is the demonstration mechanistically of the role of joint sealing on service life of jointed concrete pavements.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{threat of}} {{terrorist}} attack impacts our lives every day. Because this threat is very real, {{we have seen}} the use of bomb blast mitigating window designs grow significantly in recent years. Effective bomb blast mitigating window designs allow the window system to withstand a moderate bomb blast without causing significant injury to building occupants from the blast itself or flying glass shards. The occupants are protected because laminated glass, which can withstand the blast, is attached in the framing with a silicone sealant. The silicone sealant is {{an important component of the}} window design along with the glass composition, glass dimensions, the framing, anchoring of the framing, etc. Silicone sealants provide unique benefits to these window designs due to their strength properties and their ability to anchor the laminated glass in the framing during a blast situation. In addition, they provide long-term elasticity, adhesion and durability. The proper use and selection of silicone sealant is critical to the performance of these systems.

40|$|The {{production}} of recycled concrete aggregate requires a simple, well defined process. Concrete pavement recycling {{is a relatively}} simple process that involves breaking, removing and crushing hardened concrete from an acceptable source to produce recycled concrete aggregate (RCA). The formal process of RCA production typically involves an initial evaluation of the existing source concrete; pavement preparation, which may include removal of an asphalt overlay; pavement breaking, removal and transport to a processing facility; removal of any embedded steel such as dowel bars, tiebars, reinforcing bar, or wire mesh; crushing and sizing operations {{similar to those used}} for virgin aggregate production; beneficiation {{to improve the quality of}} the RCA, if necessary; and stockpiling of the freshly produced RCA. If desired, the RCA also can be produced in-place in the field. More about these topics is available in ACPA’s EB 043 P, “Recycling Concrete Pavements. ” The major steps in the {{production of}} recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) from concrete pavement are: evaluation of the source concrete; preparation of the slab; breaking and removing the concrete; removal of any embedded steel; crushing the concrete and sizing the RCA; beneficiation, if necessary; and stockpiling the RCA. Evaluation of Source Concrete The first step in producing RCA from a concrete pavement is to determine the quality and overall properties of the source concrete. Records of the original concrete components, strength and durability can be useful in determining the potential applications for the RCA produced. Pavement Preparation If the RCA being produced is to be considered for use in a new concrete mixture, efforts must be made to minimize the potential for introducing contaminants throughout the production process.

Analytical and numerical calculations are performed on various glass beams, in order to highlight the effects of continuous lateral restraints on their critical buckling moment. Shear tests are performed on small silicone <b>sealant</b> <b>joints.</b> Interesting correlations are found between joint properties and beams geometry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a rigorous and a reliable analytical procedure using finite element (FE) techniques {{to study the}} blast response of laminated glass (LG) panel and predict the failure of its components. The 1 st principal stress (σ 11) is used as the failure criterion for glass and the von mises stress (σv) {{is used for the}} interlayer and <b>sealant</b> <b>joints.</b> The results from the FE analysis for mid-span deflection, energy absorption and the stresses at critical locations of glass, interlayer and structural sealant are presented in the paper. These results compared well with those obtained from a free field blast test reported in the literature. The tensile strength (T) of the glass has a significant influence on the behaviour of the LG panel and should be treated carefully in the analysis. The glass panes absorb about 80 % of the blast energy for the treated blast load and this should be minimised in the design...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews current design {{standards}} and test methods for blast-resistant glazing design and compares a typical design outcome with that from comprehensive finite-element (FE) analysis. Design standards are conservative and {{are limited to}} the design of relatively small glazed panels. Standard test methods are expensive, create environmental pollution, and can classify the hazard ratings of only smaller glazed panels. Here the design of a laminated glass (LG) panel is carried out according to an existing design standard, and then its performance is examined using comprehensive FE modeling and analysis. Finite-element results indicate that both glass panes crack, the interlayer yields with little damage, and the <b>sealant</b> <b>joints</b> do not fail for the designed blast load. This failure pattern satisfies some of the requirements for minimal hazard rating in the design standard. It is evident that interlayer thickness and material properties are important during the post-crack stage of an LG panel, but they are not accounted for in the {{design standards}}. The new information generated in this paper will contribute toward an enhanced blast design of LG panels...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive numerical procedure {{to treat the}} blast response of laminated glass (LG) panels and studies the influence of important material parameters. Post-crack behaviour of the LG panel and {{the contribution of the}} interlayer towards blast resistance are treated. Modelling techniques are validated by comparing with existing experimental results. Findings indicate that the tensile strength of glass considerably influences the blast response of LG panels while the interlayer material properties {{have a major impact on}} the response under higher blast loads. Initially, glass panes absorb most of the blast energy, but after the glass breaks, interlayer deforms further and absorbs most of the blast energy. LG panels should be designed to fail by tearing of the interlayer rather than failure at the supports to achieve a desired level of protection. From this aspect, material properties of glass, interlayer and <b>sealant</b> <b>joints</b> play important roles, but unfortunately they are not accounted for in the current design standards. The new information generated in this paper will enhance the capabilities of engineers to better design LG panels under blast loads and use better materials to improve the blast response of LG panels...|$|R
40|$|Premature {{failure of}} {{concrete}} pavement contraction joint seals {{is an ongoing}} and costly problem for the Iowa Department of Transportation. Several joint seal test sections consisting of variations in sawing methods, <b>joint</b> cleaning techniques, <b>sealant</b> installation, and sealant types have been established {{over the past few}} years. Laboratory analysis and field inspections were done {{as a part of the}} tests, and core samples were taken for laboratory adhesion pull tests. Such methods often cover specifically small areas and may not expose hidden failures. Some tests are also labor-intensive and destructive, especially that of coring. An innovative, nondestructive, broad coverage joint seal tester that yields quick results has been designed and developed for evaluation of pavement joint seal performance. The Iowa vacuum joint seal tester (IA-VAC) applies a low vacuum above a joint seal that has been spray-covered with a foaming water solution. Any unsealed area or leak that exists along the joint will become quickly and clearly visible by the development of bubbles at the leak point. By analyzing the results from the IA-VAC tests, information on the number and types of leaks can be obtained; such information will help identify the source of the problem and direct efforts toward a solution...|$|R
