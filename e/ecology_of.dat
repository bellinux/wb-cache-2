5|$|The <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> global carbon budgets {{gives one}} example of the linkage between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon budgets during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E
5|$|Elaborate sexual {{displays}} and posturing are {{encountered in the}} behavioural <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> animals. The birds-of-paradise, for example, sing and display elaborate ornaments during courtship. These displays serve a dual purpose of signalling healthy or well-adapted individuals and desirable genes. The displays are driven by sexual selection as an advertisement of quality of traits among suitors.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{have been}} the focus of {{monographic}} series, action plans, field guides, and classic works in ethology. However, few species have been thoroughly studied to date, and most research has been preliminary and restricted to a single locality. Only recently have numerous scientific papers been published to explain the basic aspects of behavior and <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> poorly known species. Field studies have given insights on population dynamics and evolutionary <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> most genera and many species. Long-term research focused on identified individuals is in its infancy and has only been started for a few populations. However, learning opportunities are dwindling as habitat destruction and other factors threaten the existence of lemur populations across the island.|$|E

5|$|South Dakota's early economy {{relied heavily}} on the soil, {{minerals}} and <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> the area, as {{nearly all of the}} earliest white settlers in the area were farmers, miners, or trappers.

5|$|Very {{little is}} known of the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> eastern voalavo, but {{northern}} voalavo {{is thought to be}} largely terrestrial with some scansorial (tree-climbing) abilities.

5|$|A diatom floristic {{study of}} the lagoon {{revealed}} that it contains 41 species and is a rich storehouse of psychrophilic photosynthetic bacteria. The heterotrophic bacterial microbiota and the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> photosynthetic bacteria of the Lake Burton were studied in the 1970s and 1980s. Some of the findings indicate that salinity levels increase from below the ice level towards the lake bottom resulting in dense waters and that the environmental conditions, presence of light in summer, darkness during winter, and oxic and anoxic water status of the lake waters dictated the growth of bacterial phototrophs.|$|E

5|$|At first, {{the forests}} of the {{watershed}} were not significantly affected, but after logging operations sprung up near {{the start of the}} 20th century, most of the virgin timber in the watershed was cleared. The first sawmills were built to provide lumber for local uses, such as building houses and barns. Soon, however, the Washington, Idaho and Montana Railway extended its tracks into the area, allowing lumber to be exported out of the basin. Logging {{turned out to be a}} very profitable industry but had a lasting negative effect on the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> the Potlatch River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Bats play an {{important}} role in forest and cave ecology in Puerto Rico and help control mosquito populations. Most species (10 of 13) are cave-dwellers with low reproductive rates; the area with the highest species richness is the Caribbean National Forest, where eleven species occur. The red fig-eating bat (red fruit bat), endemic to the Puerto Rican Bank, plays {{an important}} role in the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> tabonuco forest in the Luquillo Mountains since it is believed to be the only seed disperser of bulletwood (Manilkara bidentata). Cave ecosystems are enhanced by bat feces (guano) since many of the invertebrate cave fauna are either guano scavengers, detritivores or predators of the former two.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{are often}} {{important}} to island ecology. Birds have frequently reached islands that mammals have not; on those islands, birds may fulfil ecological roles typically played by larger animals. For example, in New Zealand the moas were important browsers, {{as are the}} kereru and kokako today. Today the plants of New Zealand retain the defensive adaptations evolved {{to protect them from}} the extinct moa. Nesting seabirds may also affect the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> islands and surrounding seas, principally through the concentration of large quantities of guano, which may enrich the local soil and the surrounding seas.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> individual organisms, to those of populations, to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
5|$|Human {{beings have}} played a role in the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> Presque Isle since at least the Erielhonan. The natural drift of sand is {{hindered}} or stopped by breakwaters, permanent structures, and roads. Roads also do not absorb rainwater, causing erosion, and break up natural habitats. Excavations such as those to make the waterworks basins or the marina have destroyed habitats, but yearly artificial replenishment with sand helps to create new ones. One area within the park is closed to all public use from April to November to minimize the impact of humans: it is the easternmost part of the park, Gull Point.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have also}} {{adversely}} impacted the <b>ecology</b> <b>of</b> the Everglades by introducing numerous invasive species, which may prey on or compete with native species. A spectacular and particularly damaging {{example of this}} phenomenon is the recent proliferation of the Burmese python in the Everglades, as well as elsewhere in Florida. First observed in the wild in 1979 and not again until 1995, they have increased alarmingly since 2000. By 2011, decreases of 87.5%, 94.1%, 98.9% and 99.3% in sightings of bobcats, white-tailed deer, opossums and raccoons, respectively, were reported in park road surveys, while rabbits were no longer being seen at all.|$|E

40|$|This paper reports upon {{collaborative}} NWO-AHRC {{research conducted}} by UK and Dutch cultural geographers and artists into tidal <b>ecologies</b> <b>of</b> place in the UK and Holland and beyond. Tidal zones are extraordinarily dynamic spaces which generate complex ecologies which interconnect land and sea, air and water as elements, salt water and fresh water as variations of the latter, {{and a range of}} eco-social assemblages. All these interconnecting processes are set in series of rhythms driven by tidal cycles. Tides literally mix space, time and materiality. Tidal processes in different locations vary markedly in term of range, the habitats and ecologies generated, and in the way local culture and economy engage with them (<b>ecologies</b> <b>of</b> place). For a range of reasons which include possible climate change induced sea level rise, and various forms of development and exploitation, tidal areas around the world, and the important interconnected natural and culture they support, are under a great deal of pressure. Accounts <b>of</b> tidal <b>ecologies</b> <b>of</b> place, particularly as generated by artists, in the Severn Estuary UK and the Wadden Sea Netherlands will be discussed...|$|R
