40|$|Abstract. <b>Posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} complication after cataract surgery, which is induced by the proliferation, differentiation and migration of lens epithelial cells. Inhibiting the proliferation of human lens epithelial cells could reduce the occurrence of <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification.</b> To explore the possible potential of ZnO nanoparticles in treating <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification,</b> we investigated the effect of ZnO nanoparticles on the human lens epithelial cell proliferation in the presence and absence of ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation via 3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 5 - (3 -carboxymethoxyphenyl) - 2 - (4 -sulfophenyl) - 2 H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay. The results indicate that ZnO nanoparticles could apparently inhibit the proliferation of human lens epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner, and UVB irradiation can further enhance this inhibitory role for the human lens epithelial cell proliferation, indicating the great potential of ZnO nanoparticles in treating <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> in clinical application...|$|R

METHODS: Eighty patients(86 eyes) received cataract phacoemulsification in our hospital from January, 2013 to December, 2014 were enrolled and randomly divided into observation group and control group. The patients in observation group were received diclofenac sodium hydrodissection with nuclear rotation, and the patients in control group were received equilibrium liquid hydrodissection. Then degree of <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification,</b> visual acuity and corneal endothelial cells count in two groups were compared. RESULTS:(1) <b>Posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> degree: <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> degree of patients in observation group were better than that of control group(Z= 6. 982, P vs 0. 23 ± 0. 04, 0. 68 ± 0. 09 vs 0. 35 ± 0. 05, 0. 77 ± 0. 09 vs 0. 48 ± 0. 06, 0. 91 ± 0. 12 vs 0. 68 ± 0. 08; F = 6. 583, 8. 983, 7. 182, 5. 492, P 0. 05).

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND: <b>Posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> is {{the most}} common {{postoperative}} complication of extracapsular cataract surgery. The {{purpose of this study was}} to attempt to inhibit this secondary cataract formation by using mitomycin (an antimitotic drug). METHODS: A solution containing mitomycin was used to perform hydrodissection (with a 5 minute pause) during extracapsular lens extraction in rabbits. This way of administration was chosen to reduce as much as possible drug diffusion into the anterior chamber. Heparin was added to the irrigating solution to avoid fibrin formation. Its ability to prevent <b>posterior</b> cataract <b>opacification</b> was also evaluated at the end of the study. The animals were sacrificed 4 or 6 months after surgery. Grading concerning two aspects of secondary cataract (proliferation and fibrosis) was obtained on gross examination. Histological analysis was subsequently performed. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that mitomycin has a significant inhibitory effect on secondary cataract formation (proliferation as well as fibrosis) in rabbits whereas heparin does not seem to have the same effectiveness. CONCLUSION: This work is a preliminary study concerning the use of mitomycin for prevention of <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification.</b> It has proved its effectiveness in rabbits but more in depth studies are still necessary before its application in humans...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: Monofocal {{aspheric}} {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) provide better visual outcome {{compared to other}} available IOLs following cataract surgery. However, the imported IOLs are expensive and are not affordable by all subset of patients in low- to middle-income countries like India. The {{aim of this study}} is to compare the safety and efficacy of a relatively low cost indigenous IOL (Acriol EC) with an imported aspheric IOL (AcrySof IQ). METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted at a tertiary care centre. Two hundred and five eyes of 137 patients > 45 years of age with uncomplicated age-related cataract were recruited. All cases underwent standard phacoemulsification and randomly assigned to one of the IOL implantations (Group I: AcrySof IOL; Group II: Acriol EC IOL). Primary outcome measure was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Secondary outcomes included visual function (VF) score, spherical equivalent, contrast sensitivity, optical aberrations, and <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification.</b> Independent t-test to compare two means; Mann-Whitney test; Pearson's Chi-square test, and McNemar's test were used for analyzing the nonparametric data such as incidence of <b>posterior</b> capsule <b>opacification.</b> RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the mean postoperative BCVA at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months in either group (P > 0. 05).

40|$|K HEREDITARY, developmental, {{posterior}} polar cataract {{has been}} encountered in a North Country family and its descendants over five generations. It shows two unique features: progression and anticipation. Although {{several types of}} hereditary cataract have already been fully reported in the literature, only one satisfactory pedigree relating to posterior polar cataract has previously been recorded (Ziegler and Griscom, 1915). In the series of cases described in that pedigree, neither of these two features was demonstrated. Case Reports In the family reported here, all except three of those affected in generations I 1 -V were seen personally. The following cases demonstrate the clinical features of the condition: Case 1 (IV, 11), female, aged 29, was the first patient seen, and the hereditary basis of the cataract was established by tracing her relatives. She had had good vision as a child, but it had begun to deteriorate noticeably when she was aged about 24. When first seen, {{at the age of}} 26, the visual acuity in the right eye was 6 / 24 and in the left 6 / 60 corrected. Posterior polar cataracts were noted, and that in the left eye operated on successfully. Three years later, she presented asking for the right eye to be dealt with. On ex-amination, the vision had deteriorated to " counting fingers ", and there was present a peculiar <b>discoid</b> <b>posterior</b> polar cataract, with fluffy white extensions through the posterior cortex towards the equator. There were also a few anterior cortical punctate opacities (Fig. 1 a, b, opposite). This eye was successfully operated on also. There were no other ocular abnormalities. Her daughter (V, 15), aged 3 + years, had no cataract. Case 2 (IV, 7, elder sister of Case 1), female, aged 33, was said to have had cataracts since she was aged about 10. The vision in both eyes, especially the left, had deterorated over the past 3 years, and was worse in bright light. On examination, the visual acuity in the right eye was 6 / 9 and in the left 6 / 60 corrected. Both eyes showed a <b>discoid</b> <b>posterior</b> polar opacity, together with fluffy white extension in the posterior cortex running towards the equator.

50|$|<b>Posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification,</b> {{also known}} as after-cataract, is a {{condition}} in which months or years after successful cataract surgery, vision deteriorates or problems with glare and light scattering recur, usually due to thickening of the back or posterior capsule surrounding the implanted lens, so-called 'posterior lens capsule opacification'. Growth of natural lens cells remaining after the natural lens was removed may be the cause, and the younger the patient, the greater the chance of this occurring. Management involves cutting a small, circular area in the posterior capsule with targeted beams of energy from a laser, called Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy, after the type of laser used. The laser can be aimed very accurately, and the small part of the capsule which is cut falls harmlessly {{to the bottom of the}} inside of the eye. This procedure leaves sufficient capsule to hold the lens in place, but removes enough to allow light to pass directly through to the retina. Serious side effects are rare. <b>Posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> is common and occurs following up to one in four operations, but these rates are decreasing following the introduction of modern intraocular lenses together with a better understanding of the causes.|$|R

Ophthalmology Department &ndash; Retina departmentAbstract: We {{reported}} a 75 -year-old diabetic man, who developed opacification and neovascularization of the posterior capsule after extracapsular cataract extraction and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. The patient {{was treated with}} two injections of 2. 5 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab. The treatment produced an important regression of the posterior capsular new vessels, allowing us to perform a successful Nd:YAG capsulotomy, clearing the visual axis and improving the visualization of the posterior pole. Even though, best corrected visual acuity was 20 / 200 due to diabetic macular edema.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} 4 different intraocular lenses (IOLs) on <b>posterior</b> capsule <b>opacification</b> (PCO) by comparing the neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy rates. METHODS: This retrospective study included 4970 eyes of 4013 cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation between January 2000 and January 2008 by the same surgeon at one clinic. Four different IOLs were assessed. The outcome parameter was the incidence of Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomies. RESULTS: An Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomy was performed in 153 (3. 07...|$|R
30|$|BenEzra and Cohen [15] studied 10 uveitic postcataract surgery eyes {{which had}} {{undergone}} intraocular lens (IOL) insertion, in unilateral or asymmetric bilateral cases. The surgery had been performed {{without waiting for}} uveitis to completely settle, {{in order to prevent}} amblyopia, as the patient age range was 3 to 8  years. No additional systemic steroids were added, and 80  % of patients underwent a second procedure to treat <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification.</b> Terrada et al. [6] recommended intraocular lens insertion as unilateral aphakia led to aniseikonia and amblyopia.|$|R
40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser {{posterior capsulotomy}} for <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> after penetrating keratoplasty were reviewed retrospectively for incidence of graft rejection. All patients underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation (PC-IOL) performed {{as a separate}} or combined procedure. Only one of 20 eyes (4. 7 %) of 20 patients developed corneal graft rejection over a follow-up period of 6 months to 6 years after capsulotomy. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of corneal graft rejection. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Purpose We {{define the}} ideal {{anterior}} capsulotomy through consideration of capsular histology and biomechanics. Desirable qualities include preventing <b>posterior</b> capsular <b>opacification</b> (PCO), maintaining effective lens position (ELP) and optimising capsular strength. Methods Laboratory study of capsular biomechanics and literature review of histology and published clinical results. Results Parameters of ideal capsulotomy construction include complete overlap of the intraocular lens to prevent PCO, centration on the clinical approximation of the optical {{axis of the}} lens to ensure concentricity with the capsule equator, and maximal capsular thickness a...|$|R
40|$|Foldable acrylic {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) {{are known to}} reduce <b>posterior</b> capsule <b>opacification</b> by {{preventing}} migration of lens epithelial cells with its square edge design and its property of tackiness. Studies have reported a mean adhesiveness to posterior capsule {{more than three times}} higher for certain acrylic foldable IOLs than polymethyl methacrylate IOLs. The authors would like to report two cases where the force of tackiness was compensated, thereby presenting with delayed accumulation of lens material in the capsular bags behind the IOL with temporary loss of vision...|$|R
