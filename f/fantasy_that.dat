5|$|Distant Worlds II: More Music From Final Fantasy was {{a concert}} in the Distant Worlds series {{featuring}} music from Final <b>Fantasy</b> <b>that</b> was performed on June 12, 2010 in Stockholm, Sweden, just as the first Distant Worlds concert was. Arnie Roth returned to the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra with a completely new program presenting more pieces from Final Fantasy. Simultaneously with the concert, a new CD with the same repertoire was released under the name Distant Worlds II: Music From Final Fantasy. The recording {{was done by the}} Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra under the direction of Arnie Roth in January 2010. The name Distant Worlds II only refers to the Stockholm concert; the series itself has continued under the original Distant Worlds name with the new arrangements added to its permanent rotation.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Murakami wrote Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, a dream-like <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> {{took the}} magical {{elements}} {{of his work}} to a new extreme.

It sold millions of copies among young Japanese.|$|E
25|$|Authors such as Edgar Allan Poe and Oscar Wilde (in The Picture of Dorian Gray) also {{developed}} fantasy, {{in the telling}} of horror tales, a separate branch of <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> was to have great influence on H.

Wilde also wrote {{a large number of}} children's fantasies, collected in The Happy Prince and Other Stories (1888) and A House of Pomegranates (1891).|$|E

25|$|The French scholar Brasseur de Bourbourg {{traveled}} extensively through Mesoamerica in the mid-1800s, and was {{renowned for}} his translations of Mayan texts, {{most notably the}} sacred book Popol Vuh, {{as well as a}} comprehensive history of the region. Soon after these publications, however, Brasseur de Bourbourg lost his academic credibility, due to his claim that the Maya peoples had descended from the Toltecs, people he believed were the surviving population of the racially superior civilization of Atlantis. His work combined with the skillful, romantic illustrations of Jean Frederic Waldeck, which visually alluded to Egypt and other aspects of the Old World, created an authoritative <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> excited much interest in the connections between worlds.|$|E
25|$|Notably, {{cyberpunk}} {{has influenced}} film, in {{works such as}} Johnny Mnemonic and The Matrix series, in anime such as Akira and Ghost in the Shell, and the emerging medium of video games, with the critically acclaimed Deus Ex and Metal Gear series. This entrance of cyberpunk into mainstream culture {{has led to the}} introduction of cyberpunk's stylistic motifs to the masses, particularly the cyberpunk fashion style. It has also led to other developments including Steampunk (a subgenre of science fiction and <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> incorporates technology and aesthetic designs inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery) and Dieselpunk (which combines the aesthetics of the diesel-based technology of the interwar period through to the 1950s with retro-futuristic technology and postmodern sensibilities).|$|E

500|$|In 1997, John Grant {{wrote in}} The Encyclopedia of <b>Fantasy</b> <b>that</b> Cool World [...] "stands {{as one of}} the fantastic cinema's most {{significant}} achievements, an instauration <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> reveals greater depths with each viewing." [...] Animation historian Jerry Beck described the film as being [...] "for adults and Bakshi completists only," [...] writing that the film [...] "has a great premise, a great cast, and the best animation he's ever been involved with," [...] but critiquing it as a [...] "pointless rehash of many of Ralph's favorite themes, and the story literally goes nowhere." [...] The film garnered a Razzie Award nomination for Worst Actress (Kim Basinger; also for Final Analysis).|$|E
500|$|His {{realistic}} approach, designing dances {{that were}} inspired by the way ordinary people behaved, led one critic to observe that [...] "Kidd is, in a way, the originator of the <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> if only your life shaped up and offered you the right moments, you too {{would be able to}} dance like a Hollywood star".|$|E

LaRouche supporters insisted that LaRouche was jailed, not for any violation of the law, but for his beliefs.|$|E

Brooks credits Tolkien with introducing this theme of mundane heroism into fantasy literature and influencing his own fiction. [...] "y protagonists are {{cut from the}} same bolt of cloth as Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. It was Tolkien's genius to reinvent the traditional epic fantasy by making the central character neither God nor hero, but a simple man {{in search of a}} way to do the right thing. ... I was impressed enough by how it had changed the face of epic <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> I never gave a second thought to not using it as the cornerstone of my own writing." ...|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale {{was written}} after, and was heavily {{influenced}} by, the Second World War; Britain {{was still an}} imperial power, and the Western and Eastern blocs were engaged in the Cold War. The journalist William Cook observes that with the decline in power of the British Empire, [...] "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> Britannia could still punch above her weight." [...] The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett agree, and consider that [...] "Bond embodied the imaginary possibility that England might once again be placed at the centre of world affairs during a period when its world power status was visibly and rapidly declining." ...|$|E

500|$|The Dark Crystal was a {{financial}} and critical success and, a year later, the Muppet-starring The Muppets Take Manhattan (directed by Frank Oz) did fair box-office business, grossing $25.5million domestically and ranking {{as one of}} the top 40 films of 1984. However, 1986's Labyrinth, a Crystal-like <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> Henson directed by himself, was considered (in part due to its cost) a commercial disappointment. Despite some positive reviews (The New York Times called it [...] "a fabulous film"), the commercial failure of Labyrinth demoralized Henson to the point that son Brian Henson remembered the time of its release as being [...] "the closest I've seen him to turning in on himself and getting quite depressed." [...] The film later became a cult classic.|$|E
500|$|Frank Rich {{referenced}} truthiness {{again in}} The New York Times in 2008, describing {{the strategy of}} John McCain's presidential campaign as being [...] "to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness", Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because [...] "McCain, Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents {{and not just to}} mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it." [...] Rich also noted, [...] "You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on [...] 'The View'. Barbara Walters and Joy Behar called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> Palin opposed earmarks for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bond {{books were}} written in post-war Britain, when the country was still an {{imperial}} power. As the series progressed, the British Empire was in decline; journalist William Cook observed that [...] "Bond pandered to Britain's inflated and increasingly insecure self-image, flattering us with the <b>fantasy</b> <b>that</b> Britannia could still punch above her weight." [...] This decline of British power was referred to {{in several of the}} novels; in From Russia, with Love, it manifested itself in Bond's conversations with Darko Kerim, when Bond admits that in England, [...] "we don't show teeth any more—only gums." [...] The theme is strongest in one of the later books of the series, the 1964 novel You Only Live Twice, in conversations between Bond and the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka. Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire [...] "with both hands".|$|E
5000|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Swimming Ground" [...] are more {{realistic}} and idyllic than the psychedelic <b>fantasies</b> <b>that</b> precede it: the escape is toward the local swimming ground on hot summer {{days and the}} clouds overhead fail to let loose the rain.
