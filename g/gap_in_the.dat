5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15–16 mya. This makes Apeomyoides the {{youngest}} known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps close a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in Nevada and Arikareeomys in Nebraska. Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E

Because of its position in his Periodic Table, Mendeleev called it ekasilicon (Es), and he estimated its atomic weight to be about 72.0.|$|E

5|$|Most of US2, {{along with}} US23 in the Lower Peninsula, was {{designated}} the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949.

25|$|A problem {{specifically}} {{related to}} electrified lines are <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> electrification. Electric vehicles, especially locomotives, lose power when traversing <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supply, such as phase change <b>gaps</b> <b>in</b> overhead systems, and <b>gaps</b> over points <b>in</b> third rail systems. These become a nuisance, if the locomotive stops with its collector on a dead <b>gap,</b> <b>in</b> which case {{there is no}} power to restart. Power gaps can be overcome by on-board batteries or motor-flywheel-generator systems.|$|R

5|$|Nankoweap Formation {{is around}} 1050million {{years old and}} {{is not part of}} a group.

5|$|Next, the metamorphosed Precambrian {{basement}} rocks were uplifted and {{a nearly}} 500-million-year-long <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> geologic record, a major unconformity, affected the region.

5|$|The 42nd Division's {{participation}} in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began on 14 October when it attacked with both brigades. That evening, a conference was called to discuss the attack, during which Charles Pelot Summerall, commander of the First Infantry Division and V Corps, telephoned and demanded that Châtillon be taken by 18:00 the next evening. An aerial photograph had been obtained that showed a <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> German barbed wire to the northeast of Châtillon. Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Bare—the commander of the 167th Infantry—proposed an attack from that direction, where the defenses seemed least imposing, covered by a machine-gun barrage. MacArthur adopted this plan. He was wounded, but not severely, while verifying {{the existence of the}} <b>gap</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barbed wire.|$|E

5|$|The ears {{have been}} ornamented with jewelry for {{thousands}} of years, traditionally by piercing of the earlobe.
