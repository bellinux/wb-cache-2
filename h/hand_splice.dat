Eukaryotes splice many protein-coding messenger RNAs and some non-coding RNAs. Prokaryotes, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>splice</b> rarely and mostly non-coding RNAs. Another important {{difference between these two}} groups of organisms is that prokaryotes completely lack the spliceosomal pathway.|$|E

One of its alternatively-spliced exons is 37, which forms part of the EF hand. The expression of exon 37 a (EFa form), but not exon 37 b (EFb form), confers the channel an activity-dependent enhancement of channel opening known as Ca(2 +) -dependent facilitation (CDF). In this study, we analyzed the trend of EF <b>hand</b> <b>splice</b> variant distributions in mouse, rat and human brain tissues. We observed a developmental switch in rodents, {{as well as an}} age and gender bias in human brain tissues, suggestive of a possible role of these EF <b>hand</b> <b>splice</b> variants in neurophysiological specialization.

3000|$|The image {{splicing}} {{operation and}} inserting secrete message both cause discontinuities in an image. The steganography inserts a secrete message in an image at a random locations. On the other <b>hand,</b> the image <b>splicing</b> forgery causes abrupt discontinuities {{in the form}} of edge. Because the statistical moment-based approach only exploits a global statistical nature by abrupt discontinuities, the CF moment-based splicing detection approach can be an effective solution to extract features for splicing detection. As shown in (10), there is no information loss when constructing C_o^j(p,q) [...] because we do not use the threshold operation. However, using C_o^j(p,q) [...] as a feature vector is practically impossible because the number of the probabilities is extremely large.

40|$|The {{removal of}} {{intervening}} sequences (introns) from a primary RNA transcript is catalyzed by the spliceosome, a large ribonucleoprotein complex. At {{the start of}} each splicing cycle, the spliceosome assembles anew in a sequentially ordered manner on the pre-mRNA intron to be removed. We describe here the identification of a series of naphthalen- 2 -yl hydroxamate compounds that inhibit pre-mRNA splicing in vitro with mid- to high-micromolar values of IC 50. These hydroxamates stall spliceosome assembly at the A complex stage. A structure-activity analysis of lead compounds revealed three pharmacophores that are essential for splicing inhibition. Specifically, a hydroxamate as a zinc-binding group and a 6 -methoxynaphthalene cap group are both critical, and a linker chain comprising eight to nine methylene groups is also important, for the specific binding to the docking site of a target protein molecule and precise positioning of the zinc binding group. As we found no correlation between the inhibition patterns of known histone deacetylases on the one <b>hand</b> and pre-mRNA <b>splicing</b> on the other, we conclude that these compounds may function through the inhibition of the activities of other, at present, unknown spliceosome-associated zinc metalloprotein(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Splicing is {{a natural}} process {{happening}} in every living cell. As a fundamental process, all genes undergo splicing before tuning into a functional molecule such as proteins. However, the splicing process is still under active research in order to completely understand how it is regulated. As of now, the splicing machinery is characterized in {{what we call the}} spliceosome, but a complete understanding of it is still under active research. The discovery of alternative splicing set a breakthrough in molecular biology. This process allows a simple gene to turn into more than one protein by creating different transcripts or isoforms. The transcriptome is the whole set of known isoforms that have been characterized through research and experimental procedures. Still, many isoforms might remain unknown. Through research, alternative splicing {{has been shown to be}} responsible for the development of different pathologies, including cancer. On the other <b>hand,</b> alternative <b>splicing</b> provides a novel mean to characterize potential biomarkers for drug resistance or survival. Due to this, alternative splicing is constantly being studied in order to completely understand its functioning mechanism. 	 With the development of sequencing techniques, it has been possible to develop methods to quantify the different isoforms present in specific samples or conditions. From the method, developed by Frederick Sanger, also known as Sanger sequencing, to the development of new protocols, like third generation sequencers, vast amounts of data have been generated. Even though, sequencing has taken a lead role in the study of alternative splicing, other platforms like junction arrays have been developed to study such phenomenon. Affymetrix recently developed the Clariom microarray, which seems to be the most up to date array to identify splicing events. 	 Most of the available algorithms to identify and quantify alternative splicing events, provide more than one figure of merit per event and does not take into account a coherence in such events. For example, in a cassette exon, not only the skipped exon should show a change in expression, but the flanking junctions should display a similar behavior but in opposite directions. In order to take this into account, a novel method to identify, classify and state statistical significance of splicing events has been developed. EventPointer allows users to identify alternative splicing events and provide the statistical significance of such events. The algorithm can be applied to data from both microarrays or RNA-Seq. Also, EventPointer generates files that can be loaded into genome browsers to ease the interpretation of the results and the desing of primers for standard PCR validations. 	 The performance of EventPointer has been tested in two independent experiments using both platforms. The overall results show a promising validation rate in both technologies. EventPointer, also estimates the percent spliced index for every detected event and not only skipping exons, as most of the available software. The results, obtained through end-point PCR demonstrate that the estimated Ψ values, provided by EventPonter, are highly correlated with the experimental results. EventPointer shows an improved method to identify and quantify alternative splicing events. 	 A comparison between microarrays and RNA-Seq, in their ability to identify alternative splicing events was performed using the same experimental data from three different cell lines treated with a drug that severely affects the splicing machinery. The results show that RNA-Seq is the most flexible and trustable platform for the identification of splicing events, but microarrays are a viable option to analyze alternative splicing due to reasons of cost and convenience. Microarrays can be an alternative when compared to shallow sequencing...|$|R
40|$|Opitz BBB/G {{syndrome}} (OS) is a heterogenous hereditary {{disorder that}} {{is characterized by}} defects in organs derived from the ventral midline. The inheritance of OS can be autosomal dominant or X-chromosomal recessive. The gene for the autosomal form of OS has been assigned to chromosome 22, {{but it has not}} been identified yet. The X-chromosomal form of OS is caused by mutations in the ubiquitously expressed MID 1 -gene. Mutations in the coding regions of the MID 1 -gene account for approximately 75 % of X-chromosomal OS cases. Most mutations (68 %) involve the C-terminal part of the protein, and the remaining mutations are spread all over the protein except for the RING finger domain. Apart from this domain, the gene product of MID 1 consists of two Bboxes, a coiled coil domain, a Fibronectin type III domain and a C-terminal B 30. 2 domain. Like other RING finger proteins, the MID 1 protein shows ubiquitin ligase activity. With its Bbox 1, it binds to a 4, a regulatory subunit of microtubule-associated Phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 Ac) thereby causing ubiquitination of PP 2 Ac and its subsequent degradation via the proteasome. Mutated MID 1 protein in OS patients has lost its ability to bind to microtubules. As a consequence, it cannot interact with microtubule-associated PP 2 Ac, ubiquitination of PP 2 Ac is inhibited and PP 2 Ac accumulates in the cell. We could now show overall hypophosphorylation of microtubule-associated target proteins of PP 2 Ac in embryonic fibroblasts of an OS patient on 2 D gels. Further investigations will identify these proteins and clarify the biological relevance of their hypophosphorylation for the natural history of OS syndrome. The function of the Bbox 2 of the MID 1 protein and other RBCC-proteins is unknown. In immunofluorescence experiments that were part of this thesis it was found that a point mutation in the Bbox 2 inhibits the association of the a 4 -protein to the microtubules. This indicates that the Bbox 2 has a crucial effect on the binding affinity of Bbox 1 to the a 4 -protein. Beyond this, we have shown that some of the patients with OS have mutations in the MID 1 gene which cannot be detected by DNA sequencing. Thus, a duplication of exon 1 of the MID 1 gene could be found in one OS-family. A premature termination codon {{at the beginning of the}} second copy of exon 1 destabilizes the mRNA according to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Moreover, I have addressed the question how mutations in the MID 1 gene can lead to the highly tissue-specific OS phenotype despite ubiquitous expression of the MID 1 gene. To shed more light on mechanisms regulating MID 1 protein function, genomic sequences of the human, the murine and the Fugu MID 1 gene were characterized and compared with each other. Numerous alternatively spliced exons which are subject to tissue- and developmental specific expression could be identified. A functional conservation of alternatively spliced transcripts could be shown between the three organisms, human, mouse and fugu. On the one hand protein-truncating transcripts or rather truncated proteins that regulate the protein function of MID 1 in a dominant negative manner could be found in all three organisms. On the other <b>hand,</b> alternatively <b>spliced</b> transcripts that introduce premature termination codons into the respective sequences and are therefore subject to NMD could be found in all three organisms. Thereby, these transcripts act as regulators of MID 1 expression. Moreover, a region, Reg 1 d, with high homology between man and mouse mapping to intron 1 of the MID 1 gene and spanning a region of 1. 126 bp could be identified. Though RT-PCR experiments could show its expression, Reg 1 d doesn?t exhibit a connection to any of the MID 1 exons. An open reading frame of significant length could not be detected in Reg 1 d transcripts. Interestingly, northernblot analysis could demonstrate transcription of Reg 1 d from both strands, sense and antisense, suggesting Reg 1 d to function as a regulatory RNA-molecule. Future experiments may show that Reg 1 d and MID 1 are functionally connected and may further elucidate how the phenotype in OS patients develops...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} {{level of the}} [alpha] 6 A[béta] 4 integrin {{has been reported to}} be elevated in a number of human cancers in accordance with its known stimulatory role in several aspects of cancer progression such as promoting invasion and stimulating intracellular signaling of importance for cellular proliferation and survival. In the present work the {{expression level}}s of [béta] 4 in adenocarcinomas of the human colon were evaluated at the transcript level in comparison with the expression levels in patient matched healthy colonic tissue. Not only were the expression level of the [béta] 4 subunit found to be upregulated in cancerous tissue, but levels of expression of [béta] 4 were found to be closely correlated to levels of expression of those of the oncogenic transcription factor MYC. This correlation was demonstrated to be of functional importance for the expression level of [béta] 4, since forced expression of MYC in a colon cancer cell line stimulated transcriptional activity of various [béta] 4 promoter constructs. The pre-mRNA of the [alpha] 6 subunit undergo alternative splicing yielding two different variants: the A and the B variants. Their distinct intracellular domains and their distinct biochemical properties characterize these variants. As part of the characterization of the expression of the [alpha] 6 A[béta] 4 integrin in colon cancers, the expression level of total [alpha] 6 as well as the two different variants were investigated. As for the [béta] 4 subunit the total level of [alpha] 6 were found to be elevated in cancers as compared to their corresponding healthy resection margins. Interestingly, an alteration of the ratio of expression of two splice variants of the [alpha] 6 subunit was found to be significantly altered in 81 % of the cancers investigated. Thus, the expression ratio shifted from a predominant expression of [alpha] 6 B in the healthy resection margins to a predominant expression of [alpha] 6 A in the primary adenocarcinomas. Such differential expression of splice variants was also found in the normal human small intestine. Indeed, the proliferative crypts were found to express the [alpha] 6 A variant, while the differentiated compartments of the crypt-villus axis were found to express the [alpha] 6 B variant. The functional importance of this was confirmed when over-expression of the two different splice variants were demonstrated to differentially activate the [béta]-catenin/TCF 4 and MYC transcriptional complexes, two well known players in intestinal proliferation and adenocarcinomas formation. On the other <b>hand</b> the two <b>splice</b> variants were not found to differentially affect differentiation of human enterocytes as assayed by monitoring the transcriptional activity from promoter constructs of sucrase-isomaltase, lactasephlorizin hydrolase, DPPIV and ALPP. Finally, it has become increasingly clear that the classic normalizing genes such as GAPD and [béta]-actin can display modulated expression levels across tissue types and during cellular differentiation. Therefore, experiments aimed at identifying and validating normalizing genes for transcript measurements during the complex cellular processes of differentiation and cancer progression in the human gut were carried out. Previously generated microarray data were screened for candidate genes of which two were selected for further analyses along with seven commonly used normalizing genes. Real time RT-PCR amplifying the nine putative normalizing genes were performed on various samples representing different differentiation stages of human enterocytes as well as on patient matched primary tumors and healthy resection margins. Using several statistical approaches, RPLP 0 and B 2 M were found to be the two best normalizing genes for experiments aimed at assessing transcript during differentiation and in cancers respectively. These studies should serve as a paradigm for other studies aimed at validating other normalizing genes under other experimental settings...|$|R
