50|$|Although {{there are}} several design {{variations}} of diving rebreather, all types have a gas-tight loop that the diver inhales from and exhales into. The loop consists of several components sealed together. The diver breathes through a mouthpiece or a fullface mask. This is connected {{to one or more}} tubes ducting inhaled and exhaled gas between the diver and a counterlung or breathing bag. This holds gas when it is not in the diver's lungs. The loop also includes a scrubber containing carbon dioxide absorbent to remove the carbon dioxide exhaled by the diver. Attached to the loop there will be at least one valve allowing addition of gases, such as oxygen and perhaps a <b>diluting</b> <b>gas,</b> from a gas storage into the loop. There may be valves allowing venting of gas from the loop.|$|E
50|$|Military, photographic, and {{recreational}} divers use {{closed circuit rebreathers}} because they allow long dives and produce no bubbles. Closed circuit rebreathers supply two breathing gases to the loop: one is pure oxygen {{and the other is}} a diluent or <b>diluting</b> <b>gas</b> such as air, nitrox, heliox or trimix. A major function of the closed circuit rebreather is to control the oxygen partial pressure in the loop and to warn the diver if it becomes dangerously low or high. Too low a concentration of oxygen results in hypoxia leading to unconsciousness and ultimately death. Too high a concentration of oxygen results in hyperoxia, leading to oxygen toxicity, a condition causing convulsions which can make the diver lose the mouthpiece when they occur underwater, and can lead to drowning. The monitoring system uses oxygen-sensitive electro-galvanic fuel cells to measure the partial pressure of oxygen in the loop. The partial pressure of oxygen in the loop can generally be controlled within reasonable tolerance of a fixed value. This set point is chosen to provide an acceptable risk of both long-term and acute oxygen toxicity, while minimizing the decompression requirements for the planned dive profile.|$|E

40|$|Chromium is a {{high value}} metal and the {{retention}} of the same during the refining of high carbon ferrochrome as well as high alloy steel has significant economic and environmental impacts. The loss of chromium during the decarburization is generally minimized using argon-oxygen mixtures thereby reducing the oxygen partial pressure (PO 2) of the oxidant gas. In the current study, experiments were carried out in an induction furnace and CO 2 was introduced with the view to partly reduce PO 2 and partly as an oxidizer. During these experiments, the decarburization of molten Cr-alloy was conducted using pure O 2, pure CO 2 or O 2 +CO 2 mixtures. The results demonstrated that the Cr loss can be minimized under CO 2 introduction. The kinetic analysis showed that the mass transfer is effective due {{to the production of}} 2 CO gas molecules from one CO 2 molecule during the reaction which will improve the stirring of the bath.

The discharge stability was improved by different approaches so that the discharge could be operated up to a RF source limit of 500 W without sparking. The gas leaving the discharge was injected to the subsonic or supersonic flow of N 2 and concentration of generated atomic iodine and gas temperature were measured downstream of the injection. An inhomogeneous distribution of the produced iodine atoms among the injector exit holes was observed, which was attributed to a different gas residence time corresponding to each hole. The dissociation fraction was better with pure argon as a <b>diluting</b> <b>gas</b> than in the mixture of Ar-He, although the variation in the Ar flow rate had no {{significant effect on the}} CF 3 I dissociation. The dissociation fraction calculated from the atomic iodine concentration measured several centimeters downstream of the injection was in the range of 7 to 30 % when the absorbed electric energy ranged from 200 to 4000 J per 1 mmol of CF 3 I. Corresponding values of the fraction of power spent on the dissociation decreased from 8 to 2 %. % and the energy cost for one iodine atom increased from 30 to 130 eV.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the levels of sulfur and benzene in the {{gasoline}} pool have been reduced, {{and in the future}} there may also be new regulations on vapor pressure and the level of aromatics and olefins as well. The limitations on vapor pressure and aromatics will lead to reduced use of C 4 and reformate respectively. The branched isomers of C 5 and C 6 alkanes have high octane numbers compared to the straight chain isomers, and are consequently valuable additives to the gasoline pool. To maintain the octane rating, it is predicted that an increased share of isomerate will be added to the gasoline pool. Today there is a well established isomerization technology with platinum on chlorided alumina as the commercial catalyst for both isomerization of n-butane and of the C 5 /C 6 fraction. This catalyst is very sensitive to catalyst poisons like water and sulfur, and strict feed pretreatment is required. Zeolites promoted by platinum are alternatives as isomerization catalysts, and has replaced Pt/alumina catalysts to some extent. The Pt/zeolite catalyst is more resistant to water and sulfur compounds in the feed, but it is less active than platinum on chlorided alumina. It does therefore require a higher reaction temperature, which is unfortunate since the formation of the branched isomers of the alkanes is thermodynamically favored by a low temperature. Because of the limitations of the two types of isomerization catalysts, there is a search for a new catalyst that is resistant to sulfur and water in the feed and is highly active so it can be operated at low temperature. A new type of catalyst that seems to be promising in that respect is sulfated zirconia. The first part of this study focuses on a series of iron and manganese promoted SZ catalysts. The catalysts were characterized by various techniques such as XRD, TGA, N 2 adsorption and IR spectroscopy of adsorbed pyridine. The catalytic activity in n-butane isomerization at 250 °C and atmospheric pressure was compared to the physical and chemical properties of the samples. No promoting effect of iron and manganese was found when n-butane was diluted in nitrogen. When nitrogen was replaced by hydrogen as the <b>diluting</b> <b>gas</b> the activity of the unpromoted SZ sample was dramatically lowered, while the activity of the promoted catalyst was not significantly changed. If we only consider the promoted samples, the catalytic activity increases with increasing iron/manganese ratio. We also observe that the activity of the samples is clearly correlated with the number of strong Brønsted acid sites. The total number of strong acid sites (i. e. the sum of Brønsted and Lewis sites) does not change significantly when the promoter content is changing, hence no correlation between catalytic activity and the total number of acid sites is found. This underlines the importance of discrimination between Lewis and Brønsted acidity when characterizing the acidity of the samples. The second part of this study is focused on a series of noble metal promoted sulfated zirconia. Their catalytic activity in n-hexane isomerization at high pressures was compared to a commercial Pt/zeolite catalyst. Among the noble metal promoted samples the catalyst promoted with platinum was the most active. The samples promoted with rhodium, ruthenium and iridium showed equal activity. Common for all the noble metal promoted catalysts is the large increase in activity when catalysts are reduced with hydrogen compared to when they are pretreated in helium. The increase in activity is most likely connected to the reduction of the metal oxides of the promoters to ensure that the promoters are in the metallic state. Reduction at too high temperatures does however give lower activity. This is probably due to the reduction of surface sulfate groups leading to a loss in acid sites. The commercial sample was considerably less active than the sample of platinum promoted sulfated zirconia. The commercial catalyst was however more stable than the PtSZ catalyst. All the sulfated zirconia catalysts deactivated, but the initial activity could be regenerated by reoxidation at 450 °C followed by reduction at 300 °C. The promotion with noble metals appears to inhibit coke formation on the catalyst. But, the main cause of deactivation of the platinum promoted sample is most likely the reduction of sulfate species leading to a loss of acid sites. The kinetic study of the catalysts indicates that the n-hexane isomerization proceeds via a classical bifunctional mechanism where the role of the promoting metal is to produce alkenes, which are subsequently protonated on the acid sites. The reaction orders of hydrogen, n-hexane and total pressure are all in accordance with this mechanism. The activation energies of the catalysts are within the typical range of bifunctional catalysts. All catalysts, except the unpromoted SZ sample, showed close to 100 % selectivity to branched hexane isomers and a similar distribution of these isomers. The isomer distribution being the same for both the noble metal promoted catalyst and the Pt/zeolite is another indication that the isomerization proceeds via the bifunctional mechanism over the promoted samples. The different selectivity of the unpromoted SZ catalyst indicates that the isomerization proceeds via a different pathway over this catalyst; this is probably a pure acidic mechanism The acidity characterization can not explain the differences in isomerization activity. It is however likely that the activity of the promoting metals in the dehydrogenation of alkanes is important since the classical bifunctional mechanism is prevailing. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E
40|$|There is {{an urgent}} demand for clean, liquid fuels for transportation. In China, the total {{consumption}} amount of gasoline/diesel {{was more than}} 80 million ton during 2000. The overall import amount of crude oil will be 0. 2 billion ton in 2020. At the same time, the liquid fuel production was less than the actual requirement. It has been expected that at least 0. 03 ~ 0. 05 billion oil fuels is needed from non-oil technology to keep sustainable development of economy in 2010. The only solving method is {{to find new ways}} to get liquid fuels, such as catalytic Fischer-Tropsch(F-T) synthesis of synthesis gas from coal/natural gas/biomass. F-T synthesis to get gasoline/diesel has been carried out in South Africa and Middle East from coal or natural gas in large scale. However, this process was still depending on traditional fossil fuels. Second-generation biofuels are usually bio-chemical or thermo- produced from non-edible part of biomass residues as corn stalk or rice husk. That enhances the economic competition, fatally associated with most first-generation biofuels like food-ethanol. Thermo-chemical production of petroleum-gasoline(diesel) substitutes from biomass is more attractive because the catalytic F-T synthesis processes are almost identical to those industrialized ones from coal/natural gas-derived syngas in case biomass syngas is obtained, which is an effect supplement for transportation fuels. While hydrocarbon distribution of traditional F-T synthesis from coal/natural gas over Co- or Fe-based catalyst is determined by the limit of Andson-Schultz-Flory (ASF) law and the selectivity to heavy products is high with low selectivity to gasoline. Usually the following hydrocraking and hydroisomerization are needed to obtain gasoline/diesel fuels. At the same time biomass syngas is generally CO 2 -rich with low H 2 /C ratio, which is unfavorable for F-T synthesis directly over Co- or Fe-based catalyst. In the present work, the hybrid support of mesoporous SiO 2 and microporous zeolite were used to prepare multifunctional catalysts. The support features of the impregnated Co-based catalysts, such as the texture properties of SiO¬ 2, the types of zeolite with different SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio were evaluated to synthesize gasoline-range hydrocarbons（C 5 ~C 12 ）. Noble metal (Ru) was loaded to modify the catalytic activity of Co/SiO 2 /HZSM- 5 catalysts. The F-T synthesis performance of biomass syngas was also investigated over Co/SiO 2 /HZSM- 5 by activity test and catalyst characterization, where H 2 and CO 2 content in the syngas were the main influence factors. And the whole route of biomass to liquid fuels(BTL) was roughly analyzed to optimize the efficiency of F-T synthesis from biomass. The results obtained are listed below 1. The high dispersion degree of cobalt particles resulted from high surface area of the supports, but the strong acidity of zeolite decreases this tendency. When the zeolite（USY、Hβ、HZSM- 5 ）with different SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio was used along with mesoporous SiO 2 (9 nm) as hybrid supports, the large surface area of SiO 2 dispersed zeolite particles and reduced the acidity of zeolite without meso-pore structure destruction. The meso- and micro-pore structure of tailor-made Co/SiO 2 /Zeolite catalysts combined the advantage of quick diffusion rate and high shape selectivity to C 5 ~C 12, which increased the hydrocarbon yield to 150 g/Nm 3. HZSM- 5 (38) was better than the other two zeolites during F-T synthesis. 2. Loading small amount of noble metal(Ru) increased the dispersion degree and reduction of Co/SiO 2 /HZSM- 5 catalysts by H 2 spillover. When Ru content was 1 ~ 2 wt% on Co/SiO 2 /HZSM- 5 catalyst, the increase degree of reduction degree at 150 - 400 ℃ was high. Although the hydrocarbon yield was increased when Ru loading amount was higher than 2 wt%, the accelerated CO hydrogenation rate derived from high Co dispersion degree and reduction resulted in low space-time yield of C 5 -C 12. The characterization of the used catalyst implied the carbon species deposited were hydrocarbons from F-T synthesis. And the decreased carbon depositing amount was due to the dissociative adsorption of H 2 on Ru surface and Hads spillover from Ru to Co surface. 3. Proper amount of CO 2 in biomass syngas increased CO 2 conversion, but decreased CO conversion and total carbon conversion because of relatively slow hydrogenation rate of CO 2 and the competing adsorption of Hads between CO and CO 2. But CO 2 conversion would be debased when quite amount of CO 2 played as <b>diluting</b> <b>gas</b> without being catalyzed. While the product selectivity still showed typical F-T distribution model, resulted from CO hydrogenation in CO and CO 2 -containing biomass syngas. The proper H 2 /C ratio also affected the total synthesis results. 7. 5 % CO 2 in the biomass syngas(C) inhibited WGS reaction and decreased the re-oxidation of Co-based catalysts, which kept the carbon usage and F-T performance at high level. The carbon species in the used catalysts were mainly hydrocarbons and carbon deposition. The favorable hydrocarbon yield and space-time yield of C 5 ~C 12 were achieved at T= 250 ℃，P= 2. 0 ~ 2. 5 MPa， WHSV= 6. 27 ~ 12 mg/gcat/h 4. For liquid fuel synthesis, the “Once-through” route combined with power generation from unconverted tail gas has higher efficiency with easier maintenance than 100 % syngas conversion. And to increase H 2 content is the primary task for stoichiometic adjustment of syngas composition and the key factor that affect efficiency of biomass to liquid technology.

40|$|The shock {{structure}} {{problem is}} one of the classical problems of fluid mechanics and at least for non–reacting <b>dilute</b> <b>gases</b> it has been considered essentially solved. Here we present a few recent findings, to show {{that this is not the}} case. There are still new physical effects to be discovered provided that the numerical technique is general enough to not rule them out a priori. While the results have been obtained for dense fluids, some of the effects might also be observable for shocks in <b>dilute</b> <b>gases.</b> Key words: shock structure, anisotropy, molecular chaos, shock thickness, asymmetry factor...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a fluid model for {{electrons}} and positrons in structured and soft-condensed matter utilizing <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> phase cross-sections together with a structure factor for the medium. Generalizations of the Wannier energy and Einstein (Nernst–Townsend) relations to account for coherent scattering effects present in soft-condensed matter are presented along with new expressions directly relating transport properties in the <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> and the structured matter phases. The theory is applied to electrons in a benchmark Percus–Yevick model and positrons in liquid argon, and the accuracy is tested against a multi-term solution of Boltzmann's equation (White and Robson 2011 Phys. Rev. E 84 031125) ...|$|R
40|$|We discuss hybrid atomistic-continuum {{methods for}} {{multiscale}} hydrodynamic applications. Both dense fluid and <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> formulations are considered. The choice of coupling method {{and its relation}} to the fluid physics is discussed. The differences in hybrid methods resulting from underlying compressible and incompressible continuum formulations as well as the importance of timescale decoupling are highlighted. We also discuss recently developed compressible and incompressible hybrid methods for <b>dilute</b> <b>gases.</b> The incompressible framework is based on the Schwarz alternating method whereas the compressible method is a multi-species, fully adaptive mesh and algorithm refinement approach which introduces the direct simulation Monte Carlo at the finest level of mesh refinement.

40|$|The non-perturbative {{renormalization}} group (NPRG) {{is applied}} to analysis of tunnelling in quantum mechanics. The vacuum energy and the energy gap of anharmonic oscillators are evaluated by solving the local potential approximated Wegner-Houghton equation (LPA W-H eqn.). We find that our results are very good in a strong coupling region, {{but not in a}} very weak coupling region, where the <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> instanton calculation works very well. So it seems that in analysis of quantum tunnelling, the <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> instanton and LPA W-H eqn. play complementary roles to each other. We also analyze the supersymmetric quantum mechanics and see if the dynamical supersymmetry (SUSY) breaking is described by NPRG method. ...|$|R

A central role is played by a zero density quantum critical point which is argued to control the properties of the <b>dilute</b> <b>gas.</b> An exact renormalization group analysis of such quantum critical points leads to a computation of the universal properties of the <b>dilute</b> Bose <b>gas</b> and the spinful Fermi gas near a Feshbach resonance...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{in detail}} nonperturbative {{corrections}} for low lying energies of a symmetric triple-well potential with non-equivalent vacua, {{for which there}} have been disagreement about asymptotic formulas and controversy over {{the validity of the}} <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> approximation. We carry out investigations from various points of view, including not only a numerical comparison of the nonperturbative corrections with the exact values but also the prediction of the large order behavior of the perturbation series, consistency with the perturbative corrections, and comparison with the WKB approximation. We show that all the results support our formula previously obtained from the valley method calculation beyond the <b>dilute</b> <b>gas</b> approximation.
