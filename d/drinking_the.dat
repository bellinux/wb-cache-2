5|$|On {{the seventh}} day after the person had died, people celebrated the sjaund (the word both for the funeral ale and the feast, since it {{involved}} a ritual <b>drinking).</b> <b>The</b> funeral ale {{was a way of}} socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance. If the deceased were a widow or the master of the homestead, the rightful heir could assume the high seat and thereby mark the shift in authority.|$|E
5|$|After {{a quarrel}} with Barkis, and realizing {{he was only}} after her {{supposed}} wealth, Victoria follows the procession of dead to the church. Emily notices Victoria and realizes that she is denying Victoria her chance at happiness {{the same way it}} was stolen from her. She stops Victor from <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> poison and reunites him with Victoria. Barkis interrupts them, and Emily recognizes him as her former fiance, who is revealed {{to be the one who}} murdered her for her dowry. Barkis tries to kidnap Victoria at sword point, but Victor stops him and the two men duel; the dead townspeople are unable to interfere with the affairs of the living. Emily intercedes to save Victor, and Barkis mockingly proposes a toast to Emily, unknowingly <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> cup of poison. The dead, able to intercede upon Barkis's death, eagerly take retribution against him by dragging him to the underworld where he will atone for his crimes. Victoria, now a widow, is once again able to marry Victor.|$|E
5|$|Both of the attendants– Dakini to {{her left}} and Varnini to her right– are {{depicted}} nude, with matted or dishevelled hair, three-eyed, full-breasted, wearing the serpentine sacred thread and the mundamala, and carrying the skull-bowl in the left hand and the knife in the right. Sometimes, the attendants also hold severed heads (not their own). While Dakini is fair, Varnini is red-complexioned. In other depictions, both are depicted blue-grey. Sometimes, her attendants are depicted as skeletons and <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> dripping blood from Chhinnamasta's severed head, rather than her neck. The attendants are absent in some depictions.|$|E

5|$|The head {{offering}} {{and subsequent}} {{restoration of the}} head signify immortality. The dichotomy of temporality and immortality is alluded to by the blood stream drunk by Chhinnamasta's head– interpreted as amrita and the serpent, which sheds its skin without dying. The skull and severed head garlands signify her victory over Time and fear of Death. Chhinnamasta's black complexion denotes destruction; her depiction as red or orange denotes life. By <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> blood, she appears as the Saviour, who drinks the negativity {{of the world and}} transforms it to benevolent energies; in this interpretation, the blood is seen in negative light rather than amrita.|$|E
5|$|The inflorescences {{are highly}} {{attractive}} to insects. The rare bee species Hylaeus globuliferus is a recorded visitor. Large numbers of ladybirds {{have been reported}} <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> nectar of this species, while ignoring nearby Banksia attenuata inflorescences. The white-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis granulipes) has been observed visiting flower spikes. Pollen has been found on the snouts and in the scat of several species of dasyurid marsupials, which suggests these animals are likely pollinators of Banksia species in general. No pollinators of this species were recorded in The Banksia Atlas survey.|$|E

5|$|These ulcers occur {{periodically}} {{and heal}} completely between attacks. In {{the majority of}} cases, the individual ulcers last about 7–10 days, and ulceration episodes occur 3–6 times per year. Most appear on the non-keratinizing epithelial surfaces in the mouth (i.e. anywhere except the attached gingiva, the hard palate and the dorsum of the tongue), although the more severe forms, which are less common, may also involve keratinizing epithelial surfaces. Symptoms range from a minor nuisance to interfering with eating and <b>drinking.</b> <b>The</b> severe forms may be debilitating, even causing weight loss due to malnutrition.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> laws in <b>the</b> state of Wisconsin. It {{starts with the}} {{statutes}} that were first set up in state through to the 1980 s. The 1970 s to 1980 s had issues dealing with the changing of <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age that happened due to the Twenty-sixth Amendment which lowered the voting age to eighteen. A common idea in many states was to lower many other aspects of adulthood from twenty-one to eighteen. One of those changes was with <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age. <b>The</b> changes in <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age did not occur in every state causing many problems across the country leading to the changes {{that happened in the}} early 1980 s. Along with <b>the</b> patchwork <b>drinking</b> age across <b>the</b> country, Wisconsin had another problem of a lack of community support to keep alcohol out of underage students' hands. There was major public interest and support for a change in <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> age in Wisconsin, but the greatest pressure for the change came from the federal government in the mid 1980 s...|$|R
5|$|By the 18th century, Mersea Fort was in ruins. The fishery {{rules were}} {{reinforced}} by fresh legislation in 1758, which created {{a court of}} conservancy to oversea the oyster stocks. Officially, this court was supposed {{to sit at the}} fort, but rather than using the now dilapidated earthworks, it began to meet in Colchester's Moot Hall. Instead, a ceremony began to take place each year at the Mersea Stone, near to the fort, involving local dignitaries and extensive eating and <b>drinking.</b> <b>The</b> fort was recommissioned during the Napoleonic Wars {{at the start of the}} 19th century, and a new gun battery was constructed overlooking the sea, equipped with six 24-pounder (10.9kg) guns. After this the fort was abandoned once again. A sea wall was built along the coast early in the century, cutting through the south-east side of the fort. The legislation on oysters was reformed by Parliament in 1870, which disbanded the previous court structure and severed the historic link with Mersea Fort. A defensive pill-box was constructed at the castle during the Second World War.|$|E

The nephew threatened Odaenathus and was put in chains as a result; Hairan I asked his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was <b>drinking,</b> <b>the</b> nephew approached him with a sword and killed him along with Hairan I. The bodyguard immediately executed the nephew.|$|E
5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> blood of Christ in the sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E

5|$|On March 26, 1931, Ross {{substituted}} a sixth skater for goaltender Tiny Thompson in {{the final}} minute of play in a playoff game against the Montreal Canadiens. Although the Bruins lost the game 1–0, Ross became the first coach to replace his goaltender with an extra attacker, a tactic which became widespread practice in hockey. Stepping aside as coach in 1934 to focus on managing the team, Ross hired Frank Patrick as coach with a salary of $10,500, which was high for such a role. However rumours spread during the season that Patrick was drinking heavily and not being as strict with the players as Ross wanted. After the Bruins lost their playoff series with the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1936 playoffs, the result of an 8–1 score in the second game, a newspaper claimed that Patrick had been <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> day of the game and had trouble controlling the team. Several days later, Ross relieved Patrick of his duties and once again assumed the role of coach.|$|E
5|$|Quickly, the Austrians {{acquired}} {{control of}} all the earthworks of the town, the village itself, and the fortress; their skirmishers reached {{one side of the}} abutment of an old bridge of palisades, and advanced to the other side, across the islands formed by branches of the Kinzig and the Rhine. There, almost within eye-shot of the French sentinels, they halted; there is some confusion about why they stopped. Possibly they mistook the abutment for the bridge itself, as Moreau seemed to think. Regardless, the troops there did not burn the bridge, but started plundering and <b>drinking.</b> <b>The</b> French cavalry tried to retire into Kehl via the Kinzig bridge, but the heavy Austrians fire destroyed most of them.|$|E
40|$|AbstractDomestic {{water supply}} systems are {{the final stage}} of the {{transport}} process to deliver potable water to the customers’ tap.

According to <b>the</b> Dutch <b>Drinking</b> Water Act <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> water temperature may not exceed the 25 °C threshold at point-of-use level. This paper provides a mathematical approach to model <b>the</b> heating of <b>drinking</b> water within <b>the</b> domestic water supply system. It appears that residence time influences <b>the</b> <b>drinking</b> water temperature more than the ambient temperature itself...|$|R

5|$|The Adbhuta Ramayana narrates: Ravana used {{to store}} the blood of sages he killed in a large pot. The sage Gritsamada was {{practicing}} penance to acquire the goddess Lakshmi as his daughter. He stored milk from Darbha grass and purified it with mantras in a pot so that Lakshmi would inhabit it. Ravana poured the milk from this pot into his blood pot. Mandodari is frustrated seeing the evil deeds of Ravana, so she decides to commit suicide by <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> contents of the blood-pot, which is described to be more poisonous than poison. Instead of dying, Mandodari gets pregnant with the incarnation of Lakshmi due {{to the power of}} Gritsamada's milk. Mandodari buries the foetus in Kurukshetra, where it is discovered by Janaka, who named her Sita.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates that Krishna and {{his lover}} Radha were enjoying dalliance, when they thirsted for milk. So, Krishna created a cow called Surabhi and a calf called Manoratha {{from the left}} side of his body, and milked the cow. When <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> milk, the milk pot fell on the ground and broke, {{spilling}} the milk, which became the Kshirasagara, the cosmic milk ocean. Numerous cows then emerged from the pores of Surabhi's skin and were presented to the cowherd-companions (Gopas) of Krishna by him. Then Krishna worshipped Surabhi and decreed that she—a cow, the giver of milk and prosperity—be worshipped at Diwali on Bali Pratipada day.|$|E
5|$|With {{her right}} leg held {{straight}} and her left leg bent a little (the pratyalidha stance), Chhinnamasta stands in a fighting posture on the love-deity couple of Kamadeva (Kama)– a symbol of sexual lust– and his wife Rati, who are engaged in copulation with the latter usually on the top (viparita-rati sex position). Kamadeva is generally blue-complexioned, while Rati is white. Below the couple is a lotus with an inverted triangle, and in the background is a cremation ground. The Chhinnamasta Tantra describes the goddess sitting on the couple, rather than standing on them. Sometimes, Kamadeva-Rati is replaced by the divine couple of Krishna and Radha. The lotus beneath the couple is sometimes replaced by a cremation pyre. The coupling couple is sometimes omitted entirely. Sometimes Shiva– the goddess's consort– is depicted lying beneath Chhinnamasta, who is seated squatting on him and copulating with him. Dogs or jackals <b>drinking</b> <b>the</b> blood sometimes appear in the scene. Sometimes Chhinnamasta is depicted standing on a lotus, a grass patch, or the ground.|$|E
