40|$|Abstract Background Hepatitis B {{infection}} {{is the major}} cause of acute and chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide and has long been recognized as an occupational hazard among dentists. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine factors associated to the self-reporting of hepatitis B vaccination and immunization status among dentists working in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out with 1302 dentists in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. After signing a term of informed consent, the participants answered a structured questionnaire on their knowledge regarding their vaccination and immunization status against hepatitis B. Data on demographic, behavioural and occupational exposure aspects were also collected through questionnaires. Results The results revealed that 73. 8 % of the dentists reported having received three doses of the vaccine. Multivariate analysis revealed that gender (p = 0. 006), use of <b>individual</b> <b>protective</b> <b>equipment</b> (p = 0. 021), history of blood transfusion (p = 0. 024) and history of illicit drug use (p = 0. 013) were independently associated with vaccination against hepatitis B. Only 14. 8 % had performed a post-vaccination test. The use of <b>individual</b> <b>protective</b> <b>equipment</b> (p = 0. 038), dentists who asked patients about hepatitis during dental treatment (p Conclusions Although there were a large number of vaccinated dentists in Belo Horizonte, the percentage was less than what was expected, as Brazil offers the National Program of Viral Hepatitis Vaccination, which provides free hepatitis B vaccinations to all healthcare workers. Despite being part of a high risk group for contamination, most of the dentists did not know their immunization status. </p...|$|E

40|$|New {{individual}} equipment design begins with {{analysis of the}} {{need in order to}} determine equipment's relationships with its outerspace (including the user himself), transform these relationships into functions, determine their nature (service, strain, etc [...] .). The characterization of the technical functions must be performed in agreement with physiological functions concerned by the equipment. This leads to need in hierarchization, i. e. classification according to importance. If this is not done, requirements of the technical specifications may generate functional conflicts, inconsistents with user's efficiency and health. We propose an approach which allows to solve such conflicts for the design of a new chemical protective mask Its aim is to go far further than simple classical Human Factor approach and to formalize implicated functions hierarchization, thus simpliJYjng dimensionning and integration of design technical factors.

DESCRIPTORS: self-injury, <b>protective</b> <b>equipment,</b> functional analysis, trichotillo-mania One common method to treat self-inju-rious behavior (SIB), or at least to protect individuals from the detrimental sequelae of SIB, is the use of <b>protective</b> <b>equipment</b> (Dorsey, Iwata, Reid, & Davis, 1982).
