25|$|Human impacts such as sewage, urban run-off, {{agricultural}} and industrial wastes are {{running into the}} marshes from nearby sources. Salt marshes are nitrogen limited and with an increasing level of nutrients entering the system from anthropogenic effects, the plant species associated with salt marshes are being restructured through change in competition. For example, the New England salt marsh is experiencing a shift in vegetation structure where S. alterniflora is spreading from the lower marsh where it predominately resides up into the upper marsh zone. Additionally, in the same marshes, the reed Phragmites australis has been invading the area expanding to lower marshes and becoming a dominant species. P. australis is an aggressive <b>halophyte</b> that can invade disturbed areas in large numbers outcompeting native plants. This loss in biodiversity is not only seen in flora assemblages but also in many animals such as insects and birds as their habitat and food resources are altered.|$|E

With this information, an economically valid and reliable system of removing salts from wastewater may be build. The <b>halophytes</b> take up salt through the roots and distribute it by the active pumping of the sodium ions into the vacuoles. The ability of <b>halophytes</b> to grow in a high saline surrounding makes them useful as a guard against saline pollution to the environment.

40|$|<b>Halophytes</b> are plants which {{naturally}} {{survive in}} saline environment. They account for approximately 1 % {{of the total}} flora of the world. They include both dicots and monocots and are distributed mainly in arid, semi-arid inlands and saline wet lands along the tropical and sub-tropical coasts. Salinity tolerance in <b>halophytes</b> depends {{on a set of}} ecological and physiological characteristics that allow them to grow and flourish in high saline conditions. The ability of <b>halophytes</b> to tolerate high salt is determined by the effective coordination between various physiological processes, metabolic pathways and protein or gene networks responsible for delivering salinity tolerance. The salinity responsive proteins belong to diverse functional classes such as photosynthesis, redox homeostasis, stress/defence, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, protein metabolism, signal transduction and membrane transport. The important metabolites which are involved in salt tolerance of <b>halophytes</b> are proline and proline analogue (4 -hydroxy-N-methyl proline), glycine betaine, pinitol, myo-inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, O-methylmucoinositol and polyamines. In <b>halophytes,</b> the synthesis of specific proteins and osmotically active metabolites control ion and water flux and support scavenging of oxygen radicals under salt stress condition. The present review summarizes the salt tolerance mechanisms of <b>halophytes</b> by elucidating the recent studies that have focused on proteomic, metabolomic and ionomic aspects of various <b>halophytes</b> in response to salinity. By integrating the information from <b>halophytes</b> and its comparison with glycophytes could give an overview of salt tolerance mechanisms in <b>halophytes,</b> thus laying down the pavement for development of salt tolerant crop plants through genetic modification and effective breeding strategies...|$|R

40|$|<b>Halophytes</b> are {{plants of}} saline {{habitats}} that grow under conditions that may vary in extremes of temperatures (freezing to very hot), water availability (drought to water logging) and salinity (mild to almost saturation). <b>Halophytes</b> may also face sudden micro-environmental variations within their habitats. In this review we examine {{some of the}} factors that determine the ability of seeds of <b>halophytes</b> to germinate when conditions are optimal for seedling growth and survival. Seed dormancy (innate, induced or acquired) is an important means of initiating growth under appropriate conditions. Saline environments are often wet and so the seeds of <b>halophytes</b> may remain un-germinated over extended periods even after imbibition if the external environment does not favour germination and seedling survival. Many perennial <b>halophytes,</b> however, do not possess elaborate dormancy systems because they propagate largely through ramets and have no ecological compulsions for seed germination. The seeds of <b>halophytes</b> also have the capacity to recover from a salinity shock and start germination once salinity is reduced, which may happen following rain. In some cases, imbibition in a low-salt solution may help in osmo-priming and improve germination. Seed heteromorphism is yet another strategy adopted by some <b>halophytes,</b> whereby seeds of different size and colour are produced that germinate consecutively at suitable intervals. Light-dependent germination may also help if the seed is under a dense canopy or buried in debris; germination only occurs once these restraints are removed thus increasing the chances of seedling survival.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} assess the {{contribution}} of different salt marsh <b>halophytes</b> (Spartina maritima, Scirpus maritimus, Halimione portulacoides, Sarcocornia fruticosa, and Sarcocornia perennis) to nutrient cycling and sequestration in warm-temperate salt marshes. Carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus concentration in plant organs and rhizosediment, as well as plant biomass were monitored every two months during one year. Results show that the C retained in the rhizosediment {{does not seem to}} be species or site specific. However, some <b>halophytes</b> seem to have a higher contribution to retain C from external sources, namely S. perennis and S. maritima. Regarding N, <b>halophytes</b> colonizing the upper and middle marsh areas had the highest NBPP (net belowground primary production) as well as the retention of N in the rhizosediment.
