40|$|This article {{concerns}} the mongolian languages fishery terminology analysis {{carried out to}} identify the turkic-mongolian parallels relating to the names and aquatic means of transport, objects of fishery, ways and methods of fishing and the <b>fishing</b> <b>tackles</b> in its structure.

Turkic material was mostly taken from the old Turkic dictionary, which is a compilation of lexicon from the old Turkish writing artifacts. Comparative study of the Mongolian and the old Turkic languages allowed to reveal insignificant number of the turkic-mongolian parallels concerning both names of fishes, names of <b>fishing</b> <b>tackles</b> and aquatic means of transport...|$|R

Initially an {{incendiary}} device {{had been found in}} a <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle</b> shop as a customer tried on a jacket, accidentally discovering the cigarette packet explosive. The police were called and seized the jacket for forensic tests, alerting all other <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle</b> shops in the island. However four further devices had been planted in Ryde and Newport, with the next one found in Halfords, a subsidiary of Boots, that was detonated in a controlled explosion. The three remaining devices then ignited {{in the early hours of}} the morning, setting ablaze two leather shops and an Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) shop, as a hundred firefighters attended to the fires.|$|E
25|$|Bass {{boats are}} small {{aluminium}} or fibreglass boats used in {{lakes and rivers}} in the U.S. for fishing bass and other panfish. They have swivel chairs for the anglers, storage bins for <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle,</b> and a tank with recirculating water for caught fish. They are usually fitted with an outboard motor and a trolling motor.|$|E

25|$|Recreational {{fishing is}} done for {{pleasure}} or sport, and not for profit or survival. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard {{with the intent to}} catch a fish. Usually some form of <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle</b> is brought on board, such as hooks, lines, sinkers or nets. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, kayaks, rafts, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.|$|E

500|$|As Richard {{struggled}} {{both with}} the need to find a purpose to his post-retirement life and the fear of being forgotten, he attached his name to numerous endeavours. [...] He acted as a consulting editor for a magazine titled Maurice Richard's Hockey Illustrated, owned the [...] "544/9 Tavern" [...] (named for his career goal total and sweater number) in Montreal, and was a pitchman for dozens of products, including beer, hair dye, car batteries, <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle</b> and children's toys. He continued to use his name as a promotional vehicle for over 30 years after his retirement. Richard briefly returned to hockey in 1972 as head coach for the Quebec Nordiques of the World Hockey Association. He lasted only two games, a win and a loss, before finding himself unable to handle the strain of coaching. Richard reconciled with the Canadiens in 1981 and resumed his team ambassador role.|$|E
500|$|The Claimant quickly {{acquired}} significant supporters; the Tichborne family's solicitor Edward Hopkins accepted him, as did J.P. Lipscomb, the family's doctor. Lipscomb, after {{a detailed}} medical examination, {{reported that the}} Claimant possessed a distinctive genital malformation. It would later be suggested that Roger Tichborne had this same defect, but this could not be established beyond speculation and hearsay. Many people were impressed by the Claimant's seeming ability to recall small details of Roger Tichborne's early life, such as the fly <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle</b> he had used. Several soldiers who had served with Roger in the Dragoons, including his former batman Thomas Carter, recognised the Claimant as Roger. Other notable supporters included Lord Rivers, a landowner and sportsman, and Guildford Onslow, the Liberal MP for Guildford who {{became one of the}} Claimant's staunchest advocates. Rohan MacWilliam, in his account of the case, calls this wide degree of recognition remarkable, particularly given the Claimant's increasing physical differences from the slim Roger.

2500|$|A rod {{is usually}} also {{classified}} by the optimal weight of fishing line {{or in the}} case of fly rods, fly line the rod should handle. Fishing line weight is described in pounds of tensile force before the line parts. Line weight for a rod is expressed as a range that the rod is designed to support. Fly rod weights are typically expressed as a number from 1 to 12, written as [...] "N"wt (e.g. 6wt.) and each weight represents a standard weight in grains for the first 30 feet of the fly line established by the American <b>Fishing</b> <b>Tackle</b> Manufacturing Association. For example, the first 30' of a 6wt fly line should weigh between 152-168 grains, with the optimal weight being 160 grains.

2500|$|Today, {{smallmouth bass}} are very popular game fish, {{frequently}} sought by anglers using conventional spinning and bait casting gear, {{as well as}} fly <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle.</b> The smallmouth bass {{is one of the}} toughest fighting freshwater fish in North America.

[...] The smallmouth is highly regarded for its topwater fighting ability when hooked â old fishing journals referred to the smallmouth bass as [...] "ounce for ounce and pound for pound the gamest fish that swims". [...] Smallmouth bass are taken for the table, with filets of white, firm flesh when cooked. [...] Today, many fishermen practice catch-and-release fishing to improve fish populations.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{proposal}} {{for the construction of}} the navigation was in 1719, but the traders of Ipswich objected, fearing loss of trade. It was not until 1789 that six local gentlemen (two of whom were vicars) with foresight realised that because of poor transport, due to badly-maintained turnpike roads, the population and industries were dwindling in the Stowmarket area. They engaged William Jessop, who employed Isaac Lenny as the surveyor and a Parliamentary Bill for the construction of the navigation was introduced on 17 February 1790. It became an Act of Parliament on 1 April 1790, and created a Board of Trustees, consisting of six men. They were empowered to borrow Â£14,300 to finance the work, and an additional Â£6,000 if this became necessary. They also had powers to build an extension of the navigation from Stowupland Bridge for [...] to the turnpike road that ran to Bury St Edmunds. An unusual clause in the act prohibited the carrying of <b>fishing</b> <b>tackle</b> by boats using the navigation, for which a fine of Â£5 could be charged.|$|E
