40|$|On July 18, 1997, the Transuranic (TRU) {{glovebox}} {{was tested}} using glovebox acceptance test procedure 13021 A- 86. The primary focus of the glovebox acceptance test was to examine control system interlocks, display menus, alarms, and operator messages. Limited mechanical testing involving the drum ports, hoists, <b>drum</b> <b>lifter,</b> compacted <b>drum</b> <b>lifter,</b> drum tipper, transfer car, conveyors, sorting table, lidder/delidder device and the TRU empty drum compactor were also conducted. As of February 25, 1998, 10 of the 102 test exceptions that affect the TRU glovebox remain open. These items will be tracked and closed via the WRAP Master Test Exception Database. As part of Test Exception resolution/closure the responsible individual closing the Test Exception performs a retest of the affected item(s) to ensure the identified deficiency is corrected, and, or to test items not previously available to support testing. Test exceptions are provided as appendices to this report...|$|E
50|$|Rotary dryer systems use a {{cylindrical}} metal reactor (drum) that {{is inclined}} {{slightly from the}} horizontal. A burner located at one end provides heat to raise {{the temperature of the}} soil sufficiently to desorb organic contaminants. The flow of soil may be either cocurrent with or countercurrent to the direction of the purge gas flow. As the drum rotates, soil is conveyed through the <b>drum.</b> <b>Lifters</b> raise the soil, carrying it to {{near the top of the}} drum before allowing it to fall through the heated purge gas. Mixing in a rotary dryer enhances heat transfer by convection and allow soils to be rapidly heated. Rotary desorber units are manufactured for a wide range of treatment capacities; these units may be either stationary or mobile.|$|R
50|$|In the test, a 200 g {{sample of}} -21 mm to +19 mm {{particle}} range coke is heated at 1100 °C under 1 atmosphere pressure {{of carbon dioxide}} for 2 hours. The coke is preheated and cooled under nitrogen and the weight loss during reaction is measured. The percentage weight loss {{is known as the}} reactivity (CRI). The reacted coke is placed in an I-type <b>drum</b> (no <b>lifters)</b> and subjected to 600 revolutions in 30 minutes. The percent of carbon material removed from the drum that is +10 mm is known as the coke strength after reaction (CSR).|$|R
500|$|Los Angeles {{musician}} Mark Posgay {{auditioned for}} the band in 1995 and became the group's permanent drummer. In July of that year, Magnapop supported R.E.M. on their Monster World Tour and continued playing in the United States and Europe, including an appearance at X-Fest in 1996. They also played their first dates in Australia and Japan in 1996 and hosted 120 Minutes on July 7 of the same year. In late 1996, Mulvaney left the group, citing problems of distance—Hopper and Morris had relocated permanently to Los Angeles—as well as a desire to focus on his family. He continued playing bass guitar and stand-up bass with Atlanta groups The Hots, The Lugosis, and Anna Kramer & The Lost Cause. Boston native and former Queers bassist Greg Urbaitis replaced him after replying to an ad in The Recycler and the band continued to play live shows through 1997, including supporting Throwing Muses on their farewell tour. Posgay quit that summer and he was replaced by former <b>Lifter</b> <b>drummer</b> Johnny Rozas and this line-up recorded six demos at a recording studio in Orange County. This version of the band was short-lived as Magnapop was informed while on tour that their record label's rock division ceased to exist {{and they did not}} have any funding for future touring or recording. Compounding matters further, the band members were still under contract to their old record label and were legally disbarred from using the name [...] "Magnapop" [...] until their contract expired seven years later.|$|R
