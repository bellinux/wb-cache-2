5|$|His writing {{style is}} best {{described}} as equal parts anger, confidence, and pageantry. Scalia has a taste for garish analogies and offbeat allusions—often very funny ones—and he speaks in no uncertain terms. He is highly accessible and tries not to get bogged down in abstruse legal jargon. But most of all, Scalia's opinions read like they're about to catch fire for pure outrage. He <b>does</b> <b>not,</b> <b>in</b> short, write like a happy man.|$|E
5|$|Melting of {{floating}} ice shelves (ice that originated on the land) <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> itself contribute much to sea-level rise (since the ice displaces only its own mass of water). However {{it is the}} outflow of the ice from the land to form the ice shelf which causes a rise in global sea level. This effect is offset by snow falling back onto the continent. Recent decades have witnessed several dramatic collapses of large ice shelves around the coast of Antarctica, especially along the Antarctic Peninsula. Concerns have been raised that disruption of ice shelves may result in increased glacial outflow from the continental ice mass.|$|E

5|$|The first upper molar (M1) was {{described}} as square by De Bruijn and as rounded by Prieto and Böhme. There are five main transverse crests, which are mostly isolated, but some may be connected on {{the borders of the}} teeth. The middle crest, the centroloph, reaches to the labial (outer) margin in the single known M1 of S.bolligeri, but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> any of the five M1 of S.alpinus. The front crest, the anteroloph, is less distinct in S.bolligeri than most S.alpinus, but one M1 of S.alpinus {{is similar to that of}} S.bolligeri. M1 has three roots in S.alpinus, but the number of roots in S.bolligeri is not known.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of bold skin markings <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>in</b> itself prove that an animal relies on camouflage, as {{that depends on}} its behaviour. For example, although giraffes have a high contrast pattern that could be disruptive coloration, the adults are extremely conspicuous when in the open. Some authors have argued that adult giraffes are cryptic, since when standing among trees and bushes they are hard to see at even a few metres' distance. However, adult giraffes move about to gain the best view of an approaching predator, relying on their size and ability to defend themselves, even from lions, rather than on camouflage. A different explanation is implied {{by the fact that}} young giraffes are far more vulnerable to predation than adults: {{more than half of all}} giraffe calves die within a year, and giraffe mothers hide their calves, which spend much of the time lying down in cover while their mothers are away feeding. Since the {{presence of}} a mother nearby does not affect survival, it is argued that young giraffes must be extremely well camouflaged; this is supported by the fact that coat markings are strongly inherited.|$|E

Rather, the cleavage reaction is simply an isomerization that consists of rearrangement of the linking phosphodiester bond.
