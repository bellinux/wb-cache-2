500|$|Wanderone enjoyed {{promoting}} a feud with world champion Mosconi {{over how to}} present pool— either as a rough-and-tumble gambling game (Wanderone) or as a genteel pastime and art form (Mosconi). Mosconi's widow, Flora, said of the rivalry, [...] "My husband hated Minnesota Fats because he felt that [...] was always hurting {{the image of the}} game instead of helping it." [...] Wanderone would state smugly, [...] "I may have 'given away' a few games to deserving competitors, but I have never lost a real money game since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to spell 'Weeli Mesconi'." [...] The two competed on Valentine's Day (February 14), 1978 in a televised match on ABC's Wide World of Sports. With almost 11 million viewers, the game was the second-highest rated episode of the show for that year, behind only the Muhammad Ali vs. Leon Spinks rematch. The game was held at New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, and was announced by Howard Cosell. Although Wanderone lost the game, he won the audience with his banter, and with his joking manner. Mosconi on the other hand was reportedly perceived as cold.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think about}} my father being called ‘boy’, my uncle being called ‘boy’, my brother, coming back from Vietnam and being called ‘boy’. So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to fight and die for my country, old enough to drink, old enough to vote, I said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> {{to be called a}} man. I self-ordained myself Mr. T so the first word out of everybody’s mouth is [...] "Mr." [...] That’s a sign of respect that my father didn’t get, that my brother didn’t get, that my mother didn’t get.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{was born}} in Bowling Green, Warren County Kentucky, at Western University Hospital. He has written and talked {{extensively}} about his gender dysphoria and transgender issues. He is a gay man, and has said, [...] "Ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to know what gay men were, I've considered myself a gay man that happens {{to have been born}} in a female body, and that's the perspective I'm coming from." [...] In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein would call him a [...] "nonoperative transsexual", Martin would not insist on a pedantic label, writing [...] "I'm just me". In August 2010, he began the process of gender reassignment, and, in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.|$|E

6000|$|... "Hadn't you? Then I won't say {{but what}} {{you may be right}} to try and begin now. But, law! what <b>am</b> <b>I</b> talking of? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's right; {{throw in}} my teeth what I {{wanted to do}} in order to help you along, and call me an <b>old</b> skinflint. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to expect such things from such as you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Doll was honorably {{discharged}} from the military in June 1946 and returned to USC in time for summer practice. [...] In July 1946, Braven Dyer wrote that USC had found [...] "a new backfield star." [...] Dyer continued, [...] "Fresh out of the Marines, the lad's name is Doll, Don Doll, that is." [...] Doll had changed his surname from [...] "Burnside" [...] to [...] "Doll" [...] after being {{discharged from}} the military. [...] Doll later explained the reasoning behind his decision:"My stepfather, Adna Doll, raised me {{and as soon as}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> (and, incidentally, had dough for the legal transfer) I changed my name to his because I was grateful for all Dad had done for me. [...] I thought that if any honors came my way in football, I'd like to be known by his name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do--not--know. I have guarded--I mean--cast away--I mean--never entertained {{any such}} thought ever since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> {{to know how}} wicked it would be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{old enough}} to----" [...] and Alan struck his {{forefinger}} {{on the back}} part of his neck, meaning that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to lose my head.|$|E
60|$|Mood. Jack sauce! if <b>I</b> say it <b>is</b> a tragedy, {{it shall}} be a tragedy, in spite of you; teach your grandam how to piss. What! <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to spout English with you, sir.|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{the camp}} of the Texan army," [...] {{answered}} Dan, before his father could speak. Then {{he turned to}} his parent. [...] "Father, you must let me go with you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, of course, mother, I don't {{want the}} French to be beaten--not {{regularly}} beaten, till <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> {{to have a}} share in it. Just fancy what a nuisance {{it would be if}} peace was made just as I get my commission." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have known}} him," [...] Cecil answered, [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to {{remember}} anybody. He has lived here all his life, and only been away {{three or four}} times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, Wilhelmina," [...] {{answered}} the captain, more mildly, [...] "you have a true colonist's admiration of home. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough,</b> when I left England, to appreciate what I saw and knew, and cannot feel all this provincial admiration." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That must be nonsense. But don't {{you think}} women are fools to marry when they've got {{anything}} of their own, {{and could be}} their own mistresses? I couldn't have been. I was made to marry before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to assert myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{no claim}} to control {{you in the}} choice of your friends," [...] he said; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to give you a word of advice. Don't {{associate}} yourself too readily, David, with the woman whom I found here to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Clym, [...] "whatever you do, {{you will}} always be dear to me--that you know. But one thing I {{have a right to}} say, which is, that at my age <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to know what is best for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and Francois {{has promised}} to make me a pair," [...] said Edith gaily, [...] "and to {{teach me how to}} use them; and mamma says <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to learn now. Is it not kind of Francois? He is always very good to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really couldn't help it, you know. To {{think that}} Grandfather Fox had chased me {{three or four}} times a year since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to run by myself, and that at last I should lead him into a trap from which he couldn't get out!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know not," [...] said Okiok. [...] "When {{my father}} named me I was very small, {{and could not}} ask his reason. He never told any one. Before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to ask, a bear killed him. My mother thought {{it was because the}} winter when I was born was very cold and long." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe you}} are {{actually}} afraid. Why, I was born on the Potomac, and have used a paddle since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to lift one. Come, place the canoe in here and we will keep to the near shore until we reach the bend. There is a little fall just below this and I love to shoot it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that <b>is</b> what <b>I</b> {{always wanted}} to do," [...] cried Eva, [...] "for I love my song-books best, and never find new ones enough. Show me more, dear elves, so that I can have many fine tales to tell when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to write." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean," [...] she said, [...] "that now <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to work, <b>I</b> cannot accept {{everything}} from one upon whom I have no claim. If you {{will help me}} a little still, <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> more than grateful. But it must be in my own way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah no," [...] I said. [...] "Remember that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> your father; that I {{knew you}} when you <b>were</b> three years <b>old.</b> <b>I</b> may surely ask such questions. But you are right; one must do your mother justice. She was {{certainly}} thinking of her second marriage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{a little}} {{doubtful}} about {{going on with}} my story, sir. I have told you how I got to Tadmor, and what it looks like, {{and what sort of}} people live in the place. If I am to get on beyond that, I must jump to the time when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to learn the Rules of the Community." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was my mother's first cousin, general; {{but they}} were always dear friends, and have for years written {{regularly}} to each other; and it was settled that I should come out to him, as soon as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough.</b> 'Tis upwards of two years since I did so, {{and he has been}} more like a father than a cousin to me, during that time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said George dully, [...] "I'll own I've got a knock. I {{reckoned}} {{if there}} was a lode, it would never be found. Looks as if I didn't know as much as I thought. But that's not all. Since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to guess my mother's fears I did the old man wrong. He's made good. I doubted, but you knew him best and you believed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She always has, but {{she gets}} ugly, cheap things that I don't like. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to choose myself, {{if there is}} someone {{to tell me about}} prices and the {{goodness}} of the stuff. Merry does; and she is only a few months older than I am." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} bitterly reproached myself that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unable {{to share your}} fate. You are still young, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> your father. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unmarried, with no {{particular}} ties in the world. You have given me new interest in life. It {{will be a great}} pleasure for me to watch your career.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, squire, {{for your}} kind intention," [...] Reuben answered; [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{so much in}} your debt, now, that I would rather not go further into it. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> now {{to make my own}} way in life. My only regret in the matter <b>is</b> that <b>I</b> cannot persuade my mother to go with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} a worker," [...] she said, [...] "in a {{clothing}} factory since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to stand up, and what little time I have had to spare, I have spent in study, in trying to fit myself for the fight against those things that you and I {{and all of us}} know of. There has been no opportunity," [...] she went on, more slowly, [...] "I have not allowed myself--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is so, sir. It {{was always}} my mother's wish that I should, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough,</b> {{come up to}} the Soudan to make enquiries. As my father was a good Arabic scholar, my mother always entertained a faint hope that he might have escaped; {{especially}} as we know that a good many of the Egyptian soldiers were not killed, but were taken prisoners, and made to serve in the Mahdi's army." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What quarrel have I {{with the}} King or the gentry? They have quarrel enough with {{me it is}} true, but, nathless, I {{do not know why}} I should have hated them so before <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to know how rotten they really are. So {{it seems to me that}} I am but the {{instrument}} of an old man's spite, not even knowing the grievance to the avenging of which my life has been dedicated by another.|$|E
60|$|THE MAN. Bluestocking? The {{effort to}} make out your meaning is fatiguing. Besides, you are talking too much to me: <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to {{discourage}} you. Let us be silent until Zoo comes. [He turns {{his back on the}} Elderly Gentleman, and sits {{down on the edge of}} the pier, with his legs dangling over the water].|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are ways}} of doing everything," [...] I said; and, seeing it wasn't going to break her heart, I told her just the plain facts. She listened without a word, and when I had {{finished}} {{she put her arms}} round my neck and kissed me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to <b>be</b> her grandfather, but twenty years ago it might have upset me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} I shall tell him {{whenever}} I see him," [...] returned the youth, somewhat softened; [...] "and I'm aware {{he has a}} sort of sneaking fondness for me; but I'm {{not going to ask}} his advice, because he knows nothing about the business. Besides, mother, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> to judge for myself, and mean to take the advice of nobody." ...|$|R
